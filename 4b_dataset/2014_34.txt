ABSTRACT

CRITICAL INFORMATION LITERACY IN PRACTICE: AN INTERPRETIVE
REVIEW
Beth Allsopp McDonough, Ed.D.
Western Carolina University (March 2014)
Director: Dr. John Habel
More than two decades of debate since the Association of College and Research
Libraries (ACRL) adopted the term information literacy have been marked by ongoing
criticism of its associated definitions and standards. Some scholars and practitioners
have argued for a critical information literacy, which applies the precepts of critical
pedagogy to information literacy instruction. Though intriguing, this body of literature is
theoretical and largely-negative and so is not readably accessible to the practitioner.
The purpose of this study was to review and synthesize the literature of critical
information literacy` through a critical interpretive practitioner lens in order to uncover
pedagogy and instructional content to inform my own teaching practice and that of other
individual teaching librarians who wish to take a critical approach to information literacy
with undergraduate students.
The study is a critical interpretive synthesis (Dixon-Woods, et al., 2006), a review
methodology designed to be configurative, use an emerging theoretical framework to
thematically synthesize ideas, include methodologically-diverse literature, and
incorporate an authorial voice. An underlying premise of this study is that there is value

9
in practitioner review of the research to improve practice in the tradition of action
research or the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL).
Almost all of the studies critiqued or criticized traditional approaches to
information literacy. Advocates agreed that traditional information literacy overlyfocused on tools and skills. Traditional information literacy also presented an overlysimplistic model of the research process that is out of synch with the reality that research
is a non-sequential, iterative, and messy process. Most called the Association of College
and Research Libraries (ACRL) Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education and other definitions of information literacy to account for over-emphasis on
tools-and-skills-based approaches. Some also held accountable the design and focus of
traditional research paper assignments. Various voices from the literature negatively
described traditional approaches to information literacy as technical, mechanical,
behavioral, strategic, and skills-based; while positively describing critical information
literacy as critical, problem-posing, multi-dimensional, creative, intellectual, processbased, and in support of student agency.
In terms of pedagogy, critical information literacy scholars and practitioners
called upon teaching librarians to embrace new roles for themselves and their students.
They were advised to give up their own authority and expertise in the classroom; build
upon students’ existing knowledge about information; place the student at the center of
instruction, and use their own peripheral role as an opportunity to help students transition
into academia.
The literature revealed some practical advice about how to design instruction that
is meaningful to students by incorporating problem-or-question based instruction; using

10
research topics and examples that are meaningful to students’ personal lives; promoting
student interaction; letting go of the classroom agenda in order to create space for student
interaction; and using accessible language in instruction.
In terms of content, the literature recommended that teaching librarians teach
explicitly about all types of information; avoid imposing value judgments on types of
information sources; teach about information in terms of its purposes and uses; teach
information as dialog; and do not limit sources – instead make use of sources students are
familiar with as a bridge from their personal lives into academia.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION

For the past 18 years, I’ve been responsible for information literacy instruction in
a variety of educational settings including P-12, community college, and for the past six
years at a library serving a regional, comprehensive university. My situation is similar to
most teaching librarians in the United States. Although, sometimes I teach graduate
students, or present multiple information literacy sessions to the same class in the same
semester, the typical venue for my instruction is a single 50-75 minute session for
students enrolled in an undergraduate course (known by librarians as a one-shot). As a
guest instructor, my time with students is limited, and I have little control over the
research assignments my instruction is designed to support. Due to the paucity of time
for information literacy instruction I strive to employ the best possible pedagogical
practices in order to help students navigate the complex, increasingly-pervasive,
phenomenon that is information in the digital age.
Despite my best efforts, students resisted looking beyond the surface of the
information they are required to use for research projects; only a few students become
passionate about research; and, based on comments from a wide range of teaching faculty
in multiple disciplines, the resulting research papers and projects typically failed to
synthesize information to the degree that course instructors and librarians desire. Indeed,
two ongoing, large-scale information literacy research projects that examine
undergraduate student research behavior paint a picture of students who are reluctant to
engage deeply with information, spend little time on research, and procrastinate engaging

12
with research projects (Ethnographic Research, 2012; Project Information Literacy,
2012).
A few years ago, I radically changed my teaching style. I was weary of
presenting the very best sources and search strategies for students to use for a given
assignment, only time and time again to observe them typing poorly-constructed searches
into Google five minutes later. I realized that my approach of modeling information
expertise and expecting the students to mimic it was at odds with my desire to empower
them to find, evaluate, and use information to solve research problems. By simply
offering students the right tools and techniques to conduct research, I was denying them
the opportunity to build upon their prior knowledge to gain new understanding. I began
to experiment with ceding control in the classroom by adopting a less prescriptive, more
inductive approach. The results have astounded me. When I give students control, and
begin with their experiences, they are much more willing to dialogue with me about
information contexts and uses. Together we critically examine their information
strategies and the resulting sources. We all learn from each other, and I find that when
the students are allowed to have a voice in the process, they are much more willing to
listen.
Eventually, I discovered a body of library literature dedicated to the concept of
critical information literacy, a teaching perspective that does not focus on student
“acquisition of skills,” but rather encourages a critical and discursive approach to
information (Simmons, 2005, p. 299). Just as I had found in my own classes, critical
information literacy is not about teaching the right way to do things, an approach that is
bound to be off-putting to young adult. Instead, critical information literacy encourages

13
students “to think of research not as a task of collecting information, but instead as a task
of constructing meaning” (p. 299).
I was thrilled to find emerging theory and pedagogy that supported my newfound
approach in the classroom. And yet, as is the case with many themes of educational
research, the literature failed to present a holistic view that was readably accessible to the
practitioner. While my own experience informed me that a critical approach to
information literacy instruction can improve the practice of teaching librarians, it was
important that I and other teaching librarians better understand the processes and
rationales of critical information literacy as described in the literature for it to be useful in
the classroom. In particular, I was inspired by Jacobs’ (2008) challenge:
What I am suggesting is that the dialogues we have surrounding information
literacy instruction strive to find a balance in the daily and the visionary, the local
and the global, the practices and the theories, the ideal and the possible (p. 258).
This dissertation research synthesizes the literature of critical information literacy
through a critical interpretive practitioner lens in order to inform teaching practice. It is
situated between my lived experience as a teaching librarian and my scholarly endeavors.
Most importantly, it seeks to have a practical and positive impact on other practitioners
and subsequently, the students, faculty, and institutions they serve.
Nature and Significance of the Problem
The concept of information literacy has come under much scrutiny in the
literature, which has proliferated over time with increased interest since the mid-1990s
and the advent of the digital age (Pinto, Cordon, & Diaz, 2010). The articles that define,
redefine, or appraise the concept critically are too numerous to count, but frequently cited

14
voices in the conversation include Bruce (1999), Elmborg (2006), Lloyd (2006), Marcum
(2002), Owusu-Ansah (2004, 2005), Shapiro and Hughes (1996), Simmons (2005), and
Webber and Johnson (2000).
Most teaching librarians in the United States are guided by the information
literacy standards produced by divisions of the American Library Association (ALA),
namely ACRL and the American Association of School Librarians (AASL). For teaching
librarians the standards present a mathematical challenge. The five standards outlined in
the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education encompass
twenty-two performance indicators, and 86 outcomes (ACRL, 2000) while the AASL
(2007) standards encompass 83 outcomes. Since most practitioners are still confined to
one-shot library instruction sessions, with credit-bearing information literacy courses
being the exception rather than the rule (Davis, Lundstrom, & Martin, 2011), the numbers
alone present a formidable barrier to an individual practitioner who aims to teach to the
standards.
Standards, or really the use of any sort of taxonomy or codex system (list of what
an information literate person needs to know), have been subject to much criticism,
especially in response to the shift from a print to digital paradigm of information. The
early conversations in the literature about the print to digital paradigm shift are among the
most interesting. Hubbard (1995) appears to be one of the first to criticize, with his
statement:
If what we have taught in the Industrial Book Age is the organization and
structure of codex knowledge and all we teach about The Net is communications

15
software, data manipulation, and liberal attitudes, the Information Age may be
more threat than promise for our pedagogy if not our profession (p. 441).
Luke and Kapitzke (1999) took up the cry with criticism of a still-pervasively
popular taxonomic, linear information literacy model called The Big Six (Eisenberg &
Burkowitz, 1990). Luke and Kapitzke perceived that hierarchies of skills are at odds with
the use of the internet to acquire information, a process they describe as “nonlinear,
recursive” and “simultaneous” (p. 478). Webber and Johnston (2000) also comment on
the “limitations of the list approach”:
While this approach seems to put the individual at the centre of the process, in
fact the result has been increasing numbers of ever more detailed lists. . . reducing
a complex set of skills and knowledge to small, discrete units. The assumption
seems to be that the skills have been mastered for good once each unit can be
labelled as completed. This fragments the field of knowledge and reflects a
surface learning approach (with a short-term focus on the task in hand) rather
than a deep learning [emphases from original] one (in which the students are
encouraged to reflect on and contextualise what they are learning, in a manner
that enables them to use the knowledge or skill outside the task in hand) (p. 384).
Teaching librarians with moderate to heavy teaching loads are likely to be
unsympathetic to the debaters. Our concern is less with what information literacy means,
than pedagogical practices and curricular content that help students become information
literate. Owusu-Ansah (2005) called for an end to the debates in his article, Debating
Definitions Information Literacy: Enough is Enough! He stated, “Defining information
literacy continues to remain a distraction in the efforts of many librarians as they strive to

16
determine what needs to be done by the library in information literacy education" (p.
367). This perspective is shared by Jacobs and Berg (2011). Arguing that information
literacy is “full of possibilities to explore rather than problems to be solved” (p. 383),
Jacobs and Berg revisited a range of international documents that seek to define
information literacy and concluded:
Information literacy practitioners struggle to find ways to connect the larger goals
with their daily information literacy work. The gap between the large, overreaching goals and ideals of information literacy and the realities of daily practice
within our libraries, classrooms, and workplaces can, at times, seem like a chasm.
. . . How can we take what is powerful and inspiring about the proclamations and
create workable plans for our libraries, our information literacy programs, and our
students? (p. 385-386).
While the volume of information literacy literature is testament to its importance
to education in the 21st century, the debate and discussion over what is meant by
information literacy and constant calls for reconceptualization can be confusing to the
practitioner (Elmborg, 2006; Jacobs & Berg, 2011; Johnston & Webber, 2003; OwusuAnsah, 2005; Webber & Johnston, 2000). The frustrating reality is that the discussions
have had little effect on practice and that many teaching librarians continue to teach in a
style more reflective of the bibliographic instruction training model than information
literacy (Seamans, 2012). From the perspectives of a teaching librarian and scholar, I
believe the literature about critical information literacy can inform (rather than confuse)
practitioners, and encourage them to “focus less on information transfer and more on
developing critical consciousness in students” so that they “learn to take control of their

17
lives and their own learning to become active agents, asking and answering questions that
matter to them and to the world around them” (Elmborg, 2006, pp. 192-193). Critical
consciousness is a tenet of critical pedagogy that “that allows people to question and
explore the character of their society with a view to acting as subjects in creating a more
democratic culture” (Freire, Paulo, 1921-1997, 2004).
Definitions
Critical information literacy – Information literacy that focuses “less on information
transfer and more on developing critical consciousness in students” so that they “learn to
take control of their lives and their own learning to become active agents, asking and
answering questions that matter to them and to the world around them” (Elmborg, 2006,
pp. 192-193).
Critical Pedagogy – “Educational practices that allow people to acquire, analyze, and
produce both social and self-knowledge” (McLaren & Crawford, 2010).
Information literacy – Is defined by ACRL (2000) as “A set of abilities requiring
individuals to "recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate,
evaluate, and use effectively the needed information" (p. 2).
Interpretive review – Is defined by the Sage Encyclopedia of Social Science Research
Methods as a qualitative approach with “an emphasis on the interpretive role of the
reviewer in making sense of the findings of different studies to construct a holistic picture
of the field, a picture that may well reflect the particular interests and sensibilities of the
reviewer” (Hammersley, 2004, para. 6).
Practitioner – The term practitioner is used interchangeably with the term teaching
librarian.

18
Reflexivity – Reflexivity is used throughout this document to clarify my perspective as a
practitioner who has a non-neutral relationship with the literature being reviewed. The
Sage Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods defines reflexivity as,
“Qualitative researchers’ engagement of continuous examination and explanation of how
they have influenced a research project” (para 1). . . . “Researchers are required to ask
questions of their methodological decision making and are encouraged to think about
epistemological decisions regarding the research and its findings” (Dowling, 2008, para
3).
Conceptual Framework
This interpretive synthesis of the literature of critical information literacy was
reflexively interpreted through my dual lenses of teaching librarian and scholar. It is a
practitioner inquiry grounded in the justifications and philosophies of action research and
the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) (Cochran-Smith & Donnell, 2006). As a
practitioner and researcher my intent was to reveal pedagogy and curriculum to improve
my own teaching practice and that of other teaching librarians. While lack of access to
the curriculum handicaps individual teaching librarians’ influence to some extent, we still
have a great deal of control over what and how we teach (Hollister & Coe, 2003; Phelps,
Senior, & Diller, 2011). The lack of time and access is in fact a challenge to teaching
librarians to use the very best pedagogy and present the most effective content possible.
Methodologically-inclusive reviews conducted by and/or for the practitioner to
inform practice have much potential because they are driven by practitioner-based
concerns, are purposive to address those concerns, and are conducted in such a way that
they are likely to provide the synthesized detail that practitioners need in order to apply

19
knowledge to practice (Gough, 2009; Hammersley, 2002) The methodologies and
findings of studies may have very different meanings to practitioners than to scientists,
scholars, or policymakers (Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 2009; Groundwater-Smith &
Mockler, 2008; Sch n, 1995). A review of the literature by and/or for the practitioner is
intended to solve very different problems than such a review conducted for other
audiences (See Figure 1).
Oddly, despite the attention paid to evidence-based practice in education, the
importance of practitioner review of the research has received little attention in the
education literature (Kahn, Wareham, Young, Willis, & Pilkington, 2012). This is
puzzling given practitioner reviews and syntheses’ prominence as methodologies in the
field of nursing, which is similarly concerned with evidence-based practice (Polit &
Tatano-Beck, 2008; Rebar, Gersch, Macnee, & McCabe, 2011). Recent research in
education demonstrates that a practitioner review of the literature can lead to improved
integration of research into practice (Kahn, et al., 2012; Professional user reviews, 2012).
Further, the purposes and processes of systematic literature review and practitioner
inquiry are similar. Both recommend that research be conducted collaboratively in
teams, and both strive toward public dissemination of results to influence policy and
practice (Cochran-Smith & Donnell, 2006; Gough, Oliver, & Thomas, 2012). As
Groundwater-Smith and Mockler (2008) put it:
What counts as professional knowledge is a much more interesting and complex
matter than in times gone by, when it was seen that it was the role of academia
and dedicated Government agencies to develop such knowledge and communicate

20
it to the cognate profession. . . . knowledge creation is not exclusively a matter for
scientists and academics working in institutions. ” (p. 81).

Figure 1: Conceptual Framework

Figure 1: Methodologically-inclusive reviews conducted by and/or for the practitioner to
inform practice have much potential because they are driven by practitioner-based
concerns, are purposive to address those concerns, and are conducted in such a way that
they are likely to provide the synthesized detail that practitioners need in order to apply
knowledge to practice.
New voices are calling for and conducting many types of literature review and
research syntheses of methodologically-diverse reports in order to complement the
customary quantitative meta-analysis of individual research studies (for examples, DixonWoods, et al., 2006; Gough, et al., 2012; Morse, 2006; Pawson, Greenhalgh, Harvey, &

21
Walshe, 2005; Suri & Clark, 2009). This is due in part to the surge in qualitative and
other methodologically-diverse research and also to emerging critical, participatory, and
interpretive perspectives among scholars, referred to by Lather as “paradigm
proliferation” (2006, p. 35). Suri and Clarke (2009) note that critical and participatory
perspectives “are common in educational research” (p. 402). Among others, Pawson, et
al., (2005) question whether the exclusion of large numbers of studies on the basis of
research methodology can result in a credible review that is free from bias and argue for
more methodologically-inclusive reviews (also see Hammersley, 2001).
In academia the purpose of literature reviews is ordinarily understood to be to
provide background for a study or to aggregate or summarize knowledge (Sandelowski &
Barroso, 2007). There are, however many ways of approaching a literature review or
synthesis that may vary depending on the purpose of the review. Cooper (1988)
proposed that reviews can be positioned according to the focus and goals of the review,
the perspective of the reviewer (epistemology), the coverage of the review, and its
organization, and intended audience. So, in terms of Cooper’s taxonomy, critical
interpretive synthesis from a practitioner perspective would have a focus of “practices or
applications,” a goal of “identification of central issues,” coverage that is “central or
pivotal,” organization that is “conceptual,” and an audience of “practitioners” (p. 109).
Barnett-Page and Thomas (2009, p. 5), and Gough, et al., (2012, p. 41) describe
“overarching approaches to the activity of reviewing research literature” (p. 40), which
are dependent on the reviewer’s epistemological viewpoint:


Subjective idealism: there is no shared reality that is independent of multiple
alternative human constructions

22


Objective idealism: there is a world of collectively shared understandings



Critical realism: our knowledge of reality is mediated by our perceptions and
beliefs



Scientific realism: it is possible for knowledge to approximate closely an external
reality



Naïve realism: reality exists independent of human constructions and can be
known directly.

The epistemologies of objective and critical realisms are appropriate to this review,
because I wish to explore the collective understanding of practitioners, through my own
practitioner lens.
The most common form of review, meta-analysis, is aggregative and conducted
from a scientific realism or naïve realism approach. Newer forms of review are
configurative, and are positioned to purposely “arrange (configure) the findings from
primary studies to answer the review question(s)” (Gough, et al., 2012, p. 51). While
traditional meta-analyses are effective to evaluate interventions to discover “what works”
(p. 41), Pawson, et al., (2005) suggest that other forms of research synthesis can be aimed
at discerning “what works, for whom, in what circumstances, in what respects, and how”
(p. 21).
Gough, et al. (2012) offered examples and define several “overarching approaches
to reviewing” (p. 41): realist synthesis; critical interpretive synthesis; and, meta-narrative
review. Of these, critical interpretive synthesis was most appropriate for this practitioner
inquiry, because is deliberately configurative to answer research questions,
methodologically-designed to synthesize “a multidisciplinary and multi-method evidence

23
base” (p. 43), and emphasizes that the “voice of the author is explicit and reflexively
accounted for” (Dixon-Woods, 2008, para 20). From perspective of a critical researcher,
“validity is called into question, its assumptions interrogated and challenged, and the
researchers need to be reflexive and disclose what they bring to a narrative” (Creswell &
Miller, p. 126). Practitioner researchers, in particular, must be transparent about ethics
and values, because as Groundwater-Smith & Mockler (2008) maintain “ethical issues
form the primary criteria for quality in practitioner research” ( p. 114).
As will be further described in Chapter 3, critical interpretive synthesis draws
upon ethnographic and grounded theory approaches in order to generate theory, which in
this case is more akin to “practice theory” often discussed in the nursing literature
(Practice theory, 2009). Barnett-Page and Thomas (2009) concisely describe the
characteristics of critical interpretive synthesis:
It involves an iterative approach to refining the research question and searching
and selecting from the literature (using theoretical sampling) and defining and
applying codes and categories. It also has a particular approach to appraising
quality, using relevance – i.e. likely contribution to theory development – rather
than methodological characteristics as a means of determining the quality
[emphasis from original] of individual papers (p. 4).
The published research which supports critical information literacy is diverse, and
so this approach to review seemed most appropriate in order to maximize use of the
literature to inform practice. The capacity of critical interpretive synthesis to allow an
“emerging theoretical framework” also seemed appropriate to a body of literature that is
not yet grounded in theory (Dixon-Woods et al., 2006). Most importantly, a

24
configurative review, such as that employed here, firmly entrenches the issues of the
practitioner as the driving force of the review. Citing Eakin and Mykhalovskiy (2003),
Dixon-Woods, et al. (2006), suggest that the research questions of a study should “serve
as a compass rather than an anchor” (p. 3) – a perspective which inspires this conceptual
framework
Purpose and Research Questions
Despite the herald of a critical approach to information literacy and the
contributions of practitioners to the literature, a clear interpretation of critical information
literacy practice for the teaching librarian has yet to emerge. The literature about
information literacy has proliferated exponentially (Pinto, Cordon, & Diaz, 2010), but
scholars and professional associations have failed to communicate effective, pedagogical
guidance in a manner that is useful to practicing teaching librarians (Elmborg, 2006;
Jacobs, 2011; Johnston &Webber, 2003; Owusu-Ansah, 2005; Webber & Johnston,
2000).
The purpose of this study was to review and synthesize the literature of critical
information literacy through a critical interpretive practitioner lens in order to inform my
own teaching practice and that of other individual teaching librarians who wish to take a
critical approach to information literacy with undergraduate students. A goal was to use
the literature to discern pedagogy and content that can be used to improve information
literacy instruction by actively engaging students. Two research questions framed this
study:
1. What pedagogies should individual teaching librarians who wish to promote
critical information literacy employ?

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW

This chapter provides a thematic review of the literature of teaching librarianship,
and critical information literacy, in order to provide context for and substantiate the
research problem under investigation. While the literature is integrated throughout this
dissertation, this chapter specifically provides background about teaching librarianship
and critical information literacy in order to frame the study.
Teaching Librarianship
The range and complexity of library work has changed markedly in recent
decades, largely due to the changing nature of libraries’ chief commodity: information
(Myburgh, 2003; Walter, 2008). The demand for librarians to teach information literacy
skills has grown, as technology has upended the traditional ways faculty and students find
and use information (Albrecht, & Barron, 2002; Clyde, 2005; Kennan, Cole, Willard, &
Wilson, 2006; Walter, 2008). It is widely recognized that students must have information
skills to survive and thrive in the 21st Century; yet, few library education programs
prepare librarians to teach (Albrecht & Brecht, 2002; Ishimura, & Bartlett, 2009; Julien,
2005; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010).
Albrecht and Baron (2002) summarized more than three decades of literature that
examined the issue of librarian preparation to teach and the expanding teaching role of
librarians. They confirmed that the professional issues remain. Their research further
confirmed that few schools of library and information science courses require training in
instruction as part of their programs, except when preparing school library media
specialists (a finding which is in agreement with Ishimura, & Bartlett, 2009 and Julien,

27
2005). Albrecht and Baron’s analysis of more than 1,000 academic librarian job
advertisements established that 50 percent require instructional duties. Further, their data
showed that practicing teaching librarians spend an average of 50 percent of their time on
library instruction and related activities.
Walter (2005) surveyed public services librarians from a random sample of 13
research libraries to better understand how academic librarians “with little or no
background in pedagogy, instructional design, or assessment of student learning” can
become effective teachers (p. 363). He found that while respondents prefer to learn from
other practitioners, reading the professional literature was the most frequentlyexperienced instructional improvement activity.
Critical Information Literacy
The term information literacy was developed in response to the advent of the
information age in the latter part of the 20th century (Livingstone, Van Couvering, &
Thumim, 2008). In the United States, the term was introduced to librarianship via
ACRL’s Presidential Committee on Information Literacy, which stated in its final report:
Ultimately, information literate people are those who have learned how to learn.
They know how to learn because they know how knowledge is organized, how to
find information and how to use information in such a way that others can learn
from them. They are people prepared for lifelong learning, because they can
always find the information needed for any task or decision at hand (ALA, 1989).
The new concept of information literacy was intended to transform and expand the role of
librarians in creating information literate citizens; and was distinguished from the earlier
instructional role of the librarian, which was known as bibliographic instruction. There

28
are a number of features that differentiate information literacy from bibliographic
instruction (Ward, 1997, as cited in Seamans, 2012, p. 231). Bibliographic instruction is
a library endeavor delivered by the librarian in a lecture format with a focus on library
materials; whereas, information literacy results from a collaboration between the librarian
and course instructor, is integrated into the course, features instruction linked to course
assignments and utilizes active learning techniques (See Table 1).

More simply, Reichel (1990) explained that the shift from bibliographic
instruction to information literacy meant “librarians are aligning themselves with the

29
literacy movement” (p. 46). She conceptualized the differences between the two
concepts:
At first glance, the controversy over the choice between the terms bibliographic
instruction or information literacy seems like an argument comparing apples and
oranges. Information literacy is an attempt to instill a condition, that is literacy
[emphasis from original] into an individual. It has a product – an information
literate individual. Bibliographic instruction, on the other hand, is a methodology,
some would argue a discipline, which enables skills and concepts to be learned (p.
46).
Although lagging behind other academic disciplines, the call for a shift from
bibliographic instruction to information literacy reflected understandings from cognitive
psychology that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. The incorporation of active learning
was supported by the conception of “learning as knowledge construction, in which
learners actively build organized and meaningful representations in their minds” (Mayer,
2005, para 11).
Unfortunately, after more than two decades, the transformation from
bibliographic instruction to information literacy has largely failed (Seamans, 2012).
Elmborg (2004) observed:
Information Literacy has been an important movement in academic libraries for at
least the past decade. Still, no consensus has emerged about how to define
information literacy or how broadly or narrowly to apply literacy theory to the
work of librarians. In fact, the historical definitions of librarianship have tended
to work against the integration of literacy theory into the daily practices of

30
librarianship. These definitions have emphasized protecting the library as
warehouse of externalized knowledge and the librarian as mediator between that
knowledge and the students and faculty who need to use it in the educational
process. The end result has been that information literacy’s power to transform
libraries has been neutralized and contained (p. 5).
The term critical information literacy emerged just a few years after ACRL
introduced the term information literacy (Luke & Kapitke, 1998; Todd 1998). While the
concept of applying literacy theory to information literacy instruction has been bandied
about the literature for some time, it gained traction in 2006 with Elmborg’s highly-cited,
seminal article, “Critical Information Literacy: Implications for Instructional Practice.”
Arguing that academic librarians “increasingly see themselves as educators” (p. 192),
Elmborg expounded upon Paulo Freire’s “banking concept” of education, which rejects
the concept of knowledge as a commodity that can be deposited into student brains by
teachers to be withdrawn at will for future use. Elmborg stated:
Perhaps not accidentally, Friere equates the common library functions of
receiving, filing, collecting, and cataloging with the banking concept. In doing so
he poses important challenges to librarians. What is the role of the library in the
Freirian vision of critical literacy? Is the library a passive information bank
where students and faculty make knowledge deposits and withdrawals, or is it a
place where students actively engage existing knowledge and shape it to their own
current and future uses? And what is the librarian’s role as educator in the
process? (p. 193).

31
It’s important to note that there were several influential articles addressing the
relationship between critical literacy and information literacy published in the years
before Elmborg’s provocative challenge to the profession; however, his appears to have
garnered the most attention, according to Google Scholar metrics (cited 145 times).
Using the same measure, other earlier influential articles that applied critical theory to
information literacy include: Pawley’s 2003 problematization of information literacy
(cited 84 times); Kapitzke’s 2003 “poststructuralist critique” of information literacy (p. 6)
(cited 74 times); Simmons’ 2005 application of genre theory to information literacy (cited
71 times), Andersen’s 2006 view of information literacy as “sociopolitical” (p. 213)
(cited 52 times), Swanson’s 2004b case study of critical information literacy
implementation (cited 42 times), and several others that are more obscure (Burton, 1995;
Doherty & Ketchner, 2005; Hubbard, 1995; Pawley, 1998; and Todd, 1998).
Of special interest to this study is the body of literature that calls for information
literacy to embrace the broader elements of literacy theory, which call for literacy
education to be transformative and emancipatory, and which are increasingly perceived
by the scholarly community as being essential to any form of literacy acquisition
(Elmborg, 2006). An initial review of the literature of critical information literacy
uncovered more than 60 articles and book chapters published since 2006 with a clear
progression from abstract theory toward increasing practicality for teaching librarians.
All of this suggested that at the outset of this study there was a sufficient body of
literature about critical information literacy instruction with the potential to inform
practice if synthesized, interpreted, and disseminated for teaching librarians.

32
CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY

This section provides an overview of the study’s methodology. After a brief
description of the study, it details the research design, sample, sampling procedures, and
data analysis. The chapter concludes with a discussion of trustworthiness.
Research Design
This study was inspired by an authentic problem encountered with my practice of
teaching librarianship, which was how to critically engage undergraduate students with
the vast amounts of information available to them. As always when approaching a
practice problem, I immediately turned to the literature to explore approaches to
information literacy instruction. I found the literature of critical information literacy to
be inspirational and that it resonated with my own experiences as a teaching librarian.
The literature is a rich and underutilized resource for the improvement of practice
(Hammersley, 2002). The value of synthesizing the literature is well-recognized in
education, with a familiar example being the prestigious journal, Review of Research in
Education. It has also become a tenet of evidence-based practice to rely on systematic
review of the literature in recent decades. It was my original intent to conduct a
traditional systematic review of empirical studies; however, I was frustrated in that
attempt because a strict inclusion and exclusion of studies based on research
methodology would have excluded many studies of value to answer the research
questions. Thus began an exploration of methodologically-inclusive review methods
which led to the positioning of this review as a critical interpretive synthesis (DixonWoods, et al., 2006). The methodology was carefully selected in order to make the most

33
of the literature on hand, as well as to accommodate my perspective as a practitioner
through an “authorial voice” (p. 10).
Qualitative inquiry is an appropriate vehicle for research synthesis that is intended
to derive meaning from the literature, since the unit of analysis for qualitative approaches
is text, and the library literature is a rich source of textual data. In this case, qualitative
methodology as practitioner inquiry was particularly appropriate, since the bulk of the
library literature is authored by practicing librarians (Cronin & Meho, 2008; Wiberley,
Hurd, & Weller, 2006). Critical interpretive synthesis methodology is crafted to allow
the synthesis of a large body of methodologically-diverse literature (such as that of
critical information literacy) and provides for an “authorial voice,” (Dixon-Woods, et al.
(2006, p. 10). Such a voice is useful to the practitioner who wants to critically and
reflexively interpret the literature; and, allows for an emerging theoretical framework,
which is appropriate to a relatively new body of research.
Gough, et al. (2012) compared review research methodology and primary
research methodology, and concluded, “The idea that different research questions may be
answered best by different methods and by different types of data also applies to reviews”
(p. 7). They and many others argue that a “systematic question-driven approach to
reviews can apply equally to research questions of process or of meaning that are
addressed by more qualitative primary research and by review methods that reflect those
qualitative research approaches” (2012, p. 7). For more detailed discussions of a range of
qualitative approaches to research syntheses and their purposes, see Barnett-Page and
Thomas (2009); Finlayson and Dixon (2008); Priest and Woods (2002); Schreiber,
Crooks and Stern (1997); and Thorne, Jensen, Kearney, Noblit, and Sandelowski (2004).

34
The Sample
Booth’s (2011) qualitative synthesis found that the evidence base in the literature
of librarianship is a barrier to evidence-based library and information practice due to its
“diffuse nature,” “high proportion of descriptive studies,” and the lack of empirical
studies (p. 4). By adopting the methodologically-inclusive approach of critical
interpretive review, these perceived disadvantages became advantages, since the
literature of critical information literacy includes substantial descriptions of practice,
which are largely written by practitioners, and provide the rich data necessary to describe
a complex practice situation. Thus, in order to capture the most complete information
from the literature available to teaching librarians, studies were included that met the
American Educational Research Association’s broad definition of social science research,
which includes “reports of education research,” and which specifies reports to include
“reviews of research; theoretical, conceptual, or methodological essays; [and] critiques of
research traditions and practices” (Standards, 2006, p. 33).
Appendix A offers details of the studies in the final sample, which was comprised
of 42 studies, and Table 2 presents the characteristics of the studies. Most of the studies
were peer-reviewed journal articles (N=28), some were book chapters (N=13), and one
was a doctoral dissertation. In terms of the type of research, the majority (N=17) were
theoretical essays. The authors of these studies stated their intent to explore theory as it
related to information literacy. Another substantial portion of the studies (N=15) could
loosely be termed single case studies – they were mostly descriptions of practice in a
particular information literacy setting. Some studies were argumentative essays (N=8) in
that the authors clearly argued for a particular stance with regard to information literacy.

35
One study was a literature review and one was a true qualitative empirical study with a
critical action research framework.
The studies used a wide and oft-confusing range of epistemologies, which helps
explain why this particular body of literature to date has not been readily accessible to
practitioners. Many of them cited more than one epistemology. The majority of them
clearly used a critical pedagogy framework (N=25). Some borrowed from frameworks
traditionally used in compositional studies (N=11) and the subset of compositional
studies that addresses genre theory (N=3). Others used a postmodernist framework,
which is larger paradigm behind critical pedagogy (N=9), or specifically cited critical
theory (N=3). A few addressed problem-based or problem-posing techniques with regard
to information literacy (N=3). The rest employed a wide range of frameworks; examples
include aestheticism, contact zone theory, and feminist theory.
Some of the theoretical and argumentative essays did not reference which groups
of students might be targeted by the critical approaches they were exploring or arguing
for. Of the studies that did reference groups of students, most targeted a college student
population (N=27). Some did not specify the level of student (N=8); some specified
lower level undergraduate students (N=4), first year students (N=6), or community
college students (N=4). A few targeted upper level undergraduate students (N=3). One
was in a K-12 setting of unspecified grade level, one was in a secondary setting, and one
specified adult learners.

Sampling Procedures
Critical interpretive synthesis (Dixon Woods, et al., 2006) borrows from the
qualitative traditions of ethnography and grounded theory to use purposive, theoretical
sampling to select research reports based on their potential to contribute to the
“development of concepts and theory” related to the research problem under investigation
(p. 3). It is not the goal of critical interpretive synthesis to be exhaustive, or to simply
summarize what is known, but rather to critically interpret the literature in order to better
understand the phenomenon. This study incorporated an emergent design so sampling
“involved a constant dialectic process conducted concurrently with theory generation” (p.

37
4) until saturation was reached, meaning that no new data relevant to the research
questions emerged from subsequent searches (Theoretical saturation, 2004). Studies
were selected on the basis of their “relevance and theoretical contribution” to the practice
of critical information literacy instruction (Gough, et al., 2012, p. 44), using the weight of
evidence framework (Gough, 2009), which sets a standard for study inclusion based on
“fit for purpose for answering the review question” (p. 9).
The extensive search for studies using Bates’ (1989) berrypicking strategies took
many months of repetitive searching and the same studies were encountered, scanned,
and considered for inclusion multiple times. Unlike the “classic model of information
retrieval,” which is a holdover from the print era, Bates’ (1989) “berrypicking, evolving
search model” (p. 407) acknowledges the iterative nature of secondary research in the
digital age, and encompasses a range of search techniques to supplement database
searching that emphasize making use of the knowledge gained as the search progresses.
See Figure 2 (Adapted from Bates, 1989, p. 408) and Figure 3 (p. 411). The following
strategies were used to uncover additional studies for the sampling frame.


Footnote chasing/backward chaining – As studies were found “footnotes found in
books and articles of interest” were tracked (Bates, 1989, p. 412). I read the
reference lists of studies and looked up articles that appeared to be relevant to the
reference questions.



Citation searching/forward chaining) – Articles which cited found articles were
also tracked. This was accomplished using Google Scholar’s “cited by” feature.



Journal runs and hand searching – I identified and manually searched individual
journals that were central to the line of inquiry. The tables of contents of eight

38
journals were read spanning from 2000 (or when the journals began publishing)
through spring 2013. These journals were identified because they contained three
or more relevant articles from the initial sampling frame. They were:
Behavioral and Social Sciences Librarian
College and Undergraduate Libraries
Journal of Academic Librarianship
Journal of Documentation
Library Philosophy and Practice
Library Quarterly
Reference and User Services Quarterly
Reference Services Review


Area scanning – I browsed physical collections for nearby materials on similar
topics. This was not particularly helpful, as there were only a few books
published that contained chapters related to the study and those were mostly
uncovered via other search methods.



Author searching – I identified authors who wrote about the area of interest and
sought additional research by that author that might have relevance to the subject
under investigation. This was accomplished using Google Scholar author pages
and library databases.

40
Google Scholar proved to be an excellent tool for many of these techniques, since
it is fairly comprehensive for the social sciences (Kousha & Thelwall, 2007), provided
links to subsequent references to works, ranked the most influential articles high in the
result lists, and linked directly to institutional library holdings. Scholar searches were
supplemented with other databases, including worldwide library holdings via WorldCat,
the local library catalog, and databases specific to education and librarianship, such as the
Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Library, EBSCO’s Education
Source, and Information Science Abstracts (LISA).
Studies that held promise for answering the research questions were stored in a
commercial bibliographic management system that also functioned as a searchable
database and permitted me to make notes on each study. An initial pool of 128 studies
was identified as the sampling frame.
Through a careful process of reading and rereading the studies, they were further
screened and included or excluded in the sample. There were multiple reasons why a
study might be excluded, but the most common and most important was whether or not
the study offered advice that was relevant to the practice of individual teaching librarians
who wish to promote critical information literacy in undergraduate research. So, for
example, while a study about information literacy for a highly specialized upper-level
course, or a for-credit information literacy stand-alone course might have been included
in the initial sample frame, after careful scrutiny it might have been excluded if it did not
provide information of use to the practitioners targeted by this study. Similarly, a study
about information literacy at the high school level might have included even though the
setting was not an undergraduate library if it had practical advice to offer. Other studies

41
were excluded because upon further inspection they did not really address critical
approaches in the information literacy classroom. So, for example Hamelink (1976) was
the first writer to use the term “critical information literacy” but she wrote about
journalism, not librarianship. Or, Dunaway’s (2011) article, “Web 2.0 and Critical
Information Literacy” looked promising initially, but closer inspection revealed it was
really about critical thinking, not critical pedagogy.
The careful reading and rereading of studies and the application of inclusion and
exclusion criteria took place throughout the data collection and analysis stages and
ultimately resulted in a pool of 42 studies that were included in the synthesis, and which
were “clearly concerned” with issues of practice (Dixon-Woods, et al., 2006, p. 3). See
Appendix A for the details of the studies that were included in the review.
Data Collection and Analysis
To begin the data collection and analysis processes, I carefully reread each study
and created a table that listed the author, type of study, target population of the study,
why it was of interest, and how it might contribute to the research questions. Next, I read
each study again, this time extracting direct quotations from the authors. These
quotations were extracted when they provided rich description that could inform
practitioners. As I selected and captured the quotations I began to organize them by
broad theme, and as the study progressed, I constantly organized and reorganized these
quotations so that a thematic conversation began to emerge that closely followed the
literature and conceptually captured the main practice ideas that the studies contained. It
should be noted that many of the studies were not explicitly about teaching practice.
Many were much more theoretical, but if they contained relevant information about

42
teaching practice, that information was extracted when it took the form of a tangible and
useable quotation, unique to that author (meaning they weren’t quoting someone else).
The process for developing themes and synthesizing the studies emulated the
process used by Dixon-Woods, et al. (2005):
Synthesis should begin with a detailed inspection of the papers, treating them as
analogous to transcripts in primary qualitative research. Tentative theoretical
constructs, or categories, that help to explain the phenomena being described in
the literature should be developed. The theoretical structures that begin to emerge
should be constantly compared against the evidence in the papers, and the
credibility of the evidence and its underlying assumptions should be critically
assessed. The categories and the relationships between them should gradually
become better specified into the integrated set of constructs that forms the
synthesising argument (p. 275).
Critical interpretive synthesis builds upon Noblit and Hare’s (1988) lines of
argument synthesis. Dixon-Woods, et al. (2005) suggested, “that the output of an LOA
[lines of argument] synthesis is a synthesising argument. This synthesising argument
integrates evidence from across the studies in the review into a coherent theoretical
framework comprising a network of constructs and the relationships between them.
Suri (2014) described the process of constructing “a collective account of
evidence across individual research reports” (p. 129). He explained, “Interpretive
techniques in a synthesis involve consciously constructing understandings by connecting
subjective insights gained from individual studies” (p. 135). In the case of this study, in
accord with critical interpretive synthesis methodology, thematic analysis was used “to

43
identify key themes emerging from the literature” (p. 136). Also in keeping with critical
interpretive synthesis, I avoided coding and counting themes, in favor of selecting quotes
and organizing themes on the basis of the their “explanatory power” (p. 136).
Trustworthiness
Suri (2014) offered multiple examples of how to evaluate the rigor of syntheses in
his recent handbook, Towards Methodologically Inclusive Research Syntheses.
Published after I conceived my conceptual framework, his guide confirmed the
methodological approaches I had gleaned from previous literature about conducting a
configurative review of methodologically-diverse literature for purposes of practice. He
stated:
There is no universal framework by which the results of all quality syntheses may
be evaluated. However the process by which the synthesis was conducted can be
evaluated with respect to its methodological coherence and consistency of its
alignment with its overarching epistemological orientation (p. 148).
This synthesis attempted to provide a rich level of detail regarding
methodological decisions made and to support those decisions with the literature of
research synthesis in order to enhance its credibility for practitioners. It is also wellaligned with the “overarching epistemological orientation” of critical information
literacy, and associated ideas of knowledge creation and agency. The methodology
employed was indeed a form of critical information literacy itself, as the literature was
used to uncover new ideas of probable use to practitioners who want to use a critical
approach in the information literacy classroom.

44
Suri (2014) further stated, “In general, understandings constructed in a synthesis may be
evaluated by the extent to which they are useful and insightful to the intended audience.”
Interpretive review makes no claims to be reproducible or generalizable – measures of
reliability that are often used in the evaluation of other types of meta-analyses. Instead,
one can assess the “applicability” or “transferability” of an interpretive synthesis such as
this one (p. 148).
Suri explained:
Applicability or transferability [emphases from original] may be described as the
extent to which connected understandings constructed in the synthesis can be
adapted to similar real-life contexts. Transferability can be enhanced by using
purposeful sampling to maximize the range of information; by selecting reports
from diverse theoretical perspectives, research foci and contexts; and by
providing thick description of the synthesis process as well as the contexts
covered by the original studies (p. 150).
From the context of practice, Schön (1995) refers to this as “actionable theory,”
which is:
Derived from and invented in particular situations of practice, [that] can be
generalized to other situations, not as covering laws but through what I call
reflective transfer [emphasis from original], that is by carrying them over into
new situations where they may be put to work and tested and found to be valid
and interesting, but where they may also be reinvented (p. 31).
This study is not intended to generate a single knowable truth, but rather practical
and useful ideas for teaching librarians who want to try a critical approach to information

45
literacy instruction. It is unlikely that anyone will find here a finished recipe for perfect
instructional practice, nor that anyone, even I, would embrace the range of these findings
uncritically. Rather they are something to consider, try out, tweak, and try out again – as
is all good pedagogy.
Another measure of credibility for interpretive synthesis suggested by Suri (2014)
is “prolonged engagement with the research literature to be synthesized” (p. 149). The
bibliographic software used to store studies for this synthesis was created August, 13,
2011. For two years and six months I engaged with the literature repeatedly through the
multi-stage search process described in the data collection and analysis section above,
and then through repeated reading, data extraction, and data analysis.
Suri (2014) stated, “Given the inherent subjectivity involved in an interpretive
process, an interpretive synthesis may approach rather than attain external reliability” (p.
150). He suggested that clear description of the “factors which contribute to the
uniqueness of their synthesis, such as the synthesist’s identity” can help interpretive
syntheses “approach” reliability (p. 150). Throughout the synthesis, I have been
transparent about my role as a practitioner and researcher in order to render the findings
believable and useful to other practitioners.

46
CHAPTER FOUR: FINDINGS

The purpose of this study is to review and synthesize the literature about critical
approaches to teaching information literacy to undergraduate students. Its aim was to
discern curriculum and pedagogy that individual teaching librarians can use to improve
their teaching practice. Two research questions guided this synthesis:
1. What pedagogies should individual teaching librarians who wish to promote
critical information literacy employ?
2. What content should individual teaching librarians who wish to promote critical
information literacy teach?
This chapter is organized by themes related to teaching critical information
literacy. The methodology used to develop each theme is fully described in the previous
chapter. It opens with an over-arching view of the paradigm shift that critical
information literacy scholars and practitioners describe. Next each research question is
addressed individually. Two themes emerged that addressed research question one, and
one theme that addressed research question two. Within each theme, multiple,
overlapping subthemes emerged, which are further organized by subsection to flesh out
distinct, though related concepts. Each section includes an introduction, followed by the
subthemes and direct quotations from the literature that best exemplified the subthemes.
The chapter concludes with a summary of the findings and a graphical overview.
Overview: Traditional Information Literacy versus Critical Information Literacy
Almost every study included in the synthesis was premised on criticism of
existing approaches to information literacy instruction. A common critique was that

47
instruction about tools and skills is inadequate to support a research process which is in
reality complex and non-sequential. Some writers went so far as to claim that skill-andtool based approaches were detrimental to students because they do not allow for the
development of student ideas and agency. At the core of many of these criticisms was
dissatisfaction with the ACRL (2000) Information Literacy Competency Standards for
Higher Education. Also, student research assignments that emphasize the final product
over the research process were thought to diminish student capacity to engage critically
with information and become knowledge creators.
Although these criticisms at face value seem to offer little to the practitioner
seeking to apply critical pedagogy to his or her practice, an analysis of the key terms the
authors used to negatively describe traditional information literacy, when compared with
the key terms they used to positively describe critical information literacy presents a
contrast between the two approaches, which is depicted in Figures 4 and 5 on pages 60
and 61. This contrast represents a paradigm shift for traditional teaching librarians.
Information literacy should be about more than learning tools and skills.
While most studies mentioned the deficits of a tools-and-skills based approach, a few
teaching librarians described their realizations within the context of classroom
experiences. In an essay book chapter, Keer (2010) described a “typical one-shot
[emphasis from original] information literacy instruction session” as:
a forty-five minute marathon during which the librarian desperately spews forth
as many of the tenets of How To Do Research [emphasis from original] as is
humanly possible while the class sits in anxious silence, hoping to figure out what
possible relevance this litany could mean to their particular circumstances. When

48
the librarian conceives of the information literacy session as a brief opportunity to
frantically impart to students a veritable arsenal of techniques, shortcuts, and
strategies, the students often feel that they have been plucked from the relative
comfort of their regularly scheduled classes and deposited into a world of arcane
codes and unfamiliar customs. What results resembles less a vigorous exploration
of how to develop sound research skills and more a medieval ordeal that everyone
is hoping desperately to survive (pp. 152-153).
After several years of teaching a for-credit information literacy course at a large
university, Broidy (2007) reconceptualized her “traditional approach to library
instruction” (p. 495). She realized:
The tools-and strategies-intensive way I had structured my courses and
presentations actually encouraged students to commodify information without
stopping to consider the political ramifications of facts [emphases from original]
on a page or, indeed, how those facts came to be valued. . . . Working in a
university that went to great lengths to promote the conscious incorporation of
critical thinking skills into every aspect of the curriculum, I was forced to
confront the realization that not only was I failing to instill these skills in my
students, I may very well have been doing just the opposite. The students left the
classroom equipped to search the catalog or find a journal article but no more able
to assess the quality of the books and articles they discovered or to think critically
about the nature of information than they were when the session started (p. 495).

49
Kopp and Olson-Kopp (2010), a teaching librarian and a professor of rhetoric and
writing contextualized the shortcomings of a skills-and tools-based approach to
information literacy:
In broad terms, library instruction functions within the banking concept of
education to the extent it can be described merely as a transfer of objects that
fosters the development of skills in the service of others [emphasis from original].
This description stands in dialectical opposition to an alternative, problem-posing
orientation, which defines library instruction as a dialogic process, a collaborative
praxis in the face of an authentic problem (p.56).
Based on their own teaching experiences, Kopp and Olson-Kopp further reflected:
When learning outcomes are couched primarily in mechanistic and behavioral
terms, we should not be surprised if students remain uncritical. Although students
may play a visibly active role when they complete a hands-on task such as using
truncation in a search, they are for the most part developing technical expertise –
learning how to operate machines, as it were, without considering their purposes,
functions, or effects on others. Technical skills when they are taught in the
absence of the particular human contexts which give them significance may seem
hollow or pointless (p. 58).
Research is a non-sequential, iterative, and messy process. Many proponents
of critical information literacy felt that traditional conceptions of the research process
were flawed and misaligned with both the way new knowledge is actually created and
students’ real life experiences with research. One teaching librarian stated simply,

50
“Searching for information is not the simple, rules-driven process that many of us would
like. Gathering information is erratic and often messy” (Swanson, 2004b, p. 260).
Another scholar contextualized the problems associated with conceiving the
research process as linear and sequential:
The information process [emphasis from original] as it is currently understood –
define a problem; locate appropriate information; select, organize, and synthesize
resources; create and present a solution; evaluate the effectiveness of the task
completion – is devoid of any opportunity for students to examine the social
context and construction of either the information problem or its solution
[emphases from original]. Neither the constituent assumptions of the problem, its
process of formulation, the subsequent solution, nor the information used in
solving the problem is contextualized or problematized. This, in turn, precludes
the availability of multiple and alternative solutions and naturalizes the
information process, making it immune to discursive interrogation and
transformation (Kapitzke, 2003, p. 51).
Sinkinson and Lingold (2010) decided to apply critical pedagogy to their
instruction after realizing:
In the former seminar model, we explained library resources and demonstrated
[emphases from original] how to navigate them as students followed along at their
own computers. We superficially modeled the research process by moving
through sample searches that we knew would produce excellent results while
highlighting searching strategies and database features. . . . We knew research to
be a messy and iterative process that is often frustrating and surprising . . . We

51
compartmentalized information by seeking isolating specific mechanical
strategies rather than nurturing a conceptual understanding of information systems
(p. 82).
A few teaching librarians described specific problems related to the timing of a
research model that is conceived to be experienced in discrete stages suggesting that
students should be critically engaged earlier in the process. One challenged librarians:
to rethink the chronological configuration of the research process and to
reimagine the nature of reading as an act of discovery and creation. Early
engagement of students in the research process and regarding students as creators
of knowledge from the moment that they begin research are two characteristics of
a reconceptualized IL [information literacy]. Creation is conventionally
conceived as happening only during the third act, the using act of a three-act
information literacy drama, which involves a first act of finding and a second act
of evaluating [emphases from original]” (Patterson, 2009, p. 353).
This teaching librarian further envisioned an “IL [information literacy] pedagogy
that would be more like a glass-blowing class, combining technique, aesthetics, risk,
demonstration, and practice, and less like a workshop on Microsoft Excel” (Patterson,
2009, p. 353).
Several studies emphasized the impact that the internet has had students’ research
process. Luke and Kapitzke (1999) writing at the time that the internet was initially
becoming a factor in library instruction argued:
Common uses of the internet tend to be non-linear, recursive, and, taking a leaf
out of McLuhan's book, 'simultaneous'. In this way, problems and tasks

52
encountered by internet users tend to be defined and redefined in dynamic,
reflexive practices that, quite literally, second guess and critique each decision as
it is being made (p. 478).
Subsequently, they concluded:
As a consequence [of traditional linear information frameworks] students are
being taught to do [emphasis from original] a research methodology that, at best,
is out of sync with cultural change and technological capacities and, at worst, lags
behind their relatively unfettered agency at surfing the net selectively and,
perhaps, quite critically and cynically, away from the gaze of the teacher, the
librarian and the assignment (p. 484).
Information literacy standards and definitions over-emphasize tools and
skills. Almost every study debated definitions of information literacy and critiqued the
ACRL (2000) Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (see
Table 3). The following argument is typical of the discussion in the literature:
Proponents of critical information literacy caution that, although standards such as
the Association of College and Research Libraries’s [sic] Information Literacy
Competency Standards can help librarians and other educators outline the
research process, these standards and performance measures may lead to an
excessive focus on teaching skills related to finding, accessing, and evaluating
information at the expense of providing insight into how information is intimately
tied to the social contexts in which it is created and used (Warren & Duckett,
2010, p. 355).

53
Writing from the perspective of a critical information literacy librarian, Elmborg
(2012) concurred:
This librarian will find important things missing from the Standards. The way
that research is portrayed in the Standards will seem not so much wrong as onedimensional and inadequate. The idea that we ‘recognize the need for
information’ will seem mechanical. The idea that we should aim to ‘access the
needed information effectively and efficiently’ will seem contrary to the slow and
patient way that knowledge builds in the person (p. 93).
Table 3
ACRL’s Information Literacy Standards for Higher Education

Standard One: The information literate student determines the nature and extent of the
information needed
Standard Two: The information literate student accesses needed information effectively
and efficiently.
Standard Three: The information literate student evaluates information and its sources
critically and incorporates selected information into his or her knowledge base and value
system.
Standard Four: The information literate student, individually or as a member of a group,
uses information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose.
Standard Five: The information literate student understands many of the economic, legal,
and social issues surrounding the use of information and accesses and uses information
ethically and legally.

54
Some critics perceived that the standards are detrimental to the goals of
information literacy. Pankl and Coleman (2010) commented:
Indicators listed under each ACRL Standard do not fully address the individuality
and creative functionality of the researcher – they, in effect, bypass the agency of
the researcher. Fundamentally these standards favor an instrumental approach.
They are predicated upon the idea of using information to achieve purposes,
rather than highlighting the purposiveness of the researcher. Thus, they construct
research as an accretion of knowledge that can be added to a pre-existing
knowledge base [emphasis from original] that is divorced from any knowledge
creation. Consequently, by promoting (to the letter) the ACRL Standards, the IL
[information literacy] instructor is hindering the transformation of her students
and inhibiting their impact on the world (p. 8).
A teaching librarian and instructor of record who partnered to integrate
information literacy into a first-year writing course concluded:
Our teaching practice undermined the ACRL’s (2000) proclamation that
information literacy enables learners to ‘extend their investigations, become more
self-directed, and assume greater control of their own learning.’ Because our
classes were teacher-centered and demonstration-based, we were in no manner
fostering self-direction for the students. We imposed a research formula on the
students that inhibited their active engagement with seminar content (Sinkinson &
Lingold, 2010, p. 82).
Another commented:

55
The dual presence of strategic and communicative action in the ACRL definition
is not a fatal contradiction, but it does produce some specific challenges for
information literacy educators, which manifest themselves in questions of
pedagogy [emphasis from original]. Each ACRL standard can, in principle, be
reduced to technical points which can be taught behaviouristically, as long as the
full implications of the word critically in §3 are ignored. . . . This type of teaching
is in contradiction with the use of the term “critically”. It reduces information
literacy to technical, strategic action, instead of appreciating its social scientific
nature (Whitworth, 2006, p. 8).
Research paper assignments can be antithetical to information literacy.
Some proponents of critical information literacy found the research paper assignment
itself complicit in limiting student agency as it “made the collection of research more like
a scavenger hunt than a critical, self-reflective process” (Jacobs & Jacobs, 2009, p. 75).
Hubbard (1995) claimed that “librarians figure as unindicted coconspirators in the
dubious achievements of the RPA [research paper assignment] as a retailer of undigested
facts (p. 447).
One instructor of record for an English Composition course described her
realization that she instilled a critical perspective in every aspect of her course except the
research paper assignment. Her partnership with a librarian took the common form of a
one-hour, one-time workshop:
The students are highly goal-oriented during the one-hour workshop. . . . Students
want to learn the quickest way to locate a cache of acceptable research materials
that can be inserted into the research paper, meeting or exceeding the exact

56
number of sources and source types, the exact number of in-text citations, and the
exact number of pages required by the syllabus. This focus on getting and
skimming as opposed to seeking and evaluating is a departure to what we’ve been
doing all semester. In my classroom the students mostly form a community of
scholars who are ready to be critical readers of everything I assign. Now, [during
library instruction] however, when faced with [the] task of reading the published
word by themselves and writing a formal paper that incorporates it, the students
morph into survival mode and are ready to accept almost unquestioningly
everything they read. . . . The multidimensional experience of research has
collapsed into a shallow, mind-numbing chore (Torrell, 2010, p. 90).
She concluded:
Consider that the research paper process described in my narrative places the
stress on a top-down [emphasis from original] teaching of technique both in the
classroom and [library] workshop; it limits the research workshop to a rushed,
single hour of class; it does not include opportunities for the students to receive
guided instruction throughout the research process; it isolates students as opposed
to encouraging peer interaction; it evaluates the students’ multi-dimensional
process of research writing using a single, formal paper that determines a large
part of the course grade; it does little to give students the agency to be active
researchers, readers, and responders to sources (pp. 94-95).
Another rhetorician who worked for a university writing center explored the
interconnection between writing and information literacy in a two-part series of articles
arguing for a critical approach to information literacy. He described the effects of a

57
reductionist approach that traditional research paper assignments take, “Such research
papers tend to collapse what should be a rich process of compositional invention and
intellectual inquiry into a lock-step sequence that focuses on selecting, narrowing, and
outlining a subject” (Norgaard, 2003, p. 127). In the second article, he reflected, “As
traditionally taught, the research paper places its focus on format and final product, on
sources and citations instead of intellectual process” (Norgaard, 2004, p. 222). He
concluded, “Students come to see citation merely as a means to avoid plagiarism, not as a
productive means to frame questions, establish currency and credibility, advertise
allegiances, and explore disagreements and open questions” (p. 223). Instead he
suggested:
Rather than having us focus on the fruits of our search for information (citations)
or on the final written products of that search (the research paper), a processoriented information literacy would attend more closely to a broad and evolving
life of intellectual inquiry (Norgaard, 2004, p. 224).
Summary of criticisms of traditional approaches to information literacy. The
skeptical and largely negative nature of the scholarly dialog about critical information
literacy could be off-putting and frustrating for the teaching librarian seeking to improve
his or her practice by incorporating critical approaches. It seems much more focused on
what is wrong than what can be accomplished. To gain a clearer understanding of the
difference between traditional and critical approaches to teaching information literacy, it
was helpful to contrast positive and negative descriptive key terms from the authors’
direct quotations.

58
I extracted words and phrases from the authors’ statements, much as a secondary
researcher would identify keywords for an information search – by stripping out all of the
words from the quotations except those that were perceived to be important to describing
the phenomena under study. For example, Sinkinson and Lingold’s (2010) statement is
typical of a description of critical information literacy in terms of what was not
happening, “Because our classes were teacher-centered and demonstration-based, we
were in no manner fostering self-direction for the students.” (p. 82). Conceptually this
statement describes traditional information literacy as an approach is “demonstrationbased” rather than self-directed. These are the key terms behind the concept relayed in
the statement. One is a negative description of practice and the other positive. While the
additional words in the statement hold the sentence together, they do little to describe the
concept being relayed, and so were stripped from the sentence, leaving the phrase
“demonstration-based” as a description of traditional practice, and the phrase selfdirected as a positive description of practice.
Using a popular, web-based word cloud tool, I created one word cloud from key
descriptive words and phrases the authors used to positively describe critical information
literacy instruction (often in terms of what was not happening in the traditional
information literacy classroom), and another from descriptive words and phrases the
authors used to negatively describe traditional instruction. Figure 4 depicts negative
descriptions of information literacy and Figure 5, positive descriptions of information
literacy. In order to effectively group similar key terms, I used a process called
stemming. Stemming converts similar words to the same root or stem (Feinberg, 2013).
So, for example, for Figure 4, the word behavioristically was converted to behavioral.

59
The word cloud software displays words that are mentioned more frequently in the text in
a larger font size. I selected the same font and colors and layout for both figures for
consistency.
Because there is no well-defined theory of critical information literacy, the
comparison of these two word clouds can be useful to a practitioner who wants to
understand the differences between traditional and critical information literacy. While
not absolute, the word clouds give a sense of varied perceptions of critical information
literacy scholars and practitioners who perceive characteristics of traditional information
literacy to be technical, mechanical, behavioral, strategic, and skills-based as compared to
perceptions of critical information literacy as critical, problem-posing, multi-dimensional,
creative, intellectual, process-based, and designed to support student agency.

Research Question 1: Critical Information Literacy Pedagogy
Critical information literacy librarians embrace new roles for themselves
and students. Many scholars and practitioners viewed the traditional role of the librarian
as information expert to be problematic from multiple perspectives. Voices from the
literature suggest teaching librarians relinquish power and give up the role of efficient
expert in favor of the role of friendly ally working alongside students to construct
knowledge. Librarians are also asked to reject a deficit view of student capacity and view
students as active agents in their own knowledge construction. The student should be the
center of instruction, rather than the material. Some scholars suggested the

62
interdisciplinary position of librarians is an asset that can be leveraged to ease students’
entrance into academia, especially those at a disadvantage.
Give up authority. Multiple scholars and practitioners described the critical
information literacy classroom in terms of a more equal balance of power between
librarians and students. In a published “reflective dialogue done with the intent of
developing a more critically grounded theory of information literacy instruction,”
Doherty and Ketchner (2005) proposed:
Authentic teaching is an important concept for librarians to be aware of. It
dismisses the concept of banking, of depositing information in the student.
Rather, the student is an active participant in learning; indeed, the student would
be in control of her learning. For librarians working with patrons, this means a
surrendering of authority. To empower someone means to relinquish control, to
pass along a level of trust and responsibility for learning to the learner. We would
argue that this is part of the definition of learner-centered education: teaching and
learning in equal partnership, implying that the teacher and the learner also are in
partnership (p. 8).
Another scholar described the necessary shift in roles in a published essay:
This change re-envisions the persona of the academic librarian from one of rigid
authority, handing down information from on high, to a dynamic co-creator,
facilitator, enabler, and guide. In this new understanding, the librarian
orchestrates the process of learning; he or she is instrumental in empowering
students to achieve agency [emphases from original] in their education (Yoder,
2003, p. 384).

63
Reale (2012) described her teaching philosophy in framing a library instruction
session for a sophomore-level literature class:
For me, operationalizing Freire’s philosophy and pedagogy in the classroom
begins by seeing my students holistically, in other words recognizing that they
come with thoughts, feelings, perceptions and many other human attributes that
influence not only how they learn, but their capacity to learn. And that I am the
guide who will help them along the way as opposed to being the authority who
expects them to have the right [emphasis from original] answers. This approach
empowers students to trust their own thoughts in exploring a topic (p. 85).
One researcher reflected in her dissertation:
To teach critically requires that instructors be self-aware, flexible, nonauthoritarian, and open to taking risks and to relinquishing control in the
classroom. . . . adopting critical pedagogy involves risk as librarians relinquish the
pretense of control to face a pedagogical situation in which their role develops
according to the needs and preferences of the students” (Strege, 1996, p. 192).
One team of theorists envisioned “a library where librarians become more critical
commentators, mediators and mentors – and perhaps nomadic intellectuals and cultural
tourists- rather than traditional archivists and monitors” (Luke & Kapitzke, 1999, p. 476).
Relinquish expertise and efficiency. Some scholars perceived the traditional role
of the teaching librarian as efficient expert to be an impediment when teaching from a
critical perspective. Peterson (2010) reflected that the role of teaching librarian as expert
erects a barrier in the information literacy classroom:

64
[A] side effect of this lecture-demonstration, cram-it-all-in approach is distance.
When I teach this way, I don’t have to engage with the students beyond a
superficial level. It’s all show and tell on my part with no discussion or active
reflection with the group. I am the expert at the podium in the front of the
classroom and the students are the passive receptacles (p. 71).
In an essay aimed at “re-envisioning” reference services, Martin (2009, p. 1)
stated simply, “Librarians must recast themselves without espousing our expertness,
without claiming that we know the only correct way to conduct information seeking” (pp.
3-4) and concluded, “Rather than acting as experts to whom all patrons should defer,
librarians should serve as helpful guides and fellow explorers” (p. 6).
Patterson (2009) explained that efficiency as a goal undermines students’
knowledge construction, “Librarians who view their job as monitors of information and
who prize the conventional LIS [library and information science] framework of
efficiency and effectiveness are probably the least likely mentors for promoting the idea
that knowledge is constructed.” Instead he advocated “an approach that authorizes
students to create meaning, to construct an argument, to stake claims, and to question
others' claims,” even with the understanding that such an approach “is often full of
inefficiency, doubts, intellectual circling, and confusion” (p. 352).
Ceding the role of efficient expert can be particularly difficult for librarians. In
arguing for an approach to information literacy that is more about “problem posing” and
less about “problem solving” Jacobs and Berg (2011) challenged librarians to:
Consider how we define ourselves as teachers or educators. As librarians, we
have been trained to provide policies that supply answers, offer solutions, and

65
solve problems: this kind of training works well with banking models of
education and problem-solving approaches to information literacy. Problemposing education, on the other hand, disrupts our notions of our role as
information authorities [emphasis from original] . . . Through dialogue, the
teacher-of-the-students and the students-of-the-teacher cease to exist and a new
term emerges: teacher-student with students-teachers. The teacher is no longer
merely the one-who-teaches, but one who is himself taught in dialogue with the
students, who in turn while being taught also teach (p. 390).
Another theorist stated:
Librarians need to move away from the mediating position and develop strategies
to work with people collaboratively, to honor their experiences, and to build
bridges from where they are to new literacies. The vehicle for that change is
language. In my experience, too many librarians still think their job is to provide
correct answers to questions. To be clear, I do not advocate that we abolish
correctness as a standard, but rather that we need a human connection with
someone, to understand the way they view the world, where their question or
problem is coming from (Elmborg, 2010, p. 75).
One librarian offered a practical classroom example of ceding expertise and
efficiency, “I avoid canned searches that demonstrate the right [emphases from original]
way to search using perfect examples that demonstrate all the advantages and none of the
disadvantages of CD-ROM searching” (Burton, 1995, p. 139).
Mirtz (2010) agreed:

66
By limiting research models not only to academic or serious [emphasis from
original] topics, but to topics that have been the subject of serious research and
thinking, we model a non-problematic research process that then frustrates
students when they try the topics that are important to them. In other words,
librarians too often model successful searches, not failed ones (p. 301-302).
Build upon students’ knowledge about information. The literature described a
new role for students as well: As active participants in their own knowledge construction
as opposed to Freire’s “empty vessels” waiting to be filled (Smyth, 2010, para. 3).
Again, librarians were challenged to shift their traditional views of students. Norgaard
(2003), a self-described rhetorician problematized “the deficit model that the term
literacy might have us unwittingly adopt” (p. 126). He explained:
Mandates for information literacy presume that students are not information
literate, whereas our own experience might suggest that college students have
developed fairly complex (if not always effective, appropriate, or productive)
ways of accessing and using information. If information literacy is to succeed in
ways that we would like, we need to accord more attention to the tacit (if
incomplete) knowledge that students already bring with them (p. 126).
In a rare empirical study, Strege (1996) commented in her qualitative dissertation:
Based on the dictates of the deficiency model, librarians focus on dumbing down
[emphasis from original] their curriculum instead of building on the strengths of
the students, which I found in this study include skepticism and resilience. . . .
Instead of teaching these skills in a reductive manner emphasizing pre-determined
mental models, critical pedagogy suggests that librarians recognize that students

67
know how to think but have not been encouraged to question assumptions and the
accuracy of truth claims in writing and in speech (pp. 189-190).
Kapitzke (2003) stated:
A high proportion of activities undertaken in school libraries are based on the
assumption that students lack something (that is, information), which only the
teacher or librarian can provide. Yet the role of the librarian as fact provider
[emphasis from original] is becoming obsolete (p. 47).
Swanson (2004b) viewed the deficit approach as a missed opportunity to engage
students, “We need to recognize that our students enter our classrooms with their own
experiences as users of information. This is a common ground from which we can enter
a discussion about using and finding information” (p. 264). In a second study he stated:
A critical pedagogical approach to information literacy would recognize that
students enter classrooms with their own experiences as information users. For
some students, this may be a simple recognition that CSPAN, CNN, and MTV are
different cable channels. Others will have a broader perspective, but in either
case, students must be given the opportunity to relate their experiences as
information users to their first attempts at college-level research (Swanson, 2004,
p. 74).
Jacobs and Berg (2011) further explained the limitations of a deficit approach:
Structuring information literacy instruction around the ACRL standards is rooted
in a problematic assumption that students are in a deficit position in terms of
information literacy: students lack the skills they need to complete assignments
and so librarians provide them with those skills. . . . When we teach information

68
literacy as a survival tactic [emphasis from original] we approach it as if it were a
problem that needs solving and, often, a problem with only one solution (p. 387).
Librarians employing critical pedagogy found in contrast to the deficit approach
that students had much to contribute to discussions about information:
Our patrons have been searching online for years, so to assume they know nothing
about information seeking is offensive and naïve. Giving these patrons detailed
instructions that directly contradict what they have been doing for years is not
going to help them or our image. Rather, we must encourage and acknowledge
the benefits of experimentation with library tools and demonstrate our
appreciation for learning from our patrons' approaches to searching. We must
also keep in mind that their online searching experience might differ from ours.
In the fragmented postmodern world where diversity and contradictions are
celebrated, differences do not make either librarians or patrons wrong. Instead,
by pointing out the differences between the search strategies of the librarian and
patron, the postmodern citizen can celebrate diversity and appreciate the
contradictions encountered in the information seeking process (Martin, 2009, p.
5).
Sinkinson and Lingold (2010) described their experiences integrating critical
information literacy into a first-year-experience course:
Fighting our urge to deposit knowledge, we are astounded by the quality of
student-generated ideas when we allow them to expand in an open-ended, nonjudgmental discussion. . . . Despite our initial skepticism, after taking a leap of
faith and testing out the student-led activity, we were thrilled to observe students

69
transforming into eager mini-experts who have a great deal to say about searching
with variant tools, investigating an author or source, limiting searches and
developing new keywords. Indeed the students began to build methods of critical
evaluation arriving at precisely the conclusions we previously had attempted to
drive home through our woefully inauthentic methods (p. 87).
Place the student at the center of instruction. A few researchers tackled the
complex context in which information literacy instruction occurs, describing multiple
influences that impede student-centered instruction. Swanson (2010) stated:
The significant challenge to a fully realized critical information literacy
perspective does not lie in convincing librarians, faculty members, administrators,
or professional organizations about the benefits of a critical approach, although
this is important. It lies with convincing our students by shifting the focus of
critical pedagogy toward student belief about knowledge and worldview (p. 266).
Another team of teaching librarians expressed, “The most imperative paradigm
shift for library instructors involves placing the individual, the researcher, at the center of
the research process rather than demanding that the researcher bend to a static and
arbitrary outcome” (Pankl & Coleman, 2010, p. 9).
Doherty (2007) explained:
Information literacy, rather, should be focused on the learner, not on the content .
. . but even if content were not the focus of information literacy, there would still
be a strong pull in the direction of the teacher, or in this instance the faculty
[instructor of record]. Their learning outcomes directs [sic] the library instruction
session. Take out the faculty, and milieu still pulls quite strongly, in that the

70
mode of delivery of information takes precedence. Unfortunately, this leaves the
student at the rear (pp. 3-4).
And speaking from his classroom experience, a teaching librarian described the
practical benefits of a student-centered classroom:
Incorporating the students’ own experience into lesson plans has a twofold
benefit. When students can find themselves and their own interests in the material
and concepts, the instruction is more likely to be relevant and engaging to them.
Also it brings the student and instructor onto a more equal footing. It says to the
student: what you know and what you experienced is relevant and important. It
says: I know something, you know something, so let’s work together to learn
more. Acknowledging this prior experience is a profound act of respect in the
classroom, and it is a small step toward equipping students with power to further
transform their own educational experience… (Peterson, 2010, p. 73-74).
Promote student agency. Many critical information literacy proponents focused
on the goal of student agency. Students do not simply absorb knowledge; they create
new knowledge and act upon it. As one teaching librarian said:
When students view themselves as agents – as creators of information – no longer
do they see their papers: as compilations of pieces of Truth [emphasis from
original] retrieved, evaluated, and used but rather as created works written with
the authority that flows from understanding information's political, social, and
economic dimensions (Patterson, 2009, p. 358).
Another stated, “A critical theory of IL seeks to engage students as active social
subjects charged with interrogating the social world and developing their own capacity

71
for informed questioning” (Cope, 2010, p. 25). Such an approach engages students
intellectually.
Pankl and Coleman (2010) surmised:
When students are taught they are, in fact, knowledge creators, they begin to
understand that they are responsible for producing the evidence [emphasis from
original] that will support their assertions. Thus students will learn that their ideas
and their opinions stand not in the shadow of others. Instead students will act as
agents of change and discovery. . . . By emphasizing students’ individuality,
creativity, and agency, teachers can help students interact with external
knowledge in a way that presents it not as superseding their understandings but as
intersecting and enriching them (p. 10).
In critical information literacy classrooms students are challenged to take an
active and discursive role in their interactions with information, “This agency entails both
new capacities to juxtapose, to ignore, to elide, to silence and to critique information that
doesn't appear to be relevant or valuable or interesting but as well new capacities to
produce, change, alter, relocate and transform these messages” (Luke & Kapitzke, 1999,
p. 480).
Ease the student transition into the academic community. Some theorists
envisioned a pivotal role for the critical information literacy librarian in helping students
fulfil their role in academia, or as Hubbard (1995) put it, “break into the disciplinary
ivory towers” (p. 446). Elmborg (2006) authored several studies in which he championed
the librarian’s role in supporting students as they strive to join academic communities:

72
Students who aspire to membership in academic communities must master both
the external style and the way of thinking to be initiated into a discipline.
Librarianship as a profession should develop strategies for helping students
master these styles and patterns of thinking (p. 196).
In another study Elmborg (2010) explained further:
The codes and discourses of academic communities (the college game or the
academic library game) can be learned if learners are assisted in joining the
communities. The process of exploring how this joining occurs is essential to
understanding a critical approach to information literacy. Critical information
literacy, or critical literacy, aims to bring as many newcomers into the game as
possible by assisting learners in developing understanding of the codes or
language of the academic discourse community. Democratic in impulse, critical
literacy seeks to empower rather than discipline, to raise up rather than rank, and
to include rather than exclude (p. 69).
And yet again in 2012 Elmborg described the role of a “critical information
literacy librarian”:
This librarian will recognize that being a literacy worker involves something other
than imparting skills. It involves connecting daily work with students, colleagues,
and institutions to larger ideological questions about who belongs in higher
education and how to make higher education as accessible as possible to
everyone. It involves putting ourselves on the level of students as co-questioners,
co-doubters, even co-dreamers. In short it involves an entire rethinking of the
relationship between librarian and student. . . . To be a critical information

73
librarian is to recognize that even with all our material success, there are those
who have yet to make it [emphasis from original] in a world that is subtly but
powerfully stacked against them. The critical information literacy librarian
chooses not to walk away from the challenge posed by that problem, which seems
to me the central educational and social problem of our time (p. 94).
Some critical information literacy proponents saw distinct advantages to the
librarian’s outsider role in terms of being able to help students become scholars.
Simmons (2005) contextualized librarian’s positioning within the academy:
Librarians are simultaneously insiders and outsiders of the classroom and of the
academic disciplines in which they specialize, placing them in a unique position
that allows mediation between the non-academic discourse of entering
undergraduates and the specialized discourse of disciplinary faculty. Academic
librarians, by the nature of professional preparation, have an interdisciplinary
perspective – that is, most academic librarians have an undergraduate degree in a
non-library-related discipline (English literature or sociology, for example), the
master of library science degree, and often a second master’s degree or doctoral
degree in another academic discipline. This interdisciplinarity provides librarians
an opportunity to see how discourses differ across disciplines, positioning them
uniquely and powerfully to help students recognize and make sense of the
disciplinary differences (p. 304-305).
Offering some practical classroom examples, Keer (2010), another teaching
librarian, capitalized on her outsider role:

74
Because the information literacy session often literally moves the student out of
the classroom and into a new environment with a new teacher, the traditional
interaction between teacher/librarian and student already has fault lines in it as
soon as the students arrive in the library. Rather than looking at this as an
obstacle, the librarian may, in her capacity [as] a secondary authority figure to the
professor, be able to encourage more flexibility in the ways her students interact
with her and with the material being discussed.
To capitalize on this disruption of the traditional classroom power structure, the
librarian could encourage the students to introduce her, as an outsider to their
classroom dynamic, to their classmates. She might ask students to introduce each
other, as a way of getting them to acknowledge each other’s presence in the
classroom. She may be able to enter into a dialog with the students about what
they are learning, and what they find most useful or problematic about the subject
matter, or about the project at hand. The librarian can use her status as a
classroom outsider to draw the students into interaction with each other, rather
than relying so heavily on [being] the authority figure at the front of the room.
This kind of mutual participation in the information literacy curriculum can enrich
the experience for all involved (p. 155).
Elmborg (2010) also commented on the librarian’s outsider role:
To operate in the literacy metaphor, librarians need to work on the boundaries of
their discourse communities, bringing new learners into the community by
helping them learn what information they need to function. To do this, librarians
need to locate themselves at the boundaries rather than in the centers. . . . The

75
future of libraries and librarianship cannot be between learners and information in
this way, but must be alongside learners, especially those who didn’t inherit
English school literacy…. (pp. 73-74).
Critical information literacy librarians design instruction that is meaningful
to students. Some critical information literacy scholars and practitioners offered some
practical advice for designing instruction that is meaningful to students. They suggested
instruction that is problem-or-question based in order to frame research as a process of
discovery. They also suggested that teaching librarians select research topics that are
meaningful to students’ personal lives. Critical information literacy librarians should
maximize opportunities for student interaction, and in order to do this, they must let go of
a strict agenda in the classroom. Finally, teaching librarians seeking to apply critical
approaches to information literacy were advised to use accessible language in instruction.
Design instruction that is problem-or-question-based. Kapitzke (2003) first
suggested that a critical information literacy approach should guide students to use a
series of questions to interrogate information. This model was expanded upon by several
critical information literacy librarians including Simmons (2005):
We need to communicate to students – both explicitly through explanation and
implicitly through modeling – that research is not about finding information or
facts, as most of the ACRL standards suggest, but instead that research is about
constructing meaning through active engagement with the ideas and asking
questions surrounding the information itself. Over and over, we need to ask
questions with our students such as ‘Who benefits from having this information
published and disseminated?’ ‘Whose voices are not represented in this research?’

76
and ‘What counts [emphasis from original] as knowledge in this discipline?’ We
need to model at the reference desk, in individual research consultations, and in
our instruction sessions that research is a process of discovery and of construction
of meaning instead of a process of accumulation of information. Reference work
needs to be more about helping students ask questions about information and less
about our delivering answers to questions. When we teach students information
literacy, we need to shift our orientation from a process of finding and gathering
(acts that imply an unambiguous body of information over which one can gain
mastery) to a process of discovery and knowledge construction (Simmons, 2005,
p. 308).
Many librarians felt that this interrogation of information was a useful
manifestation of Freire’s “problem-posing” model of instruction for the information
literacy classroom (Smyth, 2010, para. 4). For example, Swanson (2010) suggested:
The problem-posing approach suggested by critical information literacy practitioners
is enhanced when it is paired with ill-structured problems. I would suggest exercises
that seek to expose students’ beliefs about knowledge. On any given subject, the
following critical questions should be applied.


How do you know what you know?



What information do you trust?



What causes you to disagree with a piece of information?



What counts as expertise?



Who can publish on a specific issue?



Who cannot and why?

77


Whose voice is included/excluded?



What information is trusted by society? (p. 272).

Jacobs and Berg (2011) also suggested a curriculum based around Kapitzke’s
(2003) questions as expanded by Simmons (2005). They reflected:
In its focus on engaging with questions about information, critical information
literacy is an attempt to help students see that information questions are deeply
embedded within cultural, social, political, and economic contexts” (p. 389).
Citing student engagement as “the most pressing information literacy problem [emphasis
from original, they concluded:
Because we view this pressing information literacy problem not as a something
unwelcome, harmful or wrong that needs to be overcome but as a difficult or
demanding question, [emphases from original] we believe this is a question ripe
for problem-posing approaches within our classrooms, our meeting rooms, our
campuses, and our professional discussions (p. 390).
Elmborg (2006) suggested that by taking a “problem-posing approach”:
Information can then be redefined as the raw material students use to solve these
problems and to create their own understandings and identities, rather than as
something out there to be accessed efficiently, either in the library or in the world.
This educational process cannot be conveyed as content. It is, rather, a path or
journey [emphases from original] of intellectual growth and understanding (p.
198).
Norgaard (2004) suggested that teaching librarians frame information literacy as
“intellectual inquiry”:

78
Conceived of in this fashion, our pedagogies would see information literacy as a
means for asking better and better questions and for finding ever more persuasive
lines of reasoning, and not just as a way to cite factoids and ready answers (p.
224).
Similarly Cope stated:
A critical theory of IL . . . maintains that the development of students’ capacity to
pose thoughtful questions (as opposed to clear answers) is as important as their
ability to locate, access, organize, evaluate, and apply information in the research
process (p. 13).
Pankl and Coleman (2010) agreed, “The IL instructor must demonstrate that
research is not a process of answering questions, but rather a process of formulating
questions, ideas, and narratives (p. 11).
Some librarians felt that problem-based learning (PBL) was an ideal approach for
critical information literacy instruction. PBL “can be simply defined as using problems
as the basis for students’ learning” (Problem-based learning, 2010, para. 1). After
exploring some of the barriers teaching librarians face, such as lack of time and lack of
control over the curriculum, Kopp and Olson-Kopp (2010) suggested:
PBL provides an excellent example of how librarians have already overcome
some of the limit-situations described above. Students are encouraged to play
active roles and to enter into dialogue with their peers during their research
process rather than simply retrieve objects or gather sources (p. 63).
Peterson (2010) agreed:

79
As a methodology for critical pedagogy in library instruction, problem-based
learning (PBL) is a natural fit. PBL breaks down the traditional hierarchy of the
classroom and shifts the focus from lecture to active learning. It uses open-ended
questions to encourage exploration and independent conclusions. PBL assumes
that students come to the library classroom with previous experiences and builds
on them to develop new skills and knowledge. It is also a tidy way to incorporate
multiple skills and sources into the typical one-shot session (p. 72).
Use research topics that are meaningful to students. In order to engage students
several proponents of critical information literacy suggested that research topics should
have a political or controversial aspect. Others felt that student engagement could be
piqued by allowing topics that were more personally meaningful, even when they fall
outside the realm of academia. And a few, conversely, hinted that there are flaws in the
approach of allowing students to choose any topic and that alternative approaches might
be in order.
Asselin, Kymes, and Lam (2007) suggested, “Inquiries should be political and
provocative; there is no shortage of real issues for students to research. And the critical
and critical information literacies needs to be emphasized so that students know how to
uncover and reveal voices rarely heard (p. 15). In advocating a PBL approach, Peterson
agreed, “PBL questions should relate to the course content. If the course is
interdisciplinary, current events or controversial topics also work well. Good PBL
questions are open-ended enough for students to arrive at different conclusions based on
their research (p. 74).

80
Doherty (2007) similarly suggested that student research topics should have a
“political aspect” so that:
Even a cursory review of the conversation will reveal an oppressive voice.
Critical information literacy will uncover that voice and ask the student where she
would find the Other voices [sic]. Thus, websites, oral histories, student
interviews, personal stories, home made videos, ceremonial texts [emphasis from
original] and other resources could enter the dialogue the student is now
conducting between herself and society's assumptions (p. 6).
Other scholars and practitioners felt that students should be allowed to choose
topics of personal interest to them as a way to bridge their personal and academic worlds:
Too often there is a disconnect between the students’ conception of leisure and
education. By demonstrating the interconnectedness of the intimate and the
academic, IL [information literacy] instructors can engender an intellectual
curiosity within their students. Before any lessons about skills or objective facts
about the information universe are imparted, students’ curiosity must be whetted
and they must realize that the act of researching is authentic and representative of
their own selves (Pankle & Coleman, 2010, p. 9).
Keer (2010) shared this practical classroom example of how she incorporated
students’ sometimes-inappropriate topic suggestions into her pedagogy:
For example, [of how to engage with students] when the librarian asks the
students what topics they are interested in researching, some students may make
suggestions that sound sarcastic, or that are aimed at challenging the librarian’s
authority. If the librarian takes these comments in a spirit of fun, rather than

81
reacting defensively, and acknowledges the student’s contribution to the
discussion by drawing him further into it, rather than shutting him out, these
throw-away [emphasis from original] comments can enhance the feeling of
community in the classroom….
When my students suggest topics that could be considered inappropriate, such as
celebrity sex scandals, or topics I’m not expert on, such as hip hop culture, I use
the opportunity to acknowledge that I don’t know a lot about those topics and to
emphasize that research is for learning about things you don’t understand or aren’t
familiar with yet. Following through on these topics for demonstration purposes
also reinforces the idea that research skills can be used for things students care
about on a personal level, as well as more task-oriented topics (p. 157).
Mirtz (2010) agreed:
Most libraries provide research guides or fliers on every discipline and academic
major, to guide students in the absence of a human intermediary. But few or none
of the fliers are on topics of interest to students, such as hunting, extreme sports,
or the latest celebrity scandal. These are not scholarly topics but they give
librarians the opportunity in the disintermediated environment that the flier
operates in, to model effective and efficient research processes, including
evaluating sources and asking critical questions about issues. . . . Whenever
students have to eliminate topics of primary interest to them or adapt topics to fit
what they can find literature on (such as switching from the topic of deer baiting
to bovine tuberculosis) instead of pointing students to other professional sources
of information (such as Department of Natural Resources reports on stakeholders’

82
meetings about deer hunting regulation changes), the library has missed the
chance to intermediate with users in a critically supportive way. The search
process then fails to engage a citizen in a collective process or in ethical questions
that could alter the status quo. The library hasn’t encouraged or provided a
challenge to disintermediation, but encouraged failure . . . The library has thus, in
this situation, failed to help the students negotiate the movement between
scholarly, individual, and public spheres, nor to create a conversation among the
data created by researchers, the values a student brings from home, and the
potential to enact change in the world (pp. 301-302).
A few critical information literacy practitioners disagreed, arguing that students
may need more structure and support in choosing a research topic. In her qualitative
research study, Strege (1996) analyzed student research journals and concluded:
I also found that students did not find library research interesting or intrinsically
valuable even when they selected their own research topic. Selecting topics of
personal interest accords with a precept of critical pedagogy which states that the
instructor ground all assignments on the students’ own interests and experiences.
However, this personal interest was insufficient motivation for students to persist
in completing the final paper. Every student found just enough materials to
satisfy the assignments requirements and perceived collecting the materials and
writing about the self-selected research question as a boring, alienating
experience…. (pp. 186-187)
She met with more success when she provided more structure for student
research:

83
Even though these students did not consider their self-selected research projects
interesting enough to complete, I discovered that they engaged with materials that
I selected with their interests in the foreground. Following critical pedagogy
precepts, I did not use pre-determined curricula, but developed lesson plans and
selected materials only after I became aware of the consciousness and interests of
the students . . . developing the curriculum based on the students’ situations rather
than using pre-determined curriculum helped students make connections between
themselves and knowledge (p. 188).
Peterson (2010) agreed. An advocate for PBL as a vehicle to support critical
information literacy, she described two classes – one in which she provided topics, and
one in which she did not. She found that providing more structure helped the students
better engage with the session:
Students should have an annotated list of the sources the librarian wants them to
know and use for the assignment. This is especially important for first-year or
inexperienced students who would otherwise fall back on the tools they know
best, i.e., broad searches in Google, which don’t help them learn how to find
scholarly journal articles in a particular discipline or when to use subject-specific
encyclopedias . . .
Rather than letting students pick any topic, one should provide a short list to
choose from based on the course content. Without this structure, students may
spend an inordinate amount of time waffling about a topic, rather than focusing on
searching for information and evaluating its usefulness. This is especially
important with a 50-minute session (pp. 74-75).

84
Design opportunities for student interaction. Some critical information literacy
proponents explicitly discussed the need for student interaction in information literacy
sessions. Keer suggested teaching librarians “encourage and facilitate conversations
between students as an integral part of the classroom experience” (p. 153). Reale (2012)
noted:
To me liberation in the classroom means removing traditional constraints, such as
students having to sit and be lectured to (without the chance for participation) and
providing opportunity in the class (each of which should be a learning lab) to ask
questions of themselves and each other [emphasis from original]. . . . It is through
dialogue, relentless questioning, and the de-centralization of authority that a level
playing field is created where students are encouraged to express their own
thoughts and come to their own conclusions (pp. 85-86).
Peterson (2010) explained:
The efficiency of group work is well suited to the time constraints of the one-shot
session, but more importantly, groups allow students to share the work amongst
several people. A team-based approach encourages students to rely on and learn
from each other as they work through the assignment . . . From a critical
pedagogy standpoint, small, collaborative groups shift the locus of control in the
classroom from the teacher to the students (p. 75).
Pankl and Coleman (2010) agreed:
A rhetorical context is established when students are required to produce and
articulate their research within a dialogic community. Means by which this

85
context is established include requiring discussion, presentation, and other forms
of language-driven interaction with the researchers’ peers (p. 8).
Elmborg (2010) described the importance of peer interaction:
Having more advanced peers helps us learn more effectively than having very
advanced professors or teachers. Through conversation, we learn to “scaffold”
our ideas as we build or construct these ideas. Learners in libraries collaborate
with other learners to engage the information and research sources they encounter,
scaffolding and learning together (p.70).
Let go of the agenda. Some scholars and practitioners urged teaching librarians
to be flexible in the classroom and to resist the urge to try to cover too much content.
Such an approach was felt to open up space in the classroom for student voices. Reale
(2012) advised:
Do not be afraid to go off the program [emphasis from original]; often energy is
created in a class when the agenda is loosened and we respond to what the
students really need rather than what we think they should know. It is much
easier to be adaptable, however, if you are carefully prepared in the first place.
Surprise students by doing something they won’t expect. Allow them to take the
lead with idea generation and in-class discussion (p. 86).
Peterson (2010) offered similar advice about attempting PBL as a critical
approach to the design of library instruction:
In a traditional 50-minute library instruction session, PBL or not, one cannot be
overly ambitious, despite the often high expectations of instructors. For the
librarian attempting to incorporate critical pedagogy and PBL into her teaching,

86
an important first step is letting go of the temptation to cover as much material in
a single session as we know students need . . . (p. 74).
Sinkinson and Lineman (2010) explained how they ceded control of the agenda in
their re-visioning of the library seminar:
During the activity, the teacher-librarian is available for questions, but we make it
a point not to hover. We have found that maintaining a physical distance
encourages student leadership. It is important for students to be responsible for
their own searches, even if they encounter roadblocks. By approaching the
challenges without the aid of a librarian, students problem-solve, teach one
another, and become aware of the complexity of research and information
systems. This results in a more authentic learning experience (p. 84).
Some librarians described a balance between structure and flexibility in their
teaching:
There is an inherent struggle between this sort of teaching method and covering
the material in the time allotted. If students are to be involved and grow to be
independent learners, then we must work on finding the correct balance for a
given context (Swanson, 2004b, p. 267).
Another librarian in partnership with a composition instructor reflected:
Most of the problems we have encountered stem from the looseness of the class'
structure, and we are constantly looking for a way to balance what we call
structure and discovery. We want students to discover their own topics and their
own strategies for doing research. That forces them to take responsibility for their

87
own learning and the learning of their peers when they share their discoveries
(Isbell & Broaduss, 1995, p. 59)
Peterson (2010) explained, “A well-designed PBL lesson has enough structure for
students to stay focused and meet their learning objectives, but is still open-ended enough
for students to come to independent conclusions” (p. 74).
Use accessible language in instruction. Several critical information literacy
scholars and practitioners cautioned teaching librarians to be careful with the language
they use during instruction. Some felt that librarians’ depictions of information might be
overly-simplistic and misleading for students, while others felt that use of library and
academic jargon is off-putting to students. For example, Franks (2010) discussed
teaching about the “information cycle”:
We often describe the publishing mediums without probing the assumptions about
information flows that we make along the way: the very term information cycle,
in fact suggests to the researcher or student that it is a passive, neutral process,
like the water cycle or the cycle of seasons [emphases from original]. . . . Our
initial terminology, and certainly the way we describe the steps of creation and
publication of texts, reflects our own preconceptions of the process as something
so established and so ingrained in the way we talk about information that it takes
on an apolitical, manifest and predetermined quality . . . rather than the valueridden and strategic acts that the processes actually represent as information is
carefully situated at each level of this so-called cycle (p. 47).
Elmborg (2012) suggested:

88
The key to all practice/praxis is conversation: how we talk to other people;
whether we see people as learners struggling for meaning, respecting that struggle
and helping them scaffold; encouraging them to grow, develop, and challenge the
assumptions they hold as well as their given place in the world (p. 71).
He further cautioned:
Critical information literacy exists in relationships between people and
information rather than as an identifiable thing in its own right. As we begin to
engage the question of critical information literacy, it helps if we are careful with
our language, to make sure we avoid reducing complex processes to overly simple
concepts. The dynamism of critical information literacy needs to be reflected in
our language (p. 77).
Reflecting on his work with community college students, one teaching librarian
commented:
Giving voice means not only giving the students the opportunity to speak, but also
being aware, as an instructor, of one’s own speech patterns, word choice, and
attitude toward non-standard English in the classroom . . . The librarian can be
mindful of expressing concepts in ways that do not alienate students, and of
offering practical definitions of library jargon when it must be used (Keer, 2010,
p. 154-155).
Sinkinson and Lingold (2010) found it helpful to observe each other’s teaching in
order to keep “teacher-talk” in check:
Through co-observation and post-class discussions, we were able to identify
moments in the seminar when we reverted to a teacher-centered approach. We

89
became particularly conscious of our desire to expedite student discovery by
asserting authority and making directive comments. We listened for teacher-talk
that shut-down student participation and developed alternate language that
encourages dialog . . . (p. 86).
Research Question 2: Critical Information Literacy Content
Critical information literacy librarians teach about all types of information.
Many scholars and practitioners believed that librarians should spend more time teaching
about information itself, rather than tools and skills. They felt that students needed
explicit instruction about how information is created and organized and that instruction
would provide a useful introduction to academia. Many felt strongly that librarians
should avoid the temptation of imposing value judgments about types of information
sources by privileging peer-reviewed journal articles and other library sources over nonlibrary sources. Similarly, the temptation to teach about information in terms of format,
rather than type was eschewed (e.g., print v. online). Instead it was suggested that
librarians teach about information in terms of its intended purposes and how students
might make use of it to fill their own needs. Some librarians found it useful to use dialog
as a metaphor for the literature, framing the range of information about a particular topic
as a conversation that the student can be invited to join. A few cautioned that limiting
which sources of information students could use quashes criticality and student agency.
As an alternative they urged fellow librarians to embrace the range of information
available in the digital age, and to use nontraditional sources that the students are familiar
with, like Google and Wikipedia, as a way to engage students in conversations about
information and as a bridge to more traditional academic sources.

90
Teach about information. A substantial subset of studies about critical
information literacy advocated explicit teaching about information, as opposed to skills
and tools. The author of several studies that advocated this approach, Swanson (2004b)
explained, “Before we train students to use search tools, before we send them to books,
periodicals, or Web sites, we need to teach them about information. What is it? How is
it created? Where is it stored?” (p. 259).
Simmons (2005) felt that explicit teaching about information is necessary if
students are to understand the academic context of their own research:
Helping students to examine and question the social, economic, and political
context for the production and consumption of information is a vital corollary to
teaching the skills of information literacy. Additionally, facilitating students’
understanding that they can be participants in scholarly conversations encourages
them to think of research not as a task of collecting information but instead as a
task of constructing meaning (Simmons, 2005, p. 299)
Warren and Duckett (2010) shared a similar perspective, “Search skills must be
accompanied by a greater understanding of how scholarly information is created,
debated, vetted, stored, and accessed – issues intrinsically tied to scholarly
communication” (p. 355). They suggested a curriculum that would center on the
following “core variables”:
1. Who creates the information and for what audiences;
2. How the information is packaged and distributed;
3. Which technologies and tools are used to discover and access it; and

91
4. What the economic realities inherent in the preceding factors are (pp. 351351).
Elmborg (2006) suggested:
Students must learn how information functions in proof or argument, and why
that information is accepted while other information is not. Ultimately, students
need to produce information that meets the community’s standards. Faculty in the
various disciplines expects student work to reflect an understanding of their
disciplinary styles. Academic conventions reflect beliefs about how research
should be done, and how students’ work should be measured against these
standards. Information literacy, seen in this way, is more than a set of acquired
skills. It involves the comprehension of an entire system of thought and the ways
that information flows in that system (p. 196).
Avoid imposing value judgments on types of information sources. Many
proponents of critical information literacy found fault with teaching librarians for
presenting to students an overly-simplistic idea of information as falling into one of two
categories: good or bad, with library sources such as peer-reviewed journal articles
unquestionably falling in the former. This approach of privileging library materials was
felt to discourage criticality and student agency. Instead, teaching librarians were
encouraged to teach students to critically examine the context of each piece of
information no matter the source. Librarians were also encouraged to be more accepting
of non-library sources that the students might wish to employ in their research. For
example, Cope (2010) envisioned critical information literacy instruction as “a move
away from the demonstration of technical search processes and simplistic claims that

92
certain sources are authoritative [emphasis from original] because authorizers have
decided they are” (p. 25).
Another team of teaching librarians stated:
The rise of free Open Access journals, preprint servers, Google Scholar, and
Google Books has rendered ineffective the instructional strategy of teaching
students that library equals good information and free Web equals untrustworthy
information [emphases from original]. As librarians, we know that the situation is
much more complex and we have a responsibility to incorporate this murkier
landscape into our instruction.
We believe that a realistic consideration of how library subscription based
resources and regular search engines function should center not on simplistic and
increasingly inaccurate dichotomies . . .” (Warren & Duckett, 2010, pp. 351-352).
In general critical information literacy scholars and practitioners felt that teaching
librarians who privileged peer-reviewed resources over other types of resources framed
information literacy in an inauthentic manner that was out of synch with the reality of the
digital age. Doherty (2007) criticized:
Multi-literacies recognize the values of all forms of literacy as coming from a
variety of community definitions. Therefore, applied to the academy,
demonstrated literacy can come from virtually any source. In higher education,
however, information literacy is still limited to a conservative tradition of peerreviewed, print-based resources (p. 4).

93
He offered a case of how a teaching librarian might misstep even when trying to
incorporate non-library resources. Using an example from the literature, he described an
assignment which required students to use Google:
In one instance a librarian worked with faculty to design an assignment in which
the students were asked to use Google. However, they were then asked to
evaluate Google in print-based terms, where the latent assumption was that
Google was worse than a journal article . . . The students were not asked to
evaluate the content of the information they found, or even to evaluate that
content from a critical perspective that would have, for example, asked them to
consider the different voices Google has presented them with” (p. 4).
In an earlier study Doherty and Ketchner (2005) described an introductory course
to the university they team taught as instructors of record:
In this class we were able to redirect our focus based on the control we gave to the
students to their concepts of forms of information and all forms of information
sources. It may be somewhat heretical to say it, but when we say all forms of
information, we do mean all forms, up to and including the usenet, web, blogs,
and emerging information resources. The students forced us to ask ourselves
some very hard questions, and these began to inform the theory of the empowered
intentional learner we had been working from. And these questions began to
inform our classroom and library practice. For example: we wondered why
librarians should limit students to only library-sponsored resources? Even in our
own day-to-day, personal information activities, do we limit ourselves to just
Academic Search Premier? Or do we also use Google? Librarians, we hope, are

94
literate information consumers – we know how to effectively get the quality
information we need from the many and diverse resources available to us. If our
intentional learner is empowered to do the same, why stand in her way? (p. 7)
As an example of how librarians can incorporate a broader range of non-library
resources, Jacobs (2010) incorporated the discussion pages associated with topics in
Wikipedia into her information literacy instruction in order to help students understand
how knowledge is created and debated:
Telling students not to use Wikipedia [sic] and to accept our judgments
unquestioningly does not model or encourage the kinds of critical thinking we
want our students to learn and practice. This is not to say that librarians and
professors need to encourage or allow the use of Wikipedia [sic]. Rather we need
to allow room in our classes and curriculum for critical inquiry into our
information sources be they subscription databases, university press monographs,
librarian-selected websites or Wikipedia [sic] (p. 193).
She concluded:
Whether we like it or not Wikipedia [sic] is here to stay . . . many of our students
know they will need to negotiate questions related to Wikipedia [sic] and other
similar resources in their lives outside of school. We are doing them a disservice
if we ignore the complexities of Wikipedia [sic]. . . . Further, we need to think
about the message we sent to students when we banish, forbid, or ignore a
resource in our classes that is firmly of their generation in favor of promoting
resources of previous generations.

95
In a similar vein, Sinkinson and Lingold (2010) explained their philosophy with
regard to avoiding value judgments about types of information sources with the goal of
promoting criticality and class discussion in a first year college experience course,:
We want students to be aware of their information agency and to understand the
impact of source selections, but we avoid making value judgments about the
sources students select in the activity. Issues of academic authority are often
brought up in discussion, and while we encourage these topics, we try to remain
neutral. We do not advocate a blind preference for peer-reviewed publications,
nor do we dismiss the value of popular sources. We want students to become
critically sensitive to issues of legitimacy and power within information systems
and environments. Imposing traditional evaluation criteria or norms of authority
would contradict our intention to advance students’ critical examination of
information (p. 86).
Another librarian used the historical example of tablets discovered at ancient
libraries as a metaphor for the hindrances of access to information that occur when
librarians discount some information resources in favor of others on behalf of the student:
The unspoken effect of the [library] catalog, that of privileging information within
it, whether for a Hittite priest or a community college student, must be
acknowledged as well. All too often students' first visit as undergraduates to an
academic library includes messages about the superiority of peer-reviewed
articles, a certain disdain on the part of their professors for encyclopedias, the
extremely dubious quality of the free Internet as opposed to the proprietary
databases to which the library subscribes, and the absolute unworthiness of

96
Wikipedia [sic], even, with some professors, as a starting point. The message
given to college students must be similar to that to the priests of Nippur and
Hattusas – here are kept the rituals, here, etched into these tablets, are the sources
of information that you can trust. . . .
This disqualification of certain kinds of information, while detrimental to all
college students, is particularly debilitating to community college students, who
frequently arrive at college underprepared to engage in scholarly discourse but
who often have had all sorts of other powerful information literacy experiences –
as immigrants persistently negotiating a maze of community resources, as
consumers shrewdly maneuvering through complex networks to procure
affordable services and goods, as employees tenaciously seeking work and
evaluating conflicting sources of information to get ahead economically . . . Such
students' success in community college depends partly on learning about IL
[information literacy] in ways that respect the rich knowledge they bring with
them from these experiences (Patterson, 2009, pp. 356-357).
Teach about types of information not formats. In a similar vein, librarians were
encouraged not to teach about information in terms of format, but rather to teach about
types of information. Burkholder (2010) argued that librarians need to spend more time
teaching students to differentiate between types of information. He questioned:
What are sources [emphasis from original]? We speak of them quite often,
instructing students how to locate sources, evaluate sources, select sources, and
use sources. We use the term unquestioningly, as if its definition was obvious and
its utility proven. But what exactly are they? As a term, it is a generic

97
classification that encompasses an impossibly broad range of material;
encompassing countless information types, and formats. There is little indication
of the varying quality and content a student may discover. By meaning so much,
it means very little. The term describes an idealized version of reality and cannot
account for the overwhelming complexity of the information environment; nor
can it possibly illuminate the rhetorical nature of sources (p. 2).
He advocated the use of genre theory to improve students’ abilities to differentiate
between types of sources. Genre theory is related to critical theory and is “used to
characterize groups of similar texts that share certain recognizable conventions and that
belong in the same literary tradition” (Türkkan, 2011, para. 1). Burkholder (2010)
reflected:
For reasons that appear to be born out of convenience and expedience, most
attempts to define sources do so by describing aspects of their physical natures.
Due to our increasingly digital environment, these kinds of definitions are
becoming much more difficult to defend. . . . The larger problem with definitions
that focus on sources as mere objects is that they neglect their significance as
communicative acts (p.2).
Swanson (2007) also cautioned against defining sources by their physical formats:
Librarians need to present them [students] with the information landscape and
give them the ability to make judgments about particular pieces of information
and about appropriate information tools. This model must reflect the ways in
which information is created in society. In order to meet these needs, librarians
and instructors need to present students with a model of the information world

98
that focuses on the type of information rather than the format (book, Web site,
periodical, etc.) (p. 323).
In an earlier study he offered this example:
An article from Newsweek may exist in print, it may be on the Newsweek Web
site, and it may appear in a subscription database . . . it is the same article in all
three formats, for all intents and purposes. For a searcher, the concern should be
that this is a news article, and the fact that it is news tells us something about the
credibility of the information. This information would be different than
information found in a scholarly publication, in a professional/trade publication,
or on a personal website (Swanson, 2004b, pp. 262-263).
Swanson (2004b) detailed a two-part lesson plan intended to help students
differentiate between types of sources:
In these two sessions, students come to see that information formats (books,
articles, Web pages, etc.) are less important than the types of information these
formats contain. It is the type of information, not the container (format), that
determines the credibility and, therefore, relevance to an information need. Even
though some types of information are more common in particular formats (i.e.,
news is most commonly found in articles), it is theoretically possible that all of
the types of information could be published in any format (p. 267).
Jacobs and Jacobs, 2009 offered this classroom example of how to help students
recognize how their information needs vary according to their information need:
Groups were then asked to select one trend and identify what kinds of information
would best suit their needs. When students discussed these needs with the whole

99
class, it became apparent that, although all groups were addressing the same topic,
each trend required specific kinds of information. Some might need statistical
data, others might need ethnographic research, others would need to consult the
local newspaper, and others needed peer-reviewed articles or scholarly studies (p.
78).
Teach about information in terms of purposes and uses. Some critical
information literacy librarians found it effective to teach students about information in
terms of its purpose of publication, and in some cases the students’ purpose in accessing
the information. Anderson (2006), another advocate for using genre theory in
information literacy instruction, argued:
Information literacy must be grounded in an understanding of how the documents
stored in the information system one uses are produced as a result of some generic
communicative activities in society. Documents argue from a variety of
perspectives for certain intentions, ideas, conceptions, or theories and produce
arguments and knowledge claims on the basis of this and the documents’
sociopolitical function in society (p. 225).
Burkholder (2010) agreed:
Traditional definitions cannot fully describe the ideological components of
sources. . . . a more dynamic and robust definition of sources is needed.
Modern genre theory may provide us an answer by bridging the gap between what
a form really is and what it is actually designed to do. In this theory, genre is no
longer solely about the traditional classes of literary texts or other forms of art. It
is about how people use language to accomplish specific tasks (p. 2).

100
He concluded:
An effective and efficient research strategy is worthless, if students cannot
effectively and efficiently use the sources they located. Organized by content
types and forms, sources are familiar, but ultimately limited in their ability to
represent the variety and complexity of potential purposes students may
encounter. As organized by the social acts they perform, sources are something
much more daunting, but much more promising in their ability to prepare students
for actively living in an information-rich environment (pp. 8-9).
One team of scholars theorized about the pedagogical value of teaching students
about information in terms of its purpose and their own use of that information:
Even if (and frequently when) the best search techniques are not used, finding
information is usually a brief, if oft repeated, event in a student’s life. One cannot
expect these events to have a significant impact on the student’s attitude. . . .
Evaluating what others have done to information and what one might, in turn, do
with it, comprise less superficial and more integrative tasks that, if repeated, can
contribute to a process of intellectual growth that can have an impact on a
student’s attitude and research (Harley, Dreger, & Knoblock, 2001, pp. 27-28).
A few teaching librarians shared techniques for helping students understand that
the same piece of how information is shaped by the purpose of the author or need of the
student. Jacobs and Jacobs (2009) described their collaboration aimed at “transforming
the one-shot library instruction session” in an English 101 course (p. 72):
Thinking about how to teach IL [information literacy] in composition brings
information – not disciplinary concerns – to the forefront, especially because

101
students are asked to devise and select their own topics. How, for example, could
we talk about what makes for appropriate [emphasis from original] research
sources when the most appropriate source for one student’s topic will be Rolling
Stone and another’s might be statistical information from the Government of
Canada’s website. We could not say, for example, ‘only use peer reviewed
articles or scholarly monographs’ since, for many topics like iPods or parkour,
monographs or peer-reviewed articles simply do not exist (p. 76).
They reflected on their pedagogy:
Instead of teaching rules and predetermining what sources of information were
appropriate for their topics, we realized teaching a highly flexible and reflexive
research process would better help students develop critical habits of mind
regarding their topic’s specific information requirements (p. 76).
Swanson (2004b) offered this practical example of teaching about research in
terms of the researchers’ need in his case study of a two-part information literacy session:
The second librarian-led class session, Defining Relevance and Credibility,
addresses objective one, defining the information need, and objective three,
identifying the value of information in various formats. This session begins with
a general discussion of credibility and relevance led by the librarian. The students
again divide into their groups of four or five and review the same sources that
they saw in the previous session. Each group is given a unique scenario and
asked to determine the credibility and relevance of each source based on the
scenario. The scenarios are as follows:

102


You are an OB GYN nurse recently assigned to a new medical team that
does not include a genetic counselor. You think such an expert is a
needed addition to your team. Which articles would you use to support
your argument?



You are a journalist writing an article on genetic counselors for the South
Town (a Chicago newspaper). Which articles would you consult for
background information?



You and a spouse have an appointment with a genetic counselor. Which
sources would you consult for information on the genetic counseling
profession?



You and your best friend have a bet about what genetic counselors do.
What source would you use to settle the bet?



Your eighth-grade cousin needs information for a science project on
genetic counseling. Which articles would you recommend to your cousin?
(Swanson, 2004b, p. 266)

Swanson’s activity was clearly designed to help students understand information needs
vary according to the researcher’s purpose and provides some basis for helping students
understand why they might be asked to use different types of sources in their academic
work than their personal lives.
Teach information as dialog. Some critical information literacy advocates
presented students with the metaphor of information sources as a dialog about the topic at
hand. Such a metaphor sets the stage for students to join the conversation. Commenting

103
on the influence of the digital age on traditional information literacy, Kapitzke (2003)
described the shift in how student researchers make use of information:
Within the present context of an information glut, librarians and users spend their
time not so much searching but interpreting, filtering, and value-adding by
creating relationships among ideas across a range of media. Librarian and
cybersearcher cooperate not to locate a particular text to meet a specific need, but
to associate or relate texts that become meaningful through specific, taskdependent criteria. Locating discrete bits of information contained in a particular
text is no longer the aim of the exercise. Rather, the purpose of their textually
mediated contact is to add epistemological value through connecting and cohering
seemingly unrelated texts and ideas. The proliferation of chaotic digital
information, and the increasing disparity of end-point textual products and
knowledges have created a situation where knowledge is located not so much in
text as such, but in the coconstruction of situated meanings among learner,
teacher, and media center specialist [librarian] (p. 48).
Writing from a genre theory perspective, Anderson (2006) compared the process
of doing research to that of writing:
Similar to a writing activity that takes place within a discourse community, this
also applies to information seekers. Their activity also takes places within a
discourse community with particular historically, socially, and culturally
developed conventions. The discourse communities and their conventions make
up the frames for the objective search possibilities. In the very concrete situation
one might therefore say that the information seeker is placed in a kind of

104
rhetorical situation, as the information seeking activity must be considered part of
a larger communicative activity . . . It is rather likely that what constitutes and
motivates the information seeking activity is both a search for and production of
argument. The information needed is going to be used in some sort of
communicative activity and the determination of the information relevant to this
activity is therefore also based on an argument. The information seeker is, we
must assume, presented with an audience he is going to confront with the
information gathered. Information also has a topic that needs to be shaped in
accordance with how it is going to be used (p. 224).
Kopp and Olson-Kopp (2010) agreed:
Inasmuch as research involves the exchange of words by people in particular
situations, it is a form of dialogue. Students may be unaware of the dialogic
quality of the sources they use, but the researcher, theorists, and practitioners who
produce them generally are not. A student may view a source as an absolute
authority to which they must passively defer, as the in the banking model of
education, or they may view it as an embodied voice in a conversation, one that
occupies a position in space and time and thus a political perspective in relation to
real problems in the world. Librarians are not in a position to notice the
difference between banking and problem-posing kinds of research if they see
themselves merely providing materials to students, delivering items from point A
to point B (p. 57).
Do not limit sources – make use of sources students are familiar with. Some
proponents of critical information literacy frowned upon the practice of limiting the

105
sources that students can use in their research. Instead, they found that embracing the
diversity of sources available to students and using “unconventional texts” spurred
student engagement and agency (Accardi, Drabinski, & Kumbier, 2010, p. vi).
Permitting students to use the sources of their choosing allowed them to find information
that was more relevant to their individual topics and needs and created a common ground
for discussion about source differentiation. Martin (2009) described the tendency of
librarians:
to direct people away from chaos and toward our subject-specific databases, our
lovingly maintained reference collections, and our carefully-crafted catalogs.
While this can no doubt help patrons, especially with their academic research,
guiding students away from chaos and to tools to which they will not have
lifelong access contradicts the goals of information literacy and undermines
mastery of important skills in patrons' lives. Library instruction should help
students develop lifelong information literacy skills. Knowing how to use
databases will not make you information literate, and avoiding chaos does not
help you harness the power of information. Instead of guiding patrons in an openended exploration through the universe of information, too often the library plays
the part of the overprotective parent. By acknowledging and employing the chaos
of the Internet in library instruction, we can encourage information literacy while
embracing postmodernism. Information literacy is about exploration, not
information control (p.6).
As an alternative approach, Martin suggested:

106
We can embrace the chaos of the information universe by adopting new
technologies such as social bookmarking, wikis, blogs, and video sharing sites to
support our teaching. Students often already know how to use and manipulate
these technologies, but they may lack the skills to interpret the information that
they retrieve critically. How do people share information? How does the medium
change the content? Who will save this information? Is it important? Web-based
technologies can be used in activities in class or to spur class discussions based on
these questions. Librarians can use Wikipedia in library instruction sessions to
initiate discussion and debate over the nature of information, truth, and reality on
the web (p. 6).
Burkholder (2010), who taught from a genre theory perspective, agreed:
As we begin to teach sources as genres, we must also gain a better understanding
of how – or if – students select sources for their rhetorical value. Rather than
looking only at citations, choices need to be evaluated within the context of
students' actual work. We should not assume that all of their choices are careless.
. . . There are times when Web sites may be rhetorically appropriate. Thus, the
inclusion of Web sites in a bibliography is not an automatic indication of poor
source-quality or a careless research strategy (pp. 8-9).
Similarly, Warren and Duckett (2010) argued:
This article focuses on teaching students about peer-reviewed journal literature,
certainly one of the types of information most frequently required for the
completion of college assignments. It argues that a critical component of teaching
students about peer-reviewed articles and how to find them is deconstructing how

107
subscription-based resources such as article databases relate to and complement
the search tools that students use more frequently—Google and Wikipedia (p.
351).
They concluded:
In the contemporary information landscape, simply teaching students how to
distinguish peer-reviewed from non-peer-reviewed research is not sufficient.
Instead, a broader discussion of scholarly communication and the economics of
information will provide a useful, critical framework for learning about how
academic research relates to the everyday search tools that students use – Google,
Google Scholar, and Wikipedia (p. 355).
Mirtz (2010) also viewed the use of web sources as, “a shared ground for starting
social relationships and a much more engaged instructional session” (p. 299).
In critiquing their former teaching style, Sinkinson and Lingold (2010) said:
While most students lacked academic research experience, they had a great deal
of familiarity with popular search engines such as Google, but we did not invite
them to reflect upon these past experiences in such a way as to make it
transferable to the academic setting. By discouraging this connection, we denied
an opportunity to validate student knowledge and to encourage meaningful
participation. (p. 82).
They offered a practical example of a group activity that incorporated Google and
guided students to compare and contrast Google with more traditional academic sources:
The activity is designed to draw out the students’ experience, knowledge and
reflection in order to bring a sense of relevance and meaning, which we believe to

108
be imperative to student engagement. By using Google as a core component of
the activity, we are able to bridge known and foreign information systems,
legitimating and exercising background student experience. We find that students
are able to conceptualize information systems more effectively through an
analysis of a familiar interface such as Google, and that by validating the
importance of the popular search engine, the classroom content becomes more
applicable for the students (p. 85).
Yoder (2003) lauded the availability of “local narratives” on the web and
suggested that nontraditional sources present a teaching opportunity for librarians:
Analyzing local narratives – the communities from which they come, the
languages they use, and the values they put forth – ultimately generates a more
satisfying library teaching and learning experience, incorporates a wide variety of
voices and formats, and de-emphasizes order and control, valuing instead
discovery, creation, and the search itself (p. 385).
A few critical information literacy librarians found the discussion pages of
Wikipedia to be a useful tool for teaching about how information is produced, as well as
engaging students in the classroom. Jacobs (2010) explained:
Because most of our students have a pre-existing relationship with Wikipedia [sic]
before they enter the classroom, many of them feel more than willing and able to
be “critical co-investigators’ of the Wikipedia problem [emphasis from original].
Wikipedia [sic] thus is a topic replete with opportunities to engage students as
active participants within evolving discussions and debates related to information

109
literacy and the production and dissemination of scholarly information and
knowledge (p. 186).
She described how she incorporated Wikipedia into her library instruction
session:
One way that this critical inquiry could be brought into classes is to have students
compare a Wikipedia [sic] entry with an entry from a reputable scholarly
reference work and discuss the differences between the two articles in terms of
content, reliability, authority, and accuracy. . . . Asking critical information
literacy questions of Wikipedia [sic] – a resource most students use and feel
comfortable with – opens a door to asking other probing questions about other
information sources, be it an Oxford University Press reference work or an open
access digital archive. These kinds of questions remind us not to be passive
consumers of scholarly information and demand that we think critically about all
kinds of information resources. Such a shift will help to illustrate to students that
the production and dissemination of scholarly information is an active and
evolving venture involving numerous decisions and choices, qualities that are
often obscured by the fixed appearance of the printed page (pp. 187-189).
Martin (2009) also used the discussion pages behind Wikipedia entries in his
instruction:
For example, in an introductory composition class, I collaborated with an
instructor to create a lesson plan that uses Wikipedia as a topic selection tool. In
order to find a topic for a persuasive paper, students are instructed to search for
topics of interest in Wikipedia and explore the discussion behind the encyclopedic

110
entry. Each Wikipedia article includes additional information in the form of a
discussion page and an article history page. These pages detail what changes
have been made to the article, why these changes have been made, and future
questions the article should explore. Students must consider what the discussion
sections for their articles reveal not only about their topics, but also about the
nature of information on the web. Taking this meta [emphasis from original]
view and looking behind the scenes in Wikipedia invites students to think
critically about their topic in the context of a familiar websites (p.6).
Chapter Summary
Almost all of the studies critiqued or criticized traditional approaches to
information literacy. Advocates agreed that traditional information literacy overlyfocused on tools and skills. Traditional information literacy also presented an overlysimplistic model of the research process that is out of synch with the reality that research
is a non-sequential, iterative, and messy process. Most called the ACRL Information
Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education and other definitions of
information literacy to account for over-emphasis on tools-and-skills-based approaches.
Some also held accountable the design and focus of traditional research paper
assignments. Various voices from the literature negatively described traditional
approaches to information literacy as technical, mechanical, behavioral, strategic, and
skills-based; while positively describing critical information literacy as a critical,
problem-posing, multi-dimensional, creative, intellectual, process-based approach to
support student agency.

111
In terms of pedagogy, critical information literacy scholars and practitioners
called upon teaching librarians to embrace new roles for themselves and their students.
They were advised to give up their own authority and expertise in the classroom; build
upon students’ existing knowledge about information; place the student at the center of
instruction, and use their own peripheral role in academia as an opportunity to help
students transition into academia.
The literature revealed some practical advice about how to design instruction that
is meaningful to students by incorporating problem-or-question based instruction; using
research topics and examples that are meaningful to students’ personal lives; promoting
student interaction; letting go of the classroom agenda in order to create space for student
interaction; and using accessible language in instruction.
In terms of content, the literature recommended that teaching librarians teach
explicitly about all types of information; avoid imposing value judgments on types of
information sources; teach about information in terms of its purposes and uses; teach
information as dialog; and do not limit sources – instead make use of sources students are
familiar with as a bridge from their personal lives into academia.
Figure 6 presents on overview of these findings.

CHAPTER FIVE: DISCUSSION

The purpose of this study was to review and synthesize the literature about critical
approaches to teaching information literacy to undergraduate students. Its aim was to
discern curriculum and pedagogy that individual teaching librarians can use to improve
their teaching practice.
The chapter begins with a conceptual discussion of the findings, which explores
implications for practice. It is organized around the two research questions:
1. What pedagogies should individual teaching librarians who wish to promote
critical information literacy employ?
2. What content should individual teaching librarians who wish to promote critical
information literacy teach?
Next, the chapter continues with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of
this study and recommendations for future research.
Traditional Information Literacy versus Critical Information Literacy
Four themes emerged from the analysis. The first was an overarching theme that
attempted to distinguish critical information literacy from traditional approaches. Using
key descriptive terms derived from the author’s own words, a general picture emerged
that described critical information literacy as a problem-posing, multi-dimensional,
creative, intellectual, process-based approach intended to support student agency, as
opposed to a traditional technical, mechanical, behavioral, strategic, skills-based
approach.

114
Several proponents of critical information literacy advanced the somewhat
startling idea that traditional approaches to teaching information literacy may actually
inhibit, rather than support, students’ development of information literacy. They posited
that an overly-simplistic, skills-and-tools based approach stripped information of its
context and thus did very little to promote student criticality. This idea is reason enough
for teaching librarians to re-examine their pedagogy to determine if the methods they
employ in the classroom are actually supporting the long-term goals of information
literacy beyond student acquisition of tools and skills.
Another challenge that emerged from this theme is that the research paper
assignment, which drives much library instruction, may also be counter-productive to
information literacy. As some of the studies pointed out, research paper assignments that
are product-driven rather than process-driven, “tend to collapse what should be a rich
process of compositional invention and intellectual inquiry into a lock-step sequence that
focuses on selecting, narrowing, and outlining a subject” (Norgaard, 2003, p. 127).
Unfortunately, there is little most individual teaching librarians can do about the design
of research paper assignments other than offer advice to instructors of record who
typically design the assignment. One taken-for-granted tenet of teaching librarianship is
to always ground the session in the course research assignment with the goal of
integrating information literacy into course instruction (Rockman, 2004). However, if the
assignment itself is flawed and out of the teaching librarian’s control, it may make sense
to consider alternative approaches to the information literacy session when possible. This
idea will be further explored within the context of the research questions below.

115
Research Question 1: Critical Information Literacy Pedagogy
Critical information librarians embrace new roles for themselves and
students. The aim of this research was to benefit individual teaching librarians, so it was
important to discern advice from the literature about factors that individuals can control.
As such, one of the more accessible findings was the call for new roles for librarians and
students, which has more to do with perspective than material changes. Essentially this
theme calls for praxis, which is the development of a critical consciousness about one’s
own teaching that connects theory and practice (Praxis, 2007). To accomplish the
perspective called for in the critical information literacy literature, teacher librarians must
be self-aware of their attitudes toward their own authority and expertise and toward
students. Such a shift is necessary if teaching librarians are to set the tone for instruction
that builds student criticality and agency.
Many teaching librarians are likely to reject the notion that they should give up
their authority and expertise. Expertise is highly valued by librarians, and many
librarians strive to model their expertise for students with the idea that students can then
emulate it (Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2001). In my own experience librarian expertise
seems welcomed by students at the graduate level and upper level disciplinary classes.
However, this study focused on the teaching of undergraduate students. Most of the
studies under review discussed teaching beginning or non-traditional students. Several
voices from the literature made a compelling argument that ceding expertise and
authority opens up space for student agency and engagement, inviting students to become
contributors to academia.

116
When I have ceded expertise and authority to students in the undergraduate
information literacy classroom, my experiences aligned with the experiences critical
information literacy scholars and practitioners described – there are many ways to impart
expertise to students without flaunting it. When I let students take the lead in
demonstrating their own expertise, my information literacy sessions led to interesting,
productive discussions that elicited student engagement and allowed plenty of
opportunity for me to offer expertise in response to the issues that the students raised.
This theme challenges teaching librarians to take a risk, what Sinkinson and Lingold
(2010) aptly describe as a “leap of faith” (p. 87) – to trust that students have something of
value to contribute. Like Sinkinson and Lingold, by rejecting a deficit approach, I too
have been “astounded by the quality of student-generated ideas” and find that students
arrive “precisely the conclusions we previously had attempted to drive home through our
woefully inauthentic methods” (Sinkinson and Lingold, 2010, p. 87).
Perhaps unsurprisingly, given librarian stereotypes, most librarians are introverts
(Scherdin, 2002). It may be impractical for many to cede authority and expertise to
students in favor of interaction with students. It is possible that that authority and
expertise shield introverted librarians from the very interaction that critical pedagogy is
designed to promote. Peterson’s (2010) observation in support of this theme was
striking:
[A] side effect of this lecture-demonstration, cram-it-all-in approach is distance.
When I teach this way, I don’t have to engage with the students beyond a
superficial level. It’s all show and tell on my part with no discussion or active

117
reflection with the group. I am the expert at the podium in the front of the
classroom and the students are the passive receptacles (p. 71).
There very well may be a mismatch between the self-perception of librarians and the
modern requirements of the job itself, which increasingly includes more teaching
responsibilities (Walter, 2008). Citing Wilson, Walter described the stereotype of a
librarians as “someone who is (among other things) introspective, socially conservative,
concerned with adherence to rules and regulations, orderly, and submissive to authority”
(p. 58). Or, as Patterson (2009) put it in support of this theme, “Librarians who view
their job as monitors of information and who prize the conventional LIS [library and
information science] framework of efficiency and effectiveness are probably the least
likely mentors for promoting the idea that knowledge is constructed” (p. 352)
The literature revealed several advantages to letting students demonstrate their
knowledge about information rather than telling them about it. Perhaps most compelling
was Martin’s (2009) argument in support of this theme that “to assume they [students]
know nothing about information seeking is offensive and naïve” (p. 5). Presuming that
student engagement, not alienation, is the goal of a pedagogically-sound instruction
session, it makes sense to “honor their experiences, and to build bridges from where they
are to new literacies,” as Elmborg (2010, p. 75) suggested. Teaching librarians should
seriously consider the suggestions from the literature about structuring information
literacy sessions in such a way that student experiences are the center of instruction,
because, as Peterson (2010) suggested, “When students can find themselves and their
own interests in the material and concepts, the instruction is more likely to be relevant
and engaging to them” (pp. 73-74).

118
This technique of honoring students’ existing knowledge may be particularly
important in an information literacy classroom that seeks to help students transition into
academia. The idea that librarians’ “outsider role” may be an advantage to their ability to
ally themselves with and benefit students was intriguing (Simmons, 2005, p. 304).
Increasingly, higher education is being called to account for student retention, especially
state run institutions (McLendon, Hearn & Deaton, 2006). In response, libraries have
successfully sought methods to demonstrate the value of library programs and services to
student attainment (Stone & Bryony, 2013). If, as the literature suggests, taking a critical
approach to information literacy instruction can ease student transition into academia,
then there is substantial motivation for teaching librarians to experiment with the
pedagogies called for by such an approach.
Critical information literacy librarians design instruction that is meaningful
to students. The concept that information literacy might “be more about helping
students ask questions about information and less about our delivering answers to
questions” (Simmons, 2005, p. 308) offers teaching librarians a subtle, but important shift
in perspective. Such an approach can be difficult when students are working on
individual research topics, as students’ topics are likely to vary widely as are their
questions. My own experience aligns with Strege’s (1996) and Peterson’s (2010) –
students need a balance between structure and discovery in topic selection. Problembased learning (PBL), an alternative approach suggested by several scholars and
practitioners, is attractive because problems can be built around topics that are
meaningful to students and can be grounds for an interactive discussion in the classroom
around a common-information-based problem. PBL also lends itself to group work.

119
Perhaps most importantly, PBL offers individual teaching librarians more control over
the instruction session than the traditional assignment-based approached. Using PBL can
help librarians mitigate the possible harmful effects of poorly-designed, product-based
research assignments by presenting a lesson that is supportive of, but not solely based on
the assignment.
This isn’t to say that teaching librarians can afford to ignore poorly-designed
research assignments. This issue will be further explored in the discussion of the second
research question, which relates to content of the instruction session, but in terms of
pedagogy, one practical step that individual teaching librarians seeking a critical
approach can take is to suggest to instructors-of-record that they provide more structure
and support to help students choose topics that are personally meaningful during the topic
selection phase of research, especially when working with beginning students. The
literature strongly suggested that such an approach would provide for students a bridge
from their personal lives to academia – such a bridge would be especially important to
those students who struggle the most.
If a teaching librarian seeks to have an interactive, personally-meaningful
exchange with students the concept of letting of the agenda is important, even if at first
difficult to accomplish. I cringe every time I hear a teacher say he or she is going to
cover the material. Such an idea is directly related to the banking concept of education.
It implies a single knowable truth that can be deposited into students’ minds unfettered by
the students’ own ideas. It is easy to see that such an approach, particularly with young
people just realizing their own independence, would be off-putting. By letting go of the
agenda, teaching librarians can create space for student learning. But, letting go of the

120
agenda can be particularly challenging for teaching librarians who are limited to a single,
one-time session with students. The temptation to cover as much material as possible in
those constraints is strong. Again it seems that the literature of critical information
literacy challenges teaching librarians to take more risks, in this case perhaps to sacrifice
short-term goals in favor of long-term results. As Harley, Dreger, and Knoblock (2001)
put it:
Even if (and frequently when) the best search techniques are not used, finding
information is usually a brief, if oft repeated, event in a student’s life. One cannot
expect these events to have a significant impact on the student’s attitude. . . .
Evaluating what others have done to information and what one might, in turn, do
with it, comprise less superficial and more integrative tasks that, if repeated, can
contribute to a process of intellectual growth that can have an impact on a
student’s attitude and research” (pp. 27-28).
Research Question 2: Critical Information Literacy Content
Critical information literacy librarians teach about all types of information.
Many scholars and practitioners believed that librarians should spend more time teaching
about information itself, rather than tools and skills. Those of us involved with the
education of college students are very familiar with information – it is the tool of the
trade. Many of us also grew up in the print era, when it was far easier to distinguish
types of information from their physical properties – properties that today’s college
student probably hasn’t been exposed to. It makes sense that students, particularly
beginning students, need explicit instruction about types of information and their
purposes and uses.

121
Accepting that students need explicit instruction about information, the body of
literature that advocates for teaching about information must still be viewed with some
skepticism by individual teaching librarians. Many scholars and practitioners who
advocate this approach also argue that information literacy should be its own academic
subject and be presented in a credit-bearing course (Webber & Johnston, 2000; Johnston
and Webber, 2003). It isn’t so much that I disagree with information literacy as a standalone subject, but that issue is beyond the scope of the current study. The aim of this
study is to chart a possible course for individual teaching librarians who wish to improve
their own individual teaching practice. The establishment of a credit-bearing information
literacy course or not is for-the-most-part out of the control of individual teaching
librarians. Other critical information literacy scholars and practitioners argue for
teaching about information as a means of teaching about social injustice from the
perspective that information is produced to perpetuate the status quo and students should
be taught to recognize and reject that manipulation (Pawley, 1998; Kaptizke, 2003).
However, such an approach is again unlikely to be useful to individual teaching librarians
teaching in the common one-shot environment, so it is also beyond the scope of this study
that seeks practical advice for teaching librarians.
Individual teaching librarians in a one-shot environment have limited time to
teach explicitly about information. To attempt to introduce any significant amount of
content about information in a short session seems at odds with other findings of this
study that discourage teacher-centered approaches in favor of student-centered
approaches. It is hard to imagine, for example, holding student interest for long with
Warren and Duckett’s (2010) suggested curriculum:

122
1. Who creates the information and for what audiences;
2. How the information is packaged and distributed;
3. Which technologies and tools are used to discover and access it; and
4. What the economic realities inherent in the preceding factors are (pp. 351351).
A likelier scenario is that individual teaching librarians in collaboration with departments
or instructors of record may be able to integrate teaching about aspects of information at
strategic points in the curriculum within the context of courses already being taught.
Swanson (2004, 2004b), on the other hand, offers teaching librarians some richlydescribed, practical approaches to teaching about information in a pedagogically sound
manner that could be accomplished in one or two class sessions. His use of scenarios to
guide students to think critically about different types of information in terms of its use is
an activity I’ve successfully adapted in a one-shot session for first-year students. The
activity, which is more-fully described on pages 98 and 101-102 of this report, challenges
students to evaluate information from different perspectives ranging from that of a health
professional, to a journalist, to an 8th grader completing a paper. These scenarios help
students understand information needs vary according to the researcher’s purpose and
provides some basis for helping students understand why they might be asked to use
different types of sources in their academic work than their personal lives.
The more practical perspectives on teaching about information offer sound advice
to teaching librarians. Librarians were cautioned against imposing value judgments on
types of information sources. The argument was made that such an approach guides
students to accept certain types of sources uncritically, which is at odds with the goals of

123
information literacy. The reality is as Warren and Duckett (2010) surmised, “The rise of
free Open Access journals, preprint servers, Google Scholar, and Google Books has
rendered ineffective the instructional strategy of teaching students that library equals
good information and free Web equals untrustworthy information” [emphases from
original] (p. 351).
Equally practical is the idea that librarians should teach about types of
information, not formats. There was a time within the scope of my career when it made
sense to teach students about information in terms of format, because at that time, format
was synonymous with types and purposes of information. Ebooks and ejournals were
uncommon in the 1980s and 1990s, and access to the internet was limited. In the final
decades of the last century it was quite common for instructors-of-record to limit students
to print resources, so it is no wonder that, perhaps unconsciously, librarians slip into the
habit of teaching about formats rather than types of information. Today’s reality is quite
different. Swanson’s example is apt: “An article from Newsweek may exist in print, it
may be on the Newsweek Web site, and it may appear in a subscription database . . . it is
the same article in all three formats, for all intents and purposes (Swanson, 2004b, pp.
262-263). In a one-shot session, this might take the form of simply challenging students
to be more specific about what type of source they are using. For example, I never let
students get away with saying they found a website, because a website is always
something else as well. It may be a blog, a policy, a government document, social media,
or any one of hundreds of types of information that are freely available on the web.
Although genre theory, outside of its application to information literacy, was
beyond the scope of this study, the glimpses of its practicality provided by Anderson

124
(2006) and Burkholder (2010) were intriguing. Teaching about information in terms of
genre may have potential for teaching librarians who wish to help student understand the
range of types of information, its purposes, and its uses. Recalling that, “Genre theory is
related to critical theory and is “used to characterize groups of similar texts that share
certain recognizable conventions and that belong in the same literary tradition” (Türkkan,
2011, para. 1), it is easy to see how teaching from such a perspective would also lend
itself to another recommendation from the literature – that teaching librarians teach about
information as dialog. If types of information are grouped by purpose and potential uses,
then a natural dialogical framework is created that can be shared with students and set the
stage for their own participation in that dialog. By incorporating some of the pedagogical
techniques suggested in the discussion of the first research question, such as PBL or
group work, for examples, and presenting types of information as types of dialog,
teaching librarians may be able to incorporate more content about information into
sessions while still engaging students and not reverting to lecture.
One final but important word of advice from the literature is not to limit the
sources students can use in their research, but to make use of sources students are already
familiar with to bridge the gap between their personal and academic lives. Again, which
sources students can and cannot use for a research paper assignment is largely determined
by the instructor of record. A teaching librarian can make suggestions, but the issue is
largely out of his or her control. The literature however, offered several examples of how
librarians might use nonconventional sources such as Wikipedia to teach students about
academic sources or as Martin (2009) suggested, “to initiate discussion and debate over
the nature of information, truth, and reality on the web (p. 6).

125
Implications for Practice
This interpretive synthesis produced actionable theory (Sch n, 1995) that should
be recognizable and understandable to teaching librarians who wish to take a critical
approach to teaching information literacy. The pedagogy and content defined by this
synthesis can be applied by individual teaching librarians, even in very limited contexts
such as the one-shot library instruction session, with the potential to increase students’
critical engagement.
This synthesis also demonstrated the value of practitioner review of the research
to improve practice, even in such situations that the research is diverse and largely
comprised of descriptions of practice. In the course of conducting the synthesis, I have
regularly practiced the pedagogy and content found here and believe in the process,
become a more reflective, better-informed teaching librarian in terms of pedagogy and
instructional content.
Strengths and Limitations
This study had both strengths and limitations. Some of the strengths were:
1.

It meaningfully targeted practitioners. It was able to synthesize an amalgamous,
conjectural, and discursive body of literature to discern practical advice for
teaching librarians who wish to take a critical approach to information literacy
pedagogy and content.

2.

The use of the methodology of critical interpretive synthesis by a practitioner with
the intention of improving practice is unique to this study as far as I can tell. The
study may serve as a pilot of a methodology that may be useful to other
practitioners who wish to make use of the literature to improve practice.

126
3.

This study was guided by sound methodological decisions supported by the
literatures of research synthesis and practitioner inquiry. These included
purposeful, theoretical sampling with the intent of answering research questions
related to practice; a thorough and multi-faceted approach to locating the studies
in the literature that comprised the sample; prolonged engagement with that
literature; iterative data analysis; and extensive reliance on the data through use of
the authors’ own voices in the form of direct quotations to ground the findings.
Limitations to the study included:

1.

This study targeted a very narrow group of practitioners’ – individual teaching
librarians who wish to improve their teaching practice through the use of critical
approaches to information literacy in an undergraduate setting. Given the
stereotype of a librarian as “someone who is (among other things) introspective,
socially conservative, concerned with adherence to rules and regulations, orderly,
and submissive to authority” (Walter, 2008, p. 58, citing Wilson), it is to be fully
expected that many teaching librarians would reject a critical approach. They
may still, however, benefit from certain ideas conveyed by this study even while
not embracing critical information literacy.

2.

While “transferable” (Suri, 2014), this study is not generalizable or reproducible.
It is a snapshot of the emerging theory of critical information literacy as described
in the literature over a specific period of time. The findings may support the
emerging theory at this time, but will likely be subsumed if the literature of
critical information literacy continues to grow and develop.

127
3.

While every effort was made to thoroughly ground the findings in the authors’
own words through the use of direct quotation, those words were still interpreted
through my lens as a practitioner of information literacy instruction with more
than two decades’ experience. While the study should be useful to some
practitioners as intended, it does not pretend to represent a neutral or single truth.

Limitations and Delimitations
The following limitations and delimitations bounded this study.
1.

The literature examined for this study constituted a purposeful sample, was
selected on the basis of an “emerging theoretical framework” (Dixon-Woods, et
al., 2006, p. 10).

2.

My own perspective as a practitioner guided this study and my interpretations. I
can’t pretend to unlearn all that I know from, years of teaching and researching
these issues. My “continuous examination and explanation” of how I “have
influenced a research project” will allow me to craft a voice that is critical and
authentic to practice, which is in keeping with the overall purpose of this research
(Dowling, 2008, para. 1).

3.

Although, critical interpretive synthesis is “sensitised to the processes of
conventional systematic review methodology” it incorporates critical
interpretation with the aim to “offer a theoretically sound and useful account that
is demonstrably grounded in the evidence” (Dixon-Woods, et al., 2006, p. 10).

4.

The focus of this review was literature relevant to teaching librarians in academic
libraries that serve undergraduate students, although, in keeping with critical

128
interpretive synthesis, literature outside of that narrow field was reviewed if
relevant to the research questions under study (Dixon-Woods, et al., 2006).
Recommendations for Future Research
Clearly there is a need for more empirical research related to critical information
literacy in practice. Of the 42 studies, more than half were essays (N=25) with no
empirical data. Only one or two would meet any serious criteria of qualitative research.
Most of the remainder could at best be described loosely as single case studies, but were
really just descriptions of practice, because no serious effort was made to conduct or
report on a systematic study involving the collection and analysis of qualitative data.
This is in keeping with Booth’s (2011) literature synthesis, which found that the library
literature lacks empirical studies and has a “high proportion of descriptive studies” (p. 4).
The critical information literacy literature also lacks a clear theoretical basis.
Although the term has been attributed to Hamlink (1995), who used in the context of
journalism, Todd (1998) and Luke and Katpitzke (1998), its origin isn’t even clear.
There has been no serious theory development published in the literature. This absence
seems to call for grounded theory research to better understand the phenomenon of
critical information literacy.
Gauging the reactions of practicing teaching librarians to the findings of this study
merits further exploration as it would enhance the trustworthiness of the study. A second
potential direction to build upon the current study is to look further into the impact of
practitioner review of research on practice in education. I identified only two studies that
examined this issue (Kahn, et al., 2012; Professional user reviews, 2012). After
experiencing this study as a practitioner, I agree more than ever with this idea that was

129
previously expressed in my conceptual framework and shaped by the work of Gough
(2009) and Hammersley (2002): Methodologically-inclusive reviews conducted by and/or
for the practitioner to inform practice have much potential because they are driven by
practitioner-based concerns, are purposive to address those concerns, and are conducted
in such a way that they are likely to provide the synthesized detail that practitioners need
in order to apply knowledge to practice.
