ABSTRACT
Alex H. Poole: Forging Our Cultural Commonwealth:
The Importance of Digital Curation in the Digital Humanities
(Under the direction of Helen R. Tibbo)

New forms of digital data and tools or methods, for instance those that cross academic
disciplines and domains, those that feature teams of scholars instead of single scholars, and those
that involve individuals from outside the academy, can enable new forms of scholarship and
teaching in the digital humanities. Such scholarship can promote reuse of digital data, provoke
new research questions, and cultivate new audiences. Digital curation, the process of managing a
trusted body of information for current and future use, can help maximize the value of research
in the digital humanities.
This exploratory qualitative study centered on the salience of digital curation to the
digital humanities. A case study predicated upon semi-structured interviews, it explored the
creation, use, storage, and planned reuse of data by 45 interviewees involved with nineteen
Office of Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant (SUG) projects. Similarly, the study sought to
determine what digital curation skills had been employed in these projects and what digital
curation skills project personnel felt were most important in doing such work. Interviewees
grappled with challenges surrounding data, collaboration and communication, planning and
project management, awareness and outreach, resources, and technology.
This study sought to understand the existing practices and needs of those engaged in
digital humanities work and how closely these practices and needs align with the digital curation
literature. It established a baseline for future research in this area and suggested key skills for

digital curation work in the digital humanities. Finally, it provided a learning model for guiding
such education.

Chapter 1: Introduction

A revolution in digital information is occurring across all realms of human endeavor.
-National Research Council of the National Academies (2015), 7.

We swim in a sea of data…and the sea level is rising rapidly.
-Anderson & Rainie (2012)

Virtually no one in academia perceives that they have a professional responsibility or
mandate for research data management functions.
Council on Library and Information Resources (2013), 6.
Introduction
“Contemplating the digital universe is a little like contemplating Avogadro’s number,”
claim Gantz and his colleagues (2008). “It’s big. Bigger than anything we can touch, feel, or see,
and thus impossible to understand in context” (3). One study concludes, “Every day, we create
2.5 quintillion bytes of data—so much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created
in the last two years alone.”1 In 2014, there existed 1.7 megabytes per minute for every
inhabitant of Earth (EMC Digital Universe 2014). The amount of research data in the sciences
alone increases by as much as 30% per year (Pryor 2012). The data deluge is truly upon us.

Data is “notoriously fragile, short-lived, and easy to manipulate without leaving obvious
evidence of fraud” (American Council of Learned Societies 2006, 18). It is also unprecedentedly
vast in scale and scope. “In almost every laboratory,” Bell et al. (2009) report, “‘born digital’
data proliferate in files, spreadsheets, or databases stored on hard drives, digital notebooks, Web
sites, blogs, and wikis” (1297). Haendel et al. (2012) contend, “Where researchers once managed
discrete, controllable building blocks of knowledge, they must now contend with a tsunami of
information that paradoxically feeds the growing scientific output while simultaneously crushing
researchers with its weight” (1). Yet “data icebergs” persist (Hey, Tansley and Tolle 2009).
The data deluge presents unprecedented challenges with regard to preserving digital
assets. Rothenberg (1995) offers an apothegm: “Digital objects last forever—or five years,
whichever comes first” (42). Other scholars worry about the potential loss of important data,
identifying “A Public Trust at Risk” (Heritage Preservation 2005), data’s “shameful neglect”
(Data's Shameful Neglect 2009), or the specter of a “digital dark age” (Bollacker 2010).
Yet the data deluge also offers immense possibilities. The American Council of Learned
Societies (2006) contends, “The emergence of the Internet has transformed the practice of the
humanities and social sciences—more slowly than some may have hoped, but more profoundly
than others may have expected” (1). New forms of digital data and tools or methods can enable
new forms of scholarship and teaching, for instance those that cross academic disciplines and
domains, those that feature teams of scholars instead of single scholars, and those that involve
individuals from outside the academy. Such scholarship can promote reuse of digital data,
provoke new research questions, and cultivate new audiences. Digital curation can play a central
role in these explorations.

2

Beagrie (2006) asserts, “For society and individuals, it can be argued that digital
knowledge if it is to be useful and usable must be continuously updated, maintained, and
accessed” (12-13). An umbrella term, digital curation manages a trusted body of information for
current and future use. Predicated upon a lifecycle approach, digital curation helps to safeguard
data’s longevity, integrity, authenticity, and accessibility (Higgins 2008) (Higgins 2012). Digital
curation can benefit data creators by increasing the data’s and the research’s visibility, by
increasing the number of citations received by the work, and by helping creators develop risk
management strategies, and by assisting creators demonstrate compliance to funding and legal
bodies and to publishers (Harvey 2010).
Digital humanities work focuses on “what it means to be a human being in the networked
information age and to participate in fluid communities of practice, asking and answering
research questions than cannot be reduced to a single genre, medium, discipline, or institution”
(Burdick, et al. 2012, vii). Digital humanities may be conceived of as a continuum: a discipline
of its own, on one end, or as shorthand for digitally-enabled humanities work, on the other. In
any case, digital tools and methods pervade humanities study and scholarship.
In this vein, the digital humanities embrace a wide variety of work practices. Scholars
may work on cultural criticism, archives, mapping, text markup, encoding, and analysis,
digitization, data mining, aggregation, visualization, gaming, databases, and code and software
studies. Given the depth and breadth of its scope, the digital humanities can serve as “a
laboratory, innovation agency, portal and collaborative initiator for the humanities, and as a
respectful meeting place or trading zone for the humanities, technology and culture, extending
across research, education and innovation” (Svensson, Envisioning the Digital Humanities
2012).

3

Two programs exemplify innovative digital humanities research that pivot on digital
curation: 1) those projects funded as Start-Up Grants by the National Endowment for the
Humanities’s Office of Digital Humanities (ODH); and 2) those projects sponsored by the
National Endowment for the Humanities under the auspices of the three “Digging into Data”
challenges (2009-present). Both of these initiatives dovetail with the National Science
Foundation’s efforts to promote digital curation through its grant-making process. In fact, the
ODH adopted much of its agenda from the NSF’s instantiation of a data management plan
requirement beginning in 2011.
First, between the first round of awards in 2006 and the ninth round in 2014, 2,057
scholarly teams have applied for Start-Up Grant awards and 280 (13.6%) have succeeded. The
Office’s 2010 report reflected, “Like a basic research grant program in the sciences, the
guidelines were designed to encourage applicants to propose innovative projects that had longterm potential but in the short term needed finds to do preliminary work, to test out ideas, to
develop prototypes, to get their planning in order, and perform other tasks necessary for the
successful implementation of a digital project” (National Endowment for the Humanities, Office
of Digital Humanities 2010, 5). More important, the ODH added a provision in 2011 that
mandated the inclusion of data management plans in each grant application.
Second, the three Digging into Data challenges represent more advanced digital
humanities work than that pursued in the Start-Up Grants. They feature more mature projects,
larger teams, an international focus, and more funding than the Start-Up Grants. Round one
(2009) featured eight international projects supported by four research funders in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom); round two featured fourteen 14 projects supported by
eight funders in the US, Canada, the UK, and the Netherlands; and round three featured fourteen

4

projects supported by ten funders from the US, Canada, the UK, and the Netherlands. Such
projects suggest “a digital ecology of data, algorithms, metadata, analytical and visualization
tools, and new forms of scholarly expression” (Williford and Henry 2012, 2). They may even
hint at a “new era” in which “revelatory explorations of our cultural heritage that will lead us to
new insights and knowledge, and to a more nuanced and expansive understanding of the human
condition” (Williford and Henry 2012, 1).
But despite the promise of Start-Up Grants and Digging into Data projects, practical and
methodological challenges abound. The, the full scholarly potential of work in the digital
humanities depends upon digital curation.
Digital curation in the digital humanities typically focuses on a wide range of work
products, e.g. scholarly editions, text corpora, marked-up text, thematic research collections, data
accompanied by annotation or analysis, and finding aids or information maps such as
bibliographies (Flanders and Munoz 2012). Tasks may include translating or migrating data into
new formats, adding contextual information or markup, or linking datasets (Flanders and Munoz
2012). Digital curation helps ensure long-term access; facilitate discovery, retrieval, use, and
reuse; and maximize the usefulness of the curated digital content (Harvey 2010). By making data
as functional as possible, digital curation can enable better research in the digital humanities.
Digital curation and the digital humanities share concerns, practices, and objectives. Both
digital curation professionals and digital humanists add value to digital assets: they help
encourage reuse, develop new research questions, and bring in new audiences. Second, both
areas rely upon interdisciplinarity and collaboration. Third, work in both areas often depends
upon short-term, project-based grant funds. Fourth, digital curation and digital humanities
struggle with some similar challenges: sustainability, project management, institutional position,

5

and the valuation of their work as scholarship. Finally, digital curation and digital humanities are
both areas of practice and research. Henry (2014) notes, “Humanities data is some of the richest
information available and provides some of the greatest challenges for digital curation” (370).
The potential symbioses between the two areas, particularly in fostering education, training, and
skilling up, merits study. Digital curation can contribute much to the digital humanities—and
vice versa.
Digital Curation Education: The Current Landscape
Digital curation is a burgeoning area of interest in Library and Information Science given
job opportunities, funding, and new programs. This dissertation focuses on digital curation
education for three reasons. First, examining digital curation education efforts allow us to discern
how the field and its knowledge, skills, and competencies are presently defined by key
stakeholders. Second, an examination of digital curation education permits us to determine
possible needs and opportunities in the field. Third, although digital curation is expanding its
reach, it is only partially addressing the needs of digital humanities researchers.
As of 2012, 22% (13 of 58) of accredited Library and Information Science programs in
North America offered courses in digital curation (Creamer, Morales, et al. 2012). In March of
2015, I found that 21 (36.2%) schools currently offer such a course, a marked increase. (Nine of
58 programs offer digital humanities course, suggesting potential for collaborative digital
curation and digital humanities work in Library and Information Science.)
In addition to LIS courses, digital curation has gained traction through curriculum
development, Master’s degrees, specializations, certificates, and workshops. Thirty-three

6

initiatives stand out: ten capacity-building programs,2 two Master’s degrees,3 four
specializations,4 ten certificates (graduate, professional, or both),5 and six workshops.6
Despite these efforts, digital curation remains an immature field that lacks coordination
overall (Dallas, An Agency-Oriented Approach to Digital Curation Theory and Practice 2007). A
recent report noted, “Although the benefits of digital curation are poorly understood and not well
articulated, significant opportunities exist to embed digital curation deeply into an organization’s
practices to reduce costs and increase benefits” (National Research Council of the National
Academies 2015, 2). LIS programs not only can train librarians and archivists to engage in
digital curation work, but also can teach digital humanists how best to curate their own data.
Digital curation of digital humanities data can facilitate the sharing and reuse of data, thereby
promoting new research questions and new audiences as well as justifying the public investment
in the digital humanities.

Research Questions
Digital humanists likely have much to gain from working with digital curator in their
training and education efforts as well as in their daily work (Poole 2013). In an effort to establish
a baseline of current practice, and to suggest areas of pedagogical coordination and collaboration
between digital curation and digital humanities, this dissertation centers on four research
questions:


What types of data have digital humanists (whether faculty, “alternative-academics,”7
(alt-acs) or graduate students) created, reused, stored, and planned to reuse in their SUG
project?



What (if any) digital curation skills did they employ and how did they acquire them?



Are these digital humanists interested in acquiring skills to help curate their data and if
so, what content would they like to learn?



What sort of educational framework would be useful to help them learn more about
curating their data?
These questions will be addressed by an examination of selected awardees of Start-Up

Grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities’s Office of Digital Humanities. These
projects represent seminal examples of current and emergent digital humanities work; they will
be contextualized, moreover, in the broader literature of digital curation and digital humanities.

As Bethany Nowviskie puts it, “The #alt-ac label speaks to a broad set of hybrid, humanities-oriented professions
centered in and around the academy, in which there are rich opportunities to put deep—often doctoral-level—
training in scholarly disciplines to use.” See http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-alt-ac-track-negotiating-youralternative-academic-appointment-2/26539

The National Endowment for the Humanities’s Office of Digital Humanities
Established in 2007 by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Office of Digital
Humanities (ODH) propounds, “The ways we read, write, learn, communicate, and play have
fundamentally changed due to the advent of networked digital technologies. These changes are
being addressed in fascinating ways by scholars from across the humanities, often working in
collaboration with scientists, librarians, museum staff, and members of the public.”8
Consonant with this evolution, the ODH began offering Start-Up Grants in 2007 “to
support the initial phases of projects offering innovative approaches to the use of emerging
technologies in the humanities.”9 Head of the ODH Brett Bobley (2007) remarks, “I chose the
name ‘start-up grant’ because it reminded me of the tech world, a tech start-up like the two
Apple Computer guys in their garage.”
Of the “high risk, high reward” variety, ODH-funded projects foreground research
innovation. The ODH sponsors two types of Start-Up Grants, each of which may run up to
eighteen months in duration. Disbursing up to $30,000, Level I grants underwrite brainstorming
sessions, workshops or conferences, alpha-level prototypes, or initial planning. Likely outcomes
include reports, position papers, or plans for future work. Level II grants support more mature
projects, generally those that prepare for implementation or that show proof of concept.
Receiving up to $60,000, these grants produce more concrete deliverables than Level I grants,
for instance prototypes, test beds, or demonstration projects.
All Start-Up Grants grant applications require Data Management Plans. Plans focus on
the types of data the project will produce and the grantee’s plan for managing that data during

and after the grant.10 The ODH defines data broadly: “Many variables govern what constitutes
‘data’ and the management of data, and each discipline has its own culture regarding data.”11 The
ODH classifies data as materials generated or collected such as citations, code, algorithms,
digital tools, documentation, databases, geospatial coordinates, reports, and articles. Conversely,
it excludes materials such as drafts or preliminary analyses, plans for future work, peer-review
assessments, communications with colleagues, and confidential or private material. The ODH
expects grantees to disseminate their findings and their data to scholarly and public audiences.
The ODH’s efforts since 2011 suggest the possibilities of digital curation work in the
digital humanities. Humanists increasingly realize that they reuse and create “data” and thus can
profit by making this data sharable and reusable, especially when their work depends upon
public monies. The Start-Up Grant projects examined in this study illustrate the potential for
coordination, communication, and collaboration among digital curation professionals and digital
humanists. They provide a useful way of studying the practices of key stakeholders.
Structure of the Dissertation
Including this introductory chapter, this dissertation comprises seven chapters. Chapter
two describes the landscape of digital curation in six parts. First, it discusses the definition of
digital curation and the roles and responsibilities of digital curators. Next, it probes the definition

10

http://www.neh.gov/files/grants/data_management_plans_2014.pdf. Data management plans comprise four areas.
First, the plans spell out data rights and obligations, relevant legal or ethical issues, costs, and roles and
responsibilities. Second, plans deal with expected data, namely its types and formats, the ways in which it will be
managed and maintained until shared, and its level of aggregation. Third, plans address sharing, primarily the
mechanisms in place for sharing, how the data was generated, procedural information, and metadata. Fourth, plans
address dissemination. Dissemination issues include strategies to promote public access, formats, resources, any
privacy, confidentiality, security, or intellectual property issues, the archival storage location of data, and the period
of retention.

SUGs.

of data and examines Big Data, the data lifecycle and data lifecycle models, metadata, and data
sharing and reuse. Third, the chapter considers digital curation in the context of scholarship,
focusing on cyberscholarship, citation, and copyright. Fourth, it turns to institutions that play a
foundational role in digital curation: archives, centers, libraries, and institutional repositories.
Fifth, the chapter looks at higher-level concerns such as governance and policy, planning and
data management plans, planning tools, trust, risk management, metrics, standards, and
sustainability. Finally, it stresses the need for examining actual researcher practices and
conducting outreach and raising awareness.
Chapter three explores the digital humanities, also in six parts. It first sets forth the
historical trajectory of the digital humanities. Second, it examines the definition, scope, and
inclusivity of the field. Third, it addresses digital humanities work as scholarship. Digital
humanists often struggle to demonstrate the scholarly worth of their work to more traditionallyminded colleagues, just as do digital curation professionals. Fourth, the chapter tackles the
institutional position of digital humanities, highlighting the importance of libraries and centers as
well as the notion of the “alt-ac” career. Like digital curation, digital humanities often operates in
an insecure position on campus. Fifth, the chapter describes further the types of work digital
humanities scholars do. Data used in such work needs to be curated. Finally, it stresses the
overarching importance in digital humanities of sustainability, collaboration, and project
management. All three of these areas, too, are vital to successful digital curation.
The fourth chapter addresses the current state of education in digital curation and the
digital humanities. The chapter addresses 30 recent initiatives in digital curation education,
parsed by type: capacity-building, specialization, certificate (graduate, professional, or both), and

11

workshop. Both structurally and conceptually these initiatives provide helpful suggestions for
educational model and program development.
The fifth chapter offers an overview of the dissertation’s methodology, unpacks
qualitative and naturalistic approaches. It then covers research design, research questions, and
data collection. Next, it addresses research methods, primarily the affordances of a case study
approach, semi-structured interviewing, purposive sampling, and documentary evidence. Finally,
the chapter discusses grounded analysis and open coding. Overall, this study sought “a nuanced,
expressive and information-rich understanding of scholarly practices and needs” (Benardou,
Constantopoulos and Dallas 2013, 106).
Chapter six discusses the results of the study. First, it describes the nineteen projects.
Next, it provides demographic information about the 45 interviewees. Third, it focuses on
education, training, and skilling up experiences, both formal and informal, undertaken by the
interviewees. Fourth, it discusses challenges faced by interviewees during the projects and
lessons learned. Data, collaboration and communication, planning and project management,
awareness and outreach, resources, technological issues—all were key issues for interviewees.
The seventh chapter addresses the four research questions that steered the study. First, it
discusses the types of data that digital humanists—whether faculty, “alternative-academics,” or
graduate students—created or reused in their SUG projects. Second, it describes the digital
curation skills (if any) they used in their projects and the ways in which they learned them.
Third, it considers whether digital humanists are interested in learning about digital curation
skills and if so, the ways in which they might learn them. Fourth, it sets forth a pedagogical
framework that suggests how digital humanists might learn about curating their digital content

12

appropriately. Fifth, the chapter describes implications and limitations of the study. Last, the
chapter suggests directions for future research. Three possibilities stand out.
A first set of questions centers on refining the proposed learning framework. First, how
can the proposed learning framework be converted into a full-fledged curriculum model?
Second, how can such a curriculum subsequently be propagated across social science and natural
science disciplines? Third, how can such a curriculum be implemented at diverse types of
institutions?
Second, future work might sample other types of scholars doing digital humanities work.
Given the apparent similarity of many of the participants’ affiliations in this study (only four of
29 Carnegie classification categories were represented), what other digital humanities
populations’ digital curation practices would be useful to study? For instance, what are the
digital curation practices (and education practices) for digital humanities scholars at liberal arts
colleges, traditionally women’s colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs),
community colleges, and Master’s level institutions? Along these lines, what activities are
happening at institutions that have not received grant funding? This issue of sampling channels
into a final question: what digital curation skills are employed by personnel pursuing digital
humanities projects more advanced (i.e. involving more data and data of greater complexity and
variety) than the Start-Up Grants?
Third, future work might assume a longitudinal approach. First, what is the fate of the
nineteen SUG projects examined in this study? Have they been sustained? Has their data been
reused and if so, by whom? Second, is digital curation education for digital humanists becoming
more formalized or systematic or both? What are the best ways of measuring the outcomes of
digital curation education programs? Third, do stakeholders view data management plans

13

(DMPs) as more important than they did before? How can we measure DMP improvement (or
lack of improvement)? Finally, have the roles of librarians’ and archivists’ roles in digital
curation evolved or increased?
This study seeks to understand the existing practices and needs of those engaged in
digital humanities work. It intends to discern how closely these practices and needs align with
the digital curation literature. Therefore, it hopes to establish a baseline for future research and to
suggest key skills for digital curation work in the digital humanities. It also seeks to provide a
framework for guiding such education. As one interviewee commented, digital curation
education in the humanities remains a “greatly unexplored area.” This study is an early step to
redress such neglect.

Chapter 2: The Conceptual Landscape of Digital Curation

Data becomes dark because nobody is paying attention.
-Heidorn (2008), 290.

Fulfilling all of these research data management tasks is a complex sociotechnical
challenge that all stakeholders, whether they are research funders, higher
education institutions publishers, researchers or regulators, are currently ill
prepared to meet.
-Proctor, Halfpenny, & Voss (2012), 135.
Introduction
Ross (2000) reflects, “Increasingly, our culture and its by-products are represented as
binary digits” (23). Tibbo (2003) puts the matter more bluntly: “Society as we know it is
dependent upon digital data” (42). According to the American Council of Learned Societies
(2006), “Digital technology can offer us new ways of seeing art, new ways of bearing witness to
history, new ways of hearing and remembering human languages, new ways of reading texts,
ancient and modern” (16). But such rich cultural data demands new strategies of curation.
Technical obsolescence or fragility, lack of resources or of understanding of good practices,
uncertainty over appropriate organizational infrastructure—all these factors represent serious
risks to data (Harvey 2010).

This chapter first defines digital curation and sets out the roles of curators. Second, it
defines data and then proceeds to discuss Big Data, the data lifecycle, metadata, and sharing and
reuse. Third, it addresses scholarship, namely the possibilities inhering in cyberscholarship and
complicating issues such as citation and copyright. Fourth, it considers the place of institutions in
digital curation, focusing on archives, centers, libraries, and institutional repositories. Fifth, it
turns to high-level concerns: governance and policy, planning and data management plans,
planning tools, trustworthiness, risk management, metrics, standards and best practices, and
sustainability. Finally, it addresses the importance of actual researcher practices and of raising
awareness.
Digital Curation
Though preserving electronic records harkens back to the early 1960s at the National
Archives, the notion of the digital preservation of data came about only in 1990 (Hirtle 2007).
Digital preservation constitutes “the planning, resource allocation, and application of
preservation methods and technologies necessary to ensure that digital information of continuing
value remains accessible and usable” (Hedstrom 1998, 190). As a result, digital curation, a
notion that crystallized in 2001, “carries with it the traditions, research subject, and objects of
enquiry of digital preservation; indeed, digital preservation is considered to a necessary—and
immediate—if not sufficient condition for achieving the goals of digital curation” (Dallas, An
Agency-Oriented Approach to Digital Curation Theory and Practice 2007, 5). Indeed, digital
preservation represents an important stage in the digital curation lifecycle model (Higgins 2008).
The Digital Curation Center posits that digital curation “is about maintaining and adding
value to a trusted body of digital information for current and future use.” a definition this

16

dissertation adopts.12 Digital curation thus centers on “planned, systematic, purposeful, and
directed actions that make digital information fit for a purpose” (National Research Council of
the National Academies 2015, 10).
Digital curation bridges disciplines and surmounts temporality and geography. It holds
forth “the promise of linking research, practice, and education relating to digital resources in all
forms and disciplines, as well as the potential for better aligning data management across all
types of repositories, from science data centers to cultural heritage organizations” (Ray 2009,
367). Curation activities are “highly interconnected within a system of systems, including
institutional, national, scientific, cultural, and social practices as well as economic and
technological systems” (A. Gold 2010, 3).
Given the diversity of its stakeholders and the environments in which it is conducted,
digital curation has many definitions and includes many stakeholders (Winget, et al. 2009).
Digital curation potentially involves anyone who interacts with digital information during its
lifecycle (Dallas, An Agency-Oriented Approach to Digital Curation Theory and Practice 2007).
Dallas (2007) elaborates:
The generality of essential conceptual tools underlying digital curation advocacy—
information lifecycle stewardship; multidisciplinary scope including financial, scientific,
technical, legal and sociological points of view; primacy of future ‘fitness of use’—as
well as the perceived need to deal with problems of great magnitude, dependent on
universal infrastructures, tools and procedures, and equally applicable to the curation of
information resources in diverse fields…produced a motive to unite in the short term,

under the digital curation banner, a broad cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary
community of researchers and practitioners (4).
One recent study found that more than 90% of doctoral supervisors and more than 90% of their
students see digital curation as moderately or extremely important to their research work (Abbott
2015).
Despite the long-term importance of digital curation, researchers tend to postpone it as
“that extra burden…in the queue behind meeting the conference deadline and writing the grant
application” (Rusbridge 2007). Digital curation projects have developed at an “alarmingly fast
rate, producing a useful but bewildering array of theoretical frameworks, diagrams, software and
services” (Prom 2011, 142). Complicating matters, researchers may not discuss digital curation,
so they have no way of comparing their practices with other researchers (Alexogiannopoulos,
McKenney and Pickton 2010). The vocabulary of digital curation seems both abstruse and
technical to many stakeholders (Pryor 2013). Finally, lack of standards, authority control,
hardware and software, and storage space complicate the digital curation endeavor (Latham and
Poe 2012). Researchers’ need for assistance with digital curation persists: digital curation
represents “a community, a set of practices, and a field of theoretical and policy concern still in
its infancy” (Dallas, An Agency-Oriented Approach to Digital Curation Theory and Practice
2007, 15).
Digital Curators
Digital curation describes “an interoperable role with a blend of traditional principles and
LIS domain skills and competencies and skills belonging to other specific non-LIS domains,
including both technical and interpersonal skills” (Vivarelli, Cassella and Valacchi 2013). Both
digital humanists and digital curators require non-technical skills, namely project management,

18

negotiation, team-building, and problem solving (Harvey 2010). People skills are at a premium
(Swan and Brown 2008).
Digital curators constitute “the human element of a knowledge infrastructure supporting
contemporary scholarly practices and are key to developing and sustaining a global system of
interoperable digital data and tools across the natural, physical, and social sciences, as well as the
humanities” (Weber, Palmer and Chao 2012, 307). Harvey (2010) calls attention to a dearth of
such professionals. Educational programs should cultivate “professional allrounders like a [sic]
Swiss army knife” (Osswald 2013).
Digital curators embrace a wide variety of duties.13 Digital curation work may seem “a
service-oriented back office activity with high requirements concerning functionality and
perfection” (Osswald 2013). But digital curators ensure long-term access, facilitate discovery,
retrieval, use, and reuse, and help users maximize the usefulness of the curated digital content
(Harvey 2010).
Data
Defining Data
Data is “A reinterpretable representation of information in a formalized manner suitable
for communication, interpretation, or processing.”14 It represents “the output from any systematic
investigation involving a process of observation, experiment or the testing of a hypothesis, which
when assembled in context and interpreted expertly will produce new knowledge” (Pryor 2012,

They manage digital information (ideally) from its point of creation and advise the information’s creators; develop
and implement policies, plans, and services; negotiate donor agreements and ensure submission of objects; maintain
links between digital objects and publications; ensure data quality; perform archival activities such as selection,
appraisal, and retention while maintaining archival principles such as authenticity, integrity, and provenance over
time; promote interoperability; effect preservation activities; manage risk; and ensure destruction of deaccessioned
objects (Harvey, 2010).

3). “Data is a mundane idea,” Cole (2008) notes, “but fundamental to disciplinary knowledge, as
well as central to an understanding of information streams” (240). It constitutes “the raw stuff of
the scientific record, and the basis for verifiability” (Rusbridge 2007).
The definition of data is heavily contextual, reliant upon “a multiplicity of distinct
vocabularies of data-related terms [and] associated with various communities of practice and
disciplinary traditions” (Cole 2008, 240). It is hardly surprising that “considerable confusion
exists as to what ‘counts’ as data” (Steinhart, Chen, et al. 2012, 67). Indeed, “Researchers are
often unaware, or minimally aware, of what their partners consider to be valid and reliable data”
(Borgman, Wallis and Mayernik. 2012, 519). Hence “data, like beauty, exist in the eye of the
beholder” (Borgman, Wallis and Mayernik. 2012, 517). The Office of Digital Humanities defines
data as “Materials generated or collected during the course of conducting research,” the
definition this dissertation uses.15 Data in the ODH’s view can thus include citations, software
code, algorithms, digital tools, documentation, databases, geospatial coordinates, and
publications.
Big Data
Big Data appears “the next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity”
(Manyika, et al. 2011); as the World Economic Forum states, “big data, big impact” (World
Economic Forum 2012). Yet Big Data “is less about data that is big than it is about a capacity to
search, aggregate, and cross-reference large data sets” (Boyd and Crawford 2012, 663). It has
different degrees of “bigness” based on its size, its long-term significance, and its descriptive
challenges (Lynch 2008).

15

20

Nonetheless, Big Data is not necessarily better data. Taken out of context, Big Data loses
its meaning. Big Data also triggers new ethical issues, e.g. new digital divides (Boyd and
Crawford 2012). “One of the most persistent, unresolved questions,” Bollier (2011) opines, “is
whether Big Data truly yields new insights—or whether it simply sows more confusion and false
confidence.” (14). At the least, though, Big Data “enables more people to crunch the same
numbers and come up with their own novel interpretations” (Bollier 2011, 15).
Along these lines, the first Digging into Data challenge (2009-2010) introduced “a new
paradigm: a digital ecology of data, algorithms, metadata, analytical and visualization tools, and
new forms of scholarly expression that result from this research” (Williford and Henry 2012, 2).
The projects demonstrated that data management and organization cannot be separated from data
analysis. Rather, they are “deeply interdependent and that work in both is iterative and cyclical
rather than sequential” (Williford and Henry 2012, 25). Whether big data’s promise will be
fulfilled remains an open question.
The Data Lifecycle and Lifecycle Models
Tibbo (2015) asserts, “Never before in the history of librarianship or archivy has there
been such a clear notion of the need to curate content over its entire lifespan” (151). Digital
curation follows a lifecycle approach, which involves numerous components: appraisal, ingest,
classification, indexing, cataloging, knowledge enhancement, presentation, publication,
dissemination, use experience, repository management, preservation, goal and usage modeling,
domain modeling, and authority management (Constantopoulos and Dallas 2007)—hence the
importance of stakeholder involvement early or even before data creation (A. Ball 2012).
The use of lifecycle models to guide the curation of data can benefit creators, archivists,
and reusers (Harvey 2010). They promote “the maintenance of authenticity, reliability, integrity

21

and usability of digital material” (Higgins 2008, 135). Lifecycle models comprise three types:
individual, organization, and community. They describe how maintaining or preserving data as
well as adding value to it can be effected throughout the lifecycle (Pryor 2012). Models allow
researchers to map their work against the lifecycle, to determine vulnerabilities, to encourage
documentation, to develop standards, and to identify tools and services.
Eight research lifecycle and digital curation models16 merit consideration by digital
curation stakeholders: the Digital Curation Center Curation Lifecycle Model (Higgins 2008), the
I2S2 Idealized Scientific Research Activity Lifecycle Model,17 the DDI Combined Life Cycle
Model,18 ANDS Data Sharing Verbs,19 the DataONE Data Lifecycle,20 the Research360
Institutional Research Lifecycle,21 the Capability Maturity Model for Scientific Data
Management,22 and the UK Data Archive Data Lifecycle.23
In developing or following an appropriate lifecycle model, designers might consider
issues such as scope (what level of services will be offered and to what audiences), best practices
and community standards, and how best to represent real world activities (J. Carlson 2014).
Lifecycle models constitute vital resources for digital curation work.

16

While not a lifecycle model per se, the Open Archival Information System Model has been a key influence on
other lifecycle models (C. A. Lee 2005) (C. A. Lee 2009).

Metadata
Metadata “addresses data attributes that describe, provide context, indicate the quality, or
document other object (or data) characteristics” (Greenberg 2005, 20). Increasingly expansive in
definition, it constitutes “the sum total of what one can say about any information object at any
level of aggregation” (Gilliland 2008, 2). Indeed, Riley (2014) insists that metadata “drives
virtually all of the…steps in the curation life cycle…from preservation actions to access and
reuse” (150). Because metadata captures all levels of a digital object’s properties, it is
tantamount in importance to data itself (Levine 2014).
More specifically, metadata provides stakeholders not only with a controlled vocabulary,
but also with information on related objects, on intellectual property, on user information, on
versioning, on integrity checks, and on preservation actions (Harvey 2010). It may prove a
“Rosetta stone that will make it possible to decode information objects and their transformation
into knowledge in the cultural heritage information systems of the future” (Gilliland 2008, 19).
Evolving over time and with use, metadata is foundational in enabling use, sharing, and reuse of
data.

Sharing and Reuse
Sharing
Sharing data allows scholars to reproduce or verify research findings, to make findings
generated by publicly-funded research available, to permit other researchers to ask new
questions, to facilitate meta-analysis, to increase citation, to reduce loss, to promote teaching and
learning, and to foster economic development (C. Borgman 2012) (Faniel and Zimmerman 2011)
(Lyon 2009) (McLure, et al. 2014) (Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development
2007) (Parsons and Duerr 2005) (Ray 2014) (Tenopir, Allard, et al. 2011) (Whitlock 2011).
Sharing and reuse allow researchers to obtain “new knowledge from old data” (Zimmerman
2008).
Rationales for sharing vary. Perhaps most important, trust nurtured through personal
relationships and collaborations often undergirds sharing (Akmon, et al. 2011) (Cragin, et al.
2010); (Faniel and Jacobsen 2010) (Kroll and Forsman 2010) (Pryor 2009) (Sayogo and Pardo
2013). Such personal exchange renders documentation and tacit knowledge more effective in
transfer (Birnholtz and Bietz 2003) (Wallis, Rolando and Borgman 2013). Still, trust alone
cannot ensure effective sharing (Zimmerman 2008).
Researchers can share data through deposit in a data center, archive, data bank, or
Institutional Repository; through submission to a journal as part of publication; through making

24

it available online through a personal, project, or institutional website; and through peer to peer
exchange (Van den Eynden, et al. 2010).
Policy and enforcement practices, infrastructure, credit mechanisms, rights and licensing,
data usage agreements, best practices, educational modules—all facilitate sharing (M. Smith
2014). But stakeholders who consider sharing must know which data can be shared and why, by
and with whom and under what conditions, and to what effect (C. Borgman 2012). Before
sharing, moreover, data must be gathered and structured (Haendel, Vasilevsky and Wirz 2012).
Even with considerable data management and documentation, sharing remains difficult at best
(Akmon, et al. 2011). Indeed, making data accessible is not equivalent to making it usable
(Wallis, Rolando and Borgman 2013).
Personnel involved in sharing may include the project director; the staff who collects,
processes, and analyzes the data; external contractors or collaborators; support staff; IT staff;
reviewers; meta-analysts; students; and external data centers or web services archives (Van den
Eynden, et al. 2010) (Whitlock 2011). Kroll and Forsman found that direct contact among
faculty and other professionals remains the elemental precondition for collaboration (Kroll and
Forsman 2010). Community buy-in is essential (Haendel, Vasilevsky and Wirz 2012).
Conversely, disincentives to share data persist. First, researchers fear they will not
receive credit for such labors. What is more, writing data documentation is time-intensive. Third,
creators of data worry about misuse, primarily about misinterpretation, but also about intellectual
property. Fourth, confidentiality or privacy concerns play a role (C. Borgman 2012). Researchers
deal with “the carrot of the continued vitality of the community and relationships between
partners, and the stick of obligation to other group members.” (Davenport and Hall 2002, 191).

25

One strategy is to allow original authors to review any publications that make extensive reuse of
their original dataset (Whitlock 2011).
In one study, researchers wanted the right to publish the results of their work before
sharing. They also stressed the importance of proper attribution, the amount of effort prerequisite
to sharing, and the role of funder’s expectations. Finally, they preferred to be familiar with the
potential re-user (Wallis, Rolando and Borgman 2013).
Another study found that 95% of respondents thought they would be able to share their
data at some stage in their research. But more than two thirds (68%) wanted to wait at least six
months after their data analysis to do so. Reasons not to share included researchers’ concerns
regarding privacy and confidentiality (54%) or their sense that their data is of little use to others
(48%) (Steinhart, Chen, et al. 2012).
A third study found the vast majority of its participants willing to share data, but nearly
half of those participants prefer not to share their data with project funders. The most common
form of sharing overall is through emailing data on request (Akers and Doty 2013).
But disciplinary variations regarding sharing behaviors prevail. For example, arts and
humanities researchers are less willing overall than basic science researchers, medical science
researchers, or social science researchers to share their data. On the other hand, arts and
humanities researchers are the most willing of the four groups to share their data with the general
public.
Akers and Doty (2013) determined that medical and social sciences are least likely to
share due to personal or sensitive information contained in their data. Basic sciences and arts and
humanities researchers are most likely not to share because they fear not receiving credit.

26

Finally, basic and medical sciences are least likely to share because of patent or commercial
issues.
Methods of sharing also vary across disciplines. For example, social sciences researchers
are least likely to share data via email. Meanwhile, medical science researchers are least likely to
mount their data on personal websites. Third, basic science researchers are most likely to share
their data by linking it to journal articles or posting it on department or university websites.
Finally, no arts and humanities researchers share their data via repositories or databanks. Perhaps
most important, many researchers struggle to imagine future reuse possibilities of their data
(Wallis, Rolando and Borgman 2013). Unsurprisingly, they are not familiar with documenting or
creating metadata to enable others to understand their data as a result (Akers and Doty 2013).
In deciding whether to prepare their data for sharing, stakeholders need first to discern
data’s potential reuse value and subsequently to determine how many resources should be
allocated to ensure future fit for purpose (Palmer, Weber and Cragin 2011). Most problematic, a
“stated ‘willingness to share’ may bear little relationship to actual release of data” (Wallis,
Rolando and Borgman 2013, 12). Small wonder sharing can seem “a thorny, almost byzantine
concept” (Carlson, et al. 2011, 647). Complicating matters, Lynch (2014) postulates, “The vast
majority of faculty will, at least in the near term, see little real benefit for making their data
available for sharing” (397).
Reuse
Reuse may include migrating data, creating new visualizations of data or enhancing
existing data, aggregating data, or applying new analytical techniques to examine it. (McLeod,
Childs and Lomas 2013). But reuse of shared data invites further challenges: first, the
provenance of the dataset may be ambiguous. What is more, reusability necessitates not only

27

additional policies, but also mechanisms for policy enforcement and compliance. Third and most
important, potential reusers must be able to understand the data in order to reuse it; describing
their methods may be creators’ best strategy to enable reuse (Zimmerman 2008).
It can be tough to enforce or to align terms of use or data usage agreements (M. Smith
2014). Hence both a discipline’s history and the configuration of its research community are key
variables in contextualization and documentation (Carlson and Anderson 2007). Guidelines and
policy stipulations cannot always ensure data deposit and sharing occurs in practice (Schofield,
et al. 2009). Researchers often defer to disciplinary norms or conventional wisdom. The greatest
uptick in sharing will occur in communities that realize direct benefits in sharing or in situations
in which infrastructure is in place (S. Jones 2012).
Nicholson and Bennett (2011) conclude, “While informal paths to data access and
sharing may serve some members of a research community, it seems that maintaining…a
haphazard and idiosyncratic system of data sharing—especially when better methods are
available—is contradictory to fundamental principles of scholarly practices supported by sound
and consistent methodologies” (513). Wallis et al. (2013) report:
The originating investigator bears the cost of data preparation. Other entities such as data
repositories, universities, libraries, and funding agencies are likely to bear the cost of
curating those data for sustainable access. Unknown—and often nonexistent—reusers
reap the benefits. This equation is not viable in economic or social terms (15).
Scholarship
Cyberscholarship
Cyberscholarship features collaborative resource discovery, analysis, discussion, and
argument; in addition to texts it relies upon formats such as images, moving images, sound

28

recordings, maps, and GIS (Green and Roy 2008). Its promise inheres in its potential for fluid
access to and sharing of digital data (Green and Roy 2008). Cyberscholarship therefore allows
new forms of research such as building digital collections of information for further analysis,
developing tools for collection-building and for analysis and study of such collections, and
creating new intellectual products by leveraging those tools (American Council of Learned
Societies 2006). It also allows for further peer review or auditing of research work. Waters
(2007) comments:
Although the systematic exploration of large quantities of information is not a new
scholarly practice, what does seem new is the formalization of the very traditional
interpretive activities of data-mining, pattern-matching, and simulation in powerful
algorithms that represent large and complex sets of data in terms of multiple features and
variables that can be analyzed, tested, replicated, and changed at the scale and speed
afforded by advanced computation” (8).
The development of infrastructure for cyberscholarship may depend upon national,
international, and interdisciplinary coordination (Arms and Larsen 2007). Additionally, it
requires domain and computational knowledge and a common language to transcend these
boundaries (Bowker and Star 2009). A substantial shift in scholarly culture is wanting (Green
and Roy 2008). Lack of expertise may prove the most notable hindrance to the maturity of
cyberscholarship (Arms 2008).
Citation
Brase et al. (2014) note, “The primary purpose of citation has been to support an
argument with evidence, though…it also has become a mechanism for attribution, discovery,
quality assurance, and provenance” (170). Advantages of citation include allowing identification,

29

retrieval, and attribution of data and incentivizing sharing and reuse, thus promoting overall
scholarly productivity (Mooney and Newton 2012).
Though increasingly common, data citation remains exceptional. Mayernik (2012)
discerns “strong cultural inertia against data citations within many research communities” (24).
Researchers may not know that they should cite data; they might not know how to cite data even
if they are aware that they should do so. Journals’ author instructions seldom provide guidance
on data citation. One study found data citation both “infrequent and haphazard” (Mooney and
Newton 2012).
Digital curation stakeholders should follow ten “first principles” (Brase, et al. 2014).
First, data citations should get the same cachet as traditional citations. Second, citations should
give credit and legal attribution to appropriate parties. Third, citations should be persistent. A
persistent digital identifier should have clear referencing and cross-referencing, authentication,
and validation. Fourth, citations should enable access to data, metadata, and documentation.
Brase et al.’s other six principles concentrate on accessibility: citations should help users
discover data and documentation, establish provenance, support granular description for
identification purposes, permit unambiguous identification of data, rely upon widely embraced
metadata standards, and be sufficiently flexible not only to deal with different domain practices
but also to allow communication across domains (Brase, et al. 2014).
Requisite infrastructure involves the marriage of law, computer science, informatics, and
policy and systems research (Brase, et al. 2014). “At a minimum,” Smith (2014) concludes,
“publications should cite data in a similar manner to related publications, and…include
statements about the data’s availability and metadata for where to access it, and terms and

30

conditions” (52). In the end, as an incentive recognition may well outstrip federal or funder
mandates in effectiveness (Haendel, Vasilevsky and Wirz 2012, 3).
Ultimately, citations constitute “one step toward more integrated and transparent data
collections and supplement parallel movements promoting linked data approaches to digital
information provenance tracking” (M. Mayernik 2012, 27). They represent a “necessary
corollary” to data publication (Mooney and Newton 2012). Ball and Duke (2012) offer useful
guidance on the mechanics of data citation and linking.
Copyright
Copyright law seems both “ubiquitous and yet not at all intuitive” (Levine 2014, 140).
Nonetheless, as Smith (2014) sums up, “Copyright law, while complex and nuanced, is largely
harmonized (in the sense that it is structured, interpreted, and enforced in the same way)
worldwide, unlike other types of intellectual property law (e.g., sui generis database rights or
patent rights)” (46).
Four legal issues are interwoven in digital curation work. First, technological change
always outstrips legal change. Second, different countries’ copyright laws vary. Third,
disciplinary practices vary. Fair use necessitates case-by-case scrutiny; what is more, stakeholder
familiarity and comfort with openness remains far from uniform (Levine 2014).
Overall, copyright “is usually framed as a ‘problem,’ but the real impediment seems more
diffuse: a disincentive to share, difficulty in credit and attribution, low value in the tenure
process, and the essential complexity of managing data are more likely factors” (Levine 2014,
134). Potential legal tools for protecting and sharing data include contracts, public licenses, and
waivers (M. Smith 2014). Digital curation professionals would benefit from being well-versed in
these areas.

31

Institutional Sites for Digital Curation
At least four classes of institution have crucial roles to play in digital curation: archives,
centers, libraries, and institutional repositories (Poole 2015).
Archives
“Records such as email, spreadsheets, digital photographs, blogs and other informal or
unpublished materials,” states Prom (2011), “are heirs to the analog records formats that have
long constituted the stock in trade of archives and special collections libraries” (143).
Archivists have much experience selecting records, preserving records’ context, and
making records interpretable and usable (Akmon, et al. 2011) (Prom 2011). In fact, the National
Archives became concerned with machine-readable data as early as 1964, first appraised
machine-readable records in 1969, and developed the first general records schedule for such
records in 1972 (Alldredge 1972) (Dollar 1978) (Fishbein 1972) (Peterson 1985). But digital
materials have traditionally been acquired by archives incidentally (Redwine, et al. 2013).
Notwithstanding the complexity of digital curation tasks, archivists already face existing
backlogs of paper materials (Prom 2011). Indeed, 34% of repositories in one study had more
than half of their holdings unprocessed (Greene and Meissner 2005). Moreover, archivists often
see data as not useful for historical research; they favor placing data with possible long-term
value in discipline-specific repositories maintained by the government or laboratories (Akmon, et
al. 2011).
Yet the archival principles are increasingly relevant to various academic fields and to
digital curation (Manoff 2004) (Poole 2015). Researchers working with data need basic archival
skills, for instance the ability to create good metadata and documentation (Jahnke and Asher

32

2012) (Shankar 2007). Wallis and her colleagues (2008) stump for implementing archival
practices as early as possible in the data lifecycle.
Archivists can serve as digital curation participants or consultants or both. A repository’s
mission statement and collection development policy should determine its involvement (Noonan
and Chute 2014). A recent survey of university archivists who work at ARL member institutions
found 57% of respondents involved in campus conversations about curation. Nearly half of
respondents, moreover, reported collecting institutional or research data. Nonetheless,
institutional size mattered: the largest institutions featured the most archivist involvement. The
vast majority of participants (86%) believe archivists should be involved with digital curation on
some level, whether on a continuous or a case-by-case basis, but only 54% of these respondents
felt capable of fulfilling their perceived roles (Noonan and Chute 2014). Prom (2011) concludes,
“The need is great and the archival community is receptive” (148).
Centers
Centers can improve research efficiency, increase return on investment, enable data
discovery, create data or store reusable data, and raise awareness of data’s disciplinary
importance (Collins 2012). They can advocate for humanities scholarship and teaching, serve as
intellectual sandboxes, promote interdisciplinarity, attract new audiences, engage professional
communities, stimulate collaborations, and extend services to scholarly communities (D. Zorich
2009). The Digital Curation Center, for example, offers two workshop series throughout the
United Kingdom (Digital Curation 101 and Tools of the Trade) and a visualization tool for
constructing curricula (Moles and Ross 2013). The DCC maintains the “dual aim of assisting
growth in research data management proficiency within the higher education community whilst
coordinating the development of institutional services in a way that allows national and

33

international infrastructure to build on, interoperate with and support those services” (Pryor
2013, 182). Yet centers struggle to sustain themselves. Collins (2012) laments, “The value of
research data centers is perhaps brought into its clearest focus when the services that they offer
are no longer available” (169).
Research Libraries
Research libraries have a pivotal role to play in supporting and educating researchers, as
numerous scholars suggest.24 Abram (2014) insists, “The most popular buzzword in library land
these days is curation” (25).
“Responsible stewardship is at the heart of professional librarianship” note Price and
Smith (2000, iv). Corrall (2012) elaborates:
Powerful synergies exist between the longstanding library commitment to open access
and the philosophy of open science, between the principles underpinning library
collection management and emerging protocols for curating digital data, between the
track record of libraries and in technology adoption and systems development and the
complex demands for integrated infrastructure and novel workflows, and between the
teaching mission of librarians and the educational agenda for e-research (126-127).
Consulting with researchers about their data represents an opening wedge, given its
similarity to the reference interview (Brandt 2014). Librarians are well-familiar with metadata
creation, collection management, information literacy, scholarly communication, open access,
and institutional repositories as well (Corrall, Kennan and Afzal 2013). Subject specialists,

24

Key readings include: (Akers and Green 2014) (J. Carlson 2012) (J. Carlson 2013) (Corrall, Kennan and Afzal
2013) (Eaker 2014) (Erdmann 2013) (Fox 2013) (Giarlo 2013) (A. Gold 2010) (Haendel, Vasilevsky and Wirz
2012) (Hey and Hey 2006) (Lage, Losoff and Maness 2011) (Latham and Poe 2012) (Lyon 2012) (McLure, et al.
2014) (Mitchell 2013) (Muilenberg, Lebow and Rich 2014) (Nicholson and Bennett 2011) (Ovadia 2013) (Shaffer
2013) (Starr, et al. 2012) (Tenopir, Birch and Allard 2012) (Walters 2009) (Walters and Skinner 2011) (Wang 2013)
(Witt 2008).

34

metadata librarians, institutional repository coordinators, data curators, systems or IT librarians,
copyright specialists, collection managers, and acquisitions librarians—all can be involved. But
librarians need competencies: knowledge of disciplinary and domain cultures, research methods,
workflows, lifecycles, technology, relationship building and institutional contexts (Corrall 2012).
Librarians who work with data may do so more or less in isolation (Steinhart 2014). Even
so, they have made much progress in supporting course- or department-specific information
literacy programs (Carlson, Johnston, et al. 2013). Purdue University Libraries’s Digital
Information Literacy effort, for instance, balances workshops and semester-length courses while
aligning outreach with current disciplinary research practices (Carlson, Johnston, et al. 2013).
DIL is “grounded in the culture of the discipline in which it is embedded…but certainly imbued
with the greater, communal perspective possessed by an inter- or extra-disciplinary librarian”
(Carlson, et al. 2011, 653).
Yet the commitment of libraries to digital curation is inconsistent (Council on Library
and Information Resources 2013). Price and Smith (2000) note, “Most libraries have traditionally
focused more on the costs of acquiring and maintaining collections than on their potential as
assets that are vital to institutional productivity” (1). Moreover, determining data’s place in the
library’s operations is hardly intuitive (Steinhart 2014). Assuming a research life cycle approach,
for example, represents a sea change for libraries. Similarly, “the prospect of providing
specialized services to selected researchers collides with deeply rooted professional values of
equal service and access to information for all” (Steinhart 2014, 320).
Finally, the scholarly literature evinces little consensus regarding the application of
librarians’ skills—much less what additional skills they need to cultivate (J. Carlson 2013). More
localized studies can determine the appropriate mix of skills needed by librarians (McLure, et al.

35

2014). Ultimately, “The involvement of academic libraries in e-science/e-research has been seen
as a natural extension of their electronic resource management and digital stewardship
responsibilities but also questioned because of the level of technical know-how and domain
understanding required” (Corrall, Kennan and Afzal 2013, 666).
Complicating matters, though researchers lament their inability to create sharable
metadata and to manage their data efficiently, they show little awareness that libraries and
librarians can help (Kroll and Forsman 2010). They see the library only as a “dispenser of
goods,” not as a support system (Jahnke and Asher 2012, 4). There remains “much concern that
researchers will not think to consult librarians—which could lead to inaccuracies,
misinformation, or unrealistic expectations in the plans themselves” (Hswe and Holt 2011, 15).
Ideally, as loci of support for and education of researchers, libraries will evolve into
“vibrant knowledge branches that…provide curatorial guidance and expertise for digital content”
(Walters and Skinner 2011, 5). “Research libraries cannot provide RDM services alone, and it is
essential to be proactive in working with the full range of stakeholders and interested parties,”
claims Westra (2014, 385). Libraries and librarians can increase awareness of digital curation’s
importance, can provide archiving and preservation services, and can cultivate new professional
practices (Swan and Brown 2008). Perhaps most important, digital curation facilitates librarians’
further embedding themselves in research processes (Nicholls, et al. 2014). Partnering with
disciplinary data repositories such as Dyad is one strategy for doing so (Akers and Green 2014).
One study concludes, “Work in identifying and addressing the educational needs of
students with data has just begun and…there are many possible avenues for librarians to explore
in this area” (Carlson, Johnston, et al. 2013, 215).

36

Digital Curation Profiles (DCPs)
Developed at Purdue University Libraries, Digital Curation Profiles are a key resource
for librarians (Witt, Carlson, et al. 2009). DCPs represent digital curation needs from the
perspective of the data creator using her own language. They provide information about data
creation or use, data management, and the curation needs of the researcher. As important, DCPs
are easily comprehensible to non-specialists and are amenable to comparison across fields and
disciplines (J. Carlson 2013).
A recent study reported on twelve workshops geared toward training librarians to use
DCPs. Of 259 participants, 237 had data responsibilities of some sort, whether formally assigned
or fortuitously acquired. All the same, these participants encountered barriers to digital curation
work, primarily organizational support, time, staffing, and resources. The workshops
successfully boosted attendee’s digital curation confidence levels, but their levels of engagement
remained “relatively stagnant” (J. Carlson 2013, 24). Therefore, librarians have yet to parlay
their stated investment in digital curation into action (Carlson, Johnston, et al. 2013). As Carlson
(2013) queries, “how does one actually ‘do data?’” (30).
The DCP initiative also developed a Digital Curation Profiles Toolkit (DCPT). In the
end, “Most respondents feel they can understand the DCPT well enough to use it but would like
support in adapting and customizing it for their own purposes” (Zhang, et al. 2015, 57). But aside
from the time investment necessary to use the DCP Toolkit, attendees expressed concerns about
the tool’s applicability, about getting training and help, and about the DCP Toolkit’s
extensibility. They also found it challenging to articulate the DCPT’s value to researchers or
library colleagues. Responding to criticisms that the DCP Toolkit is cumbersome, time-

37

consuming, insufficiently modular, and too heavily science- and engineering-inflected in its
lexicon, Purdue personnel are developing a new version (Brandt and Kim 2014).
DataNet
Also building on libraries’ potential for digital curation work, the National Science
Foundation’s 2008 DataNet initiative25 funded Data Conservancy26 and DataONE27 (Lee, et al.
2009) (Sandusky, et al. 2009). First, Data Conservancy constitutes a template “that could be
emulated or even replicated verbatim to create a distributed network of human and technical
infrastructure” (Treloar, Choudhury and Michener 2012, 197). Unfortunately, Data Conservancy
was defunded in 2013. Second, DataONE represents “an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional,
multinational project that supports the data life cycle in the biological, ecological, and
environmental sciences” (Allard 2014, 255). Its work continues.
In 2011, three DataNet projects succeeded Data Conservancy and DataONE. First,
Sustainable Environment through Actionable Data (SEAD) (2011-2016) enables “sophisticated
management of heterogeneous data while dramatically lowering the cost and effort required to
curate and preserve data for long-term community use.”28 Second, the DataNet Federation
Consortium29 (2011-2016) employs the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS) to offer
nationally federated data grid infrastructure and to encourage collaborative research among and

between scientists and engineers. Third, Terra Populus30 (2011-2016) provides tools for data
integration across the domains of social science and environmental data.
Institutional Repositories
Often associated with libraries, institutional repositories (IRs) fuse human intervention
and institutional commitment (Kunda and Anderson-Wilk 2011). They contain the intellectual
products of faculty and students, including research and teaching materials, as well as relevant
institutional documentation (Lynch 2003). Therefore, IRs are “part of a larger set of strategies
emerging across academic institutions, and nations, to provide for the stewardship of scientific
research data and mobilize data for ‘e-research’ and ‘e-Learning’” (Cragin, et al. 2010, 4036).
They can help nurture interdisciplinary researcher communities and attend to the data lifecycle.
If repositories involve themselves early in the lifecycle, they can serve as “platforms” where
datasets can be reviewed and annotated. Thus they can help disseminate competencies,
assessments, and interpretations within research communities (Walters 2014).
IRs often support project conception, proposal development, scheduling, documenting,
meeting, and communication. They can manage not only scholarship and data, but also software,
tools, and code. Walters (2014) reports, “Digital repositories are maturing into content and asset
management components of broader ecosystems, ones that support communication and
documentation, in addition to the research process itself and its associated results” (190).
Librarians play a central (if still unsettled) role in IR development and operation.
Given the scale and complexity of the digital curation mandate, there are potential roles
for IRs, libraries, centers, and archives. Whyte (2012) concludes, “Whoever provides data
management, curation and preservation services will be expected to cater for cross-disciplinary

30

http://www.terrapop.org/

39

virtual communities, while drawing their capabilities from regional innovation networks based
around clusters of institutions and the physical facilities and tacit expertise in their vicinity”
(220).
Scale notwithstanding, institutions and organizations face the challenge of balancing
different disciplinary perspectives, negotiate tensions among local and global research
communities, and determine the role of funding agencies (Lynch 2014). In the end, however,
institutional repositories “can play a vital role in bridging the gap between the vast amounts of
research data that are currently hidden in personal hard drives and university servers, and the
small amounts of research data that are placed in national and international disciplinary data
repositories” (Akers and Green 2014, 128-129).
Overarching Concerns
Governance and Policy
Data governance represents “the system of decision rights and responsibilities covering
who can take what actions with what data, when, under what circumstances and using what
methods” (M. Smith 2014, 45-46). Governance ensures that data can be trusted and that
stakeholders stay accountable. Components of governance include business processes, risk
management, legal and policy issues, attribution and citation concerns, archiving and
preservation, discovery and provenance, data schema or ontology discovery and sharing, and
access to necessary infrastructure (M. Smith 2014).
In digital curation, policy vacuums surrounding copyright, database rights, and other
intellectual property issues abound. Other challenges involve creating discipline-neutral policies
and centralizing policy (M. Smith 2014). For example, researchers face Institutional Review
Board requirements, professional ethical codes, funding agency conditions, and international or

40

cultural differences regarding data work (Council on Library and Information Resources 2013).
In some cases, policies are diametrically opposed.
According to the DataRes project,31 the majority of American universities have not
implemented institutional research data management policies. Only 18% have publicly available
policies requiring retention and sharing of research data; the policies that exist are weak. But the
vast majority (87%) of respondents agree or strongly agree that a data management plan is
important (Council on Library and Information Resources 2013).
Another study developed eighteen criteria to analyze the policies of ten funders. Data
policies lacked many of those criteria (Dietrich, Adamus and Steinhart 2012). Four findings were
particularly salient. First, “while many policies stated that grant recipients were required to make
their research data available and include a data management plan in grant proposals, more
focused language, such as how to budget for data management or requirements to conform to
standard data and metadata formats was less commonly mentioned in policies” (Dietrich,
Adamus and Steinhart 2012). Second, policies tended to emphasize access to data more than
preservation. Third, funders by and large neglected to address open access. Finally, policies often
stipulated that data be made available but failed to include details for implementation (Dietrich,
Adamus and Steinhart 2012).
Overall, at least four sectors would benefit from policies: storage, management, security,
and disaster recovery (Harvey 2010). Optimal policies likely focus on the long-term and are
periodically reviewed and refurbished. Accountability, organizational protection and legitimacy,
acceptable practice, monitoring and review, and links to other relevant policies and materials are
some useful components of a good policy (Harvey 2010). Though institutional policies ideally

31

https://datamanagement.unt.edu/datares

41

align with funding agency mandates, both institutional inertia and the still-ambiguous status of
data as a research product undercut such efforts (Council on Library and Information Resources
2013).
Planning and Data Management Plans (DMPs)
Building on the stipulation for data management plans issues by the National Institutes of
Health in 2003, in May, 2010, the National Science Foundation mandated that all grant
applications beginning in 2011 include data management plans—the first step in ensuring that
federally-funded research would be made available to the general public (Mervis 2010). The
Office of Digital Humanities borrowed much NSF language in instantiating their own data
management plan requirement, also formulated in 2011.
Sallans and Donnelly (2012) suggest, “It is neither necessary nor appropriate for all
stakeholders to become experts in every facet of the endeavor, but the planning process provides
an opportunity to clearly stake out the roles and responsibilities for each stage of the process and
to keep them up to date as requirements change over time” (128).
On the other hand, “planning at its best is a process that reacts to change, and that no plan
benefits from being set in stone or blindly adhered to regardless of changing circumstances”
(Donnelly 2012, 90).
Ray (2014) contends, “A good data management plan will not only satisfy grant
application requirements, but will also serve as a blueprint for instituting good practices for
managing active data and facilitating long term access” (9). Van den Eynden et al. (2010)
similarly insist, “A data management plan should not be thought of as a simple administrative
task for which standardized text can be pasted in from model templates, with little intention to

42

implement that planned data management measures early on, or without considering what is
really needed to enable data sharing” (6).
Key considerations regarding a DMP include the data to be generated and shared, funder
or publisher requirements, project stakeholder roles and responsibilities, disciplinary and domain
standards and best practices, deposit location and provisions for back up, internal requirements,
research groups, legal and ethical obligations toward participants, colleagues, funders, and
institutions, and costing (Donnelly 2012) (Van den Eynden, et al. 2010). A DMP should address
stakeholders ranging from researchers, librarians, and center or repository managers, to support
staff such as grants officers, specialists such as archivists, and technical and laboratory staff
(Donnelly 2012).32
According to one source, a data management plan should undergo at least three iterations
(Donnelly 2012). First, at the beginning of the project or at the grant application stage, a DMP
should be minimal. Second, once funding is in place a core data management plan that tackles a
wider range of issues and does so in greater depth can be crafted. Finally, a full plan should focus
on the long-term. Nonetheless, planning can be “misunderstood and underappreciated”
(Donnelly 2012, 83). Small wonder that many researchers neglect to develop DMPs unless
compelled by funding agencies (Jahnke and Asher 2012).
DMP requirements reflect pressure on funders to show positive economic and societal
impact (Lynch 2014). One study found “a great deal of uncertainty among PIs about what the

assistance—both with data management planning, and with specific components of data

two-thirds (62%) of respondents wanted help writing DMPs; only 13% expressed no interest in
support (Steinhart, Chen, et al. 2012).
Another study found a distinct lack of awareness of what a DMP was. Moreover,
responses showed “varied perspectives on what a DMP entails and whether it is only a formal
plan or may also name procedural workflows that for many researchers are embedded in their
research process” (McLure, et al. 2014, 152). Librarians can assist by conducting workshops to
disseminate best practices for writing DMPs, developing common language for certain sections
of DMPs, and promoting tools such as DMPTool 2 (discussed below) (Nicholls, et al. 2014).
Although ultimately Hswe and Holt (2011) counsel, “Funder requirements cannot be
ignored,” there remain few ways of tracking DMP compliance (11). Lynch (2014) remarks,
“Either such mechanisms will need to be developed, or there will be reliance on occasional spot
audits by funders, probably accompanied by increasingly draconian punishments in order to
encourage compliance” (400). Perhaps a better strategy is within reach.
Planning Tools
Though the importance of planning seems to be gaining a foothold among researchers,
tools as well as practices lag. Researchers’ current practices appear desultory largely because
funding agencies propagate broad requirements and provide few resources (Sallans and Lake
2014).
Moreover, current services appear “rather limited in nature, often focusing foremost on
the language and interests of the given funders, and less so on the idealistic or most pure aspects

44

of data management best practices” (Sallans and Lake 2014, 88). Hence a “vicious cycle”
prevails: not only do most disciplines lack standardized procedures for managing data, but they
have yet to train researchers (Sallans and Lake 2014, 88). Tools such as DMP Online and
DMPTool can allay these concerns.
Both DMP Online and DMPTool provide a structured environment for data management
planning and explicitly link to funder requirements (Sallans and Donnelly 2012). Sallans and
Donnelly (2012) conclude, “While the development paths of the tools have diverged, both
groups retain a broader vision of a joined-up tool…that serves as a coordinating hub for the
management of data across many disciplines, many funding agencies, many institutions and
many countries, with shared good practice as a common goal” (128).
In the United States, the DMPTool is especially promising: it constitutes “a
straightforward and easy way for libraries to become more active and engaged in the DM
conversation” (Sallans and Lake 2014, 104). More recently, the six original partner institutions,
recognizing that the “overall quality and success of DMPs are likely to be higher if they are
created using commonly accepted standards and practices based on requirements and
recommendations of funders, institutions, librarians, and research communities,” developed
DMPTool 2 (Strasser, Abrams and Cruse 2014, 327). Goals for DMPTool 2 included settling
upon best practices, allowing local adaptation of the tool, cultivating an open source community
of users, promoting the sharing of institutional resources, and supporting the data lifecycle
(Strasser, Abrams and Cruse 2014).
Trustworthiness
To take full of data’s reuse value, researchers prefer “that the preservation practices of
the source of the data are adequate: that archive media are routinely verified and refreshed, that

45

the facilities are secure, the processes to verify and ensure the fixity of the data are operational,
the geographically distributed copies of the data are maintained as a protection against
catastrophe, and that disaster recovery plans and procedures are in place” (Duerr, et al. 2004,
113). Criteria for trustworthiness include sustainability, compliance with OAIS criteria, pledging
responsibility to long-term preservation, adopting organizational standards, and employing audit
processes (Harvey 2010).
“Despite tremendous advantages offered by digital access and networking,” Kroll and
Forsman (2010) report, “the stellar productivity of U.S. researchers continues to be built on a
foundation of direct human connection, researcher to researcher” (5). If data is shared beyond a
researcher’s colleagues, the processes of data management and documentation must engender
trust (Ray 2014). Elements of such documentation include context of the collection, collection
methods and dataset structure, information on provenance and the chain of custody, information
concerning validation, checking, proofing, cleaning, and quality assurance, the measures taken to
avoid or mitigate loss or corruption or both, and information on access or use conditions or
confidentiality (Ray 2014) (Van den Eynden, et al. 2010).
Outreach and engagement with actual user behaviors seems imperative: “Exploring the
stakeholders’ needs and the process of matching repository operations against those needs has to
date never failed to yield new insights into how the repository can better serve its community”
(Reilly and Waltz 2014, 125).
Risk Management
Within the context of digital curation, risk management constitutes “a continuously
developing arena whose ultimate goal is to define preservation and control mechanisms to
address the risk attached to specific activities and valuable assets, where risk is defined as the

46

combination of the probability of an event and its consequences” (Barateiro, et al. 2010, 6). Risk
assessment procedures include defining potential risks, conducting interviews and walkthroughs, settling upon controls and compensating for their weaknesses, assessing the degree of
risk and parsing risks into acceptable and unacceptable, reporting the results, and developing
action plans (Price and Smith 2000).
Data are subject to numerous risks: viruses, faulty backup, storage media failure,
technology obsolescence, insufficient metadata, and physical disaster (Harvey 2010).
Combatting these risks involves ensuring persistent access, regular backup, multiple copies, a
delimited number of file formats, secure and stable storage, disaster recovery, and community
watch (Harvey 2010).
Choosing a backup strategy involves assessing local conditions, the perceived value of
the data, the systems on which the data is stored, and the acceptable levels of risk. Stakeholders
need to consider whether to backup particular files or the whole system and how often to do so.
Finally, they need to decide how best to organize and label backup data (Van den Eynden, et al.
2010).
Meanwhile, storage of data revolves around employing non-proprietary formats, regular
integrity checks, periodic migration, relying on at least two different forms of storage, creating
digital versions of paper documentation, organizing and labeling data, and ensuring storage areas
remain fit for purpose (Van den Eynden, et al. 2010). Last, security measures should address
physical, network, and system and file issues (Van den Eynden, et al. 2010).
Evaluation is crucial in fostering “an institutional culture of improvement, inquiry,
responsibility, and…quality” (Lakos and Phipps 2004, p. 349). Audits allow precise definition of

47

the designated communities and identification of previously unnoticed risks (Reilly and Waltz
2014).
For instance, the Trustworthy Repositories Audit & Certification: Criteria and Checklist
targets infrastructure, digital object management, and security. The tool helps a repository
transparently tackle risks (Center for Research Libraries 2007) (Reilly and Waltz 2014).
Similarly, the Planning Tool for Trusted Electronic Repositories (PLATTER) constitutes “a basis
for a digital repository to plan the development of its goals, objectives and performance targets
over the course of its lifetime in a manner which will contribute to the repository establishing
trusted status among its stakeholders” (DigitalPreservationEurope 2008, p. 6). Third, the Digital
Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment (DRAMBORA) grew out of a
collaboration between the Digital Curation Center and DigitalPreservationEurope (DPE).
DRAMBORA allows repositories to self-assess their risks and make them quantifiable
(McHugh, et al. 2008). Finally, the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)’s
Audit and Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories enables “a process of continuous
improvement” (2011, p. 1-6). It was codified in ISO 16363 (2012).
But such tools cannot inoculate an organization against risk. “No situation or
environment can ever be totally risk-free,” Price and Smith (2010) report, “and reducing risk
costs money, whether in the form of additional insurance coverage or of funding to implement
tighter controls” (17). Measurement is a critical part of dealing with risk.
Metrics
Measurement is as integral to evaluation as it is to research. Evaluation facilitates
learning, decision making, alerting stakeholders to risks, and stimulating reflection (Whyte,
Molloy, et al. 2014).

48

Stakeholders would benefit by addressing two questions. First, what can or should be
measured? Second, what criteria or metrics should be used? Similarly, evaluation may profitably
focus on two contexts: developing institutions’ research support services and infrastructure and
judging their economic impacts (Whyte, Molloy, et al. 2014).
Despite these guidelines, Whyte et al. (2014) warn, “measuring benefits is often quite
challenging, especially when these benefits do not easily lend themselves to expression in
quantitative terms (286). Hence a mix of strategies is likely beneficial. Even so, “Not all impacts
can be captured and quantified” (Whyte, Molloy, et al. 2014, 292): perhaps data’s value cannot
be tabulated merely by the “accountant’s abacus” (Pryor 2012, 4).
Standards
Standards are “mechanisms of coordination that facilitate the exchange and comparability
of information and practices in the global community” (Yarmey and Baker 2013, 157). Key in
transforming local into public knowledge, they can help ensure the authority of the material, its
authenticity, its reliability, its integrity, and its usability; they smooth the way, too, for technical
integration, collaboration and community participation, interoperability, discoverability,
accessibility, and long-term preservation (Higgins 2009) (Lyon 2007) (Zimmerman 2008).
Ideally, standards are open, publicly propagated, created by a vendor-neutral body, and
functional across competing platforms (Harvey 2010).
Many disciplines and domains lack standards and are ill-informed about standards’
benefits (Lyon 2007) (Tenopir, Allard, et al. 2011). Disciplinarity provides further
complications, as do broader political, cultural, scientific, and technical issues (Griffiths 2009)
(Zimmerman 2008). One study discerned that lack of standards proved a roadblock for graduate

49

students trying to manage, describe, organize, and sharing their data (Carlson and StowellBracke 2013).
Absent incentives, researchers appear “apt to misunderstand and resist” adhering to
standards (Edwards 2004, p. 827). Despite its potential costs financially and temporally, Yarmey
and Baker (2013) advocate for standard-making as “an evolving, continuing design process, as
opposed to a set of defined steps leading to a solution in the form of an enduring standard” (158).
Standards, after all, can consistently justify their costs (Lynch 2008). Most notably, they can
facilitate the development of local best practices (Yarmey and Baker 2013).
Sustainability
The National Research Council of the National Academies (2015) propounds, “The
benefits of doing digital curation are increasingly evident, but so are the actual and, often hidden,
costs” (17). Sustainability hinges on technical, social, and economic facets. “Identifying the
‘what,’ ‘when,’ and ‘who’ of the value proposition is an aspect of communicating the benefits of
preserving research data to funders, administrators and other decision makers,” claims Lavoie
(2012, 72). Though Lavoie argues that sustainability cannot be divorced from economics (Lavoie
2012), the Repository Task Force insists that sustainability “is not merely about money; it is
about organizational commitment and the ability to build persistent collaborations to address the
ongoing needs for repository services and infrastructure” (Repository Task Force 2009, 8).
Diverse incentives promote sustainability; the best option is to attract diverse revenue
sources (Lavoie 2012). Optimal sustainability plans feature leadership, precise value
propositions, minimization of direct costs, varied revenue streams, and commitments to
accountability (Maron, Smith and Loy 2009).

50

Projects may assume one of two approaches to costing. First, the project can price all
activities and resources for the entire lifecycle, thus determining the total cost of data generation,
sharing, and preservation. Second, the project can determine the additional expenses necessary to
allow the data to be sharable (Van den Eynden, et al. 2010).
For example, the LIFE Project improved planning, comparison, and evaluation of digital
lifecycles (LIFE Project Team 2008). The Keeping Research Data Safe (KRDS) project
constructed an activity model and a TRAC-based resource template (Beagrie, Chruszcz and
Lavoie 2008). Keeping Research Data Safe 2 reviewed and extended KRDS’s activity model and
crafted a benefits framework based on case studies (Beagrie, Lavoie and Woollard 2010).
More recently, the European Union funded 4C: Collaborating to Clarify the Cost of
Curation project (2013-2015).33 “Designed to help public and private organizations invest more
effectively in digital curation and preservation through the development of useful and usable
resources, the [4C] project aims to sustain the long-term value of all type of digital information”
(Kilbride and Norris 2014, 45). The project sought to receive community input on and to
encourage “sharing as you go.” The project team received input from memory institutions, dataintensive research groups, and industry and commerce. It focused on conducting a gap analysis
and a stakeholder needs survey, on developing the Digital Curation Sustainability Model
(DCSM) and the Curation Cost Concept Model, and on building a Curation Costs Exchange
(CCEx).
In addition to these four endeavors—gap analysis, stakeholder survey, the DCSM, and
the CCEx—the 4C project set out the 4C Roadmap providing guidance for the next five years. It

51

also sponsored an international conference, two workshops, and four focus groups before its end
in early 2015 (Kilbride and Norris 2014) (Middleton 2014).
Ultimately, the sustainability of digital curation work should focus on making decisions
that are optimal for current needs and yet will not preclude future users from making optimal
decisions of their own (Kunda and Anderson-Wilk 2011).
Conclusion
“We are at the early stages of a genuine systemic and systematic response to the data
stewardship challenges framed by the emergence of e-research, and to seizing the opportunities
promised by more effective, broadscale sharing and reuse,” Lynch (2014) posits (406). But basic
challenges such as providing for documentation, helping faculty write data management plans,
developing platforms for sharing, preserving bits, and publishing data persist (Lynch 2014).
More exigent tasks for stakeholders include complying with funder requirements and minimizing
risk and liability (Lynch 2014). But studying researcher practices and conducting outreach and
raising awareness are perhaps most pressing.
Researcher Practices
“Within or across disciplines,” says Prior (2012), “members of that workforce will over
time combine, disperse and recombine with seeming fluidity; the research undertake will rarely
follow an exclusive and linear path and as a community they will exhibit changing patterns of
allegiance and interests” (9). Researchers can profit by examining the prevailing data practices in
disciplinary cultures, transdisciplinary domains, and collaborative work groups (Palmer and
Cragin 2008) (Palmer, Teffeau and Pirmann 2009).
Curation services would likely benefit by embracing a range of disciplinary,
subdisciplinary, and domain traits and sharing practices (Cragin, et al. 2010) (Karasti, Baker and

52

Halkola 2006) (Lage, Losoff and Maness 2011) (Lyon, Rusbridge, et al. 2009) (Myers, et al.
2005) (Shankar 2007). Akers and Doty (2013) report, “Different disciplines vary widely in their
research funding, technical infrastructures, collaboration networks, source materials, subject
populations, methodologies, ethical considerations and types of research outputs” (14). One
recent study found disciplinary culture—in this case agronomy—a key impediment to sharing
(Carlson and Stowell-Bracke 2013). In any event, translating materials developed for generic
purposes into discipline-specific training persists as a central challenge (Molloy 2012). The
“domain disconnect” looms large (Lyon and Brenner 2015, 116).
Outreach
The DataRes project (2013) concludes soberly: “virtually no one in academia perceives
that they have a professional responsibility or mandate for Research data management
functions” (6). Many faculty members feel that funding agencies, publishers or professional
societies have yet to extend sufficient support (Carlson, Johnston, et al. 2013). Digital curation
professionals can fill this lacuna. One study’s participants emphasized their interest in attending
digital curation workshops and in receiving help preparing data management plans (Akers and
Doty 2013).
Though raising awareness risks “alarming an institution by revealing the scale of the
challenge facing it” (Pryor 2013, 187), outreach “requires a cooperative audience and time but no
additional infrastructure or financial investment” (Shorish 2012, 270).
Jones (2012) maintains, “A considerable culture change is required to sustain the shift to
sharing and reusing data, and more incentives are needed to speed this along” (63) (Mooney and
Newton 2012) (Whitlock 2011). “Researchers,” conclude Patrick and Wilson (2013), “are not
rebellious schoolchildren who need to be bullied into working harder; they are generally highly

53

motivated and highly skilled individuals who take a great deal of pride in what they do, and thus
are more likely to embrace digital curation as a worthy goal if persuaded of its merits.” Digital
humanists are just such researchers who may be persuaded.

54

Chapter 3: The Trading Zone, the Meeting Place: the Digital Humanities

Certain questions are especially insistent: How do we sustain the life of these
digitally-organized projects; how do we effectively address their institutional
obstacles and financial demands; how do we involve the greater community of
students and scholars in online research and publication; how do we integrate
these resources with our inherited material and paper-based depositories; how do
we promote institutional collaborations to support innovative scholarship; how do
we integrate online resources, which are now largely dispersed and isolated, into a
connected network.
-McGann (2010), 1.
During a period of transition it may be particularly difficult to determine where
we are in the unfolding of that transition.
-Greetham (2012), 442.
Introduction: the Digital Humanities and the Humanities
Renear et al. (2009) maintain, “The humanities are an information-based domain in a
double sense: both the development of data on the one hand, and its exploitation in new
scholarship, education, and culture on the other, are intrinsic to these disciplines, and thoroughly

55

intertwined” (191).34 So too are the digital humanities (DH). But the relationship between
traditional humanities and digital humanities scholarship over seven decades generally has been
strained.
Digital humanities scholars stress the manifold opportunities for symbiosis between the
two forms of scholarship (D. Parry 2012) (Reid 2012) (M. N. Smith 2004) (Warwick 2004).
Even the Head of the Office of Digital Humanities remarks, “You can tackle the ‘traditional’
humanities topics and questions while still using the latest digital tools if you find it adds value
to your work” (Gavin and Smith 2012, 64). But Huggett (2012) points out, “From a traditional
humanities perspective, it can often seem as if Digital Humanities is not only the new kid on the
block, but also the monster that is garnering all the attention and sucking up available research
funding” (86).
Turf wars aside, two issues span humanities and digital humanities scholarship. First,
both synthesize digital and traditional publication to facilitate wide circulation of knowledge
(Woodward 2009). Second, despite the tension between them, both areas face questions of
belonging and legitimacy in the university and society (Piez 2011).
But among digital humanists, optimism abounds. The digital humanities seem in a “boom
time” (Alexander and Davis 2012, 368), as suggested by new books, more positions advertised,
new funding, an increased number and range of projects and institutes, and heightened
administrative interest (Greetham 2012) (Svensson, Beyond the Big Tent 2012). Waltzer (2012)
deems the DH “a destination in and of itself, a jumping-off point for the building of a scholarly
According to the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act (1965), as amended, “The term
‘humanities’ includes, but is not limited to, the study and interpretation of the following: language, both modern and
classical; linguistics; literature; history; jurisprudence; philosophy; archaeology; comparative religion; ethics; the
history, criticism and theory of the arts; those aspects of social sciences which have humanistic content and employ
humanistic methods; and the study and application of the humanities to the human environment with particular
attention to reflecting our diverse heritage, traditions, and history and to the relevance of the humanities to the
current conditions of national life” (http://www.neh.gov/about).

56

identity” (339). Digital humanists seem close to “full partners” with other humanists (Liu 2012,
492).
Yet in the midst of this triumphalism, Alvarado (2011) reminds us: “To a disconcertingly
large group of outsiders, the digital humanities qua humanities remains interesting but
irrelevant.” Ayers (2014) similarly cautions, “I’m not sure you’re a pioneer if nobody follows
you.”
This chapter first addresses the antecedents of the digital humanities. Next it deals with
the digital humanities’ definition, scope, and inclusivity as well as their relationship to cultural
criticism. Third, it situates the digital humanities in the context of the academy, discussing
scholarly communication (social media, publication, and open) and institutional position
(centers, libraries, and alt-ac careers. Fourth, it analyzes digital humanities work: curation,
editing, modeling, analysis, and tool use. It concludes by suggesting the importance of
sustainability, collaboration, and project management, issues especially relevant to digital
curation work. Above all, digital humanities work demands curation; digital humanists require
education in the area.
Computing in the Humanities and Humanities Computing, and the Cradle of the Digital
Humanities
Setting a foundation for the digital humanities, humanities computing focused on textual
data from its effective gestation with Roberto Busa’s Aquinas concordance (started in 1949).
Though the military, scientists, and business firms first embraced computers, some scholars soon
exploited computing power for textual and alphanumeric manipulation (Deegan and Tanner
2004) (Rockwell and Mactavish 2004). Perhaps most important for scholars, texts were
“massively addressable at different levels of scale” (Witmore 2012, 325).

57

Humanities computing (HC) casts a long shadow over the digital humanities. Though the
digital humanities grew “specifically out of an attempt to make ‘humanities computing,’ which
sounded as though the emphasis lay on the technology, more palatable to humanists in general”
(Fitzpatrick, The Humanities, Done Digitally 2012, 13), there persists a close link between HC
and DH (D. Parry 2012).35 McCarty (2012) laments, “Since the beginning [digital humanities]
has kept far back, absorbed with technical concerns, with its place in the academic world and
with the enormity of its task” (The Residue of Uniqueness, 27).
Following Busa’s pioneering work, concordance tools gained cachet as techniques for
tackling questions of style and authorship. Reverend John W. Ellison produced a concordance
for the Revised Standard Version of the Bible in 1957. Some philosophers gravitated toward
computers (Ess 2004); some historians followed suit (W. G. Thomas 2004).
In 1963, the National Commission on the Humanities promulgated a vision for a
humanities equivalent to the National Science Foundation (established in 1950). Yorktown
Heights hosted one of the first conferences focusing on computers and literature in 1964. Yale
and Purdue each hosted a similar conference in 1965; the journal Computers and Humanities
debuted in 1966.
In the fall of 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the National Foundation on the
Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-209) into law. “Democracy demands wisdom and
vision in its citizens,” the Act maintains. “It must therefore foster and support a form of

35

Despite their longtime loyalty to text, HC scholars have shown some interest in multimedia and non-textual
representation, e.g. metadata systems and GIS. But the “visual turn” has not (yet?) exerted an important impact on
HC; new media studies work in HC has been “relatively marginal.” Svensson argues this marginality stems from the
lack of interaction occurs between these communities and the difficulty of developing tools for these frameworks
(Svensson, Humanities Computing as Digital Humanities 2009).

58

education, and access to the arts and the humanities, designed to make people of all backgrounds
and wherever located masters of their technology and not its unthinking servants.”36
The National Council on the Humanities convened in March, 1966. The Council awarded
its first grant that July (it funded at least five digital humanities projects during its first year of
operation). In 1967, digital humanities grants comprised four percent of non-fellowship and
stipend grants; the NEH also funded the EDUCOM Symposium. Computers appeared “more
than a passing curiosity” (Hindley 2013).
In the early and mid-1960s, the combination of available data and computing power
allowed Mosteller and Wallace to resolve longstanding authorial disputes over twelve Federalist
Papers (Hockey 2004). Some archaeologists meanwhile welcomed databases to synthesize large
quantities of data collected from multiple excavations (Eiteljorg II 2004). A number of historians
coevally embraced social science methods to study “ordinary” people (W. G. Thomas 2004).
Refining techniques of counting, sorting, and storing, some humanities scholars applied
new methods from mathematics, logic, and linguistics to their data (Lieb 1966). But stakeholders
recognized the limits of technology, especially with respect to character sets, input-output
devices, and batch processing (Hockey 2004).
The 1970s, the 1980s, and the first half of the 1990s witnessed consolidation (Hockey
2004). An increasing number of scholars employed common methods and applications. Centers,
conferences, journals, and courses on computing in the humanities proliferated. The Oxford Text
Archive was opened in 1976.
Beginning in the middle of the 1980s, personal computers, primarily through word
processing and email, attracted new acolytes. Advances included DOS-based text analysis

59

programs, the advent of the Macintosh and its graphical user interface, the development of
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in 1986, and the 1987 gestation of the Text
Encoding Initiative’s (TEI’s) Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange
(published in 1994) (Hockey 2004).
Literary scholars continued to focus on pattern or theme studies (Rommel 2004). “The
‘golden age’ of linguistic corpora began in 1990” (Ide 2004). Conversations about editorial
method and theory and about electronic archives and editions converged (Kirschenbaum 2010).
Historians wrestled with the intersection of computing tools and historical interpretation (W. G.
Thomas 2004).
Computing also penetrated performance arts, art history, and history. Computers could
deal with textual and numeric data such as dialogue, criticism, and names, locations, and dates
(Saltz 2004). Pulling images from scanners and video, art historians populated text databases.
But obstacles included the number of records involved, the cost of digitization, and concerns
about image resolution and about hardware and software longevity (Greenhalgh 2004). Personal
computers, networking, and markup imprinted historians’ practices, though concerns about
information overload, authenticity, and commercialization lingered (W. G. Thomas 2004).
Ushered in by the Mosaic graphical browser in 1993, the Web seemed a useful tool for
locating information but not necessarily one amenable to research per se (Hockey 2004). Still, it
allowed scholars some control over the digitization and presentation of their materials (Earhart
2012). As in the case of personal computers, the Web attracted new stakeholders. They sought to
publish their work, to expand their audiences, and to promote collaborative efforts such as
editing.

60

Multimedia also debuted in the early 1990s, though technical issues rather than new
research possibilities pervaded discussions. Henceforth, electronic resources became objects of
study themselves. Concomitantly, more academic programs and professional outlets were
established (Hockey 2004). Born-digital objects such as hypertextual maps and oral histories
piqued historians’ curiosity, as did the emergence of historical GIS (W. G. Thomas 2004).
Predicated upon database tools, the “first wave” of initiatives in the digital humanities
began in the late 1980s and persisted into the early 2000s. Aside from migrating material into
digital forms, projects focused on textual analysis, cataloging, linguistic features, and pedagogy
(Hockey 2004). Buoyed by interface innovations, mushrooming bandwidth, and multimedia
affordances, stakeholders in the late 1990s developed visualizations and geospatial
representations, simulations, and network analyses (Burdick, et al. 2012).
Archaeologists, literary scholars, performance arts scholars, art historians, and
philosophy and religion scholars benefited from new data management affordances. Rommel
notes, “The variety of approaches used to come to terms with heterogeneous textual objects, the
multitude of theoretical backgrounds and models of literature brought to bear on studies that
share as a common denominator neither one single technique nor one ‘school of thought,’ but the
application of a common tool, are the strong points of studies of literature carried out with the
help of the computer” (Rommel 2004). In performance, computing blurs boundaries among
disciplines, scholarship, creativity, and media (Saltz 2004). While computing for art historians
became simpler, its problems still center on communication, expertise, and resources
(Greenhalgh 2004). Last, philosophers and religion scholars attained a better understanding of
computing’s affordances and limitations (Ess 2004).

61

By the early 2000s, many humanists had used computers in their work. Busa (2004) calls
developments “enormously greater and better than I could…imagine.” The digital humanities
“has broadened its reach, yet it has remained in touch with the goals that have animated it from
the outset: using information technology to illuminate the human record, and bringing an
understanding of the human record to bear on the development and use of information
technology” (Schreibman, Siemens and Unsworth 2004).
But most observers show nothing akin to unalloyed optimism. Traditionally-trained
scholars may remain leery of those they see as “wild-eyed technocrats who play with computers
and digital resources because they can” (Warwick 2004). Scholars in various disciplines also
express reservations. Ess (2004) questions whether computing edifies debate, scholarship, or
insight in philosophy or religion: computers facilitate certain paths of inquiry but foreclose
others. Similarly, Rommel (2004) points out, “No final result, let along an ‘interpretation’ of a
text, can be obtained by computing power alone; human interpretation is indispensable”
(Rommel 2004). Though Greenhalgh (2004) characterizes the computer as “a speedy idiot
obeying a set of precise instructions,” many art historians view it as “a black and magical (or
black-magical) box.”
Despite these concerns, Web 2.0 introduced new tools and promoted relationships among
producers and consumers. Increased interactivity and user participation ensued, along with a
reinforced investment in networking, customization, and collaboration (Davidson 2012). Both
Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 projects are salutary—they may prove symbiotic (Rockwell 2012). Digital
culture is both globalized and decentralized (Bartscherer and Coover 2011).
The importance of the development of the Web can scarcely be overstated. Its evolution
seems akin to “the emergence of an economy defined by social structures, modes of production,

62

and cultural formations that alter the way information is produced and exchanged, enabling a
global and networked world of decentralized sharing, collaboration, and diffusion, with the
caveat that it also creates the conditions for violent backlash and newer forms of surveillance and
control” (Burdick, et al. 2012, 80). Nonetheless, digital humanities work shows considerable
continuity: for seven decades, it has remained committed both to employing information
technology to shed light on the human past and to using an understanding of the human record to
influence the development and use of information technology (Schreibman, Siemens and
Unsworth 2004).
Despite its long history of creating, sharing, and reusing data, the digital humanities’s
relationship to digital curation remains curiously overlooked. Who will preserve, manage, and
add value to these assets?
The Digital Humanities: Definition, Scope, Inclusivity, and Criticism
Definition
Defining digital humanities remains a “known rabbit-hole problem” (S. Jones 2014, 7).
The digital humanities “sometimes seems to exist only in a state of self-definition” (Fyfe 2011).
Warwick and her colleagues (2012) sum up, “this question [what is digital humanities?] seems to
be repeatedly asked, but seldom answered to anyone’s satisfaction” (xiii). Thus Bartscherer and
Coover (2011) muse, “The deeper one probes, the more one realizes the need to clarify—and
also to enrich—the lingua franca” (7). Thaller (2012) warns, “We pay a price for this narrowness
of many definitions on a very practical level, as it seems to be next to impossible to transfer
solutions from one project defining itself in a narrow context to another one within a context
defined equally narrowly” (13).

63

Yet scholars agree on certain definitional characteristics of the digital humanities and this
dissertation follows these commonalities. Inherently collaborative, the digital humanities expand
the public sphere and the notion of scholarship. A “global, trans-historical, and transmedia
approach to knowledge and meaning-making,” they hint at “a reinterpretation of the humanities
as a generative enterprise: one in which students and faculty alike are making things as they
study and perform research, generating not just texts…but also images, interactions, cross-media
corpora, software, and platforms” (Burdick, et al. 2012, vii, 10). The digital humanities represent
“a hybrid domain, crossing disciplinary boundaries and also traditional barriers between theory
and practice, technological implementation and scholarly reflection” (Flanders, Pietz and Terras
2007). In particular, digital humanities work includes such topics as open access, intellectual
property, tool development, digital libraries, data mining, digital preservation, multimedia,
visualization, GIS, study of impact of technology on scholarly teaching and learning, and media
studies (Gavin and Smith 2012).
The complexity of the digital humanities stems from their disciplinary and institutional
diversity and from their multiple modes of engagement with information technology (Svensson
2010). But like all the human sciences, the digital humanities are hermeneutical, intertextual,
idiographic, realist, and narrative (Constantopoulos and Dallas 2007) (Dallas 1999).
Scope
In constant flux, the digital humanities seem an “enormously complex, multifunction,
distributed system that is largely undocumented” (Edwards 2012, 224). “A broadly conceived
digital humanities,” Svensson (2009) contends, “would necessarily include the instrumental,
methodological, textual and digitized, but also new study objects, multiple modes of
engagement, theoretical issues from the humanities disciplines, the non-textual and the born

64

digital.” Kirschenbaum (2010) views the term digital humanities as “a free-floating signifier”:
“digital humanities is more akin to a common methodological outlook than in investment in any
one specific set of texts or even technologies” (60, 56). Alvarado (2011) concurs: “the digital
humanities is in principle associated with as many methods and tools as there are intersections
between texts and technologies.” Digital humanists may engage more in methodological than in
theoretical debates and posits that the former may be more easily resolved than the latter
(Scheinfeldt, Sunset for Ideology, Sunrise for Methodology? 2012) (Scheinfeldt, Why Digital
Humanities is 'Nice' 2012).
Scholars engaging in digital humanities work do not necessarily call themselves digital
humanists. “I have very little to no desire to label myself a digital humanist,” insists Parry (2012,
437). “Neither critical cyberculture studies, nor internet studies, nor initiatives such as new
media studies and critical digital studies, which all come from cultural studies or art theory
backgrounds, typically make frequent use of the term digital humanities” (Svensson 2010).
Some scholars embrace this fluidity. Fitzpatrick (2012) views DH as “not the specific
subfield that grew out of humanities computing but rather the changes that digital technologies
are producing across the many fields of humanist inquiry” (The Humanities, Done Digitally, 13).
Kirschenbaum (2012) maintains, “on the one hand…digital humanities is a term possessed of
enough currency and escape velocity to penetrate layers of administrative strata to get funds
allocated, initiatives under way, and plans set in motion. On the other hand, it is a populist term,
self-identified and self-perpetuating through…contemporary social media” (417). Hence Parry
(2012) argues, “What is the essence of the digital humanities? is an impossible question to
answer, as if there is an ideal form of digital humanities out there to which one can point, a
central Platonic ideal from which all other digital humanities can be judged in relation” (429).

65

Inclusivity
Other scholars show trepidation about the field’s potential lack of inclusivity. “Even as
the digital humanities (DH) is being hailed as the ‘next big thing,’” Spiro (2012) observes,
“members of the DH community have been debating what counts as digital humanities and what
does not, who is in and who is out, and whether DH is about making or theorizing, computation
or communication, practice or politics” ('This is Why We Fight': Defining the Values of the
Digital Humanities, 17).
Though Scheinfeldt (2012) facetiously refers to digital humanists as “the golden
retrievers of the academy,” others disagree. Parry (2012) notes, “As much as the ‘big tent’
definition and narrative is iterated, the practice of what actually occurs points to a different
reality” (434). Pannapacker (2012 finds the field unprecedentedly exclusive and cliquish. Bianco
(2012) muses, “What quick, concatenating, and centrifugal forces have so quickly rendered the
many under the name of one, the digital humanities?” (97).
Spiro (2012) suggests, “Rather than debating who is in and who is out, the DH
community needs to develop a keener sense of what it stands for and what is at stake in its work”
('This is Why We Fight': Defining the Values of the Digital Humanities, 17). She propagates
values such as openness, collaboration, collegiality, diversity, and experimentation—all ideal for
a “meeting place.” According to Edwards (2012), “Our field’s current focus on qualification, on
boundary setting, is unnecessary and that the choice between emptying the term ‘digital
humanities’ of meaning on the one hand and defending it as a specialist redoubt on the other is a
false one” (228). Svensson (2012) advocates for a “‘no tent’ approach” and suggests that
“‘trading zone’…or ‘meeting place’ may be useful, alternative structuring devices and ideational
notions” (Svensson, Envisioning the Digital Humanities 2012, 36).

66

Nonetheless, there remain “tensions between a technologically oriented and tool based
approach and a cultural or media studies oriented approach, where the digital is primarily an
object of analysis rather than a tool” (Svensson, Envisioning the Digital Humanities 2012).
Friction obtains among veterans and newcomers, among configurations of interdisciplinarity, and
among notions of making and interpreting (Fitzpatrick, The Humanities, Done Digitally 2012).
Criticism
Criticism in the digital humanities seems immature (Liu 2012). Activities as seemingly
banal as keyword searching remain “fraught with interpretive baggage” (Drucker and Nowviskie
2004). As a result, “everyday politics with a small ‘p’ frequently intersects with epic politics
with a capital ‘P’” (Losh 2012, 181). Liu lobbies for digital humanists to embed advocacy into
their daily work.
But Hall (2012) deems avoiding theoretical and critical engagement as at once
conservative and moralizing. DH tools cannot presume that every user possesses the same
abilities and can employ the same methods (Williams 2012). Digital humanists should bring
theory to technology as well as to scholarly content (Earhart 2012).
For some, the digital humanities risk coalescing around “unrecognized inequities”
(Edwards 2012, 224). Bianco (2012) warns, “Recently we’ve seen a winnowing of what was an
experimental and heterogeneous emergence of computational and digital practices, teaching and
theorization from within and across disciplines to an increasingly narrow highly technical, and
powerful set of conservative and constrained areas and modes of digital research” (101). Parry
(2012) worries, “A digital humanities that replaces an ivory tower of bricks and mortar with one
of supercomputers and server farms crunching large amounts of textual data and producing more
and more textual analysis simply replaces one form of isolationism with another” (433).

67

Diversity remains a concern. McPherson (2012) argues, “Certain modes of racial
visibility and knowing coincide or dovetail with specific ways of organizing data” (143). Digital
humanities also fosters “a distinct gendering of work and product, as well as a significant gender
gap in participation” (Wernimont 2013). Calling for an “opening out,” Wernimont (2013) insists,
“However ‘open,’ ‘collaborative,’ and ‘connected’ Digital Humanities purports to be, if
computational tools are wielded in ways that continue old patriarchal privileges of expertise and
authority and create merely receptive users, then we miss an opportunity to leverage digital tools
to transform literary scholarship in meaningful ways.”
Cultural criticism—what there is of it—in the digital humanities presages the
decolonization of knowledge. Burdick et al. (2012) encourage digital humanists to model cultural
difference. Indeed, digital humanists would do well to scrutinize Web 2.0’s participatory culture
(Ensslin and Slocumb 2011). Davidson (2012) elaborates: “Hybridity, exchange, flow, and
cultural transaction are all explored more responsibly and adventurously when the resources of
many nations, in many languages, have been digitized, made interoperable, and offered for
research by scholars around the world” (479).
The Digital Humanities and/in the Academy
Scholarly Communication
Digital humanists gravitated toward alternative modes of scholarly communication as
early as 1987 (e.g. the Humanist listserv); they later embraced chat and blogs. High spots include
the Humanities, Arts, Science and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC) (established
in 2002), Companion to Digital Humanities (2004), the Alliance for Digital Humanities Online
(ADHO) (2005), the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment for the Humanities

68

(ODH-NEH) (2006), MediaCommons (2007), the City University of New York (CUNY)
Academic Commons (2009), and the annual Digital Humanities Conference (first held in 1990).
Flanders (2012) observes:
[Digital humanists] are committed to encoding our data in a standard way so that it can be
shared, so that it will remain comprehensible: in fulfillment of an implicit contract with
unknown scholars of the future who need to know what we know and understand what
we have done. But at the same time…we know that a crucially important dimension of
that representation is precisely the disciplinary norm that we adopt, and these we know to
be founded on debate rather than on straightforward agreement (Collaboration and
Dissent: Challenges of Collaborative Standards for the Digital Humanities, 74-75).
Digital humanists participate in “an always-changing online ecosystem of blogging,
microblogging, and more complicated forms of open-access and comment-friendly platforms for
reviewing and publishing,” Jones (2014) reflects (148). Multimedia and Web 2.0 propel new
types of publication. Nonetheless, scholarly publishing traditions hinder digital publishing, many
digital publications go effectively unnoticed, and establishing credibility and sustainability are
stumbling blocks (Maron and Smith 2008). “The social contract of the book,” Cohen (2012)
contends, “is profoundly entrenched and powerful—almost mythological—especially in the
humanities” (Cohen 2012, 319). Some humanists may “continue to operate not in an implicate
but in an isolate order…all the while pledging allegiance to ‘globalization’” (McGann 2010, 4).
Social Media
Scholarly communication in the digital humanities revolves around social media and thus
more broadly upon Web 2.0 (O'Reilly 2007). Social media constitute “particularly generative
spaces for questioning the academic status quo, exchanging ideas about radical scholarship and

69

pedagogy, and creating spaces for democratic exchanges” (Potter 2014). Social networking
similarly represents both a technique and an object of study (Friedlander 2009). Perhaps most
important, few if any provisions have been made for curating such ephemeral data. Blogs and
Twitter are cases in point.
Blogs represent “publishing platforms by another name” (Cohen 2012, 322) and blogging
implicates “a set of skills worth cultivating” (Owens 2012, 411). Cohen (2013) characterizes
blogs as “perfect outlets for obsession” (29).
An “invaluable ready-made network,” Twitter steers daily conversation (Kirschenbaum,
Hacking the Academy: New Approaches to Scholarship and Teaching from Digital Humanities
2013, 139). It represents “the backchannel and professional grapevine” (Kirschenbaum 2012,
417) and has “inscribed the digital humanities as a network topology…lines drawn by aggregates
of affinities, formally and functionally manifest in who follows whom, who friends whom, who
tweets whom, and who links to what” (Kirschenbaum 2010, 59). Twitter seems akin to a cocktail
party: “One does not have to be present for the entire time, or participate in every conversation,
but can check in and out of the party and move between different conversations as appropriate”
(D. Parry 2011, 159).
Cohen’s Web publication, Digital Humanities Now, aggregates tweets and disseminates
the most-discussed items (Cohen 2012). The publication “combines the conceit of a scholarly
journal with the real-time automated aggregation enabled by Twitter’s open Application
Programming Interface” (Kirschenbaum 2012, 422).
On the other hand, Edwards (2012) worries, “the lack of mutuality in Twitter
relationships can simply replicate or ‘reify’ the offline hierarchies of DH”: newcomers and those
with limited Web risk marginalization (222). Alas, even on social media “celebrity economies

70

and reputation metrics” cannot be dodged (Kirschenbaum 2012, 423). Nowviskie (2013)
elaborates, “I have heard the technology the Twitter community embraces and explicitly figures
as democratizing and personalizing described in terms of alienation, invasion, and exclusion”
(127).
Publication
Publication dovetails with scholarship writ large. Anyone with hardware, software, and a
network connection can publish—a newfound “promiscuity” (Fitzpatrick, Beyond Metrics:
Community Authorization and Open Peer Review 2012, 452). The digital humanities can upend
traditional modes of scholarship: “The existence of the digital transforms the very meaning of the
word ‘scholarship’” (D. Parry 2012, 435), though the “idols” of scholarly publishing remain
(Cohen 2010). Craig (2004) states: “A remarkable range of studies has been built up; methods
have been well calibrated by a variety of researchers on a variety of problems; and even if some
studies have proved faulty, the vigorous discussion of their shortcomings is a resource for those
who follow.”
Burdick and her colleagues (2012) assert, “A book is not simply ‘finished’ and
‘published,’ but is now part of a much more dynamic, iterative, and dialogical environment that
is predicated on versioning, crowd-sourced models of engagement and peer review, and opensource knowledge and publication platforms” (85). Waters (2008) recommends focusing on the
assembling and curation of data. In this sense, as Lynch (2010) reports, “scholars will need to
learn when and how to fully adapt the transmission of sustained argument that characterizes
monographs to the digital environment, rather than today’s practice of simply using the digital
environment to store and transmit what are still, in an intellectual sense, printed monographs.”

71

Open Access
Waters (2008) advocates for open data: “economic, intellectual property, and other
barriers must be low enough to permit an easier flow of information, especially into rich
computational environments that helps readers locate and, indeed, discover new information.”
Much misinformation persists regarding open access. Fitzpatrick (2013) expounds,
“Opponents of open access alternatively argue that making all scholarship available for free will
destroy the economic model of the publishing industry, making it impossible for anything to get
published, and that doing so will simultaneously undermine peer review” (35). But open access
will not necessarily spur plagiarism.
Humanities scholars appear complicit in the relative lack of momentum in open access.
Ramsay (2013) criticizes, “Open access…is effectively shut down by our own behavior” (45).
For instance, peer review remains pivotal and hampers open access. Davidson (2012) maintains,
“The very concept of peer review needs to be defined and interrogated”: who is a “peer”?
(Humanities 2.0: Promise, Perils, Predictions, 481) Richardson (2013) concludes, “In many cases
we are asking those tasked with setting standards for multimedia-based research to create fair
and impartial rubrics to assess the quality of non-traditional faculty scholarship when they do not
adequately understand the technologies and industries from which these digital professionals
have originated.” Fitzpatrick (2012) advocates for crowdsourced peer review; Kelly (2013) avers
that peer review is simply obsolete. But the most formidable obstacle to a “global cultural
commons” remains copyright, that “badly broken” mechanism (Burdick, et al. 2012, 113).37

Tim Hitchcock goes further: “what really needs to break down is the silo that suggests that information itself is
something to be consulted and collected; that it is an unchanging object of study, rather than a pool of constantly
changing stuff that can be interrogated from any angle, and pursued along any trajectory” (Hitchcock 2011).

72

Institutional Position
“Emergent professional communities will struggle to have their codified, or explicit
knowledge, accepted,” argue Davenport and Hall (2002, 177). The digital humanities are no
exception.
Universities legitimate knowledge in a privileged way (Burdick, et al. 2012). Disciplines
accrue influence as they embed themselves in the “university subject roll-call” (Terras 2012,
215). Although disciplinary affiliation vouchsafes a sense of identity and belonging, it may
militate against change (Watrell, Fitzpatrick and Parry 2013). Indeed, universities uphold a firm
line of demarcation between faculty members and staff (Bradley 2012). Some administrators
remain skeptical of digital humanities (Maron and Pickle 2014). Younger scholars involved in
DH work may feel “ghettoized and even disadvantaged” regarding grants, tenure, or promotion
(Friedlander 2009, 2).
The institutional status of the digital humanities remains ambiguous. They “advance not
uniformly but unevenly…from certain academic positions to specific niches” (Alexander and
Davis 2012, 368). Centers, libraries, and alt-ac careers can help digital humanists further embed
themselves institutionally.
Centers
The center, “a central (physical or virtual, or both) area where a suite of activities is
conducted by individuals dedicated to a common mission,” is among the campus loci of the
digital humanities (D. M. Zorich 2008, 4). Centers date from the early 2000s and fall into two
classes. First, resource-focused centers foreground one resource or project, occupy a virtual
space, and serve a specific constituency. A second group of centers occupy a physical space and
host diverse projects. Most centers follow the latter model (D. M. Zorich 2008).

73

Centers’ key activities include digital collection- and tool-building, research, public
outreach, internal and external support, training, collaboration, and storage (D. M. Zorich 2008).
Constituents include disciplinary, professional, university, and education communities, corporate
bodies, and the public. Ideally, centers promote entrepreneurship and experimentation (Maron
and Pickle 2014) (Ramsay and Turner 2013).
But centers hardly represent a panacea. Their establishment often reflects unstructured,
short-term planning. According to Zorich (2008), “The classic DH business model starts with a
relatively simple portfolio of funding contributed by a foundation or university, and migrates
over time to a complex mix of monies obtained from myriad sources that change yearly because
of the short-term nature of grants, state and university budget fluctuations, and an absence of any
(or any significant) revenue-generating resources” (37-38). Exacerbating this uncertain funding
model, centers often neglect to track their resource use.
Moreover, whether individual centers are sustainable remains an open question (D. M.
Zorich 2008). Local commitments can undercut external collaborations or even awareness of
complementary projects (Fraistat 2012). Paradoxically, some aspects of centers may in fact
obviate scholarship: their silo-like character, their struggle to leverage resources, and their
potential inability to erect cyberinfrastructure. One study found that 78% of centers experienced
at least one unsuccessful partnership (D. M. Zorich 2008).
Leading centers in the United States include the Maryland Institute for Technology in the
Humanities (MITH), the Stanford Humanities Lab, the Rosenzweig Center for History and New
Media (CHNM), and the University of Nebraska’s Center for Digital Research in the
Humanities. Smaller initiatives of note include those at the University of Richmond, Hamilton
College, and Occidental College.

74

Centers offer the possibility of melding digital humanities and digital curation in one
location, physical or virtual. Combining forces this way increases the likelihood of providing
return on investment that could appeal to funders and administrators.
Libraries
Not only centers, but libraries and librarians can nurture digital humanities work.
“Libraries…have taken real strides in developing plans to sort and prioritize and to seek scale
solutions for hosting and preservation” (Maron and Pickle 2014, 57). At the least, libraries can
foster collaborations by providing space and technological infrastructure (Svensson 2010).
In one study, three quarters of responding libraries partnered with other campus units (often with
IT) and more than half (56%) partnered with other institutions (Bryson, et al. 2011). Yet many
libraries cobble together resources to support digital humanities work. Approximately half of
Bryson et al.’s sample receive funding from academic departments, library IT, or special onetime funds and approximately one third receive funding from endowments. Libraries would do
well to reframe their DH work as a complement to their existing efforts (Bryson, et al. 2011, 14).
Many so-called traditional librarians have skills that are amenable to digital humanities
work. Bryson et al. found that library staff most often provide high-level support such as
consultations or project management advice. But only 35% of responding libraries allocate staff
specifically to DH projects and only 8% maintain a designated center located in the library. On
the other hand, nearly all (94%) provide some digital scholarship services, whether scanning,
image, video, and audio editing, bibliographic management applications and content
management systems, or GIS software and data management tools (Bryson, et al. 2011).
Libraries appear somewhat inconsistent regarding preservation and sustainability. More
than half (59%) of Bryson et al.’s (2011) sample preserve DH projects in-house; what was more,

75

51% develop grant proposals to ensure sustainability, 37% work with project planners to
integrate sustainability costs into project cost estimates, and nearly one third (31%) audit projects
for sustainability. Perhaps most problematic, most do not assess their services formally. Perhaps
libraries could shore up their position by demonstrating return on investment vis-à-vis their
digital humanities work. Combining DH and digital curation work may be a promising way of
doing so.
Alt-ac Careers
The notion of “alt-ac” to Nowviskie (2010) connotes “a broad set of hybrid, humanitiesoriented professions centered in and around the academy, in which there are rich opportunities to
put deep—often doctoral-level—training in scholarly disciplines to use.” Some digital humanists
have a double appointment (academic department- and campus center-based). On the other hand,
many digital humanities scholars occupy “liminal and academically precarious” institutional
positions (Flanders, Time, Labor, and 'Alternate Careers' in Digital Humanities Knowledge
Work 2012, 292).
Flanders (2012) insists that “‘alternative’ or ‘para-academic’ jobs within the academy
have a great deal to teach us about how academic labor is quantified, about different models of
work and work product, and about the ways that aptitude, skill, expertise, and productivity are
weighted in assessing different kinds of work” (Time, Labor, and 'Alternate Careers' in Digital
Humanities Knowledge Work, 293). More formal “anxieties of digital work” center on whether
digital humanities work constitutes conventionally-weighed and rewarded “scholarship”
(Ramsay and Rockwell 2012, 75). Employers seem cautious about alt-ac hires (Nowviskie 2010)
and Richardson (2013) calls for an overhaul of the tenure and promotion system. Yet neither

76

Svensson (2012) nor Waltzer (2012) sees appreciable change in the academy’s labor or reward
structures.
According to Sehat and Farr (2009), faculty members should bear ultimate responsibility
for training students. Yet apprehensiveness persists among teachers. DH’s volatility undercuts
more experienced scholars’ efforts to prepare graduate students and graduate students themselves
may be unprepared to develop new scholarly practices (Reid 2012). This uncertainty may deter
young scholars from entering the field (Greetham 2012). Brier (2012) queries, “Where’s the
pedagogy?”
Notwithstanding debates over professional status and teaching, the digital humanities’
institutional presence remains circumscribed to a handful of large research institutions.
Community colleges, most state and regional institutions, small schools, and private schools are
marginalized (Alexander and Davis 2012).
Liberal arts and teaching-focused institutions may have advantages over research
universities given their shallower administrative hierarchies, reputed intellectual flexibility,
lower faculty publication requirements, and potentially greater faculty/student collaboration
(Pannapacker 2013) (Svensson 2010). Initiatives at Hope College, Carleton College, Dickinson
College, and Wesleyan University augur well for the spread of DH.
Conversely, the affordances Pannapacker (2013) mentions—small institutional size,
pedagogical focus, varying institutional missions—may prove drawbacks. Small institutions lack
visibility in the larger digital humanities milieu and they are often geographically isolated.
Finally, their digital humanities work may fail to interoperate with other complementary projects.

77

Digital Humanities Work
Digital humanities work thrives on experimentation and risk-taking (Burdick, et al. 2012)
(Moretti 2003) (Spiro, 'This is Why We Fight': Defining the Values of the Digital Humanities
2012). Data sharing allows scholars as well as members of the general public to test hypotheses
or to add to or edit the “original” data set or its metadata (Burdick, et al. 2012). Pitti (2004)
notes, “Collaborative design involves iterative analysis and definition, frequently accompanied
by prototype implementations that test the accuracy and validity of the analysis.” Projects may
embrace multiple authors and authorial generations.
As Table 1 indicates, fifteen overlapping approaches to digital humanities work may be
discerned. A diverse range of tools support these four approaches.
Table 2: Categories of Digital Humanities Work (Burdick, et al. 2012)

“Involving archives, collections,
repositories, and other aggregations of
materials, curation is the selection and
organization of materials in an interpretive
framework, argument, or exhibit”
(Burdick, et al. 2012, 17).
“To curate is to filter, organize, craft, and,
ultimately, care for a story composed out
of—even rescued from—the infinite array
of potential tales, relics, and voices”
(Burdick, et al. 2012, 34).
Editing constitutes “a physical as well as a
philosophical act, and the medium in
which an edition is produced (or an
edition’s place in the material world) is
both part of and contains the message of
the editorial philosophies at work” (M. N.
Smith 2004).
Augmented editions: bring together
numerous versions of single work; track

This is a far narrower definition than the one I would propose. It would be useful for the DH community to
consider adopting a broader definition, namely in focusing on curation as the process of adding value to trustworthy
digital assets for current and future fitness-of-purpose. Much greater possibilities exist for the concept of curation to
bring together various strands of work in the digital humanities.

development; observe variants; preserve
entire comparative apparatus.
“Fluid” textuality: the ways in which over
time authorial changes, editing,
transcription, and translation practices,
and print production account for
variations.
The law of large numbers: “the more
times a researcher repeats a given
experiment, the closer that researcher
comes to determining an average value
that defines the results of that experiment”
(Burdick, et al. 2012, 37).
Usually employs text mining tools,
machine reading, and algorithmic
analysis.
“Distant reading is almost not reading at
all, but rather engages the abilities of
natural language processing to extract the
gist of a whole mass of texts and
summarize them for a human reader in
ways that allow researchers to detect
large-scale trends, patterns, and
relationships” (Burdick, et al. 2012, 39).
Distant reading allows users to focus on
units and structures much smaller or much
larger than the text, e.g. devices, tropes,
themes, and genres (Moretti 2000).
Close reading resembles a “theological
exercise—very solemn treatment of very
few texts taken very seriously” (Moretti
2000).
“We need to do less close reading and
more of anything and everything else that
might help us extract information from
and about texts as indicators of larger
cultural issues” (Wilkens 2012, 251).
Cultural analytics work presupposes that
“meaning, argumentation, and interpretive
work are not limited to the ‘insides’ of
texts or necessarily even require ‘close’
readings” (Burdick, et al. 2012, 40).
Cultural analytics broadens the possible
“canon” of cultural objects conducive to
study.

Cultural analytics: “The ‘data’ of cultural
analytics are exponentially expanding in
terms of volume, data type, production
and reception platform, and analytic
strategy, making it all-the-more important
that humanists are engaged with the
design of algorithms, mining and
visualization tools, and archiving
techniques that foreground questions of
value, interpretation, and meaning”
(Burdick, et al. 2012, 41).
Aggregation: permits highlighting of data
points, clusters, and trends
Data mining: parameterize an aspect of
dataset and extracting it; results in
statistical, textual, or visual outputs
“The real value of studying common
words rests on the fact that they constitute
the underlying fabric of a text, a barely
visible web that gives shape to whatever is
being said” (Burrows 2004).
Visualization “generates questions that
might otherwise go unasked, it reveals
historical relations that might otherwise
go unnoticed, and it undermines, or
substantiates, stories upon which we build
our own versions of the past” (White
2010).
“The interest in ‘reading’ the visual has
extended to ‘authoring’ the visual—using
visual means to express intellectual
concepts” (Burdick, et al. 2012, 42).
Locative investigation “brings together
the analytical tools of geographic
information systems (GIS), the structuring
and querying capacities of geo-temporal
databases, and the delivery interfaces on
GPS-enabled mobile devices” (Burdick, et
al. 2012, 44).
Mapping, the “easy synthesis of personal
and political, of multiple scales and
temporalities offer[s] a radical alternative
to the methods of hierarchical analysis,
documentary history, and biographies of
great men that dominated the traditional

teaching of most disciplines” (Guldi
2011).
Mapping is “built on the history of
cartography; ideologies of discovery,
ownership, and control; levels of
abstraction; scale; relations between the
real and representation; symbology; visual
signposting; perspective; and coordinate
systems” (Burdick, et al. 2012, 42-43).
Thick Mapping allows “geographic
analysis, digital mapping platforms, and
interpretive historical practices [to] come
together” (Burdick, et al. 2012, 46).
The digital archive “becomes a
‘mathematically defined space’ where
retrieval…is not a matter of interpretive,
iconological semantics but computing
algorithms” (Evans and Rees 2012, 91).
“The features that inscribe interpretation
in archives are those that embody or
express the imprint of the point of view
according to which the archive takes
shape” (Drucker 2011).
“Most important is not that digital
humanists become digital archivists, but
that each community think about how best
to leverage whatever knowledge, insights,
tools, and habits it has evolved so as to
enter into fruitful joint collaborations”
(Kirschenbaum, The .txtual Condition:
Digital Humanities, Born-Digital
Archives, and the Future Literacy 2013).
Knowledge production is unprecedentedly
distributed; teams of domain experts work
together and all are authors; multiple
access points and platforms prevail.
“When knowledge exists in iterative form
across global networks and local access
points, with many versions and
expressions of cultural information taking
shape in a process whose lifecycle is
ongoing, then any access to that
knowledge is a performance, an
instantiation” (Burdick, et al. 2012, 50).
Gaming “has begun to successfully
engage with historical simulation,

virtuous cycles of competition, and the

environments” (Burdick, et al. 2012, 51).
Increased processing power and
connectivity allow gamers not only to
function in real time, but also to engage
with multiple geographically dispersed
participants (S. Jones 2014).
Games are “designed to structure the fluid
relationships between digital data and the
game worlds…and between digital data
and the player in the physical world,” (S.
Jones 2014, 33).
“Code studies, along with the related
study of software and platforms, bring
humanistic close-reading practices into
dialogue with computational methods”
(Burdick, et al. 2012, 53).
Scholars study the history of encoding
practices, software and computer
languages, code game engines,
archaeological software studies, and
cultural contexts.
Work with documentary materials (film,
video, text, and animation) on an
expanded scale
Documentaries are “performed by a
reader/viewer who is provided with a
series of guided paths; and, unlike the
cinematic documentary, which is freestanding, database documentaries may be
built on multiple, overlapping databases”
(Burdick, et al. 2012, 55).
The viewer controls the sequence, the
duration, and the sound levels.
“The ease with which content can be
repurposed in digital form extends the
capacities of the medium to function as a
meta-medium” (Burdick, et al. 2012, 55).
“Remix culture is a hallmark of the
participatory, programmable Web in
which a ‘read-only’ ethos has been
surpassed by one of ‘read/write/rewrite’”
(Burdick, et al. 2012, 56).

“The tools of humanistic inquiry have
become as much objects of research and
experimentation as have the modes of
production and dissemination of
knowledge” (Burdick, et al. 2012, 58).

Tools
Although tools constitute a key extensible asset in DH work, the term “tool” itself
remains nebulous (D. M. Zorich 2008). One study concludes, “too few tool builders looked for
existing tools that already did what they envisioned, or if they did in fact do an initial check
before beginning their own development efforts, they often had trouble finding related tools”
(Cohen, Fraistat, et al. 2009). Most tools are one-off and standalone to boot; thus connecting
them remains difficult at best (Cohen, Fraistat, et al. 2009).
The problem of orphan tools—operational but not referenced by or linked to a center—
remains (D. M. Zorich 2008). Similarly, tools may be abandoned—replaced by commercial or
updated tools, but also jettisoned by dint of loss of stakeholder interest, time, or funding (Shilton
2009). Finally, tool developers usually invest less effort in sustaining or supporting the tool than
in developing it (Waltzer 2012). For tools, unfortunately, the creators may be the only persistent
users (Edwards 2012, 215).
Another study examined 39 tools. While the tools were accessible, their usability was
deeply problematic (D. M. Zorich 2008). Zorich (2008) advises digital humanities centers

83

personnel to advertise their tools, clarify their tools’ purpose, disseminate previews, offer
support, adumbrate technical instructions, and plan for sustainability.
A similar study of 38 tools also discerned problems: versioning, sustainability, standards,
funding sources, and maintenance. Shilton (2009) deems the most useful tools as open sourcebased and apparently sustainable. She advocates developing best practices regarding website
design, staffing, funding, and stewardship, institutional infrastructure, and accessible and
sustainable design. Tools might be more useful it they worked better with other tools, used
content more robustly, and were more easily locatable (Cohen, Fraistat, et al. 2009). They
optimize their usefulness by remaining findable, accessible, transparent, and easy to use longterm.
Tool creators face four challenges: conceptualizing the tool, providing for staffing,
participation, and project management, attracting and keeping users, and cultivating rewards
systems (Cohen, Fraistat, et al. 2009). They should consider serving constituencies such as
established users, software developers and technologists, content providers, funders and
supporting organizations, and traditional humanists (Cohen, Fraistat, et al. 2009). An appropriate
interface, finally, would “minimize the skepticism of black-box analysis” (Gibbs and Owens
2012). Tutorials and example use cases are imperative.
Other strategies for developing sustainable and interoperable tools include “training the
trainer” initiatives, grants for collaborative work, cyberinfrastructure such as a registry for or
repository of tools, an infrastructure providing tools, cookbooks, and recipes, and mechanisms
for recognition (Cohen, Fraistat, et al. 2009).

Conclusions
The digital humanities face serious if familiar challenges such as faculty engagement,
promotion and tenure concerns, funding, and infrastructure (Burdick, et al. 2012) (Svensson,
Envisioning the Digital Humanities 2012). Most important, stakeholders would benefit from
grappling with collaboration, project management, and sustainability.
Collaboration
Digital humanists frequently work in teams, jettisoning the traditional practice of the
solitary scholar. Interdisciplinarity may add a further wrinkle. “’Collaboration’ is a problematic,
and should be a contested, term,” insists McCarty (Collaborative Research in the Digital
Humanities 2012, 2). The term persists as “a catchphrase heard quite often, but the difficulty is in
carrying it out” (Maron and Pickle 2014, 55). It centers on common understanding of language
and terminology, methods and research styles, theories, and values (Siemens, et al. 2012).
Collaboration operates on a spectrum. “On the one hand,” notes McCarty (2012):
The intense struggle to realize something heretofore unrealized, demanding all one’s
intellectual resources, justifies and demands a researcher’s turn away from the group to
solitude, summoning and dismissing interlocutors as they prove useful, or not, to
whatever formal expression he or she is developing…On the other hand, even in the least
dependent modes of work the goal is to catch someone’s attention, to interest him or her
in what has been made, to provoke a response, even if the maker does not know who this
will be, when or where. The fundamental truth remains: our work is for communication.
This is often best done as a trial, with close and trusted colleagues; a good collaboration
provides a formal, reliable means (Collaborative Research in the Digital Humanities , 4).

85

But many collaborative efforts run aground: “Individuals working in such
interdisciplinary teams often find they are the ‘Other’—working beyond a defined disciplinary
cultural unit, with the need for the construction of roles and responsibilities that allow their skill
sets to be admitted to a working team, rather than behaving, and treating each other, as if they
come from foreign climes” (Terras 2012, 213). Waters (2012) identifies “the not-invented-here
syndrome: the conviction that ‘you and I will collaborate just fine if you adopt my system and
abandon yours.’”
Though some examples of collaboration among DHers and librarians, archivists, and
museum professionals exist, they are rare (Hockey 2012). Collaborative ventures that revolve
around sharing data or tools remain easier to establish and maintain than those that depend upon
sharing knowledge. Such is also the case with projects that aggregate (as opposed to co-create)
resources (D. M. Zorich 2008). “Even in an age of instantaneous and ubiquitous communication
mechanisms,” Zorich (2008) stresses, “highly integrated projects apparently require the frequent
and often innocuous interactions (such as hallway conversations) that occur when collaborators
are co-located rather than geographically dispersed” (45). Collaborations must be continuously
managed. Profitable partnerships arise from common self-interest (Treloar, Choudhury and
Michener 2012).
Siemens observes that research teams need to cultivate trust, consensus, and task
coordination through communication. Differing perspectives, often discipline-related, on the
research problem, method, and terminology can trammel communication, as can the cultural
backgrounds of the researchers. Teams need to allocate tasks, share information and documents,
reach consensus on decisions, and schedule meetings (L. Siemens 2010).

86

As Siemens (2010) details, communication usually takes one or more of three forms.
First, face to face is the richest medium, permitting the apprehension of body and facial cues as
well as immediate feedback. This medium nurtures trust and commitment. In the case of
geographically dispersed teams, however, tradeoffs obtain. Most notably, travel time and costs
can limit the frequency of meetings, thereby impeding decision making. In-person
communication may well be particularly important in a project’s nascency. Yet a project team
can depend more on digital modes of communication if they share a history of collaboration.
Second, email and text-based asynchronous communication such as blogs and wikis offer
benefits and drawbacks. The sender and receiver do not have to be in the same place at the same
time; the method is also inexpensive. On the other hand, asynchronous communication can be
both effortful and time consuming. Moreover, details and nuance may be sacrificed. Finally,
email and similar methods pose potential problems regarding prompt checking of and responding
to emails, particularly when stakeholders work in different time zones (L. Siemens 2010).
Third, conference calls and instant messaging surmount distance problems; they also
allow real time feedback and convey at least some visual cues. Conversely, time delays and
transmission problems can obtrude (L. Siemens 2010).
Over the course of a project, the appropriate balance between digital and face to face will
evolve as research objectives and relationships among team members change. Digital
mechanisms “can supplement, but cannot fully replace the face-to-face in collaboration” (L.
Siemens 2010, 44).
Project Management
Digital humanities projects hinge on adept project management. “Alternative academic
careers can be made or broken on the success or failure of such collaborative projects” (Leon

87

2011). Project management skills include organization, planning and follow up, prioritization,
grant administration, human resources, and conflict resolution. Often characterized as “soft” or
implicit skills, they can resist measurement, which can contribute to their remaining overlooked
(Reed 2014).
Planning, content creation, technical development, technical maintenance, preservation,
dissemination, and storage—all need to be managed. Successful projects receive support from
administrators, communicate with faculty members, partner with campus units, and invest in
skilled personnel and scale solutions (Maron and Pickle 2014).
Collaborative project work remains variable regarding funding, timelines, team
dynamics, and the problems addressed (Leon 2011). Complicating matters, most humanists lack
formal preparation for project management. Hence common failures include scheduling, no
deliverables, or leadership vacuums. To combat these problems, a project team might set forth a
project proposal that includes deliverables and ways they will be achieved, taking into account
the team’s expertise and the resources available. This prevents “failure creep” (Leon 2011).
Appropriate workplans identify deliverables, the steps necessary to meet them, and a
timeline (Leon 2011). Consulting literature such as “12 Basic Principles of Project Management”
and “Ten Rules for Humanities Scholars New to Project Management” can help ground a project
(Croxall 2011) (Nowviskie 2012).
Juggling short- and long-term priorities, the PM deals with organizational structures and
multitasking; she delegates tasks, tracks project work and associated responsibilities, manages
time, conducts efficient meetings, and facilitates communication. Guiding and supervising each
team member, PMs need to know enough about a range of subjects to communicate effectively
with experts in each area (Leon 2011).

88

Yet project managers and other project stakeholders would benefit from focusing not
merely on the early stages of the project. Funding agencies continue to shift “away from models
based on project proliferation and ephemerality and toward an emphasis on preservation and
permanence—at least of data, if not of projects” (Reed 2014). As a project matures, stakeholders
need to consider familiar challenges such as scope creep, “feature creep” (adding gratuitous tool
functionality), and the “educator imperative” (providing gratuitous information to users).
As a project progresses revision gets harder instead of easier: its collective knowledge,
documentation, and workflow become more diffuse as more collaborators contribute. As
McGann (2010) reminds us, “If prophetic forecasting is hazardous, judicious planning is not—
indeed, it’s imperative” (2).
Sustainability
“The problem of sustainability,” Powell (2012) explains, “has shifted dramatically in the
last decade as institutions of higher education, from universities to community colleges, move
towards a more corporate model, which assesses value in terms of profitability and student
preparedness for a new economy” (181). McGann (2010) argues, “A signal failure of online
scholarship has been its reluctance, perhaps its inability, to explain why and how a specific
online project constitutes an important research undertaking” (3). Waltzer (2012) similarly
laments, “Too few digital humanities projects take the extra steps to argue for their generalizable
value or even to create the conditions for broad adoption” (342); “notions of how to establish the
‘value’ of a project are often quite vague” (Maron and Pickle 2014, 5). Indeed, Piez (2011)
asserts, “To argue for our meaning and significance using only language in which meaning and
significance have been reduced to terms in economic formulas, and…to acquiesce in the attempts
gives up any chance of acknowledging the contributions we actually make.”

89

Nearly 50% of respondents (from a sample of four universities) in a recent study not only
used digital tools and collections, but also created such resources. Nearly three-quarters (72%)
planned to develop projects (whether by themselves or in collaboration with others) and nearly
two-thirds (64%) intended their projects to be geared toward public use (Maron and Pickle
2014).
Despite such seemingly propitious numbers, familiar challenges recurred. Faculty
generally lacked end to end project support. Many campus stakeholders fail to realize how digital
humanities work or products bolster institutional goals, much less who should own the outputs.
In this vein, “Few campus faculty or units seem to be regularly measuring usage of DH projects
and few are undertaking activities to increase the impact of the works they have taken on”
(Maron and Pickle 2014, 56).
“Build it, and the experts won’t necessarily come—at least not yet in great numbers,”
Howard (2014) opines. Nonetheless, a case can be made: sustainability remains a “dark but
potent word in the field of digital humanities,” the “elephant in the room” (McGann 2010, 5).
Project management, collaboration, and sustainability—all are of great importance to successful
digital humanities work.
***
The digital humanities perennially reinvent themselves (Alexander and Davis 2012).
Burdick et al. (2012) foresee “A new kind of digital humanist…who combines in-depth training
in a single humanistic subfield with a mix of skills drawn from design, computer science, media
work, curatorial training, and library science” (116).
“Discovery,” observes Burke (2011), “can go on endlessly, and never become clearly
irrelevant or unimportant.” Hence “the limit here is our imagination, not technological

90

possibility” (O'Malley 2010). “If we are indeed experiencing a digital revolution,” Gladney
(2012) insists, “it is only its early days” (213).

and workshops. Last, it sets forth generalizable lessons learned from these initiatives. Existing
curricula offer a useful foundation for new digital curation education initiatives geared toward
digital humanists (Muilenberg, Lebow and Rich 2014).
Digital Curation Education
At the end of the 2000s, digital curation work arrived at a watershed: many stakeholders
acknowledged its importance but too few professionals had the skills necessary to tackle key
technological and administrative challenges (Botticelli, et al. 2011) (Gilliland-Swetland 2000)
(Harvey 2010) (Ray 2009) (Yakel, Conway and Krause 2009). Tibbo (2012) maintains: a “lack
of widespread, long-standing, strong graduate programs in digital archiving, electronic records
management, and data curation lie at the core of the neglect of much of our nation’s digital
heritage and institutional records” (25). Lynch (2014) insists, “The availability and development
of the necessary skills and expertise in the workforce will be a serious problem” (399) and Lyon
and Brenner (2015) underline the “emerging data talent gap.”
A recent report underlined “a shortage of digitally literate professionals and increasing
demand from employers seeking professionals to manage digital collections in libraries,
museums, media organizations, public offices, research institutions, hospitals, law firms, and
private companies” (Education Advisory Board 2014, 4). National employer demand increased
by more than 50% between H1 2010 and H1 2013 and by 10% between H2 2013 and H1 2014
(Education Advisory Board 2014). The National Research Council of the National Academies
(2015) posits, “Although the number and breadth of educational opportunities supporting digital
curation have grown, existing capacity is low, especially for the initial education of professional

94

digital curators and the midcareer training of professionals with credentials in another field” (4).
Ultimately, the need for digital curation education and training is more urgent than ever: digital
curation education practices and programs are incipient (Adamick, Reznik-Zellen and Sheridan
2013) (Pomerantz, et al. 2009). LIS programs can play a pivotal role in skilling up digital
curation professionals.
Digital Humanities Education
Specific educational programs in the digital humanities include undergraduate, Master’s,
and doctoral degrees as well as workshops. Educational programs in the digital humanities based
in North America are perhaps less mature and more dispersed in the digital humanities than in
digital curation. Hirsch (2012) calls attention to “bracketing”: the “almost systematic relegation
of the word ‘teaching’ (or its synonyms) to the status of afterthought, tacked-on to a statement
about the digital humanities after the word ‘research’ (or its synonyms), often in parentheses”
(5). Bracketing buttresses “an antagonistic distinction between teaching and research, in which
the time, effort, and funding spent on the one cannibalizes the opportunities of the other” (Hirsch
2012, 5). Brier (2012) similarly worries, “this recent rush toward the technological new has
tended to focus too narrowly…on the academic research and publication aspects of the digital
humanities, in the process reinforcing disciplinary ‘siloes’ and traditional academic issues while
also minimizing and often obscuring the larger implications of DH for how we teach in
universities and colleges and how we prepare the next generation of graduate students for careers
inside and outside the academy” (390).
Though many scholars muse on how best to teach digital humanities, few best practices
have emerged (Hirsch 2012) (Scholtz 2011). “Although there are an increasing number of digital
humanities graduate programs,” Spiro (2012) observes, “the community has not yet reached wide

95

consensus on what the digital humanities curriculum should include, nor has much research been
published on digital humanities education” (Opening Up Digital Humanities Education, 338).
Many DHers relegate pedagogy to second-class status (Brier 2012) or frame it as ancillary to
information technology (Fyfe 2011). But pedagogy is crucial in establishing and consolidating an
academic field or discipline (Hirsch 2012) (Warwick 2012).
The need to incorporate digital curation into the digital humanities (and vice versa) is
pressing. Senseney et al. (2014) posit, “More fully integrating data curation into digital research
involves fluency with topics such as publication and information sharing practices, descriptive
standards, metadata formats, and the technical characteristics of digital data.” Only one digital
humanities educational initiatives—the Digital Humanities Data Curation (DHDC) Institutes—
out of twelve examined specifically address digital curation in their agenda.43
Digital Curation Professionals
Digital curation professionals represent “the human element of a knowledge
infrastructure supporting contemporary scholarly practices and are key to developing and
sustaining a global system of interoperable digital data and tools across the natural, physical, and
social sciences, as well as the humanities” (Weber, Palmer and Chao 2012, 307). The National
Research Council of the National Academies (2015) concludes, “The knowledge and skills

Based on an extensive review of the literature, I examined 12 North American digital humanities education
initiatives. They include: McMaster University’s Humanities Media and Computing Center Multimedia Degree
Program (Rockwell and Sinclair, Acculturation and the Digital Humanities Community 2012) (Sinclair and
Rockwell 2012), New York University’s Archives and Public History (MA) (Wosh, Hajo and Katz 2012), Loyola
University’s MA in Digital Humanities, University of Alberta’s MA in Humanities Computing (Sinclair and
Gouglas 2002) (Sinclair and Rockwell 2012), the Digital Humanities Data Curation (DHDC) Institutes (Senseney, et
al. 2014), the University of Victoria’s Digital Humanities Summer Institute (Bialkowski, Niles and Galey 2011)

required of those engaged in digital curation are dynamic and highly interdisciplinary. They
include an integrated understanding of computing and information science, librarianship,
archival practice, and the disciplines and domains generating and using data” (78).
Perhaps unsurprisingly, information-related jobs remain heterogeneous: many
professionals found their careers fortuitously (Pryor and Donnelly 2009). Most are either domain
experts who picked up data skills over the course of their career or began as computer scientists
who attained domain knowledge. A recent study of contributors to four scholarly venues
(International Journal of Digital Curation, the International Digital Curation Conference, the
DigCCurr Conference, and the International conference on the Preservation of Digital Objects)
found that while nearly 40 percent (39.6%) of the 139 respondents with master’s degrees earned
them in Library Science, Information Science, or LIS, a quarter (25.2% or 35) earned theirs in
Computer Science, Engineering, or Applied Mathematics and 28.8% (40) earned theirs in Arts or
Humanities. Moreover, nearly as many of those 77 respondents with PhDs earned them in
Computer Science, Engineering, or Applied Mathematics (29.9%) as in LIS (28.6%) (Poole, Lee,
et al. 2013).
Respondents were asked to describe up to three disciplines in which they classified their
research. While many of the 119 respondents included “digital” in their descriptions, the term
“digital curation” appeared infrequently: only fourteen times in 304 total responses. Finally, the
most common terms used in respondents’ presentation or journal article titles included “digital,”
“preservation,” “data,” “curation,” and “information.” But participants used the phrase “digital
curation” quite infrequently (57 of 607 titles) (Poole, Lee, et al. 2013). A recent report similarly
asserted, “No single occupational category for digital curators and no precise mapping between
the knowledge and skills needed for digital curation and existing professions, careers, or job

97

titles” (National Research Council of the National Academies 2015, 1). In training as well as in
scholarship, digital curation persists as an amorphous area.
The Role for Library and Information Science
Findings such as those of Poole et al. suggest that digital curation stakeholders’ career
preparation should be anchored in iSchool and Library and Information Science curricula. LIS
programs focus uniquely on “the full landscape of scientific information and the interactions
therein, and with the provision of services to exploit that base” (Palmer, Heidorn, et al. 2007,
37). LIS programs instill humanistic, social science, and technological literacy (Shilton,
Ambacher, et al. 2013).
As Pryor (2012) reflects, however, “The library schools in our universities may provide a
sound education in what is broadly described as knowledge management or information
management, but training in the intricacies of web search engines, information systems and
database design does not properly equip the new professionals with an outlook that will fit them
for a role as data manager in a research intensive university” (15). Exacerbating the situation,
“most data management-related curricula are not openly accessible and are not targeted for
students outside of information science programs” (Piorun, et al. 2012, 47). Hence Lyon and
Brenner (2015) call for a “transformative re-engineering of data education, training and skills
production to keep pace with market demands for data talent” (119).
But teaching digital curation involves wrestling with “an immature discipline
characterized by fluid professional boundaries and uncertainty in the development of vital
infrastructure” (Botticelli, et al. 2011, 149). Teaching efforts are recently minted and few in
number (Jahnke and Asher 2012) and many local variables demand consideration (Moles and
Ross 2013). Educators need to prepare students for multiple and evolving roles and

98

responsibilities: digital curation curricula are never finalized (C. A. Lee 2009), particularly given
the pace of technological change (J. Bastian, R. Harvey, et al. 2010, 244) (Botticelli, et al. 2011)
(Weber, Palmer and Chao 2012).
It is far from evident that LIS programs are keeping up with demand (Creamer, Morales,
et al. 2012) (Gregory and Guss 2011) (Harris-Pierce and Liu 2012). Corrall (2012) calls curricula
coverage “limited and uneven” (120) but Bastian and her colleagues (2011) point out, “a number
of viable models are developing” (616). Least sanguine, Jahnke and Asher (2012) characterize
LIS as largely “a closed circuit, providing concentrations within tracks restricted to LIS
enrollees” (39). LIS programs also find themselves competing for students and resources with
computer science programs and Management Information Systems programs (Tibbo 2015).
Of 58 accredited Library and Information Science programs in North America, 13 (22%)
offer a course in data management or curation (Creamer, Morales, et al. 2012). In April of 2015,
I conducted an environmental scan of the websites of all 58 ALA-accredited Library and
Information Science programs in the United States and Canada. I searched the sites for courses
whose titles contained the term “curation.” I made one exception: based on the DigCCurr project,
I knew that Simmons College prefers the term “stewardship” to the term “curation.” Similarly, I
examined each website looking for course titles including “digital humanities.” Twenty-one
offered a course in digital curation and nine offered a course in digital humanities.

There seems considerable potential for those schools offering both digital curation and
digital humanities courses to collaborate.
Key Initiatives: Capacity-building, Specializations, Certificates, and Workshops
The following sections discuss each of the four major classes of digital curation
education initiatives. For each type of initiative, the section discusses deliverables (in the class of
capacity-building programs), required courses or modules (these suggest key topics included in
each initiative), and lessons learned.
To locate capacity-building initiatives, Master’s degrees, specializations, and certificates,
I examined all LIS programs that offered courses with the term “curation” in the title and looked

101

to see if they were part of a larger initiatives such as a specialization or certificate.45 To locate
key workshop offerings, I relied upon sources I identified as part or preparing for my
comprehensive exam and developing my dissertation proposal literature review.
A caveat is necessary: information on programs was not always available, despite an
exhaustive search of the literature and of the program websites. This suggests the need for further
efforts to disseminate information about available programs to potential stakeholders. Supplying
such information might also promote collaboration among initiatives. Last, the overriding
commonality among programs is their diversity. Again, the need for coordination persists,
particularly in aligning course or module topics and desired competencies.
Capacity-building
Ten educational initiatives have focused on capacity building (Table 5). All are based in
Library and Information Science programs.

As such, I chose not to include San Jose State University’s MARA, the University of Texas-Austin’s Preservation
Studies Specialization or its Certificate of Advanced Study in Preservation Studies, Syracuse University’s
Certificate of Advanced Study in Data Science, or Berkeley’s Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS).
These programs are not explicitly linked to digital curation courses. Second, I did not include SAA’s Digital
Archives Specialist Curriculum and Certificate (DAS) because it is not affiliated with an ALA-accredited program.
Finally, I chose not to include King’s College’s MA in Digital Curation because it falls outside the scope of North
American digital curation education.

Lessons Learned
Five outcomes were common to at least four of the eight initiatives. First, as might be
expected from capacity-building initiatives, five programs engaged in curriculum development.
Second, five programs also foregrounded practical experience that allowed their students to
apply classroom knowledge to real-world settings. Tibbo (2015) maintains, “Perhaps the greatest
challenge for graduate programs is to provide students with consistently meaningful internships
and other hands-on experiences” (150); other capacity-building programs’ stakeholders concur
(Mayernik, et al. 2015) (Moen, et al. 2012). Third, in their publications or on their websites, five
of the eight programs advertised the opportunities they provide for professional development.
Such professional development allows students to become steeped in various communities of
practice and to obtain hands-on digital curation experience in those domains. On the other hand,
it also may alert researchers and institutions to the key roles that digital curation professionals
trained in LIS schools can play. Fourth, five initiatives developed a model or sharable
deliverable, suggesting these programs’ interest in developing a common foundation for digital

108

curation education. Fifth, capacity-building initiatives may give students valuable exposure to
and experience in collaboration—a hallmark not only of digital curation work, but also of much
current research and scholarship in both the sciences and the humanities.
Four other outcomes were emphasized by more than one program. Three programs
sought to develop new courses: UNC DigCCurr I and II developed Understanding Information
Technology for Digital Collections and iRODS Rule Construction as well as special topics
seminars on digital curation, while Science Links2 developed an undergraduate interdisciplinary
course on Environmental Information Science. Three programs sought to stimulate new research:
DCEP, DigCCurr II, and DCERC. Finally, two programs engaged in certificate development:
DigCCurr I (Graduate Certificate in Digital Curation) and iCAMP (Graduate Academic
Certificate in Digital Curation and Data Management) and two premised recruitment of diverse
populations (DCEP-H and CHART).
Not to be overlooked, two of these capacity-building efforts, UNC’s and UIUC’s,
resulted in curriculum offerings, namely the Master’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Curation,
the Post-Master’s Certificate in Data Curation (both at UNC), and the Specialization in Data
Curation (UIUC). Whether other recent programs such as iCAMP or SciData, both of whose
grant funding ended in 2014, can parlay their grant-funded projects into similar sustainable
curriculum offerings remains to be seen.

Lessons Learned
Specializations in digital curation suggest two lessons. First, a curriculum should
consider how best to balance courses, practice-based internships, and a technological
infrastructure (Yakel, Conway and Hedstrom, et al. 2011). Second, as Yakel et al. (2011) argue
based on the University of Michigan’s work, a digital curation professional would do well to
understand hybrid media environments and a lifecycle approach to information management.

Lessons Learned
Certificate programs suggest, first, that a program may profit from being structured
around the curatorial lifecycle stages.71 Second, any field experience component would likely be
enhanced by producing concreate deliverables that add value to the assets of the host institution
and can be added to the student’s vita.72 Finally, if the educational program takes place online,
program designers might consider employing a variety of media to accommodate different
learning styles. For instance, DigIn incorporates hands-on technological demonstrations,
Elluminate synchronous video conferencing, or and audio podcasting of lectures.73
Workshops
Six workshops provide digital curation education to graduate students, faculty, or
researchers (Table 16). Three of the six are based upon the New England Collaborative Data
Management Curriculum (NECDMC) developed by the University of Massachusetts-Amherst
and Worcester Polytechnic Institute Libraries (Kafel, Creamer and Martin 2014) (Piorun, et al.
2012).74

Mode of
Delivery
On campus

The New England Collaborative Data Management Curriculum (NECDMC) employs the following modules:
Overview of Research Data Management; Types, Format, and Stages of Data; Contextual Details Needed to Make
Data Meaningful to Others; Data Storage, Backup, and Security; Legal and Ethical Considerations for Research
Data; Data Sharing and Reuse Policies; and Archiving and Preservation. “Perhaps the greatest achievement of the
NECDMC is its attempt to standardize instruction around the unwieldy topic of research data management” (Peters
and Vaughn 2014, 99). On the other hand, the NECDMC needs to be modified to apply to those outside of sciences
and engineering (Peters and Vaughn 2014).

Lessons Learned
Nine lessons can be gleaned from digital curation education workshops. First, librarians
have a potentially foundational role in educating students, researchers, and faculty in digital
curation work. Second, retention may prove an important issue. For instance, one workshop
found a considerable gap between interest in the workshops and retention: 78 persons registered
but only 35 showed up to the first session (Muilenberg, Lebow and Rich 2014). Third, sessions

geared toward particular disciplines may be more valuable to participants than general ones
(Eaker 2014) (Peters and Vaughn 2014). Fourth, active learning or hands-on work can play an
important role (Peters and Vaughn 2014). Fifth, educational initiatives may be enriched by
effecting cross-campus collaborations (Peters and Vaughn 2014). Sixth, discussion-based
training and resources can help researchers familiarize themselves with data management plans
and planning (Johnston, Lafferty and Petsan 2012) (Peters and Vaughn 2014). Seventh, planners
might weigh a program’s optimal duration: while shorter workshops may facilitate both planning
and delivery, lengthier ones may permit digital curation to be covered in greater depth, they are
more difficult to coordinate as well as to deliver (Eaker 2014). Eighth, among the five initiatives
discussed in this chapter, workshops have done perhaps the best job in securing feedback from
their participants. Therefore, evaluation mechanisms can be helpful in program development.81
Finally, digital curation education geared toward the digital humanities shows two further
complications. First, curators who work in the digital humanities show considerable diversity in
their job descriptions and their professional identities. Second, dealing with digital humanities
data remains particularly challenging because of its format, its anticipated future use, and its
methodological “texture” that requires documentation (Senseney, et al. 2014).
Overall Lessons Learned
Useful lessons can be extracted from comparing, contrasting, and ultimately synthesizing
these 30 programs’ efforts.

81

Specific feedback obtained from workshops included requests from participants for more focus on familiar
granular issues: 1) types, formats, and stages of data; 2) organization and description; 3) deposit, backup, security,
and storage; 4) file naming; 5) metadata; 6) citation management tools; 7) funder policies; 8) archiving and
preservation; 9) finding and exploiting datasets for research; 10) publishing datasets; and 11) legal and ethical issues
(Adamick, Reznik-Zellen, & Sheridan, 2013) (Peters & Vaughn, 2014).

119

First, planners might benefit from considering existing programs’ topical foci. Nineteen
of the 30 programs list required courses. Table 17 shows the ten most-frequently mentioned
topics based on course titles.

Although these criteria are helpful heuristics for planning, Moles and Ross (2013) remind
us, “The almost countless number of variables that need to be given consideration in the
development and execution of curation programs will inevitably vary widely even between
similar circumstances” (16).
Conclusion
Teal and her colleagues (2015) remark, “Ideally, training would be high quality with
materials vetted by practiced instruction, consistent across universities and locations, could be
deployed at multiple and disparate locations, allow researchers to interact with the materials and
the instructors, and provide a relatively easy entry in to learning new topics” (136). In similar
spirit, Lyon and Brenner (2015) look toward digital curation initiatives to make the transition
“from specializations or special topics, to become embedded within the core curriculum and are
viewed as central to the mission, or to put it another way, data is mission-critical for iSchools”
(119). “Graduate-level programs are springing up although no one curricular model is as of yet

128

dominant,” suggests Tibbo (2015, 151). Most optimistic, a CLIR report (2013) predicts a
“national blossoming of professional curricula and certification programs for data curation” (10).
Much work remains to be done to fulfill this vision.
“Professional education is a process that is never completed” comment Lee and Tibbo
(2011, 167). Parry (2014) contributes, “These are early days in a process of defamiliarization.”
Just as the digital curation profession remains “a moving target,” so too does digital humanities.
Thus both pedagogical fields represent, as Pryor (2013) puts it, a “maturing process of
engagement.” This dissertation seeks to promote that process of maturation.

Chapter 5: Research Methods

The purpose of a research inquiry is to “resolve” the problem in the sense of
accumulating sufficient knowledge to lead to understanding or explanation, a kind
of dialectical process that plays off the theoretical and antithetical propositions
that form the problem into some kind of synthesis.
-Lincoln & Guba (1985), 227

The key purpose of undertaking research is to advance society and its
understanding across a range of disciplines.

This study employed qualitative methods situated in a naturalistic setting. Favoring
emergent research design, it adopted a case study approach. It relied upon semi-structured
interviews guided by snowball sampling; it supplemented interview data with documentary
evidence. Finally, it embraced inductive and iterative coding methods and constructivist
grounded theory analysis.
Research Questions
Research questions concentrate on professional practice or add to the knowledge of the
field. My research questions addressed both of these goals. Research questions hinge upon

130

problem identification, i.e. “unsatisfactory” situations (Wildemuth, Developing a Research
Question 2009).
My research questions gestated in my scholarly interests in digital curation and digital
humanities.82 Humanities increasingly engage with digital data; this shift toward data-driven
research can be enabled and augmented through digital curation. Thus I pinpointed a gap—an
“unsatisfactory” situation in the literature and in practice, namely that the potential for symbiosis
between the two fields had not yet been explored.
This dissertation centered on the following research questions:


What types of data have digital humanists (whether faculty, “alternative-academics,”83
(alt-acs) or graduate students) created, reused, stored, and planned to reuse in their SUG
project?



What digital curation skills (if any) did they employ and how did they acquire them?



Are digital humanists interested in acquiring skills to help curate their data and if so, what
content would they like to learn?



What sort of educational framework would be most useful to help them learn more about
curating their data?

Participants: The Office of Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants
This study focused on members of project teams that received National Endowment for
the Humanities’s Office of Digital Humanities’s Start-Up Grants (SUGs).84 I derived my sample

82

My coursework and my DigCCurr II (2010-2013) fellowship responsibilities were also important influences.

As Bethany Nowviskie puts it, “The #alt-ac label speaks to a broad set of hybrid, humanities-oriented professions
centered in and around the academy, in which there are rich opportunities to put deep—often doctoral-level—
training in scholarly disciplines to use.” See http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-alt-ac-track-negotiating-youralternative-academic-appointment-2/26539

from the larger population (more than 360 as of the end of the 2014 grant cycle) of NEH-ODH
Start-Up Grants awarded since 2007. In line with my interest in studying recent and memorable
experiences, I focused on the 23 SUGs slated for completion in 2014.
Up to eighteen months in duration, SUGs offer monies “to support the initial phases of
projects offering innovative approaches to the use of emerging technologies in the humanities.”85
Competitively awarded (16% success rate), these grants fund United States-based scholars whose
project embrace a “high risk/high reward” model characteristic of the natural sciences.
To maximize the likelihood of interviewee recall, I focused on the 23 SUGs that began in
May of 2013 and were slated to be completed by the end of 2014 (no-cost extensions
notwithstanding). I approached the Principal Investigators (34 in total) of each of these 23
projects as my initial contacts.
Ultimately, I secured participation by representatives from nineteen of those 23 projects.
After interviewing each initial participant, I requested referrals to other project stakeholders (a
form of snowball sampling). PIs most frequently referred me to their graduate students, though
some referred me to librarians or to others involved in the project. I interviewed 45 scholars, 44
of whom are based in the United States.
Sampling
Pickard (2013) maintains, “The outcomes, rigor, and trustworthiness of your research all
rely on the robustness of the sample and how that sample was identified (66). Qualitative
inquiry, she elaborates, usually employs purposive sampling. Three considerations guided my
sampling strategy. First, purposive sampling dovetailed with emergent design. The successive

85

http://www.neh.gov/files/grants/digital-humanities-start-faqs_2014.pdf

132

chosen units, moreover, complemented the data already gathered, provided contrasting data, or
filled in gaps. Third, sampling continued to the point of redundancy (Lincoln and Guba 1985).
Taking a user-centered approach, I posed “viewpoint-driven” questions, focusing on the
actual information practices of a sample of researchers working in the digital humanities.
(Benardou, Constantopoulos, et al. 2010). My recruitment script is available in Appendix B.
Snowball Sampling
Among the methods that exploits social networks, snowball sampling presupposes that
ties exist between the initial persons initially consulted and others in the same target population.
Snowball sampling allows a researcher to ferret out participants where they are few in number or
difficult to locate or when higher levels of trust are needed to initiate participation (Atkinson and
Flint 2004, 1044). On the other hand, snowball sampling necessitates that participants know
others similar to themselves who are eligible for the study (Morgan 2008).
The investigator first contacts and interviews key informants involved with informationrich cases. Based on my goal of developing recommendations and best practices for digital
curation education, I chose to contact SUG project participants. These researchers represent a
core group of those digital humanities researchers that digital curation education initiatives may
serve.
First, I contacted SUG PIs. These original sources consented to interview requests,
referred me to other project personnel, or both. I thus could not generalize from my sample,
therefore: its elements depended upon the judgment of earlier respondents.
Over the course of the research, the investigator controls the sample’s start, progress, and
close (Biernacki and Waldorf 1981). I found this true in general, though I was beholden to the

133

schedules and commitment of each member of the sample. As data collection proceeded, so too
did analysis.
The sampling process continues until an adequate sample size is reached, no new names
are collected from the process, or when the data become repetitive (known as saturation in
grounded theory) (Pickard 2013). Specifically, I focused on saturation of my categories, where
“continuing data collection produces tiny increments of new information in comparison to the
effort expended to get them” (Lincoln and Guba 1985, 350). Rubin and Rubin (2005) elaborate:
As you continue to interview people from each of the relevant categories, each new conversation
should add less and less to what you already know, until all you start hearing are the same
matters over and over again” (67).
Since I did not stipulate a predetermined sample size, I focused on the latter two criteria
(names and repetitive data). My work covered nineteen projects and 45 persons; as Weiss (1994)
notes pithily, “when further inquiry will add little to the story, stop inquiring” (21).
Rationale for Qualitative Research and a Naturalistic Approach
Qualitative research offers “richer opportunities for gathering and assessing…what the
participant values, believes, thinks, and feels about social life” (Saldana 2013, 92). A qualitative
approach may be particularly useful when research foci are clear, when the settings are not easily
accessible, when the researcher faces time constraints, and when the research focuses on more
than one topic (Taylor and Bogdan 1998). Qualitative research often focuses on exploration,
description, and comparison (Bernard and Ryan 2010).
Naturalistic Inquiry
The naturalistic paradigm accommodates heterogeneity, ambiguity, and reflexivity. It
presupposes qualitative methods, emergent design, a human instrument, focused boundaries and

134

purposive sampling, inductive, grounded data analysis, idiographic interpretation, and case study
reporting mode (Lincoln and Guba 1985). Thus it was well-suited to this study.
The Case Study Approach
Optimal for naturalistic studies, case studies constitute “interpretive instrument[s] for an
idiographic construal of what was found” (Lincoln and Guba 1985, 189). Researchers employ
case studies to tackle “how” and “why” questions (i.e. in a natural setting) (Choemprayong and
Wildemuth 2009) (Yin 2009). Case studies “provide lots of descriptive data, are lifelike, and
simplify the data that a reader has to assess” (Bernard and Ryan 2010, 43). Moreover, case
studies are useful for description and results may be leveraged to improve actions decisions
(King 1994) (Sholtz and Tietje 2002).
First, a case study probes contemporary phenomenon in depth and in real-life contexts.
Exploring the most recent round of ODH Start-Up Grant projects constituted just such an
inquiry. Second, the researcher relies on multiple sources of evidence (viz., data convergence)
(Yin 2009). I obtained multiple perspectives by using multiple methods of data collection, by
gathering data based on multiple units of analysis, and by aggregating it to understand the case as
a whole (Choemprayong and Wildemuth 2009). Not to be overlooked, finally, the investigator
must demarcate the beginning and the end of the case. Choosing grant projects with explicit
temporal boundaries satisfied this criterion.
Units of analysis may include individuals, decisions, programs, implementation
processes, and organizational changes; they also may include aggregates (groups or
organizations), projects, events, and artifacts and changes to artifacts (Choemprayong and
Wildemuth 2009) (C. A. Lee 2005) (Yin 2009). My units of analysis included actors, projects,
project teams, and artifacts and changes to artifacts. Actors have agency in the Start-Up Grant

135

projects; actors included individuals and project teams. Projects were the nineteen Start-Up
Grants whose personnel consented to interviews. Artifacts were units of textual and media
materials. Finally, changes to artifacts were changes (revisions, additions, subtractions) in those
artifacts over time, for instance changes in project plans or project plans or outcomes.
Research Design
In naturalistic studies, research design remains emergent. Therefore, “Probably all that
can be promised in advance is that ‘understanding will be increased,’ and that that increase will
be noticeable to a variety of audiences” (Lincoln and Guba 1985, 225). Raising awareness and
enhancing understanding remain a crucial goal of this dissertation. An emergent design suited
this study because little scholarship tackles the potential for collaboration among digital curation
professionals and digital humanities scholars in their work and in their education.
Trustworthiness
A study’s worth essentially depends upon its trustworthiness. Investigators should verify
the accuracy of accounts, welcome negative evidence, and look for alternative explanations
(Bernard and Ryan 2010).
First, internal validity refers to the sample’s representativeness with respect to the overall
population of inquiry. Snowball sampling militates against generalizability. I did not use
statistical verification to confirm findings from my 45 interviews; rather, I relied upon
triangulation, which can “potentially generate…‘holistic work’ or ‘thick description’” (Jick
1979, 609).
I interviewed more than one person from each project whenever possible, hoping that this
would shed light on shared work practices and priorities. Similarly, I consulted multiple

136

document types about each project and I asked interviewees about the same project but in
different ways (i.e. by posing multiple questions during each interview).
Second, external validity refers to the extent to which the data measure what the
researcher claims. The investigator can generalize from case studies only theoretically:
transferability needs to be reassessed in each case. I used both documents and interviews to
acquire a more complete picture.
Finally, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approved my application in July of 2014. Similarly, I secured informed consent from each
participant before conducting each interview.
Data Collection
In constructing data, an investigator homes in on actions and processes, especially on
who did what, when, where, why, and how. The investigator examines contexts, situations, and
conditions under which actions and processes occurred. She remains sensitive to telling words
and phrases and to participants’ tacit assumptions (Charmaz 2014).
In line with Charmaz’s prescriptions, I collected interview and documentary data to
understand the range of contexts immanent in my study and to show the variation of participants’
views and actions over time. Similarly, I achieved multiple views of participants’ actions and I
parlayed my data into the development of analytic categories amenable to comparison.
Goals of thoroughness, accuracy, believability, and transparency steered my data
collection as well as my overall research agenda (Rubin and Rubin 2005). First, thoroughness
involves not only the exploration of novel paths, but also continual redesign, alternative
explanation testing, and following referrals. Second, accuracy involves describing and explaining
a phenomenon such that participants understanding the researcher’s depiction of their world.

137

Third, believability emanates from demonstrating that the researcher has not been misled by
memory, flawed evidence, or participant bias. Fourth, transparency permits the audience “to
assess the thoroughness of the design of the work as well as the conscientiousness, sensitivity,
and biases of the researcher” (Rubin and Rubin 2005, 76).

Rationale for Qualitative Interviewing
Qualitative interviewing depends upon understanding experiences and upon
reconstructing events (Rubin and Rubin 2005). Interviews allow an investigator to integrate
multiple perspectives, to discern processes, and to develop holistic descriptions (Weiss 1994). Its
practitioners “expect people to see somewhat different things, examine them through distinct
lenses, and come to somewhat different conclusions” (Rubin and Rubin 2005, 27). This was
evident when I compared interviews from multiple persons working on the same Start-Up Grant
project.
Qualitative interviews are well-suited to a constructivist grounded theory approach.
Charmaz (2014) suggests, “Constructivist grounded theorists attend to the situation and
construction of the interview, the construction of the research participant’s story and silences,
and the interviewer-participant relationship as well as the explicit content of the interview” (91).
I focused on fostering mutuality and teasing out the participant’s definitions of terms, her
assumptions, and her understanding of situations and events (Charmaz 2014).
Semistructured interviews combine flexibility and control; the interviewer and the
participant co-construct the conversation (Charmaz 2014). In particular, the interviewer may
tweak the order and the details of topics. Hence she gives some control to the interviewee. Still,

138

the interviewer asks nearly the same if not the same questions to each interviewee, so
comparisons across interviews are possible (Bernard and Ryan 2010).
By conducting semi-structured interviews based on a 21-question instrument, I targeted
the meanings digital humanists ascribe to the experiences, actions, and processes in their daily
working lives as seen through the lens of their particular Start-Up Grant project. I focused my
interview questions on the interviewees’ most recent project (i.e. their NEH-ODH Start-Up Grant
scheduled for completion in 2014) to maximize the likelihood of their recalling information
accurately. These interviews yielded focused data for developing conceptual categories. My
questionnaire is available in Appendix A.
I followed this instrument over the course of my 45 interviews, making only one notable
modification. When I initially contacted PIs, several asked to look at my interview instrument;
they then informed me that they had nothing to contribute. I felt that my inability to go through
the instrument with them and explain key terms (e.g. “data”) and provide context as to my goals
deterred them from participating. As a result, I chose not to provide the instrument in advance to
subsequent interviewees. This also allowed me a certain useful flexibility during the interview.
Depending upon the flow of the interview, I adjusted the order of my questions slightly. But
ultimately, the interview instrument as originally constructed generated rich data.
The Interview Process
To combat potentially formulaic responses, I asked each of my 45 interviewees to define
her terms and to expand upon her responses (Rubin and Rubin 2005). “Each new interview
can…be a test, the results of which will support the minitheory, discredit it, or, most likely,
require that it be augmented or qualified” (Weiss 1994, 179). I sought to capture detail, depth,
nuance, and vividness in each of my interviews.

139

Detail involves drawing out specifics from the interviewee to understand the unexpected;
depth involves picking up explanations from participants with diverse opinions and experiences.
To gain nuance, the researcher elicits descriptions showing “that things are not always true or not
true, that they may be true in part, or true in some circumstances or at some times” (Rubin and
Rubin 2005, 132). Finally, a vivid interview leads to a report that will engage its readers
emotionally as well as intellectually.
Interviews proceed through five stages. In the introduction, the researcher establishes the
grounds for a positive and empathetic relationship. I did so by researching each interviewee’s
background, scholarship, and research interests as well as her particular roles and responsibilities
in her SUG project. Additionally, I answered any questions the interviewee had, described my
work and how her interview data contributed to it, and thanked the interviewee for her time.
Next, the researcher introduces easy, non-threatening questions while underscoring her
interest in the interviewee and the interviewee’s knowledge. I did this by asking broad questions
about the grant and the person’s role in it. Third, the researcher segues into tougher questions; in
this study, such questions centered on specific work done on the grant, its outcomes, and lessons
learned. Fourth, the researcher eases herself and the interviewee down into less stressful
questions; she may request documents at this point. I asked for referrals at this stage, requested
data management plans, and answered any questions posed by the interviewee. Finally, the
interview closes: the researcher thanks her participants and arranges for possible follow-up. I
reiterated my appreciation to the interviewee and ensured that she would be willing to expand
upon or clarify any of her answers (Rubin and Rubin 2005).
Given memory’s flaws, interview data is scarcely unimpeachable. I countered possible
bias in three ways. First, I focused on things participants remembered well, namely on critical

140

incidents centering on motivations, perceptions, and attitudes. Second, I relied on external
sources of documentation, namely materials collected by the Office of Digital Humanities from
grantees such as applications, reports, and White Papers. Finally, I resorted to multiple data
collection and analysis techniques.
Data Collection
Interviews took place between August and November of 2014. I used the telephone and
Skype as my primary data collection mechanisms. Deakin and Wakefield (2014) observe: “the
face-to-face interview has become somewhat of a ‘gold standard’ (604). Nonetheless, “there is
no need to consider the use of telephones for narrative interviewing as a ‘second-best’ option”
(Holt 2010, 120). Phone interviews may be especially effective when the investigator employs a
purposive sampling strategy (Block and Erskine 2012).
Phone interviews allowed me to reduce costs, to increase the geographical reach of my
study, and to make efficient use of time (Block and Erskine 2012). On the other hand, in some
cases it seemed slightly more difficult to establish trust with an interviewee, likely due to a lack
of visual cues (eye contact, facial expressions, and body language) (Block and Erskine 2012). At
times I needed to direct conversations more explicitly because of the lack of visual clues (Holt
2010). Overall, I conducted 34 interviews (35 persons) over the phone.
In addition to the telephone, I relied upon Skype, which allowed me to communicate with
and to see participants in real time. I conducted seven interviews (including eight persons)
through this medium. As with the telephone, Skype interviewing requires that the investigator
deliver a short scripted passage acquiring verbal consent; in neither medium is this necessarily
conducive to building trust or rapport prior to the interview (Deakin and Wakefield 2014). Skype
may prove technologically less reliable than the telephone, namely in its “drop-outs.” I

141

experienced drop-outs in three of the seven Skype interviews. Finally, I conducted two
interviews via email (Burns 2010). More specifically, I sent my interview instrument to each
participants and she answered the questions to the best of her ability before sending the
document back.
Documentary Evidence
Documents offer historical insight; they may also provide information not available in
spoken form (Hodder 2000). Documents are available, stable, rich (viz., context-grounded),
legally unassailable, and nonreactive (Lincoln and Guba 1985). They may prove more accurate
than self-reports (Wildemuth, Existing Documents and Artifacts as Data 2009).
Charmaz (2014) asserts: “A study of what a document does can include the following: 1)
what its originators intended to accomplish; 2) the process of producing the document; 3) what
and whom the document affects; 4) how various audiences interpret it; 5) how, when, and to
what extent these audiences use the document” (46).
But documents have limitations. First, the investigator cannot control the documents’
scope, the way they were created, or whether they remain extant. Second, to capture the full
meaning of the document, the investigator needs to apprehend the social context of the
document’s creation (C. A. Lee 2005) (Wildemuth, Existing Documents and Artifacts as Data
2009). Finally, documents fall prey to intentional and unintentional error as well as to possible
manipulation by the creator (likely to her advantage) (Lincoln and Guba 1985).
I used documentary evidence to complement the data I obtained through qualitative
interviews. First, material from my literature reviews established an analytical foundation for my
empirical research. Second, I reviewed each interviewee’s basic information, for instance her
scholarship, institutional affiliation, program, and degree. Third, though some personnel shared

142

their grant applications with me, in most cases I relied upon Freedom of Information Act
requests to the National Endowment for the Humanities. Of particular interest, each applicant
submits a two-page data management plan that addresses the type(s) of data to be generated and
the management strategies to be pursued regarding those data.86 I also reviewed the completed
projects’ White Papers, available grant products (e.g. software code, algorithms, digital tools,
articles, research notes, websites, and project schematics), any media coverage or reviews that
concentrated on the grants, and any publications the grants produced.
Data Analysis
Analysis constitutes “the essential qualitative act” (Bernard and Ryan 2010, 109). It
begins even before the investigator embarks upon a project; “purely” inductive studies are
impossible (Bernard and Ryan 2010).
The less a researcher knows about a problem, the more important it is for her to assume
an inductive approach (Bernard and Ryan 2010). Bernard and Ryan (2010) elaborate: “As you
develop ideas, you test them against your observations; your observations may then modify your
ideas, which then need to be tested again, and so on” (109).
Inductive analysis rests upon unitizing and categorizing. Through unitizing (coding), the
investigator renders raw data into units, i.e. single discrete pieces of information, e.g. sentences
or paragraphs. Second, categorizing involves grouping unitized data to offer descriptive or
inferential information about contexts in which the units were developed. It effectively mirrors
the constant comparative approach (Lincoln and Guba 1985).

143

Grounded Theory
The interviews were transcribed and open coded (Saldana 2013). While not embracing a
full Grounded Theory methodology, this dissertation borrowed judiciously from it. Lincoln and
Guba (1985) issue a caveat: “Defining grounded theory is…rather more complicated than
appreciating the need for it” (203).87
Proponents of grounded theory “share a conviction with many other qualitative
researchers that the usual canons of ‘good science’…require redefinition in order to fit the
realities of qualitative research and the complexities of social phenomena” (Corbin and Strauss
1990, 4). Thus grounded theory researchers advocate for a rejection of determinism and for the
building of flexibility into research methods: phenomena invariably change in response to their
environmental conditions. Grounded Theory methods represent “systematic, yet flexible
guidelines for collecting and analyzing qualitative data to construct theories from the data
themselves” (Charmaz 2014, 1).
Constructivist Grounded Theory methods guided my analysis. Ideal for addressing
specific problems or situations, constructivist Grounded Theory methods dovetail with the
qualitative and naturalistic perspective and are predicated upon semistructured interviews. They
encourage a strong focus on the agency of the researcher and the study participants; they also
help capture the dynamism and contextual relationships inherent in their interactions. These
methods lend themselves to a strategy of iterative data collection, coding, and analysis. Finally,
they explain as well as describe.

87

Additionally, two caveats should be made about Grounded Theory and the naturalistic paradigm. First, Glaser and
Strauss’s pioneering work did not refer to the naturalistic paradigm; instead, they focused on prediction and
explanation. Second, Glaser and Strauss saw the constant comparative method as a vehicle by which to derive
theory, not just to process data (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).

144

Coding
I coded “slices of social life recorded in the data—participant activities, perceptions, and
the tangible documents and artifacts produced by them” (Saldana 2013, 15). In so doing, I
focused on processes, practical concerns, and meanings and points of view (Emerson, Fretz and
Shaw 1995).
Codes “take a specific event, incident, or feature and relate it to other events, incidents, or
features, implicitly distinguishing this one from others” (Emerson, Fretz and Shaw 1995, 149). A
code is generally “a word or short phrase that symbolically assigns a summative, salient,
essence-capturing, and/or evocative attribute for a portion of language-based or visual data”
(Saldana 2013, 3).
But coding is more interpretive act than precise science (Saldana 2013). Problems during
coding may include the following: 1) the codes are too general; 2) they focus on topics instead of
actions; 3) they overlook how persons construct actions; 4) they do not focus enough on the
participant; 5) they ignore context; or they 6) summarize instead of analyze (Charmaz, 2014).
Initial codes focus on the data’s subjects, its contents, its points of view, and its
theoretical possibilities (Charmaz 2014). During this stage the researcher should develop “as
many codes as possible…without considering possible relevance either to established concepts in
one’s disciplines or to a primary theoretical focus” (Emerson, Fretz and Shaw 1995, 152).
Next, I moved to focused coding. Finer-grained than initial coding, focused coding
involves “building up and elaborating analytically interesting themes, both by connecting data
that initially may not have appeared to go together and by delineating subthemes and topics that
distinguish differences and variations within the broader topic” (Emerson, Fretz and Shaw 1995,
160). I began not only to recognize patterns, but also to think about emerging arguments.

145

NVivo software undergirded my coding process. Use of this tool involved three steps:
creating free nodes, sorting and linking existing and new nodes, and developing codes to indicate
higher order concepts (Blazeley 2007). In line with Blazeley’s recommendations, I limited the
number of nodes to fewer than ten (ultimately I settled upon eight) and each node went no more
than two trees deep.
Focused coding channeled into category formation. Categories, maintains Charmaz
(2014), “explicate ideas, events, or processes in your data—and do so in telling words” (189).
Throughout this process, I engaged in constant comparison. First, I compared potentially
classifiable incidents in each category. Second, I integrated categories and their properties. Third,
I aimed for parsimony: I sought at once to reduce my original list of categories and to promote
their saturation (Lincoln and Guba 1985).
Qualitative and naturalistic, this study’s research methods capitalized upon a case study
undergirded by semi-structured interviews. Participants were located through purposive
sampling. Documentary evidence fleshed out interview data. Analysis was grounded: moving
from initial to focused, coding proceeded iteratively and inductively. These methods worked well
for an exploratory that sought to capture current researchers’ work practices to inform actions
decisions, namely in the generation of an educational framework.

Interviewee Demographics
Through my interviews with PIs, I gained a top-down—“five thousand foot level” view,
as interviewee 3, a PI, put it—of each project. By the same token, I also received an “in the
trenches” perspective that this same PI’s Project Manager (interviewee 4) offered.

Self-Identified Digital Humanist
Perhaps surprising insofar as the SUG programs explicitly target digital humanities
projects, only 20 of 45 interviewees (44.4%) self-identified as digital humanists. Interviewee 6

150

began her answer by chuckling, “that’s the question of the hour.” Many hemmed and hawed.
Interviewee 19, a PI, claimed the issue was “not something I’ve actually thought about.”
Conversely, interviewee 45 downplayed the issue as “mostly semantics.”

Overall, interviewees offered nuanced answers when asked if they saw themselves as
digital humanists. One Principal Investigator, interviewee 35, answered, “Not by the term.”
Another PI, interviewee 27, hedged, saying she identified as a digital humanist “partly.” A third
PI, interviewee 42, characterized the issue as “such a complicated question” and elaborated that
she was “not exactly” a digital humanist.
Project Managers also waffled. Though interviewee 32 said she “absolutely” selfidentified as a digital humanist, interviewee 12 thought “digital humanist” a “rather nebulous
label” and “not a label I like to use.” In much the same way, interviewee 44 first said she was
“not particularly” a digital humanist but in her next sentence conceded, “I guess I am one.”
A third group, project personnel, also equivocated, using phrases such as “yes and no,”
“difficult to say,” “to a certain extent, yes,” “not sure,” and “I really don’t know” but “I
definitely align with the digital approach.” Two others linked their understanding of the digital

151

humanities to a certain level of technological know-how. Interviewee 2 noted that she was
“interested in DH but I don’t think that I personally have the tech background to call myself a
digital humanist.” On the other hand, interviewee 8 said, “I think so, though more on the
technical side.”
Last, three interviewees resorted to metaphor. Interviewee 23, a PM, called digital
humanists a “spectrum” of scholars and located her work on that spectrum. Interviewee 33
referred to digital humanities as a “broad umbrella”; a third, interviewee 6, emphasized the many
“flavors” of DH work.
These findings point to the inveterate debates over the definition and scope of the digital
humanities. Despite the digital humanities’ appearance as “a burgeoning field of intellectual
inquiry and scholarly practice” (Benardou, Constantopoulos and Dallas 2013), their definition as
well as their scope remains oddly ambiguous: “Identity crises abound: until yesterday we did
Humanities Computing, today it’s Digital Humanities, and the more common our practice
becomes the shorter and less descriptive its designation seems to get” (Meister 2012, 77).
Unsworth (2012) stresses, “Our two problems are defining, and not defining, the digital
humanities” (237).
Concerns about the legitimacy of SUG digital humanities work arose. Two interviewees
mentioned the challenge of demonstrating the legitimacy of the research to colleagues. Indeed,
one mentioned that her colleagues did not realize that grants were peer-reviewed and
competitively awarded. This suggests that the notion of grant funding as a funding or evaluation
instrument is nascent in the humanities, coexisting with more conventional venues such as peerreviewed journal articles. Institutionally, the burden of proof seemingly remains on those doing
DH work. Lynch (2014) observes, “The inertia and conservatism in this system is enormous”

152

(Lynch 2014, 397). According to Evans and Rees (2012) Digital humanists should “ensure all of
our wonderful whizz-bangy tools are equally followed up with research papers in important
places” (186). Indeed, ten of nineteen projects pledged to produce articles or similar publications.
Education, Training, and Skilling Up
Formal Education in Digital Curation
Virtually none of the 45 interviewees (93.3%) had received any formal education in
digital curation. The three persons who had taken courses were exposed through Library and
Information Science programs (two persons) or through the National Endowment for the
Humanities-funded Digital Humanities Data Curation Institute (one person). Moreover, not one
interviewee was currently undertaking formal education in digital curation.
These findings paralleled those of a recent CLIR report (2013): nearly nobody in
academia receives professional training or certification in digital curation. They also jibed with
the findings of a recent study conducted at the University of Northampton: “the vast majority of
researchers have not received, or at least do not recall having received, any training relating to
data management” (Alexogiannopoulos, McKenney and Pickton 2010, 33). Finally, they
mirrored the findings of a study of the first Digging into Data challenge, which stressed the roles
and responsibilities of researchers, administrators, scholarly societies, funding agencies, and
research libraries in digital curation education for digital humanists (Williford and Henry 2012).
Most striking, however, was what the 45 interviewees either did not know or did not mention
regarding digital curation education.

153

Figure 2: Formal Education in Digital Curation

No

A considerable gap exists between the potential for and the actual conduct of digital
curation education. Interviewee 38, a PI, summed up: stakeholders in digital humanities are “not
doing a good enough job” teaching digital curation. Interviewee 15, a PM, lamented that the
nineteenth century German model of education still prevails in many institutions, including her
own—a model that does not include learning about or dealing with data.
Most important, not a single interviewee thought digital curation education could be
accomplished only through formal education. Interviewee 45 commented, “I don’t think you can
get very much by reading about [digital curation].”
On the other hand, however, one of the two interviewees who had worked in digital
curation in a classroom setting (interviewee 16) found those skills “fairly transferable” to her
professional duties. Along these lines, Shilton and her colleagues (2013) believe the
“combination of humanistic, social science, and technology literacy fostered in information
programs is a crucial and useful blend.” After all, LIS remains “the only field…concerned with
the full landscape of scientific information and the interactions therein, and with the provision of

154

services to exploit that base of information” (Palmer, Heidorn, et al. 2007, 37). But more
evidence is needed to show the efficacy of formal digital curation education based in LIS
programs.
Principal Investigators
Principal Investigators admitted to little if any need to skill up to engage in their projects.
Overall, they emphasized the value of hands-on and immersive project-based work as the best
way to learn. Not coincidentally, this was the same type of experience they themselves had
endured as early stage researchers.
Interviewee 14, a PI, reflected of her digital humanities work, “I have always been selfeducating.” Nonetheless, she ascribed much credit to the openness and generosity of the DH
community, namely in its tendency to mount their materials on the Web, in helping her facilitate
this self-education. Likewise, another PI’s (interviewee 9) expertise came “absolutely” and
wholly from her “extracurricular” work. A third PI, interviewee 7, suggested the importance of
skilling up to tackle non-technological tasks. She reflected at length: “For me, it was more of
being able to talk to our potential advisory board members and figure out how they use some of
these tools. That’s been the main kind of learning that I personally have done, is what are the
archiving needs of other research groups, and what types of things do they want to do that
they’ve had to cobble several different tools together to do that we could help make more
seamless?”
Finally, two non-PIs weighed in. One Associate Professor, interviewee 6, also stressed
the need to adapt to constant changes on the Web, for instance in the development or refinement
of tools, and thus also emphasized her propensity for self-education. Interviewee 16, a Data
Management Consultant, meanwhile suggested that while a foundational body of knowledge

155

could be learned formally (e.g. what is metadata), much learning must happen as one works on
particular projects given the demand-driven nature of much digital curation work. In her opinion,
intellectual flexibility seemed crucial in doing digital curation.
Graduate Students
Graduate students played key roles in these nineteen projects. “On the front line of
generating, processing, analyzing, and managing data,” graduate students are “not a marginal
component, but rather an integral piece of the data management and curation process” (Carlson
and Stowell-Bracke 2013). These students perform much of the daily labor in digital curation;
they also represent the researchers of the future. Thus their experiences can inform digital
curation education program design. After all, “it is easier to do something right from the
beginning than to unlearn bad habits and replace them with better ones” (Frugoli, Etgen and
Kuhar 2010, 756).
There persists an important lacuna in the literature regarding digital curation as part of
obtaining the PhD. Abbott (2015) observes, “some of the digital curation activity undertaken
frequently by students themselves may in fact be being performed without the necessary skill
levels to minimize both risks to data appropriateness, accuracy, and preservation, and effort on
the part of the student” (9).
Graduate students, according to two recent studies, rarely learn the skills and
competencies necessary to curate data even though they are expected to take on such
responsibilities both as doctoral students and subsequently as scholars (Abbott 2015) (Peters and
Vaughn 2014). Frugoli et al. (2010) contend, “Overburdened Principal Investigators (PIs) may
forget about, delay, miss or neglect opportunities to formally address data management issues,
leaving students to develop data management techniques by observing others or completely on

156

their own” (756). Therefore, students may undergo the so-called pain and suffering method: the
student tries, fails, and then consults her advisor for feedback. This cycle then repeats until the
student (ostensibly) attains competency (Carlson, Johnston, et al. 2013). In this vein, students
may rely upon trial and error, consulting relevant literature, peer learning, or searching the Web.
This strategy, though, may reinforce a disjuncture between project-based skills and deeper,
transferable knowledge (Carlson, Johnston, et al. 2013).
On the other hand, one study found that both Master’s and PhD students were apparently
more aware of recent technological developments and more comfortable with hardware and
software changes than their supervisors, even though these students had less experience with
managing data than those supervisors (Alexogiannopoulos, McKenney and Pickton 2010). In the
end, however, “it is clear that a burden of responsibility to mentor students in best practice
remains with doctoral supervisors, who may not themselves have the necessary experience”
(Abbott 2015, 4). Despite their prima facie approval of better digital curation, these supervisors
may not know what improved curation practices would consist of; they may also be reluctant to
impose rules upon their mentees (Akmon, et al. 2011). In a positive sign, however, one study
found that 46% of an introductory digital curation workshop’s attendees (all graduate students)
were requested to attend by their advisors (Peters and Vaughn 2014).
I interviewed five Master’s students and eight PhD students. Thus 11.1% of my sample
was composed of Master’s students and 17.8% of doctoral students. Doctoral students were the
largest single group of interviewees. Overall, thirteen of my 45 interviewees (28.9%) were
students at the time of the interview. These interviewees—many of whom served as project
managers—offered useful insights.

157

Project managers described their experiences in skilling up. One doctoral student,
interviewee 15, reported adapting “messily,” i.e. by immersion. She recalled considerable
independent work reading about and practicing with coding. A second PM (interviewee 39), also
a doctoral student, described her experience as being “tossed in the deep end.” Notwithstanding
her own independent efforts, she capitalized on informal channels: for example, her spouse
taught her how to use Makefile. A third PM (interviewee 32), a Master’s student, called her selfeducation a “deep dive,” specifically in learning about encoding standards, metadata vocabulary,
and digital platforms. While she emphasized the importance of learning Library and Information
Science fundamentals such as the Dublin Core Schema and the Anglo-American Cataloguing
Rules (AACR2), she underlined that practical settings are “so vital” and that concepts should be
applied to practice—“where the rubber hits the road.” A fourth PM (interviewee 12), a postdoc,
recalled needing to skill up on Java script, as her knowledge was “sorely outdated.” Nonetheless,
she learned throughout the project as the need arose; she did not plan to skill up in particular
areas.
Other project personnel who were neither PIs nor PMs also spoke about educational
challenges. One librarian, interviewee 43, noted simply that skilling up “took a lot of conscious
effort.” A doctoral student, interviewee 2, exclaimed, “Oh God I’m still doing that [skilling up]”;
she was still “picking things up here and there.” Another doctoral student, interviewee 8,
contributed, “any ‘training’ was done on my own time and for the sake of my own knowledge
rather than for the project specifically.” A Master’s student, interviewee 1, finally, stressed that
she never had a “super overwhelming” moment, but underscored that her six-year relationship—
one she characterized as master/apprentice—with one of the project’s leaders was crucial. One

158

Master’s student (interviewee 37) I interviewed perhaps said it best: personnel who work on
grants such as these must be “self-driven.”
PIs offered numerous suggestions for teaching digital curation to students, even as they
admitted just how difficult such teaching was. One PI (interviewee 7) reflected, “I’d been
breathing this stuff for years. It’s really hard to take yourself back to when you were first
learning this, and how do you teach somebody that? You have to use things that they know
about.”
Three PIs suggested the need to integrate formal and informal training. Interviewee 14
stressed the need for students to obtain the broadest possible access to digital work, for instance
by starting with formal classroom instruction in basic things such as tagging, Ngrams, and word
clouds. Subsequently, though, students learn best in her estimation by doing projects—that is,
creating rather than merely reading about creating. Similarly, another PI (interviewee 3)
preferred to skill up her students formally on technical issues, then place those students with
practitioners in the field to work with an actual problem and its associated data. A third PI
(interviewee 24) preferred informal to formal training given the speed of change in digital
humanities work. That said, she teaches a “doing DH” class focused on using tools such as
Omeka and Google Glass.
Other project personnel (neither PIs nor PMs) also weighed in on teaching students. One
Associate Professor (interviewee 6) advocated treating students as responsible “fully working
researchers” who work “live,” for instance by contributing explicitly to coding and publications.
She, too, favored a mix of formal and informal education to develop flexible and adaptable
students. On the informal end of the spectrum, she encouraged students to play with tools and
tech; in class, she assigns them a different tool to explore each week. Based on his experience in

159

both computer and library and information science, another Associate Professor (interviewee 5)
stressed the need to balance coding and application. One librarian (interviewee 41), finally, also
encouraged a foundation based on classroom learning (e.g. learning the rudiments of metadata),
but emphasized the importance of bringing hands-on activities into the classroom as well.
Given interviewees’ lack of formal education and their sundry struggles in skilling up,
LIS programs have ample opportunity to recruit scholars involved in digital humanities work to
digital curation education. One PI (interviewee 7) reflected, “Often it is hard to be able to
articulate what you need if you don’t even know that it would be possible to do, right?”
Challenges Faced and Lessons Learned
Interviewees offered 102 comments that addressed challenges they faced and lessons they
learned. Each person was given the opportunity to point to as many lessons learned or challenges
faced as she wanted.
These comments comprised six broad categories: data, collaboration and communication,
awareness and outreach, planning and project management, resources, and technological issues.
Each of these issues should interpenetrate any digital curation education program developed for
digital humanities stakeholders. Despite interviewees’ emphasis on data issues, they were almost
equally concerned with non-technical issues. Gantz et al. (2008) observe, “Dealing with the
digital universe is not a technical problem alone” (2).
Data Issues
Most frequently mentioned were data issues (32 comments). But concerns about data
were dispersed. Versioning was the most commonly mentioned issue, but it figured in only four
of 32 comments (12.5%).

Collaboration and Communication
Second, collaboration and communication earned considerable commentary from
interviewees (20 comments).
Collaboration
Benefits of collaboration may include drawing upon a wider range of expertise, sharing
costs and pooling resources, accessing new tools, developing standards and best practices, and
raising awareness (Harvey 2010). But collaboration remains “a rather shady area” in the
humanities (Benardou, Constantopoulos and Dallas 2013, 118). For instance, Molloy (2012) sees
a frequent disconnect among librarians, technologists, and researchers. Another study found that
digital curation support remains “generally rare, patchy, ad hoc, or simply not promoted directly
to students or supervisors” (Abbott 2015, 3). A third study determined that researchers either

161

may not be aware of collaborative support or may not be willing to ask for help
(Alexogiannopoulos, McKenney and Pickton 2010).
The term collaboration persists as “a catchphrase heard quite often, but the difficulty is in
carrying it out when all the (well-meaning) actors are working at full capacity” (Maron and
Pickle 2014, 55). It depends on achieving common understandings of language and terminology,
methods and research styles, theories, outputs and publications, and values (Siemens, et al.
2012). A report covering the 2007-2010 SUG projects concluded, “By far, the biggest problem
encountered by project directors had to do with personnel issues, either internally or with outside
collaborators” (National Endowment for the Humanities, Office of Digital Humanities 2010, 27).
The Start-Up Grant projects foreground collaboration across departments, disciplines,
campus units, and institutions. In the best case, these collaborations flourish. One project
member lauded the relationship among the four core project team members, noting that “healthy
egos” prevailed.
Doctoral students, PIs, and Office of Digital Humanities personnel spoke about the
collaborative process in their interviews. First, doctoral students played foundational
collaborative roles in the SUG projects. One PI (interviewee 38) characterized her doctoral
student (also her PM) as the project’s “linchpin.” Often PIs were doctoral students’ supervisors
or mentors as well as their de facto employers. Additionally, in some cases graduate students
played liaison roles between PIs and other project workers such as undergraduates or Master’s
students.
But doctoral students encountered unfamiliar challenges. One PM (interviewee 15) found
it “awkward” and “a little strange” managing other graduate students for the first time because
she lacked preparatory project management training.

162

Second, Principal Investigators reflected upon their collaborative efforts. Interviewee 27
described her work with the other PI on the project as the epitome of their longstanding
“intellectual kinship.” Another PI (interviewee 6) asserted that collaboration, specifically through
co-writing “helped us tremendously.” On the other hand, one PI (interviewee 36) said she
“assumed too much” of her graduate student worker regarding motivation and work ethic.
Another PI (interviewee 29), who relied heavily on undergraduate student workers, stressed the
importance of “openness,” which she defined as the ability to help students see how “dishwater”
work (e.g. work having to do with citations) contributed in key ways to the project overall. She
suggested shifting students among tasks to facilitate this openness.
Last, officials from the Office of Digital Humanities underlined the importance of
collaboration. It appears “too much to ask,” interviewee 26 observed, to find a scholar who owns
the requisite data curation, disciplinary/domain, and outreach expertise. The ODH promotes
“strength in numbers” (interviewee 25) and tells applicants not to “go it alone” (interviewee 26).
Even so, collaboration and communication come with challenges of their own for SUG project
personnel, as discussed below.
Translation issues proved most important to participants in this study, but concerns about
clarity and about frequency of communication also emerged. One PI (interviewee 35) observed
the difficulty of initiating and then sustaining robust communication among groups of scholars
who had never met before and who worked apart from one another geographically. Other types
of divides could apply. One PI (interviewee 3) emphasized the challenge of translation among
technically literature and domain-knowledgeable persons as part of negotiating “institutional
culture”: she found such translation “really important and very difficult.” Finally, one PM
(interviewee 23) spoke about even more specific translation issues, noting the challenges of

163

achieving stakeholder agreement on the definition and use of certain metadata categories such as
genre.

6.4.2.1.1) Interdisciplinarity
Interviewees also reflected upon interdisciplinarity. One PM (interviewee 18) hailed the
“tremendous amount” of interdisciplinarity in her project. Another project participant
(interviewee 45) suggested that there was “a lot of skill involved” in negotiating with personnel
from different academic units. According to one PI (interviewee 38), interdisciplinarity remains
“incredibly difficult” and can come about serendipitously. In this vein, another PI (interviewee
19) described the gestation of her collaboration with another campus scholar as a “complete
fluke.” Obstacles to interdisciplinary collaboration arose. One PI (interviewee 29) stressed the
need to grow a “thick skin” and show willingness to ask experts from other disciplines for
explanation or clarification.
On the other hand, one PI (interviewee 13) described her project as a beneficial
“marriage” of four related disciplines. Such interdisciplinarity could pay dividends. One project
member (interviewee 43) noted that interdisciplinarity made their project group of four persons
“much stronger”: the team proved both “flexible” and “nimble.” One PM (interviewee 15) even

164

described one of her PIs as a “rare bird” able adeptly to traverse disciplines. Along these lines,
one Office of Digital Humanities representative (interviewee 25) maintained that many grantees
evolve into “wonderful bridge people.”
Communication
Not surprisingly, all project personnel relied heavily on email to communicate. Perhaps
more surprising, the vast majority (84.2%) of projects’ personnel (at least some members of each
team) met face to face at least once. This study suggests that digital communication cannot
necessarily supplant in-person communication. Last, nearly two-thirds (63.2%) of the nineteen
projects employed Skype or video chat.
Table 23: Project Personnel’s Mode of Communication

Other

Number of Projects (n = 19)
19 (100%)
16 (84.2%)
12 (63.2%)
6 (31.6%)

Some projects relied on other modes of communication as well. For instance, two
projects communicated via telephone and two used Google Docs. One project each capitalized
on co-writing, social media, a wiki, an IRC channel, and Google Chat. More projects might
exploit these venues to ensure frequent, high-touch collaboration.
Email and other text-based asynchronous communication such as blogs and wikis offer
important benefits: the sender and receiver do not have to be in same place at same time.
Additionally, these communication methods are inexpensive. On the other hand, such
mechanisms pose challenges. For example, details may be omitted involuntarily and nuance can
be difficult to convey. Persons may encounter issues with respect to checking and answering

165

email promptly (L. Siemens 2010). Thus project personnel should likely rely on multiple
communication channels, despite email’s ease of use.
Face to face communication featured in most of the projects, albeit to a very limited
degree. The richest communication medium, in-person is synchronistic, incorporates body and
facial cues, and permits immediate feedback. Thus it facilitates trust and commitment.
Conversely, if teams are dispersed geographically, face to face communication can be
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. A lack of face to face communication, however,
can hinder decision making and project reporting. In the end, as the interviewees suggested,
digital technology “can supplement, but cannot fully replace the face-to-face in collaboration”
(L. Siemens 2010, 44).
Librarians
Svensson (2010) notes, “The expansion of the digital humanities and changing roles for
libraries may lead to a new set of dynamics and a renewed sense of the library as laboratory as
well as a physical and digital repository.” Digital curation offers librarians a “novel, even
groundbreaking role,” given their experience with the reference interview and their expertise in
subject areas and with information literacy overall (Hswe and Holt 2011, 11). Yet Carlson (2014)
cautions, “In developing data services, libraries must invest time and effort to understand current
practices with data; when, how, and why these practices are performed; and the gaps between
current and ideal practice from the perspective of the researcher” (79).
Librarians or personnel affiliated with the University Libraries were involved—to
varying degrees and in various capacities—in eight of the nineteen projects (42.1%). But as
numerous scholars observe, there seems great potential for further library involvement in both
digital curation and digital humanities work (Bryson, et al. 2011) (Giarlo 2013) (A. Gold 2010)

166

(Lyon 2012) (Mitchell 2013) (Nicholson and Bennett 2011) (Shaffer 2013) (Starr, et al. 2012)
(Tenopir, Birch and Allard 2012) (Walters and Skinner 2011).

For example, the PIs of two of the nineteen projects relied heavily on librarians. One
(interviewee 30) called the library a “key player”; the other (interviewee 42) answered “Good
Lord, yes,” when asked if librarians played an important collaborative role in the project.
One Principal Investigator (interviewee 3) admitted to not working with librarians on her
SUG project, but nonetheless believed such involvement “essential.” Further, she noted the
importance of early and constant collaboration with librarians. Similarly, this PI’s PM
(interviewee 4) saw “lots of potential for collaboration” with librarians. Both claimed their SUG
project was not yet mature enough to require librarian involvement, a key misconception.
On one hand, then, libraries and librarians are increasingly staking a claim to digital
curation expertise. On the other hand, librarians are not necessarily the first resource that
scholars doing digital humanities work consult. Not consulting qualified librarians early and
often in SUG projects seems a squandering of human capital.

Center/Institute Personnel
Personnel from centers or institutes were involved in four of the nineteen projects.

At their best, centers “not only model the kind of collaborative and interdisciplinary work
that will increasingly come to define humanities scholarship; they also enable graduate students
and faculty to learn from each other while working on projects of common intellectual interest”
(Fraistat 2012, 281).
Archivists
As part of asking interviewees about their collaborators, I asked them whether archivists
were involved. Archivists’ involvement in the nineteen projects was rare: they participated in
only two projects (10.5%). The answer to the question “where’s the archivist in digital curation”
appears in these projects to be “almost nowhere” (Lee and Tibbo 2011). Once again, this likely
represents a waste of human resources and therefore a growth area for archives and archivists

Planning and Project Management
Third, planning and project management issues elicited twenty comments. One PI
(interviewee 29) likened working on a digital humanities project to “wrestling an octopus.” One
PM (interviewee 23) noted that being skilled at digital humanities work and at project
management are two very different things. A predominant concern of interviewees was the
challenge of approaching projects with a long-term perspective. Ultimately, a project
management component may be a useful addition to a digital curation education program.

Duration of Grant
The Start-Up Grant award period lasts up to eighteen months. Grantees may apply for a
one-time extension of up to one year. Twelve projects received no-cost extensions. It is no
wonder a key concern of interviewees was project planning and management. Of the seven that
did not request extensions, four were Planning Grants and all four concluded with workshops.
It appears easier to plan and to keep workshops or meetings than more experimental
explorations on track temporally. Additionally, the tendency of projects to train their personnel
only as the project unfolds may not be the most time-efficient or ultimately productive strategy.
Certainly good digital curation planning and practice requires early and frequent intervention.
Project management skills such as organization, planning, prioritization, monitoring, and
human resources seem to be of crucial but sometimes overlooked importance in SUG work as
well as in other digital humanities work (Reed 2014).
Awareness and Outreach
Fourth, interviewees identified awareness and outreach issues (19 total comments).
Concerns in this area clustered around demonstrating the relevance and legitimacy of digital
curation to stakeholders. Communication with researchers and faculty members as well as with
users more generally was also key.

Resources
Fifth, resources were mentioned, though perhaps not as frequently as one might suspect
(only seven times). Beyond the need simply for more resources of all types to ensure the project
reached its presumed potential and proved sustainable, interviewees offered several more
specific remarks. They stressed financial and temporal resources, appropriate personnel
(interviewee 12 concluded, “Talent is expensive”), technological resources (the need for
sufficient server space), and educational resources (in particular those that delivered core
concepts and best practices).
Technology
Sixth, technological issues were mentioned only four times. Key issues included userfriendly software, general technological shortcomings and technological “immaturity,” and a
broad lack of institutional technical support. Perhaps most striking, one interviewee stressed the
challenge of making technology obey one’s wishes.
Issues surrounding data, collaboration and communication, planning and project
management, awareness an outreach, resources, and technological issues hampered project
personnel in their efforts to curate their data. These findings show that not only technical skills,
but also “softer” skills play a pivotal role in the efficiency of digital curation in the digital
humanities, a key lesson for constructing a digital curation education framework.
Conclusion
These empirical study results indicate key foci of digital humanities scholars’ work. They
provide a base for suggesting ways in which digital curation needs in the digital humanities can
be met through education. In the next chapter, I bring this empirical evidence together with best

171

practices extracted from the digital curation education and digital humanities education literature
and with the DigCurV curriculum framework.

Chapter 7: Analysis and Discussion

There is a conflict at the heart of curation training between general and specific
needs that is manifest on both the individual and organizational levels.

How do you know what you don’t know?
-Molinaro (2010), 45.

This chapter first recapitulates the key points of the study. Next, it addresses the four
research questions that guided the study. More specifically, it details the types of data project
personnel created and reused, the digital curation skills they employed during their project,
whether they are interested in digital curation education, and what sort of educational framework
makes sense for their needs. Finally, it suggests paths for future research.
The Research Study
This qualitative study was situated in a naturalistic setting. It revolved around a case
study that permitted me to conduct exploratory, evaluative, contemporary, in-depth, and
contextual research work. A user-centered case study, it captured the meanings digital
humanities scholars ascribe to the experiences, events, and processes that steer their daily
working lives.

173

My research design remained emergent: flexible, iterative, and interpretive. To obtain
rich, detailed, and nuanced information, I relied upon purposive (specifically, snowball)
sampling. I interviewed Principal Investigators, Project Managers, and other key personnel (45
total) of nineteen recent (slated for completion by the end of 2014) Start-Up Grants funded by
the National Endowment for the Humanities’s Office of the Digital Humanities. I explored the
types of data these scholars reused and created in their projects and the digital curation skills and
methods they employed in dealing with their data.
I interviewed scholars in disciplines ranging from music history to archival management,
media studies to archaeology, library science to interdisciplinary studies. Interviewees included
Master’s students and PhD students, “alternative-academics,”88 and senior faculty members; they
worked at institutions ranging from community colleges to Research I universities. Their
deliverables included workshops and prototypes, models and tools, databases and meetings.
Documentary evidence culled from the nineteen projects, namely project applications,
data management plans, and White Papers, complemented and checked my interview data.
Proceeding inductively, my qualitative analysis embraced iterative memoing, in vivo coding
(using NVivo), and (re)analysis. In so doing, I borrowed strategically and judiciously from
constructivist Grounded Theory methods.
An exploratory study, my serves as a baseline study for future research. Additionally, it
helps identify needed skills and competencies among digital humanists and their collaborators.
Finally, it sets forth a framework—premised on the relevant literature, the empirical study data,

Bethany Nowviskie puts it, “The #alt-ac label speaks to a broad set of hybrid, humanities-oriented professions
centered in and around the academy, in which there are rich opportunities to put deep—often doctoral-level—
training in scholarly disciplines to use.” See http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-alt-ac-track-negotiating-youralternative-academic-appointment-2/26539

174

and the DigCurV curriculum framework89—for digital curation education aimed at digital
humanists.
Research Question 1: What types of data have digital humanists (whether faculty, “alternativeacademics,”90 (alt-acs) or graduate students) created, reused, stored, or planned to reuse in their
SUG project?
Reuse of Previously-Generated Data
Seventeen of the nineteen projects (89.5%) in some way reused existing data, whether
their own or others.’

Data that project personnel reused ranged widely in content. Topics included music,
literature, news, periodical literature, digital editions, art, religious studies, and classics. But of
those seventeen projects that employed previously-created data, nine relied upon web-based

information available in the public domain. Thus they implicitly trusted the quality of this
information and assumed that it could be revisited by themselves or others at their discretion.
Three projects reused data previously generated by project personnel: survey materials,
grant application materials, and field data. A third category of data reuse was more nebulous.
Project personnel in these cases reused metadata gleaned from third-party institutions, film prints
and ephemera, a video game and its associated materials, original literary texts, and data
collected from a historical society, respectively. Hence those responsible for curating such data
need a range not only of technological skills, but also of media-specific and domain skills.
Data Created
All nineteen projects created data in the ODH’s definition of the term. Notwithstanding
the mandatory White Paper and interim and final reports, the projects created at least 36 different
types of data. Similarly, a study conducted at Colorado State University found that participants
created twenty different types of data (McLure, et al. 2014). Heterogeneity appears to be the
norm.
In the current study, certain types of data were created more frequently than other types.
Notably, the two most frequently generated types of data were conventional publications and
presentations at professional events. Indeed, three of the most frequently cited data types
produced were “conventional.” This resembles the findings of a recent study: 44.1% of science
researchers’ DMPs promised traditional publications qua data creation (Mischo, Schlembach and
O'Donnell 2014).
Nonetheless, six projects generated code and five generated a database of some kind.
Overall, though, it seems a paradigm shift regarding the creation of less traditional types of data
has yet to occur in the digital humanities.

File Formats
Though projects employed a wide range of file formats91 in their work, personnel relied
upon some formats more often than others. For example, more than half of the nineteen projects
created or used PDF. Yet PDF was the only format that more than half of the projects used. The
next most popular format, HTML/XML, was used by less than a third of the projects. Slightly
more than a quarter of the projects used .CSV, Java, or .JPEG file formats and more than one in
five used MP3/MP4, MySQL, and PowerPoint.
Perhaps most striking, more than half of the projects used other file formats, i.e. formats
unique to their project (in the context of the sample). One project, in fact, used more than 60 file
formats. Therefore, the file formats each project employs seem to depend upon the individual
preferences of the PIs or the graduate student workers or both as well as the discipline or domain.
Indeed, one study found graduate students using a bevy of formats: Excel, Sims 3, Word,
PowerPoint, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, GraphPad, Prism, Filemaker Pro, SPSS, SAS, and
NVivo (Piorun, et al. 2012).
Future research might explore the possibility of standardizing file formats for various
domains or establishing best practices. After all, format can greatly influence accessibility
(Alexogiannopoulos, McKenney and Pickton 2010). Non-proprietary file formats should be
stressed to increase the likelihood of future readability by diverse programs (Whitlock 2011). To
this end, perhaps the ODH’s grant application instructions could insert a codicil that requests
applicants adhere to a certain number of commonly used file formats, again in the interest of
promoting best practices. Such an addition could encourage at least some format standardization.

91

Numerous interviewees conflated file formats and data formats. This confusion may point to their lack of
foundational data knowledge. If so, such knowledge might be a useful aspect of a digital curation education
program.

Data Management Plans
Interviewees’ attitude toward and involvement in the ODH’s data management plan
requirement ranged considerably. Compared to basic, social, and medical sciences researchers,
one recent study found, “Arts and humanities researchers are most likely to be completely
unfamiliar with these funding agency requirements for data management plans” (Akers and Doty
2013, 9). Thanks to the ODH, this study’s interviewees were necessarily more familiar with data
management planning, though their opinions on the usefulness of the Data Management Plan
(DMP) process varied.
Despite the ODH’s mandate that each applicant include a DMP, one of the nineteen
projects did not do so, an omission the ODH reviewers overlooked.

179

No

Personnel from the other eighteen projects expressed widely varying views on the process
and its value. One PI (interviewee 18) found the process of writing a DMP “really annoying” and
did the “minimum.” Another PI (interviewee 38) characterized her effort as not the “most
shining example of the genre,” even though she enlisted a librarian’s help. Summing up,
interviewee 33 suggested that many DMPs remain “somewhat boiler plate.”
Persons from three other projects struggled even to remember the process of writing their
SUG DMPs. Interviewee 5 said that she was “sure we wrote something down” but that she could
not recall its contents. Again, this person wrote a DMP simply because the ODH required it.
Interviewee 12 recalled that she thought she wrote the DMP, but could not remember for sure. A
third (interviewee 24) noted, “I don’t remember who wrote it…I don’t actually remember what
we said.”
Other project personnel felt differently about data management planning. One PI
(interviewee 29) called the development of the DMP a “big process.” Another (interviewee 42)
thought the DMP the “hard part of the process.” She and her colleagues were “still feeling our

180

way.” Perhaps most striking, interviewee 43 characterized the DMP process as akin to being “in
a box trying to describe another box.” Despite the challenges inhering in the DMP process,
however only one PI contacted the ODH for input or feedback.
Conversely, some other projects’ personnel found the DMP process easier. Interviewee
14 called the process “Quite simple and straightforward.” Two projects used DMPTool.92 As a
result, interviewee 9 labeled the development of the DMP a “complete no-brainer.” (DMPTool
provides a structured environment for data management planning and links directly to funders’
stipulations.) The other who used DMPTool (interviewee 44) also reused materials from a
previously submitted NEH grant. Finally, interviewee 3 reused information that she created
originally for a Mellon grant.
According to personnel from the Office of Digital Humanities, grantees’ DMPs have
improved since 2011. Further, after four years the ODH now has numerous examples to show
applicants. Early plans seemed “very divorced from the rest of the narrative,” as though “written
in a vacuum, or from a template” (interviewee 35). Interviewee 35 noted that recent DMPs are
“much more consistent” and applicants display “at least a baseline sense of what sorts of
questions they need to answer.” An increasing number of applicants now “see the relationship
between other portions of the application and the data management plan” (interviewee 35).
Ultimately, remarked interviewee 35, “A weak data management plan often is a signal of a
broader weak work plan or weak project conception as well.”
The ODH continues to educate its constituents about data management. As one ODH
official (interviewee 36) noted, “We don’t think of [the DMP] as another hoop for them to jump

92

http://blog.dmptool.org/about-the-dmptool/

181

through, but it helps them by thinking about data management, strengthen the overall project. It
leads to stronger, more sustainable projects.”
One wonders if the ambivalence felt by some members of this sample will abate.
Donnelly maintains, “what is of key importance is that the plan is fit for purpose and genuinely
considered, as opposed to simply being modified from previously ‘successful’ plans” (Donnelly
2012, 87). SUG grantees might learn from this argument.
Institutional Storage of Data
First, in their data management plans the vast majority of projects (94.8%) made
provisions for storing their data institutionally. This figure far outstripped that reported by
Mischo et al., who determined that only 52.9% of their sample planned to use centralized campus
resources (Mischo, Schlembach and O'Donnell 2014). On the other hand, far more of Mischo et
al.’s (2014) researchers (63.1%) intended to post data on websites than did interviewees in this
study. But websites not only may lack sustainability, but also may lack discoverability (Wallis,
Rolando and Borgman 2013).

Second, representatives from ten projects (52.6%) mentioned storing part or all of their
project’s data on a personal computer or computers during the project. Personnel often stored the
data they had created or worked, not necessarily the entire project’s data. They made no mention
of whether they would archive this data or whether it would simply fall prey to benign neglect. In
any case, this storage was generally ad hoc. This finding is slightly greater numerically than that
of a recent study that found almost 40% of researchers referring to local storage media (Mischo,
Schlembach and O'Donnell 2014). This finding mirrors that of Carlson and Stowell-Bracke
(2013), who found that graduate students make working copies of data for use on their personal
computers. Jahnke and Asher (2012) also found researchers storing most of their data—various
image formats, video, audio, data sets, documents, code packages, and analysis scripts— on their
PCs and not backing it up properly. Still another study found storage and back up occurring via
email, the cloud (Dropbox or Google Docs, for instance), local drives, network drives, or
external drives—and no standard naming conventions were used (Piorun, et al. 2012).
But relying on one’s PC brings up questions of proper backup, versioning, and security.
Along these lines, one PM (interviewee 39) commented that PC storage was “not the best data
management strategy”; she speculated, however, that “someday [the data] will live somewhere
else.” Benign neglect thus presumably enters these projects’ digital curation picture.
Third, project personnel from eight of the nineteen projects (42.1%) stored or planned to
store data on GitHub, “an online platform that offers users free repository hosting for their
code…, as well as social networking features common across the web, like the ability to follow
users through RSS, comment on changes or updates to a repository, and even solicit help by

183

posting code snippets to a user forum” (N. Weber 2012).93 Yet interviewees who resorted to this
method apparently gave little thought to possible sustainability or other issues regarding GitHub.
Finally, project personnel mentioned sundry other storage spaces including Omeka,94
Zotero,95 ArcGIS,96 Scalar,97 YouTube,98 HathiTrust,99 commercial providers, and the cloud.
They seemingly devoted little thought to the sustainability of these of these entities.
Project personnel were not always aware of relevant institutional policies governing the
data retention period. Those who were aware, moreover, did not always know the span of
retention to which their institution committed. Institutions committed to specific time periods did
so for amounts of time ranging from three years to ten years. More open-ended, some institutions
committed to preserving the data for the life of the project, while others committed “in
perpetuity” or “permanently,” though it remained unclear exactly how long these commitments
might play out. Sustainability should be a greater concern in project planning.
A recent study provides a telling juxtaposition with these findings. Fully 80% of
participants depended upon their own infrastructure for backup, whereas less than a quarter
(23%) used a campus service and 7% employed a commercial solution. Most problematic, 5%

http://omeka.org/. Omeka took root in an initial IMLS grant (2007). It bridges the university, library, and museum
environments. Free and open source, standards-based, extensible, and interoperable, Omeka capitalizes on Web 2.0
technology, for instance by encouraging user interaction and participation. It has low startup and maintenance costs
and a user-friendly interface (Scheinfeldt, Omeka: Open Source Web Publishing for Research, Collections and
Exhibitions 2008).

did not backup at all (Steinhart, Chen, et al. 2012). Data storage and backup provisions represent
at best a patchwork and researchers tend to rely on themselves rather than campus services.
Another study’s participants employed a “huge variety” of data storage and management
methods and did so intuitively (Alexogiannopoulos, McKenney and Pickton 2010, 29).
Unsurprisingly, these researchers also lacked a system for archiving data once they completed
their projects. As the work of Alexogiannopoulos et al. (2010) and Steinhart et al. (2012)
suggests, without oversight researchers are likely to store and backup their data in ways that will
not maximize the data’s sharing or reuse potential. Funders’ persuasiveness may have an
important role to play in encouraging researchers to keep their fit for future use.
Project Websites
Fifteen of nineteen projects (78.9%) maintained some sort of website whether fullfledged or a blog. These websites varied widely in the extent of their content, in their
functionality, and in their currency and frequency of updates. Some projects even used their
website as a de facto backup tool, thus again bringing to the fore issues of sustainability. Website
posting not only may lack sustainability, in fact, it may also lack discoverability (Wallis,
Rolando and Borgman 2013).

Plan to Reuse Project Data
In accord with NEH policy, all projects committed to sharing their data at some future
point, barring issues such as confidentiality or privacy. But the vast majority of projects had not
yet produced sharable data; what was more, none knew of any other person reusing their data.
Therefore, a crucial priority should be determining and tracking reuse over time.
Nearly two-thirds of interviewees (68.3%) planned to reuse project data themselves,
though they had often only speculative thoughts about how to do so. Data management plans,
after all, do not require applicants to spell out planned future reuse (though perhaps they should).
Rather, the ODH requires only that data be made available and in a format conducive to sharing.
Yet as Wallis et al. (2013) point out, “Making data available and making data usable are not
equivalent” (13). Interviewees apparently gave scant thought to this concern. The number who
were unsure if they could reuse their own data suggests the challenge even of conceptualizing
possible reuse for one’s own purposes—let alone others’ potential desiderata (Wallis, Rolando
and Borgman 2013).

186

Interviewees working on Planning Grants found it more challenging to suggest possible
reuses for their data, perhaps because of the perceived limited utility of workshop and meeting
records. Nonetheless, such materials provide a foundation for future grant work, whether
underwritten by the ODH or another body such the Institute of Museum and Library Services,
the American Council of Learned Societies, or the Andrew Mellon Foundation, so digital
curation remains a crucial concern. Consonant with a lifecycle approach, moreover, it seems best
to cultivate digital humanists as early as possible with respect to digital curation concerns.

Principal Investigators in nearly all cases thought they could reuse project data in some
capacity. Because of their relative job security (ten of the seventeen have tenure), these scholars
may have more freedom to think long-term or at least beyond the span of the immediate project.
They may also have been able to fit their SUG project into their longer career research trajectory.
Similarly, PIs can parlay their SUG grants into other grant applications. For instance,
they can leverage their SUG Planning grant to apply for a SUG Implementation grant, or an
Institute for Advanced Topics in the Humanities100 grant, or a grant from another organization
such as the American Council of Learned Societies or the Mellon Foundation. (By the same
token, some SUG awardees build upon grants from other agencies and parlay those grants into a
SUG.)
On the other hand, students whether Master’s or doctoral have a more or less clear
educational end point (namely their funding expires). It may prove difficult to maintain ties with
PIs given the likelihood of geographical dispersion whether these students enter academia or find
careers outside of the academy. Ideally, however, graduate students can reuse project data at
least for publications, Master’s theses, or dissertations. Paradoxically, data may be most
amenable to their reuse when it is reused for so-called conventional purposes.

Research Question 2: What digital curation skills (if any) did they employ and how did they
acquire them?
Satisficing involves choosing “a path that will permit satisfaction at some specified level
of all of [the organism’s] needs” (Simon 1956, 136). In other words, satisficers “select the
satisfactory alternative because it is satisfactory, not because they calculate that stopping the
search at that point would maximize utility” (Schmidtz 2004, 32). Indeed, “Satisficing strikes us
as reasonable in part because of contingent facts about ourselves and our world,” namely our
awareness that we are limited in our opportunities to improve our situations in the real world
(Schmidtz 2004, 43). Whereas “an optimizing strategy places limits on how much we are willing
to invest in seeking alternatives,” “a satisficing strategy places limits on how much we insist on
finding before we quit the search and turn our attention to other matters” (Schmidtz 2004, 35).
“Researchers live by satisficing,” report Kroll and Forsman (2010, 16). Researchers adopt
tools or services that are easy to use and that streamline work “even when those tools and
services are not optimal, comprehensive, or on the ‘approved’ list preferred by their university”

189

(Kroll and Forsman 2010, 16). This adds yet another wrinkle to the challenge of promoting,
much less enforcing, the use of standard tools and services.
Recent studies support the importance of satisficing in researcher behavior. For example,
the IMLS project “Sense-Making the Information Confluence” (2003) determined, “participants’
approaches to information sources and strategies and the amount of time and effort they devote
to searching, correspond directly to the perceived importance of their objectives” (Prabha, et al.
2007, 85). Similarly, Prabha et al. (2007) unearthed factors that caused researchers to stop
looking for information: 1) user objectives/motivations for wanting the information; 2)
characteristics of their information need; 3) external variables such as setting, context, and
situation; 4) internal variables such as motivation and searching skills; and 5) phase of project
(namely the ending).
Interviewees in the current study generally struggled to describe the specific aspects of
skilling up. They mentioned learning to work with particular software as well as developing an
understanding of broader concerns. On one hand, interviewees noted the challenges of learning
to work with Omeka, the Resource Description Framework (RDF) framework, Java, Git, Unix,
Python, Dublin Core and the Anglo American Cataloging Rules (AACR2), XML, R, and GIS.
On the other, they spoke about learning to understand standards, scale, domain knowledge,
foundational knowledge (e.g. what is metadata), communication and outreach, indexing,
management, bibliographic and intellectual control, and dataset vocabularies. Given the
heterogeneity of responses and the difficulty interviewees had in describing the skilling up
process, future research might present interviewees with a menu of skills from which they can
choose. This strategy might help participants translate their work activities into specifics.

190

Research Question 3: Are digital humanists interested in acquiring skills to help curate their data
and if so, what content would they like to learn?
As discussed in chapter six, interviewees expressed interest in digital curation education.
On the one hand, they recognized that training was, as one PI (interviewee 42) put it, a “giant
question mark”; on the other, they offered few concrete ideas for how to develop or implement
educational programs. Another PI (interviewee 29) called for an “honest census” with respect to
current educational opportunities. In this vein, one PM (interviewee 15) deemed education in
digital curation “worthwhile,” but offered little elaboration. Indeed, interviewees offered few
specifics about content needed in educational initiatives, suggesting their belief in the importance
of aligning training with specific projects.
Without exception, interviewees stressed the imperative of immersive project-based
skilling up. One PI (interviewee 38) reflected, “Most education…comes down to working on a
particular project.” Other project personnel agreed. Advocating a “bootstraps” approach, one PI
(interviewee 27) insisted, “[Students] really get it when they have to do it.” Another PI
(interviewee 14) thought students came up with “great stuff” when “let loose.” One PM
(interviewee 4) said she was “not sure” that academic programs properly prepared students to
deal with discipline-specific data and suggested that students receive a “crash course” once put
on a particular project. Two other PMs agreed. Interviewee 23 called education necessarily “very
much hands-on.” Interviewee 32 saw practical settings as “so vital” and advocated applying
concepts to practice “where the rubber meets the road.”
In terms of technology, interviewee 45 stressed the need for students to become
“conversant” with tools. Another interviewee (interviewee 43) working on the same project
insisted that the bedrock of education was “knowing what’s possible” regarding technology; in
this vein, she underscored the importance of learning to code. Similarly, one PI (interviewee 24)

191

characterized coding as “vital.” She elaborated: “The way one learns code is not by, is not in a
classroom, it’s actually by doing it.” Therefore, the best approach was to “have [students] do
some work in the domain they’re working in, and then to come back and discuss it, rather than to
just start with the training. That’s because it forces them to solve certain things on their own,
which is really helpful and allows them to discuss the things they can improve and also to
explore where they were having challenges and not understanding.”
But technological skills needed to be complemented by domain knowledge. One PI
(interviewee 18) exclaimed, “Oh good God it was a mess” trying to find students who had both
domain and computational knowledge; she emphasized the “steep learning curve” for students
should they have technical skills but not domain knowledge. Another PI (interviewee 7) argued
for the need to change computer science students’ mindsets, namely by encouraging them to
think like “non-technologist[s].”
Interviewees also discussed mentoring. One PI (interviewee 35) simply called mentoring
“tricky.” Interviewee 35 recommended exposing students to digital curation issues as early as
possible in their education. Still another PI (interviewee 21) described in detail the process of
acculturating one of her students. The student was at first a “fly on the wall,” but assumed more
responsibilities over time. Another interviewee (interviewee 1) described her process of
gradually increasing responsibility over a six-year working relationship with her PM. More
broadly, interviewee 6 believed in treating her students as “fully working researchers” and
characterized this as an apprenticeship model. Along the same lines, interviewee 29 mentored
each of her students by effectively showing her “how to be an adult in the workplace.” But in
order to maximize the effectiveness of mentoring, faculty members themselves need guidance:
interviewee 14 advocated “Faculty development across the board.”

192

Perhaps most intriguing, interviewee 42 recognized and advocated for the potential
educational role of iSchools and LIS programs in general. Having collaborated with her
institution’s iSchool in various capacities, she favored situating a curriculum in such a school
and tailoring it such that a digital humanities layer featuring programming and analytical work
would be added to an iSchool curriculum grounded in the liberal arts. This suggestion appears
particularly promising.
Research Question 4: What sort of educational framework would be most useful to help them
learn more about curating (managing) their data?
“At this point,” Tibbo (2013) asserts, “continuing education in digital curation and
preservation is exploratory and experimental—even the formal looking concentrations and
certificates in universities are underway.” The DigCurV project found that professionals “must
demonstrate domain-specific and technical competencies, generic professional and project skills,
and personal qualities in a blend appropriate to their particular professional context” (Molloy,
Konstantelos, et al. 2013). This argument applies to students and researchers as well.
Digital curation in the digital humanities involves not only capturing data itself, but also
the methods by which the data was produced. This twofold context implicates training and
concomitant expertise that includes humanities subject disciplines, library and information
science, archival science, computer science, and both systems and records management (Flanders
and Munoz 2012). Given these requirements, educational programs should focus on early career
intervention (Jahnke and Asher 2012). In addition to faculty members, graduate students are a
“natural audience” for educational programs (Carlson, Johnston, et al. 2013, 205).
The proposed learning framework draws from three sources: lessons from the literature
(see chapter four), lessons from findings from the empirical study of nineteen SUG projects, and

193

lessons from the DigCurV curriculum framework. Overall, the proposed framework aims to be
both extensible and repurposable (Molloy 2012).
Empirical Findings
Findings from the current empirical study encompass six broad categories that might
usefully be integrated into an educational framework:


Data issues such as versioning, size, disciplinarity, and documentation



Collaboration and communication, namely terminology, clarity, and frequency



Planning and project management, primarily a long-term perspective, skills, and time
management during the project



Skills related to effecting awareness and outreach, principally ways to show the
legitimacy and relevance of digital curation, to address researcher and faculty issues
such as gap between rhetoric and reality of commitment, and to tackle user issues
such as securing feedback during project design and testing



Skills to secure and manage financial, temporal, personnel, technological, and
educational resources are necessary

Technological issues

Digital Curator Vocational Education Europe (DigCurV)101
To succeed professionally, personnel “must demonstrate domain-specific and technical
competencies, generic professional and project skills, and personal qualities in a blend
appropriate to their particular professional context” (Molloy, Konstantelos, et al. 2013, 13).
Based on research, surveys, and focus groups, the DigCurV (Digital Curator Vocational
Education Europe) initiative produced a flexible, extensible, and iteratively-designed Curriculum

101

http://www.digcur-education.org/

194

Framework. Its essential role is to “provide a range of audiences with a means to inform
curriculum creation and evaluation for continuous professional development in digital curation”
(Molloy, Konstantelos, et al. 2013, 8). It builds on DigCurV reports, the Vitae Researcher
Development Framework (SCONUL Working Group on Information Literacy 2011), the RIN
Researcher Development Framework Information Literacy Taxonomy (Vitae 2011), the
DigCCurr projects at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in particular the DigCCurr
Matrix (Lee and Tibbo 2011), and the Digital Preservation Outreach and Education (DPOE)
initiative at the Library of Congress.
The Framework helps stakeholders pinpoint training needs, evaluate current
opportunities, and plan further professional development in the cultural heritage sector. It
propagates three “lenses” (practitioner, manager, and executive). Each lens adopts the
perspective of its target stakeholders and imbues professionals with skills, knowledge, and
competencies. Each lens helps develop training materials (overall structure, subjects to be
covered, and a common language), facilitate comparison among existing courses, and identify
areas of strength and weakness and thus facilitate professional development. But the Framework
“requires ongoing development in order to maintain (and gain) credibility, usability, and
relevance” (Molloy, Konstantelos, et al. 2013).
First, the practitioner lens centers the larger legal and ethical environment of digital
curation on tools and technologies, on one hand, and on workflows and best practices, on the
other. Second, the manager lens focuses on the project level (planning, executing, and
monitoring) and underlines the connections between programs and organizational goals. Third,
the executive lens deals with digital curation in the context of the parent organization’s business
model and mandate.

195

The DigCurV Curriculum Framework is predicated upon three levels of comprehension.
First, it deals with awareness (“Maintains a basic awareness of a given subject area, including
basic knowledge of the range of issues that shape developments in the subject area”). Second, it
addresses understanding (“Able to demonstrate understanding of a given subject area, and
possesses some knowledge of the terminology, business processes and tools relevant to the
subject area”). Third, it deals with ability (“Possesses detailed knowledge of a given subject area,
and is able to apply this knowledge to complete tasks on an independent basis”).102 Building
upon the existing DigCurV skill identifiers, the proposed Researcher lens also employs these
three terms.
Mapping the DigCurV Skill Identifiers to Proposed Researcher Lens
As depicted below, the proposed framework builds upon the 110 DigCurV Skill
Identifiers. I have annotated each descriptor to suggest how it does or does not relate to my study
results or the digital curation literature or both. Overall, researchers seem to need many of the
skills needed by practitioners and managers. That said, interviewees were often unsure of what
they needed in the way of skills, much less how to acquire those skills.
Table 29: DigCurV Skill Identifiers

DigCurV Skill Identifiers103
I) Knowledge and Intellectual Abilities (KIA)
KIA1: Subject Knowledge
KIA1.1 Subject-specific knowledge and definitions
 Interviewees stressed the importance of domain knowledge in skilling up to
participate effectively in project work.
KIA1.2 Relevance of, and need for, digital curation activity within subject
context
 Interviewees emphasized the need to have both domain and digital curation
skills; the learning curve was steeper if one or the other was lacking.

KIA1.3 Current and emerging subject landscape (trends, people, institutions)
 This is a higher-level issue that project personnel did not mention. This
responsibility would likely fall under the auspices of an institution’s
repository instead of an individual researcher or a small group of
researchers.
KIA1.4 Respective responsibilities for digital curation across institution
 In determining how best to curate their data, project personnel would benefit
from knowing what persons on campus are most qualified to support digital
curation. This issue came up in particular both in data management planning
(where the data would be deposited after the project was over) and in
collaborations.
KIA1.5 Scope the boundaries for digital curation at institution
 In developing their data management plans, project personnel (usually PIs)
needed to determine who at their institution (or at their collaborators’
institutions) could help with their digital curation needs. Having an
understanding of what services are available at each institution is thus
helpful in the planning stage when roles and responsibilities are set forth.
KIA1.6 Fundamental digital curation principles including lifecycles
 By and large, interviewees lacked an understanding of digital curation
principles. For example, they rarely used any digital curation terminology.
Moreover, they often did not seem to have a sense of their data’s lifecycle—
they sought to use the data and seemed generally uncertain about what
would happen to they used it.
KIA1.7 Designated community
 No interviewee had yet had her data reused, which made identifying a
designated community difficult. Nonetheless, project personnel might think
a bit more about potential reusers. Indeed, some interviewees lacked a sense
of how they themselves might reuse their data.
KIA1.8 Select appropriate technological solutions
 Technological issues cropped up in my interviews and information
technology skills more broadly are an important part of existing digital
curation education programs. Therefore, having a knowledge of how to
select and apply technological solutions would be helpful whether or not
those solutions are applied by project personnel or by other campus
stakeholders.
KIA1.9 Apply appropriate technological solutions
 See KIA1.8
KIA1.10 Develop a professional network for support
 Developing a professional network seems an important part of collaboration
and communication, a key concern of interviewees. The SUGs often
involved persons from more than one institution; therefore, having such a
network might facilitate workflows and time management.
KIA1.11 Digital curation tools (at high level)
 Interviewees nearly always learned about digital curation tools while
working on a specific project. It might be useful for them to have a broad

understanding of the range of digital curation tools in addition to their
project-specific tool knowledge.
KIA1.12 Digital preservation standards
 As suggested in the literature, it would be useful for project personnel to
learn about standards as part of a formal education component, as opposed
to ad hoc while dealing with data during a project.
KIA1.13 Digital curation and preservation terminology
 See KIA1.6
KIA1.14 Scope of team responsibilities within institution
 Project personnel saw their SUG work as part of their academic work and/or
as part of their daily work (for example, graduate students often relied on
project work to fund their education). The place of the project and of the
project team with respect to the institution was not discussed.
KIA1.15 Information technology definitions and skills
 Understanding information technology was an important theme in both my
interviews and is also important in the literature on digital curation
education.
KIA1.16 Select and apply digital curation and preservation techniques
 Project personnel would benefit from knowing how to select and apply
digital curation and preservation techniques whether or not they or others on
campus have sole or final responsibility for doing so. Current literature on
digital curation education underlines the importance of familiarity with such
techniques.
KIA1.17 Scope of own role within institutional context
 Interviewees did not mention how their SUG work fit into larger
institutional contexts. In fact, their project work was framed as part of their
larger academic agenda as members of a department or campus unit.
KIA2: Selection/Appraisal
KIA2.1 Maximize benefits and long-term value of collections
 In nearly every case, each project personnel planned to deposit their data
with a campus stakeholder. Therefore, the responsibility for maximizing
benefits likely will devolve upon digital curation professionals who take
over management of project data.
KIA2.2 Articulate information- and records-management principles
 Some interviewees stressed the importance of learning about foundational
issues in the classroom (most notably metadata). It seems as though other
basic records management principles would be a useful addition to such
formal education. In particular, personnel might benefit from learning about
the relationship between records management and digital curation.
KIA2.3 Articulate the benefits and long-term value of collection
 Several interviewees struggled to explain to their university colleagues the
legitimacy of their work. Showing colleagues the value added by digital
curation to collections of humanities data would thus be beneficial. The
literature on digital curation education also supports the need to understand
the characteristics of collections.

selection/appraisal
 No interviewee mentioned having a role involving institutional policy. Their
data management plans stressed the need only to adhere to existing
institutional policy.
KIA2.5 Information- and records-management principles
 See KIA2.2
KIA2.6 Institutional policies, including criteria for selection/appraisal
 See KIA2.4
KIA2.7 Plan application of selection/appraisal criteria to collections
 Neither selection nor appraisal of collections of SUG data were mentioned
by interviewees. They created and used the data they needed and
subsequently deposited it.
KIA3: Evaluation Studies
KIA3.1 Prioritize funding for curation activities based on the value of digital
objects and the risks facing objects
 Interviewees did not deal with high-level (repository or institutional)
funding issues.
KIA3.2 Respond to findings from user studies constructively in future decisionmaking
 As noted in KIA1.7, no interviewee had had her data reused. Moreover, no
interviewee mentioned the need to envision the needs of future reusers of
her data. User studies and analysis would likely remain the province of
repository personnel.
KIA3.3 Conduct user needs analysis
 See KIA3.2
KIA3.4 Continuously monitor and evaluate digital curation technologies
 Monitoring and evaluating digital curation technologies would likely help
project personnel choose the best tools for their projects. This would likely
enhance their own efficiency and thus project and data management
capabilities; it might also facilitate data sharing and reuse after the project
ends.
KIA3.5 Monitor and assess needs of designated community
 Project personnel did not seem to focus a great deal on designated
communities, perhaps because they lacked information on potential reusers
(and had not had any actual reusers of their data).
KIA3.6 Conduct usability evaluation
 See KIA3.2
KIA3.7 Prioritize curation activities based on value of digital objects and the
risks facing them
 This responsibility would likely be given to repository staff. These projects
did not involve enough data such that prioritization of activities was an
issue, not did interviewees express concerns about any potential risks to
their data.

behaviors
 As required by the ODH, data management plans described how project
data was to be made available and sharable. Yet neither data management
plans nor interviewees provided information on how access to and sharing
of their data might be facilitated. This may be a useful skill for project
personnel to learn.
KIA4.2 Support information access and sharing
 See KIA4.1
KIA4.3 Deploy appropriate information seeking strategies
 All project personnel would likely profit from a proficiency with basic
information seeking strategies, ranging from the use of search engines to
knowledge of MARC.
KIA4.4 Key metadata standards for sector/subject
 For interviewees, metadata came up as an important issue for formal
education. Similarly, current digital curation education program stress
metadata’s importance. It seems likely that dealing with metadata standards
is thus among the most important aspects of digital curation in projects such
as the SUGs.

 Dealing with data issues was the most commonly mentioned lesson
learned/challenge faced. Thus it likely should occupy a central place in
formal and informal digital curation training and skilling up.

II) Personal Qualities (PQ)
PQ1: Integrity
PQ1.1 Responsibility, accountability, and good practice in digital curation
 These qualities facilitate optimal collaboration and communication and by
extension, project management, all of which were key concerns of
interviewees.
PQ1.2 Value of policy formulation to deal with malpractice
 Interviewees did not deal with policy formulation.

PQ1.3 Make transparent decisions
 Transparent decision-making also seems a crucial part of effecting optimal
collaboration, communication, and project management.
PQ1.4 Demonstrate leadership in high quality standards of work
 Both PIs and PMs in particular might benefit from setting an example for
other project personnel. It seems as though such leadership and dedication
to quality could exert a beneficial trickle-down effect.
PQ1.5 Identify malpractice
 No instances of malpractice were mentioned by interviewees. Nonetheless,
it seems appropriate for project personnel to be aware of the possibility and
consequences of malpractice.
PQ2: Communication and Advocacy Skills
PQ2.1 Communicate across domains, staff groups, and with other relevant
communities
 Interviewees stressed the importance of communication, particularly among
project teams as well as among disciplines and institutions. This was one of
the most important lessons they learned and challenges they faced during
their project work. Communication skills are also related to interpersonal
skills, another key theme in the literature.
PQ2.2 Articulate importance of digital curation to peers, other staff, and public
 Interviewees emphasized the importance of making a case for the legitimacy
of their projects vis-à-vis “traditional” academic work. In this vein, they
underlined the importance of advocacy and outreach in showing the value of
their efforts.
PQ2.3 Articulate value of collections to peers, other staff, and public
 See PQ2.2
PQ2.4 Make case for funding of digital curation activity
 Funding efforts of project personnel were limited to PIs as part of their SUG
applications. But making a case for funding could be an important part of
advocacy and outreach and thus part of gaining legitimacy for digital
curation in digital humanities work.
PQ2.5 Manage and foster stakeholder relationships
 Nurturing stakeholder relationships seems a pivotal aspect of promoting
collaboration and communication. It may also help effect outreach and
advocacy efforts.
PQ2.6 Plan and deliver dissemination activities
 As part of their data management plans, project personnel committed to
making their data accessible. Yet they did not have opinions on how to
disseminate their data. But this skill might be a useful component of an
educational program.
PQ2.7 Make case for staff training and development
 An overriding theme of the study was how project personnel almost never
received any formal training or development, despite the potential costs of
not having this training and development in terms of time and resources. It
would be useful to develop a more structured approach to training both

before the project starts as well as throughout its lifespan. PI mentoring of
PMs and other student workers seems particularly important.
PQ2.8 Engage with wider digital curation community
 Project personnel tackled diverse types of projects. Even so, more
communication among digital humanists who are engaged in digital
curation work might help them arrive at common understandings about
tools and technology that in turn could facilitate sharing and reuse.
PQ2.9 Communication protocols for designated community
 While project personnel did not know who potential reusers of their data
might be, communication and outreach alike were vital parts of their lessons
learned and challenges faced. Learning to communicate with their
designated communities seem a good way to raise awareness, to promote
reuse, and thus to show the value of digital curation work in the context of
digital humanities projects such as the SUGs.
PQ3: Responsiveness to Change
PQ3.1 Potential developments in business models, strategic planning, and
management models in digital curation
 Interviewees did not deal with business or management modeling or
strategic planning. This appears to be a higher-level concern.
PQ3.2 Potential of developments in digital curation to influence new services
and tools
 Interviewees did not consider developing new tools.
PQ3.3 Emerging developments in discipline, and their applicability to digital
curation activity in the institution
 Keeping up with such developments both within (and in fact across
disciplines) can engender new collaborations and may suggest new
possibilities for data reuse by the original project team or in new projects
embarked on by other researchers.
PQ3.4 Cultivate and maintain relationships with other relevant sources of
information in digital curation (individuals/services/institutions)
 Developing such relationships might lead to new collaborations and
innovative projects that could raise awareness of and show the return on
investment of digital curation work.
PQ3.5 Value of new and emerging digital curation technologies and processes
 Interviewees tended to satisfice when it came to digital curation. But it
would be useful for them to monitor and appreciate new technologies and
practices, particularly if they plan to reuse their data and/or extend their
current SUG projects.
PQ3.6 Translate knowledge of technology and processes into services and tools
for needs of designated community

Interviewees were essentially concerned with their own specific projects,
not how best to propagate new models for themselves or other digital
humanists.
PQ3.8 Maintain continuous awareness of emerging developments in digital
curation
 Ideally, project personnel would be able to monitor cutting edge
developments in digital curation. But as most necessarily satisficed and
skilled up in digital curation work on the fly, it may not be possible for them
to do so. Even so, it would be desirable for project personnel to keep up to
data on such developments—such awareness might help them better prepare
their data for future reuse.
PQ3.9 Translate current digital curation knowledge into new services and tools
 SUG project personnel were not responsible for providing tools and services
at their institutions, much less developing new ones.
III) Professional Conduct (PC)
PC1: Regulatory Requirements
PC1.1 Legal frameworks in which digital curation is taking place
 Project personnel operated within legal frameworks already established at
higher institutional levels.
PC1.2 Domain policies and standards for management and preservation of
digital objects
 Though interviewees did not mention domain standards, they were aware of
the importance of domain knowledge. Thus having a grasp of domain
standards might be a useful complement to domain knowledge.
PC1.3 Contribute to national/international regulatory frameworks in which
digital repositories operate
 Project personnel were not involved in high-level policy making.
PC2: Regulatory Compliance
PC2.1 Institution’s legal culpabilities in digital curation activity
 Though my interviewees did not deal with sensitive data, it seems useful for
them to be aware of legal issues.
PC2.2 Incorporate legal requirements into institutional policies
 Interviewees did not have responsibility for institutional policy issues.
PC2.3 Contribute to institutional regulatory framework in which digital
repositories operate
 Interviewees were not involved in regulatory issues.
PC2.4 Apply appropriate actions to curation workflow to ensure compliance
with legal and policy frameworks and relevant standards
 While project personnel did not discuss these issues specifically, the
literature suggests that compliance is an important consideration.
PC2.5 Select and apply validation techniques to detect policy infringement
 See PC2.2

Such responsibility seems part and parcel of behaving like a professional
researcher in an academic setting. Additionally, the literature underlines the
importance of familiarity with ethical issues.
PC3.2 Energy consumption and carbon footprint of digital curation activity
 This was not a concern of interviewees (nor is it stressed in the relevant
literature) and thereby seems an issue to be dealt with on a higher level.
PC3.3 Embed principles of ethical conduct throughout institutional policies
(including those affecting curation activity)
 Project personnel did not have responsibility for or involvement in policy
making.
PC3.4 Adhere to principles of ethical conduct
 See PC3.1
PC3.5 Evaluate and treat employees fairly
 Personnel management was an important concern for a number of PIs and
PMs.
IV) Management and Quality Assurance (MQA)
MQA1: Risk Management
MQA1.1 Undertake succession planning
 Succession planning remains the province of high-level policy makers
MQA1.2 Risk management theory and standards
 No interviewees in this study specifically mentioned risk management
concerns. That said, the digital curation education literature suggests the
need for an understanding of risk management. It is reasonable to conclude
that these researchers need at least an awareness of risk management theory
and standards.
MQA1.3 Apply risk management practice, techniques, and standards to digital
curation activities within institutional risk management context
 See MQA1.2
MQA1.4 Assess, analyze, monitor and communicate risks
 See MQA1.2
MQA2: Audit and Certification
MQA2.1 Audit and certification standards
 No interviewees mentioned audit and certification. But it seems researchers
may need an awareness of these issues even if the work is done by other
persons on campus, if only to be assured that their data remains trustworthy
and reusable. Even so, a number of project personnel mounted their data on
the web or on GitHub, a strategy which bypasses the audit and certification
process altogether.
MQA2.2 Benefits of audit process, and relevance of audit results
 See MQA2.1
MQA2.3 Institutional liabilities in audit process
 Interviewees were not concerned, nor were they responsible, for institutionlevel liabilities such as the audit process.

MQA3: Resource Management
MQA3.1 Undertake strategic planning
 While interviewees emphasized the importance of project planning, they did
not have roles and responsibilities for higher-level strategic planning.
MQA3.2 Undertake business continuity management including disaster
planning
 As with strategic planning, interviewees left this issue to higher-level policy
makers.
MQA3.3 Resources required for digital curation activity including energy
consumption.
 Energy consumption was not mentioned by my interviewees, nor is it
highlighted in the digital curation education literature.
MQA3.4 Reputation management
 Reputation management was not mentioned by my interviewees, nor is it
highlighted in the digital curation education literature.
MQA3.5 Respond to staff recruitment, training, and development needs
 Recruiting, training, and developing staff was generally ad hoc. Projects
may benefit from more focused attention to these issues, particularly on the
part of PIs.
MQA3.6 Undertake financial planning, cost analysis, and economic
sustainability
 Aside from developing budget plans for the SUGs, interviewees did not
have responsibility for nor did they mention financial planning, cost
analysis, or economic sustainability. Such issues seem more relevant to
high-level policy makers and repository personnel.
MQA3.7 Undertake business planning in line with corporate/institutional goals
 Business planning and its relation to institutional goals was not a concern of
interviewees and is not featured in the relevant literature.
MQA3.8 Make sound decisions based on information produced by project team
 Decision-making is heavily reliant upon good communication among all
project personnel. Communication may be most beneficial when it proceeds
both top-down and bottom-up.

MQA3.10 Create a team environment
 Some PIs were more hands-on than others. That said, it seems that most PIs
could invest a bit more effort in facilitating team-building, particularly if the
project personnel have not worked together before. Communication and
interpersonal skills seemingly have an important role in this respect.
MQA3.11 Plan and implement sound staff training and development
 See MQA3.5
MQA3.12 Make sustainable storage decisions in institutional context
 For the most part, the SUG projects accommodated sustainability in their
data management plans. That said, in some cases little thought was given to
sustainability issues, for instance when personnel said they would put their
data on GitHub or mount it on a website. On the other hand, some personnel
simply planned to pass off their data to other parties at the institution, often
librarians or personnel at institutional repositories.
MQA3.13 Creation, management, and monitoring of project plans
 Project planning was identified as a key concern by interviewees. Given the
challenges the SUGS had in adhering to their stated schedules, time
management and taking a long-term perspective are perhaps especially
important.
MQA3.14 Undertake project management activities and innovative practices
 Among the key lessons learned was the importance of project management.
After all, twelve of the nineteen project requested no-cost extensions.
Therefore, good project management skills seem imperative and might help
keep these projects closer to their original planned timeframe.
MQA3.15 Data management requirements
 In sponsoring the Start-Up Grants, the Office of Digital Humanities
recognizes the importance of data management by requiring applicants to
include a data management plan. Some interviewees found the exercise of
writing and following a DMP more useful than did others. Nonetheless,
understanding data management requirements seems crucial in enabling the
sharing and reuse of data in these projects.
 Data management plans were usually written by PIs, but often the daily
responsibilities for data management itself was left to PMs or other project
personnel. It might be beneficial for all project personnel to be involved in
the data management planning stage (if feasible). If this is not possible,
perhaps early in the project the teams could meet to ensure each member
understands how the data management plan can be translated into action.
MQA3.16 Produce relevant information to support decision-making
 This appears to be an important part of transparency and thus of
collaboration, communication, and project management more broadly.

A Researcher Lens for Digital Curation in Digital Humanities
Among the goals of the DigCurV project is to develop new or innovative ways to apply
the Framework (Molloy, Gow and Konstantelos 2015). This study seeks to capitalize on this

Implications and Limitations
Implications
Implications of this study are five-fold. First, the study suggests that awareness of the
value of digital curation among digital humanists is increasing, even if many such scholars
remain unsure about how best to implement optimal digital curation practices. Second, it
suggests that the DigCurV model is flexible and can be applied to educational as well as to
professional settings. Third, the study indicates that so-called soft skills such as communication
and collaboration and planning and project management merit increased attention in digital
curation education. Fourth, challenges in translating terminology between digital curation and
digital humanities persist. Finally, Library and Information Science represents an important
potential locus for digital curation and digital humanities work.
Limitations
Limitations are also five-fold. First, as a case study grounded in snowball sampling, its
results are not generalizable. Second, the projects on which this dissertation focused were
relatively immature and small in scale. Third, the 45 interviewees by and large hailed from
similar institutions (Carnegie RU/VH and Carnegie RU/H). Fourth, although semi-structured
interviews worked well, a more structured approach that guides the interviewees a bit more
might prove useful, for instance in probing their familiarity with specific terms and skills in
digital curation. Fifth, the time frame of the projects was advantageous on one hand (it depicted
the current state of research in the field), but on the other, numerous projects exploited no-cost
extensions and thus had not yet finished their projects by the time of my interviews with their
personnel. In this vein, none of the projects’ data had yet been reused; thus project personnel’s
digital curation efforts could not yet be fully evaluated. Ultimately, this study provides a useful

208

baseline for future research: now we can ask better and more specific questions and pose those
questions to more diverse digital humanities scholars working on more diverse and mature
digital humanities projects.
Future Research
Research “helps to facilitate standardization, planning and assessment by identifying and
building benchmark data within and across research areas, institutional settings, and local and
national jurisdictions” (Gilliland and McKemmish 2004, 149). In examining digital curation
practices in the digital humanities in particular, “Case studies of research data practices in
context are essential for the development of services to support and develop practice” (SCARP
Project 2009, 18).
Three sets of questions are promising for future research; each one builds upon the work
of this study. As interviewee 15 insisted, digital curation in the humanities remains a “greatly
unexplored area.”
A first set of questions centers on the learning framework presented in figure 12. First,
how might such a model be tested and refined? Second, how can the proposed learning
framework be converted into a full-fledged curriculum model? Third, how might such a
curriculum subsequently be propagated across social science and natural science disciplines?
Fourth, how can such a curriculum be implemented at diverse types of institutions?
A second set of questions concentrates on sampling from other kinds of digital humanists.
A full two-thirds of my interviewees work at Carnegie-classified Research Universities (RU/VH)
that show “very high” research activity. Another eight work at Research Universities (RU/H) that
demonstrate “high” research activity. Thus 38 of 45 persons (84.4%) work at one of these two
types of institutions. By contrast, only one interviewee works at a Carnegie Master’s College and

209

University (Master’s L) (i.e. the institution awards at least 200 Master’s degrees) and only one
works at a Carnegie Associate’s—Public Rural-serving Large (Assoc/Pub-R-L). Therefore, my
sample includes only four of 29 Carnegie categories.104 Given the seeming similarity of many of
the participants’ affiliations in this study, what other digital humanities populations’ digital
curation practices would be most conducive to study? In particular, what are the digital curation
practices (and education practices) for digital humanities scholars at liberal arts colleges,
traditionally women’s colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs),
community colleges, and Master’s level institutions?
On a related note, as part of their applications, prospective SUG grantees select a
disciplinary classification from a menu provided by the. The NEH lists 145 possible areas
clustered under twelve categories: Arts, Communications, History, Interdisciplinary Studies,
Languages, Law, Literature, Philosophy, Politics, Religion, and Social Sciences. The nineteen
projects examined in this study occupied twelve of the National Endowment for the
Humanities’s 145 disciplinary classes. Thus future research might explore projects that embrace
more variegated disciplinary classifications.
This issue of sampling channels into a final question: what digital curation skills are
employed by personnel pursuing digital humanities projects more advanced (i.e. creating and
using more data and data of greater complexity and variegation, as in the Digging into Data
projects) than the Start-Up Grants?
A third set of questions takes a longitudinal approach. First, what is the fate of the
nineteen SUG projects here examined? Have they proven sustainable? Has their data been reused
by project personnel, by those outside the original project team, or both? Second, is digital

104

http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/resources/

210

curation education for digital humanists becoming more formalized or systematic? What are
optimal ways of measuring the outcomes of existing digital curation education programs? Third,
do stakeholders view data management plans (DMPs) as more important than they did in the
past? How can we measure DMP improvement (or lack thereof)? Finally, have the roles of
librarians’ and archivists’ roles in digital curation evolved or increased?
Notwithstanding areas for future research, stakeholders need to continue efforts to raise
awareness about the import of digital curation in the digital humanities (as well as in other areas
of study). Molloy contends, “Raised awareness remains one of the preliminary challenges to be
met in the successful creation and embedding of research data management training courses”
(Molloy 2012, 12). A small project can exert a substantial ripple effect (Molloy 2012). Hence
information professionals can play “an important role in raising awareness of open research data,
demonstrating the benefits of data sharing and preparing for the longer term preservation of
research data” (Alexogiannopoulos, McKenney and Pickton 2010, 26). Yet Abbott’s researchers
rarely used such external resources, likely because of a lack of awareness of such services’
availability (Abbott 2015). Interviewee 44 advocates for a “cultural shift” among researchers.
As yet it is far from evident that many researchers would voluntarily undertake additional
training (Jahnke and Asher 2012). Patrick and Wilson (2013) reflect, “Researchers are not
rebellious schoolchildren who need to be bullied into working harder; they are generally highly
motivated and highly skilled individuals who take a great deal of pride in what they do, and thus
are more likely to embrace digital curation as a worthy goal if persuaded of its merits.” Along
these lines, Molloy calls for “promotion of RDM across all disciplines, perhaps by publication of
case studies from varied disciplines and through training events; continued partnerships working
with the primary contacts from partner departments; soliciting feedback specifically from target

211

student audiences in each department, and the incorporation of MANTRA resources into
research student induction sessions” (Molloy 2012, 14-15).
Despite manifold challenges, it seems clear that digital curation, as interviewee 16
insisted, is a “well-established part of the university of the future.” Interviewee 43 agreed,
noting, “That’s where all the jobs are.” A recent Council on Library and Information Resources
report (2013) concludes, “The one certainty regarding research data management, both in terms
of planning and execution, is that the needs will continue to grow at an exponential pace in years
to come. The number of data objects requiring management; the size of those objects; their past
and future relevance; and the communities that wish to collaborate on creating, analyzing, and
searching those objects will all increase, as will the complexity of the human and technical
infrastructure required to support data management activities” (77). It is our responsibility as LIS
professionals to equip digital humanists as well as other digital curation professionals to meet
this formidable challenge.

APPENDIX B: SCRIPT FOR PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT
Script for Participant Recruitment
Dear XXX:
A PhD candidate at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, I am working on a dissertation under the guidance of Drs. Helen R.
Tibbo (Chair), Christopher A. (Cal) Lee, Ryan Shaw, and Sandra Hughes-Hassell (all of SILS),
and Costis Dallas (of the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information).
My dissertation poses the following research question: Are digital humanists (whether faculty,
“alternative-academics,” (alt-acs) or graduate students) interested in acquiring skills to help
manage their data and, if so, what content would they like to learn and how would they like to
learn it?
To address this question, I am conducting qualitative interviews with the Principal Investigators
of the most recent round of NEH-ODH Start-Up Grants. Given your leadership in digital
humanities, as the NEH-ODH has recognized, I would like to request your participation in a
semistructured interview focusing on your project, XXX.
The interview would take between 45 minutes and one hour and would be conducted by phone
(or Skype, if you prefer). If you are willing to participate, could you please let me know when an
interview would best fit with your schedule?
I am happy to answer any questions you may have about this study. More information about my
work can be located at http://alexhpoole.wordpress.com/. I am most grateful for your
consideration.
Sincerely,
Alex H. Poole
