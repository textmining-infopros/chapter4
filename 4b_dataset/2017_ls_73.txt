Abstract
Measures of Alienation from Work Process in Academic Libraries in the Information
Age
Zorian M. Sasyk, M.A. Sociology. Minnesota State University, Mankato. 2017. 66 pp.
This thesis examines how alienation from work process, or work alienation, varies among
work area specializations in academic libraries. Rooted in Marxist theory, the study
utilizes the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire mapped to specific measures of
alienation as a survey tool to measure the relative alienation of library workers at
Master’s level universities in the United States. Data collected is analyzed utilizing
descriptive statistics, including cross-tabulations. Findings of the study indicate that there
is some variation in work alienation among library work classifications and work areas,
with higher alienation found for paraprofessionals, administrators, and library workers in
multiple areas or roles. The conclusion discusses possible explanations for the results
from the sociological and library science occupational literature, including role
ambiguity, role overload, and job autonomy.

CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION
The profession of librarianship invokes images of stern, bespectacled, white
women who have a strong commitment to public service and the community (Defrain and
Pagowsky 2014; Schlesselman-Tarango 2016). Libraries are repositories of knowledge,
literal warehouses of books both fiction and fact, from comic books to business
directories. Librarians sitting behind reference desks strive to answer literally any
question one can throw at them, from where is the restroom to what is the gross national
product of Mongolia. Librarian expertise at searching and retrieving information for
patrons is a product of their education; the vast majority of librarians in the United States
earn their Master's in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from American Library
Association (ALA)-accredited library schools. Librarianship itself encompasses a wide
array of roles, from reference librarians to catalogers to archivists. In addition,
librarianship occurs in a variety of settings, from the public library to the academic
library to the corporate or special library. In the schema of modern labor, librarians are
firmly in the tier of white-collar workers (Nauratil 1989).
However, librarianship is an example of a profession that has been increasingly
challenged in recent years by technological innovation, unstable budgets, and
administrative downsizing. Library technology such the online public access catalog
(OPAC) and the Integrated Library System (ILS) has introduced significant automation
into library operations. In addition, the rapid development of the Internet, culminating in
the now ubiquitous tools known as search engines, has reduced the role of the library as
the predominant center of information in the community. Simultaneously, public funding

2
for higher education and service has declined over the last two decades, resulting
increasing external and internal pressures on library administrations to streamline or even
reduce operations. Thus, academic libraries in particular have seen staff reductions,
especially in technical services, as well as enlarged or multiple roles for library workers.
In some cases, professional librarian work is being supplanted by either outsourcing to
library companies such as ProQuest or OCLC or devolution to paraprofessionals (Litwin
2009). These challenges have led some to call into question the relevancy of librarians in
the 21st century (Davis 2008). From a sociological point of view, they indicate the
increasing possibility of work alienation, typically symptomatic of blue collar factory
jobs, among librarians and library workers.
Given the challenges facing libraries and librarianship, as well as the variety of
roles and forms of librarianship indicated above, this study thus seeks to measure the
level and variation of work alienation among academic library staff, both
paraprofessionals and librarians. The study will seek to explore the following research
question:
RQ: Does the level of work alienation, as measured by job satisfaction,
experienced by academic library staff differ across academic library work
specializations?
Outline of Thesis
Chapter 2 begins with an overview of the Marxist conception of alienation,
grounded in the writings of Karl Marx himself as well as several other sociologists of the
20th century such as Melvin Seeman (1959), Robert Blauner (1964), and Harry

3
Braverman (1975). After this theoretical framework has been laid out, the paper will
proceed into a review of the extant literature on two main subjects: first, it will
investigate various studies in sociology attempting to measure alienation; second, it will
investigate the library science literature for studies concerning alienation, job satisfaction,
and the effects of automation on the profession. For both topics, the various
methodological strengths and weaknesses of the studies will be discussed.
This will lay the groundwork for Chapter 3, which will discuss the immediate
theoretical and methodological underpinnings of the present study, rooted in the
combination of Seeman's dimensions of alienation and the use of the Minnesota
Satisfaction Questionnaire survey instrument to measure alienation via the job
satisfaction of academic library staff. The paper will then proceed to the methodology
and research design of the study, specifically concerning the survey instrument, variables,
sampling methods utilized in its distribution, its validity and reliability, and ethical
concerns.
Chapter 4 contains the findings and analysis of the study, including descriptive
data on the library workers sampled, general alienation scores, and relative alienation
scores and subscores for each of the four measures of work alienation. Cross-tabulations
of alienation scores and each of the two main independent variables, work area and work
classification are presented, both at the general and subscore level. The data is then
analyzed towards the goal of investigating the extent and nature of variation in work
alienation across library workers in different areas and classes.
Chapter 5 provides a discussion of the results of the study, specifically how they

4
revealed variation in work alienation across academic library workers. Drawing on
concepts enumerated in the literature review of Chapter 2, the discussion attempts to offer
some possible explanations for the results. Research contributions, further research
possibilities, as well as the limitations of the study are provided, ending with concluding
remarks.

CHAPTER 2 - LITERATURE REVIEW
Theoretical Background
The specific concept of alienation as relates to capitalist wage labor can be
attributed to Karl Marx ([1932] 1964), although his main exposition of the concept
appeared in unedited notes not intended for publication. His most direct and extensive
treatise on the topic can be found in his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844,
where in an essay titled “Estranged Labor”, he enumerates four aspects of alienation:
alienation from products of labor, alienation from process of production (work),
alienation from species-being (humanity), and alienation of man from man (others). For
the purposes of this paper, we are most concerned with his second aspect of alienation,
alienation from work:

The relation of labor to the act of production within the labor process. This
relation is the relation of the worker to his own activity as an alien activity not
belonging to him...as an activity which is turned against him, independent of him
and not belonging to him. Here we have self-estrangement, as previously we had
the estrangement of the thing. ([Marx 1932] 1964:111-112)

In a capitalist society, the worker is not only alienated from what they produce,
but also alienated from the very actions and methods of the work itself. The worker on
the assembly line cannot control the pace of their work, of the conveyor belt that is an
endless stream of new parts to be spot welded in the exact same manner. Nor does this
worker necessarily understand how their work of spot welding that specific component
fits in with the larger end product. Perhaps most significantly, that worker has little or no
say or agency in what they work on, how they work on it, or why they work on it.

6
Marx's concept of alienation features prominently across much of his work
(Marx 1977:77), and thus in much subsequent Marxist sociological thought. However, it
most often appears in its more general form, combining all of the aspects of alienation
elucidated by Marx. It is only in the mid-20th century that work emerges specifically
focused on alienation from process, referred to throughout this paper as work alienation.
The three most seminal works in this regard are Melvin Seeman (1959), Robert Blauner
(1964), and Harry Braverman (1975).
One of the most influential works on alienation in the 20th century, Seeman
(1959) laid the conceptual groundwork for much of the later empirical studies of work
alienation. It is important to note that Seeman conceives of work alienation in a much
more specific sense then Marx, limiting and defining it to the experience in the
workplace. In the paper, Seeman attempts to define alienation as a multi-dimensional
concept, consisting of five dimensions: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness,
isolation, and self-estrangement. These five concepts were nominally interrelated, but
Seeman sought to demonstrate they were distinct enough to warrant individual
investigation: “...I have attempted, first, to distinguish the meanings that have been given
to alienation, and second, to work toward a more useful conception of each of these
meanings” (Seeman 1959: 791).
Powerlessness
Powerlessness is “the expectation that one's behavior cannot determine
outcomes or reinforcements sought” (Seeman 1959:784),
Normlessness

7
Normlessness is “a situation where there is a high expectation that socially
unapproved behaviors are required to achieve goals.” The term of this measure originates
from Emile Durkheim's idea of anomie, as indicated by Seeman himself. However,
Seeman's definition, and thus the definition utilized in this study, is much narrower in
scope (Seeman 1959:787-788).
Meaninglessness
Meaninglessness is “the low expectation that satisfactory predictions about
future outcomes of behavior can be made” (Seeman 1959:786).
Self-estrangement
Self-estrangement is “working only for the money; real interests lie outside of
work;” essentially, it is extrinsic work motivation (Seeman 1959:789-790).
As will be seen below, Seeman's dimensions of alienation provided the basis for
many subsequent studies' attempts at constructing measures of alienation.
Soon after Seeman (1959), Robert Blauner (1964) produced a seminal and
comprehensive study of alienation in industrial labor that centered on the study of three
stages of industrial production: batch production, mass production, and continuous
process production. Utilizing Seeman's dimensions of alienation as the basis of his survey
instrument, Blauner measured the alienation of workers in three industries representative
of the three stages of production mentioned above. Blauner found that the level of
alienation of workers in the three stages of industries formed an inverted “u-curve”:
lower alienation was associated with the craft-guild batch production stage, as well as the
latter stage and automated continuous-process. In contrast, high alienation was associated

8
with mass production, such as the assembly line. Blauner concluded that although most
industrial work at the time was still in the mass production stage, the introduction of
automation to industrial processes (continuous-process) would reduce work alienation by
removing the drudgery and monotony of the assembly line with the presumably more
“enlarged” job of monitoring automated processes spanning multiple components of
assembly.
Harry Braverman (1975) directly challenges this rosy view of the effects of
automation on work alienation. Braverman (1975) posits that instead of resulting in “job
enlargement” and reducing worker alienation, increasing automation in production
processes merely serves the interests of capitalists. “Despite the variety of means used in
all innovations we have been describing, their unifying feature...is the progressive
elimination of the control functions of the worker...and their transfer to a device which is
controlled...by management from outside the direct process. It is this which dominates the
new place of the worker in the production process...” (Braverman 1975:212). Capitalism's
endless pursuit of higher productivity at lower costs drives capitalists towards higher and
more sophisticated levels of automation, utilizing fewer and fewer workers who are either
overworked or occupy roles where they are merely monitors minimally engaged with
machines that do all the work for them. Both situations lead to heightened work
alienation. (Braverman 1975:220,224-227).
Studies and Measures of Work Alienation
Measures of alienation as a concept
Following Seeman (1959), researchers carried out a number of studies to either

9
test the reliability and validity of Seeman's multi-dimensional definition of alienation, or
to test its relation to other concepts, especially job satisfaction. Neal and Retting (1967),
Zeller et al. (1980), and Lefkowitz and Brigando (1980) each performed their own factor
analyses on some, or all of Seeman's dimensions of alienation (in the forms of commonly
used questions or survey instruments mapped to the dimensions). Each study generally
upheld the reliability and validity of the concepts as distinct measures of alienation.
However, Lefkowitz and Brigando (1980), in addition to measuring the inter-dimensional
validity of the measures of alienation, also sought to determine the level of convergence
of the concept of alienation with that of job satisfaction. The authors found that …
“discrimination between alienation and satisfaction measures was no greater than that
among satisfaction and among alienation” (Lefkowitz and Brigando 1980:115,128).
Studies of alienation, both societal and work
Since Seeman (1959) there have been dozens of studies conducted attempting to
measure alienation in some form, whether generalized or work-specific. The easiest way
to categorize them is by whether they follow Seeman's dimensions of alienation and
whether they measure generalized or work-specific alienation. Concerning the latter
category, only a few of the oldest studies (Clark 1959, Dean 1961, Seeman 1967)
measure alienation in the context of wider society. Clark (1959:851) neither mentions
Seeman nor utilizes his dimensions, although he interestingly finds evidence of a
relationship between alienation and satisfaction, possibly foreshadowing Lefkowitz and
Brigando (1980). It also found negative correlations with alienation for age and work
tenure (Clark 1959:851). Dean (1961) references Seeman and three of his dimensions,

10
powerlessness, normlessness, and social isolation, but constructs them as subscales for
his survey instrument; the study found a slight positive correlation between alienation and
social status, as well as a slight negative correlation with age (Dean 1961:757-758).
Interestingly, Seeman (1967) does not directly utilize his own dimensions of alienation,
but rather utilizes a questionnaire derived from Blauner (1964) based on them. Seeman’s
study analyzes work alienation's effect on personal life, and suggests that work alienation
has little correlative effect on wider societal alienation (Seeman 1967:283-284).
Pearlin (1962) was one of the earliest alienation studies to focus directly on
work alienation. Pearlin, following Clark (1959) acknowledges the importance of
studying work alienation within a social system, such as nurses within a single hospital
system. Pearlin found that work alienation was negatively correlated to positional
disparity in authority structure, limited opportunities for advancement, and low levels of
social interaction with coworkers (Pearlin 1962:325). Aiken and Haige (1966) pursue a
similar strategy, albeit with a focus on the organization as the unit of analysis. Measuring
alienation alongside other variables pertaining to work formalization, the authors were
able to suggest a relationship between highly centralized or formalized work
organizations and higher levels of work alienation (Aiken and Hage 1966:497-499,506507). Chisholm and Cummings (1979) also utilizes Seeman's dimensions of alienation at
the organizational level of analysis, as well as Hull et al. (1982). The latter also sought to
test Blauner's “u-curve” hypothesis on alienation, utilizing data from over 110 New
Jersey factories, as well as retrained printers. Shepard (1970) sought to investigate the
relationship between job specialization and alienation and job satisfaction. The author

11
used an index of job satisfaction, along with three indexes of work alienation
(instrumental work orientation, self-evaluative involvement in work, and commitment to
organizational goals), to study populations that represented each of the three phases of the
man-machine relationship (control room operators from an oil company, assembly-line,
and maintenance craftsmen from an automobile plant). The study suggests a strong
negative relationship between job specialization and alienation (Shepard 1970:210-213,
216-219). Vallas (1988) investigates the impact of technology on work alienation,
studying unions representing communications workers in two Northeast states, as well
some longitudinal data to measure upgrading and deskilling trends in communications
industry over time. The study suggests automation has differential effects both within and
between occupational categories; specifically, automation highly effected clerical
workers, leading to their deskilling and higher levels of work alienation (Vallas
1988:168-170). Finally, Shantz et al. (2015) utilizes a unidimensional measure of work
alienation based on Nair and Vohra (2009), measuring, in addition to alienation,
autonomy, task variety, task identity, and social support at work. Their study suggests
task variety and task identity are negatively related to alienation.
Alienation and Job Satisfaction within Libraries
Alienation as a concept has not been directly addressed in the library science
literature, with the exception of Nauratil (1989) in her book The Alienated Librarian. The
book, despite its age, provides a comprehensive analysis of how librarianship, as a
bureaucratized profession, is prone to high work alienation, echoing Pearlin (1962) and
Aiken and Hage (1966). Although Nauratil (1989) offers many reasons and insights into

12
the causes of alienation among librarians and library staff, perhaps her most insightful
comment is the following, in regard to effects of austerity management and automation:

Librarians, deprived of the traditional job security of public employment, forced
to relinquish substantial portions of their professional autonomy in furtherance of
goals determined unilaterally by top management, and increasingly pressed to
accelerate their productivity - in short, [they are] subject to all the tyrannies of the
industrial speedup without the rewards...The experience of work alienation under
these circumstances is almost inevitable... (Nauratil 1989:68).
Even in Nauratil's work, work alienation in libraries is often relabeled or restated
as “burnout.” This may reflect both the more recent scholarship of librarianship as well
the relative decline in alienation scholarship overall in the last two decades. Thus, in
moving from the sociological literature explored above to the library science literature, a
shift in focus is necessary from alienation per se to possibly correlated or convergent
concepts, such as burnout, role stress and ambiguity, and job satisfaction.
Several examples of the study of job satisfaction within libraries exist, each
often focusing on specialized work areas such as technical services (cataloging and
acquisitions) or public services (reference). Lim (2008) focuses on library informational
technology roles, Sewell and Gilbert (2015) focus on public services, Leysen and
Boydston (2009) focus on catalogers, and Sellberg (2011) focuses on technical services.
Ritzen-Kem (2000) stands out as a seminal work, not only because the study sought to
measure job satisfaction across library area specializations and correlate to a number of
variables including work behavior and area, but also due to the nature of its survey
instrument for job satisfaction, the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ), which is
a well-established tool with high reliability and validity across disciplines (Ritzen-Kem

13
2000:27,40,45-46). Ritzen-Kem (2000) found correlations between level of job
satisfaction of librarians and the type of work behavior they represented (concentrator,
energizer, inducer, and producer), with the former two displaying higher levels of job
satisfaction and the latter two displaying lower levels of job satisfaction. (Ritzen-Kem
2000:60).
Aspects of Braverman's thesis on the alienating effects of automation and
increased efficiency are visible across the library literature, especially in regards to the
subdivision of library labor known as technical services. As early as 1992, Harris noted
the effects of automation on catalogers:
The routinizing of library work through automation has had a major impact on
the activities of cataloguing librarians… this loss of control has come about
largely because of the widespread use of cataloguing networks or bibliographic
utilities… through such services, libraries need no longer do original
cataloguing on site for most materials. Instead, they can simply purchase the
cataloguing records they need, already prepared… This reallocation of resources
moves the control over technical services work away from cataloguers and
toward administrators and systems analysts. (Harris 1992:10-11)
Grenci (2000), in an overview of three presentations by technical services
librarians on the topic of deprofessionalization, identifies the increasing trends of
professional librarian work being moved to paraprofessionals, as well as the increased
reliance on “...private, for-profit businesses that have taken over functions once
performed by the library”, such as original cataloging and resource discovery (Grenci
2000:55-56). Calhoun (2003) discusses the widespread and transformative restructuring
that the Technical Services unit at Cornell University Library had to institute to
“...become more productive, and not just incrementally but dramatically so...change is
needed that will allow technical services to do more work with fewer people, with fewer

14
librarians” (Calhoun 2003:285). In a survey of technical services managers at 112 public
university libraries, Wells (2004) shows that 62.8 percent of the managers' units had lost
positions in recent years, with 72.7 percent reporting lost librarian positions and 52.3
percent indicating lost paraprofessional positions, despite the units often being in states of
technical and organizational transition (Wells 2004:20,29).
A few other works in library science hint at alienation via their analysis of job
stress and role ambiguity. Job stress is defined by Shupe and Pung (2011) as consisting of
three components: role ambiguity, role overload, and role conflict, and they argue that
contemporary librarianship increasingly invokes such traits. “...the expanding, changing
role of the librarian...brings challenges, as libraries develop ways to recruit and select
librarians and help them acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate their new
role... [as well as] role-related stress, brought about by role ambiguity and an increased
workload.” (Shupe and Pung 2011:409-410). In a follow-up study, Shupe et al. (2015)
demonstrated in a survey of 60 librarians that role ambiguity and role overload were
significantly negatively correlated with job stress, burnout, and job satisfaction (Shupe et
al. 2015:267-268). Farler and Broady-Preston (2012), utilizing a mixed-method approach
comprised of interviews and self-completed questionnaires, found that 29 percent of
library staff at a British library experienced job stress more than once a week, in addition
to reports of role ambiguity and burnout (Farler and Broady-Preston 2012:230,234).
The goal of this study is to measure and compare the level of work alienation
experienced within academic libraries, in the face of continuous technological change and
increasing administrative pressures to reduce, automate, and outsource previously

15
specialized services. Seeman's five dimensions of alienation will serve as the basic
measures of work alienation. Their quantitative shortcomings will be addressed by
mapping them to specific questions within the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire, a
well-respected survey instrument for work satisfaction. The author believes this approach
provides a method to isolate alienation due to work while simultaneously presenting an
easily replicable and therefore highly valid design.

16
CHAPTER 2 – METHODOLOGY AND RESEARCH DESIGN
Design
This study utilized a survey-based design to collect data from a number of
academic library staff from medium-sized universities, representing both professionals
and paraprofessionals as well as various library functional work specializations. The
survey instrument collected demographic data central to analysis, such as gender, race,
age, employment length, work area, work classification, unionization, education, etc. In
addition, the survey gathered institutional data, to the extent that could be accomplished
without threatening the anonymity and privacy of the respondents.
Sampling Design
The research design included a multi-stage sampling method to achieve a
representative sample of academic library staff. The Carnegie Classification of
Institutions of Higher Education (2017) website served as a starting point to generate a
large list of universities and thus academic libraries. The Carnegie Classification website
allows for the generation and downloading of lists of higher education institutions based
on either preset or customizable criteria, such as enrollment, types of degree programs
predominantly offered, or areas of focus. For the purposes of this study, the author
generated a custom report based on selecting the criteria of small, medium and large
Master's Colleges and Universities, producing a total of 758 institutions. Per the Carnegie
Classification website, Master’s Colleges and Universities are “institutions that awarded
at least 50 master's degrees and fewer than 20 doctoral degrees during the update year”
(Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education 2017). The author then

17
divided this list between public and private institutions, (resulting in two lists of 273
public and 485 private institutions, respectively) and then divided it again based on
regions of the United States (Great Lakes/Plains, North Atlantic, Southeast, and
West/Southwest). The American Library Association's annual Librarian Salary Survey
provided the regional definitions for each state. Finally, the author selected every fifth
university from each randomized university type list, by region. From the selected
universities' library websites, the author collected staff contact information in the form of
emails, which ultimately became the distribution list for the survey instrument. It is worth
noting here that despite the sampling methodology focusing on institutions, the actual
unit of analysis in this study was still the individual respondent, contacted from the
distribution list.
The author acknowledges both the ethical concerns of privacy and identity
involved in this method, as well the limitations of such a sampling method in terms of
response rate. Ethical concerns are addressed more fully in the below section on Data
Collection. In terms of limitations, the multi-stage method attempted to generate a sample
of library staff as representative as possible, in terms of type of institution, geography,
and class (staff vs. librarian). However, since the sample was artificially limited based on
certain Carnegie Classification criteria such as degree-granting and size and researchlevel to medium-sized Master's schools, it cannot be generalized to academic libraries in
general. This was intended: there is such variety and differences in resources, including
staffing levels, among university libraries based on size and research role, that it did not
seem productive to compare alienation and job satisfaction across all tiers of Carnegie

18
Classification. Furthermore, the study could be easily replicated utilizing a sample
population reflective of libraries at either much smaller or much larger institutions.
Variables
Variables in this study were divided into two categories: Demographics and job
satisfaction. The variables for demographics included the following: occupational tenure,
library area specialization, union membership, work classification, faculty status
(conditional on selecting librarian), and tenure (conditional on having faculty status). The
variables for job satisfaction included four of Seeman's dimensions of alienation:
powerlessness, normlessness, meaninglessness, and self-estrangement.
Each of these four variables were operationally defined by being exclusively
mapped to several of the twenty factors corresponding to questions of the MSQ survey
instrument. Thus, powerlessness was operationally defined by answers on MSQ question
labeled with the factors of creativity, independence, variety, authority, working
conditions, and responsibility. Normlessness was operationally defined by answers
corresponding to moral values, company policies and practices, advancement, and
coworkers. Meaninglessness was operationally defined by answers corresponding to
ability utilization, supervision-human relations, security, supervision-technical, and
activity. Finally, self-estrangement was operationally defined by answers corresponding
to social service, social status, compensation, recognition, and achievement. Thus, an
answer on the Likert scale responses to any questions mapped to powerlessness would
indicate a higher or lower level of powerlessness.
Survey Items

19
The central instrument of the survey consisted of the long-form version of the
Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ), which measures job satisfaction. This
surveys contains one hundred short questions, with 5-point Likert scale responses. Each
of the questions correspond to one of twenty factors of job satisfaction, as exhibited by
Table B. Each question was mapped to one of four of Seeman's dimensions of alienation:
powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, and self-estrangement. This was
accomplished by mapping each of the twenty MSQ job satisfaction factors to one of the
four dimensions of alienation (see Table A). The numeric results of each group of 5
questions corresponding to the twenty factors was summed, and an average score
produced which corresponded to level of job satisfaction. From this, average scores for
each of the four alienation measures were also produced for each respondent, thus
providing a quantification of each respondent's alienation.
Method of Data Collection
The survey instrument was constructed utilizing the online survey tool Qualtrics,
which was then sent to each email address on the distribution list generated by the
sampling method. Emails to individuals included a link to the Qualtrics survey. The
Qualtrics software allows for the collection of all survey response data in one place, and
includes tools allowing for basic statistical analysis as well as for the export of collated
data for further analysis either manually or via statistical software such as SPSS.
The largest ethical concerns of this project involve the privacy of the individuals
being targeted for the survey instrument via email. Regardless of what method utilized to
contact individual academic library employees, sentiments of personal intrusion are a real

20
possibility. However, as far as could be determined in the author's review of library
occupational research, there are no better ways of representatively sampling both
librarians and paraprofessionals simultaneously. For instance, if the study only focused
on librarians, the survey instrument could have been distributed to library professional
list-servs, or lists of members of library professional organizations could possibly have
been obtained towards the same end. However, paraprofessionals and other non-librarian
academic library staff do not participate in professional organizations to the same extent
as librarians; thus, they are much harder to target for surveying purposes.
Another concern is that by the very nature of email, the information gathered by
participants' responses could potentially be enough to identify them. Second, the
responses given in the demographic section of the survey instrument could in theory be
used to identify individuals. Identity concerns were addressed by refraining from asking
demographic questions concerning the name of the institution where individuals worked.
This data was felt the most dangerous in regards to respondent identification, especially if
that individual was from a small institution or a library with a small staff size.

CHAPTER 3: FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS
Descriptives
Through the aforementioned sampling method, 1600 participants were selected
to receive email messages with a link to the MSQ Survey in Qualtrics. Of the 1600
contacted, 343, or 21.4 percent responded; of these 343 responses, 188 or 11.5 percent
were completed surveys. The findings and analysis of this study are taken from these 188
valid survey responses.
Descriptive data on the participants of the survey are shown in Table F, based on
responses from the Demographic questions section at the end of the questionnaire. By
gender, 36 or 19.15 percent of participants were male, 142 or 75.53 percent were female,
and 10 or 5.32 percent selected “prefer not to respond”. By age, 18 or 19.57 percent of
participants were between 20-29, 41 or 21.81 percent were 30-39, 50 or 26.60 percent
were 40-49, 34 or 18.09 percent were 50-59, and 36 or 19.15 percent were 60 and over.
Racially, the sample population was 78.19 percent white, 3.72 percent African American,
4.70 percent Hispanic/Latino, 1.60 percent Asian/Pacific Islander, 3.72 percent multiracial; 6.91 percent or participants preferred not to specify their race/ethnicity.
Concerning what area of the library participants worked in, 91 or 48.40 percent worked in
Public Services, 40 or 21.28 percent worked in Technical Services, 29 or 15.43 percent
worked in Administration, and 26 or 13.83 percent worked in another area which they
specified in the following response. Regarding work classification, 56 or 29.79 percent of
participants were paraprofessionals, 100 or 53.19 percent were librarians, 20 or 10.64
percent were administrators, and 10 or 5.32 percent indicated other classifications

22
specified in the following response. 24.47 percent of participants were a member of a
union, while the majority or 72.87 percent were not. Of the 100 participants who
indicated they were classified as librarians, 59 percent held faculty status, 38 did not, and
3 preferred not to respond; of the 59 faculty librarians, 27.12 percent held tenure status,
71.19 percent did not, and 1 preferred not to respond.
Work Alienation Scores: General
A general work alienation score was generated for each participant by summing
all 100 of their responses to the MSQ questionnaire, with the highest score possible being
500 (answering Very Satisfied or 5 on each question). Table G shows some general
descriptive data about the alienation scores. The mean score for all participants was
313.76, with a standard deviation of 77.59. A comparison of means test was run for two
of the independent variables most pertinent to the study's research question, library work
area and library work classification. The mean alienation score of library work areas was:
308.71 for Public Services, 317.25 for Technical Services, 335.69 for Administration,
and 301.62 for participants who indicated Other. The mean alienation score of library
work classifications was: 303.75 for Paraprofessionals, 318.99 for Librarians, 329.50 for
Administrators, and 286.1 for participants who indicated Other. Table H shows a
comparison of means table combining both variables, showing the mean score for the
fifteen possible combinations of work area and work classification for participants.
These tables show relatively small differences in average work alienation scores
across work areas and work classifications. Within work areas, administration had the
highest mean scores, and therefore lowest measured work alienation, while participants

23
who selected their area as Other had the lowest scores, and thus highest measured work
alienation. Within work classifications, administrators had the highest mean scores and
lowest work alienation, while participants who classified as Other once again had the
lowest scores and highest measured work alienation.
The general work alienation scores presented thus far are based directly on the
MSQ Questionnaire; they are absolute measures of work alienation that are essentially
percentages. Percentage scores can easily be calculated by dividing a participant's
summed total score by 500. The same can be applied to mean scores; for instance, the
mean percentage score of all respondents is 62.75 percent. According to the MSQ
documentation, this number indicates that academic library workers have low job
satisfaction; in the context of this study, this number indicates high work alienation.
However, as stated in the research question, this study seeks to determine whether work
alienation differs across academic library work specializations (i.e. work area and work
classification). We turn to cross-tabulations in the next subsection to further explore this
relative work alienation.
Work Alienation Scores Across Work Areas and Work Classifications
To further investigate relative work alienation among academic library workers,
participant work alienation scores were categorized into 1 of 5 “score groups”,
representing ranges corresponding to the five levels of satisfaction Likert Scale on the
MSQ questionnaire. The ranges consisted of the following: 0-175 (most alienated), 176250 (more alienated), 251-325 (neutral), 326-400 (less alienated), 401-500 (least
alienated). These “Score Groups” were then utilized as the new dependent variable in two

24
cross-tabulations, one for work area and one for work classification. These crosstabulations can be seen in Tables I and J.
In Table I, the row percentage under each work area shows the percentage of
library workers in each Score Group. By looking at the two lowest Score Groups, that is,
the percentage of library workers with scores between 0 and 250, and then summing
them, one can get a more precise indication of the level of relative work alienation per
work area. For instance, Table I shows that 19.38 percent of Public Service workers
featured scores indicating higher levels of alienation; Technical Services workers showed
22.5 percent, Administration showed 6.9 percent, and Other showed 23.07 percent.
Across all work areas, 19.89 percent of workers had scores of high relative work
alienation.
Table J does the exact same thing for Work Classification, producing indications
of the level of relative work alienation per work classification. The percentage of library
workers in each work-classification with scores indicating high relative alienation were:
25 percent of paraprofessionals, 17 percent of librarians, 15 percent for administrators,
and 30 percent for Other. Across all work classifications, 19.89 percent of library workers
had scores of high relative work alienation.
Work Alienation Sub-Scores: Seeman's Measure of Alienation
As discussed above, the most discrete indicators of relative work alienation in
this study relate to scores mapped via the MSQ to four of Seeman's measures of
alienation; normlessness, meaninglessness, powerlessness, and self-estrangement. Scores
for each measure were generated for each participant by summing the scores of responses

25
to questions mapped to each measure, respectively. Similar to the relative work alienation
measured by the general MSQ score, scores for each measure of alienation were grouped
into one of five “score groups”, once again representing ranges corresponding to the five
levels of satisfaction of the Likert Scale on the MSQ questionnaire. However, since the
number of questions mapped to each measure was slightly varied, the ranges varied as
well. Regardless, one can get a sense of the specific measure of high relative alienation
by once again looking at the summed percentage of the lowest two score groups. Like the
relative work alienation measured by the general MSQ score above, each measure of
alienation's “score groups” were used as dependent variables in cross-tabulations against
the independent variables library work area and library work classification.
For the alienation measure normlessness, 8.79 percent of works in the public
service work area experienced high levels of relative normlessness, with figures of 10
percent for technical services, 3.45 percent for administration, and 15.39 percent for
Other. The average percentage of high levels of normlessness across all areas was 9.14
percent. The percentage of high levels of normlessness across library work classifications
was as follows: 8.93 percent for paraprofessionals, 7 percent for librarians, 10 percent for
administrators, and 30 percent for Other. The average percentage of high levels of
normlessness across all work classifications was 9.14 percent.
For the alienation measure of meaninglessness 9.9 percent of participants in the
public services work area experienced high levels of relative meaninglessness, with
figures of 7.5 percent for technical services, 6.9 percent for administration, and 19.2
percent for Other. The average percentage of high levels of meaninglessness across all

26
areas was 10.2 percent. The percentage of high levels of meaninglessness across library
work classifications was as follows: 14.3 percent for paraprofessionals, 7 percent for
librarians, 15 percent for administrators, and 10 percent for Other. The average
percentage of high levels of meaninglessness across all work classifications was 10.2
percent.
For the alienation measure of self-estrangement, 7.7 percent of participants in
the public services work area experienced high levels of relative self-estrangement, with
figures of 12.5 percent for technical services, 6.9 percent for administration, and 15.3
percent for Other. The average percentage of high levels of self-estrangement across all
areas was 9.7 percent. The percentage of high levels of self-estrangement across library
work classifications was as follows: 12.5 percent for paraprofessionals, 8 percent for
librarians, 15 percent for administrators, and 0 percent for Other. The average percentage
of high levels of self-estrangement across all work classifications was 9.7 percent.
Finally, for the alienation measure of powerlessness 7.7 percent of participants
in the public services work area experienced high levels of relative powerlessness, with
figures of 2.5 percent for technical services, 6.9 percent for administration, and 15.4
percent for Other. The average percentage of high levels of powerlessness across all areas
was 7.5 percent. The percentage of high levels of powerlessness across library work
classifications was as follows: 7.1 percent for paraprofessionals, 6 percent for librarians,
15 percent for administrators, and 10 percent for Others. The average percentage of high
levels of powerlessness across all work classifications was 7.5 percent.
Compared to the general scores of relative high alienation, the relative scores of

27
the specific alienation measures were much lower, often in the single digits. Only one of
the alienation measure score averages, for meaninglessness, was over 10 percent. Overall,
alienation measure scores were higher for the work areas of Administration and Other, as
well as the work classifications of Other. Paraprofessionals had higher alienation scores
in all measures than librarians, while public services and technical services workers were
almost even. These differences in alienation scores trends across areas and classifications
mirror those found in the general alienation scores.
Overall, the variation in measured work alienation of the library worker
respondents were small but noticeable across work areas and work classifications.
General alienation scores show that work alienation was highest for workers in the Other
work area category, followed by Public Services, then Technical Services, and lowest
amongst Administration. Similarly, the general scores show alienation across workclassifications was highest among the Other category, followed by Paraprofessionals,
then Librarians, with the lowest scores amongst Administrators. Do the relative alienation
subscores based on Seeman's measures of alienation support the findings of the general
scores?
In Table K, we see the averages across the four measures of the 40th percentile
scores for each work area and work classification. Without getting into the individual 40th
percentiles scores for each measures across both variables, Table K allows us to see if the
subscores follow the general scores. Indeed, we find across work areas that alienation is
highest among Other, then Public Services, then Technical Services, with lowest relative
alienation among Administration. Across work classifications, relative alienation is

28
highest among Administrators, then Paraprofessionals, then Other, with Librarians having
the lowest alienation. The measures of alienation sub-scores averages rank the same for
work areas, but are significantly different for work classifications. Specifically, the
Administrators category had a high general alienation score (329.5), but also high rates of
high relative alienation across the measures of alienation subscores (13.75 percent
average, 10 percent Normlessness, 15 percent in Meaninglessness, Self-estrangement,
and Powerlessness).
Comparisons between two sets of work areas and work-classifications, public
services-technical services and paraprofessional-librarian, are worth examining in greater
detail as they represent the majority of respondents (69.68 percent in Work Areas and
82.93 percent in Work Classifications, respectively). As already noted above,
Paraprofessionals consistently were shown to have higher levels of alienation than
librarians, in general scores (25 percent vs 17 percent), average percent subscores (10.71
percent vs. 7 percent), and across all subscores. In particular, Paraprofessionals
experienced higher levels of Meaninglessness and Self-estrangement then Librarians
(14.30 percent vs 7 percent, 12.50 percent vs 8 percent, respectively). In contrast, little
variation in levels of alienation existed between library workers in public services and
technical services, regardless of general score (21.98 percent vs. 22.5 percent), average
percent subscore (8.52 percent vs. 8.13 percent), and across all subscores. However, some
variation was apparent in the measures of Self-estrangement and Powerlessness, with
Public Services workers demonstrating higher levels of Powerlessness (7.70 percent vs
2.50 percent) and Technical Services workers demonstrating higher levels of Self-

29
estrangement (12.50 percent vs. 7.70 percent).

30
CHAPTER 4: DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether work alienation
experienced by academic library workers varied across work areas and work
classifications. By utilizing the MSQ job satisfaction questionnaire and mapping its
questions to Seeman's measures of alienation, and then distributing the survey to library
workers at Master's level universities across the United States, a quantitative assessment
of work alienation within these librarians was attempted. Both general scores as well as
subscores based on the measures of alienation were generated from survey responses, and
then cross-tabulated with the research question variables of work area and workclassification for easy comparison.
Discussion
Cross-tabulations of both the general scores and subscores of work alienation
against work area and work specialization demonstrated that variation did exist among
academic library workers across these variables. Before further discussion of these
results, however, it must be noted that although variation existed, it was not found to be
statistically significant, due to a variety of factors. First, the size of the various N's of
work area and work classification were not normally distributed, with high N's for one
half of the categories (Paraprofessionals, Librarians, Technical Services, Public Services)
and low N's for the other half (Administrators, Other, Administration, Other). Thus,
standard parametric tests for significance such as ANOVA were not applicable. Second,
based on the large standard deviations found for means in each of the above categories
(see Table H), it was clear that there was greater variation within the categories then

31
between categories. This precludes the ability to conclude statistical significance from the
results.
Within work areas, the Other category exhibited the highest work alienation
across both general and subscores, while the Administration category exhibited the
lowest work alienation. Public services and technical services, the two largest work areas
by number of respondents, exhibited roughly similar levels of work alienation, albeit in
between the extremes of the aforementioned areas. Within work classifications, results
were less consistent between general scores and subscores: the Other category exhibited
the highest levels of work alienation as measured by general score, while Administrators
exhibited the highest levels of work alienation as measured by subscore.
Paraprofessionals exhibited higher levels of work alienation then librarians across both
levels of measurement. Due to the descriptive nature of the data analysis (crosstabulations), as well as the non-normally distributed nature of the data itself, the
statistical significance of this variation cannot be determined. However, it is still worth
investigating in some detail possible explanations for the observed variation, grounded in
both the sociological literature on alienation as well as the library science literature on job
satisfaction and burnout.
Marxist explanations
As discussed in the literature review, work alienation was conceived by Marx as
primarily an affliction of the blue-collar working class, such as workers on an assembly
line. Capitalists, in their pursuit of cutting costs for the sake of the profit motive, reduced
the complexity of individual labor to a few, repetitive tasks without context, eroding

32
workers' claim to wage power via specialization. Whenever feasible, jobs and processes
were automated, reducing the number of workers as well as further separating them from
the means of production via new roles as “monitors” of machines (Braverman 1975:220222). These monitoring roles over “continuous processes” either led to increased job
complexity (overseeing machines doing what used to be the work of several workers) or a
further reduction in worker engagement with process. In either case, higher work
alienation is likely; in Seeman's measures, the former leads to powerlessness and the
latter leads to self-estrangement.
In an academic library work environment, we are dealing with a white-collar
office setting, not a factory. Following Braverman (1975) and Fraser (2002), however,
work alienation can still occur along the lines Marx predicted. Shrinking government
financial support of higher education leads to flat or reduced budgets, necessitating staff
reductions; simultaneously, new technology increasingly automates clerical, technical,
and even professional work. Less library workers of all classifications and in all work
areas are expected to maintain and even expand library service levels, often utilizing
technology that rapidly changes. This affects different work areas and work
classifications differently, as found by Vallas (1988) and demonstrated, in part, by the
variations in high alienation found by this study.
For instance, as noted in the results, paraprofessionals had higher levels of work
alienation then professional librarians. Paraprofessionals often perform clerical or
technician work, whether it be manning a circulation desk and checking out materials to
the public, processing newly purchased books, or invoicing new orders. They often (but

33
not always) are supervised by either managers or librarians, who often also determine
their job duties and workloads. In contrast, librarians as professionals generally (but not
always) perform more “involved” work, such as reference services, collection
development, original cataloging, and instruction. They also generally have larger work
autonomy to perform these duties and roles, with less direct supervision. As staffing is
reduced, paraprofessionals are asked to be “crosstrained” in more areas (i.e. public
services and technical services), regardless of previous experience or skills. In addition,
paraprofessional job duties such as secretarial work, book processing, copy-cataloging,
and even checking out materials may become automated with technology.
Paraprofessionals, more often than not, have little say in such developments, due to their
general lack of job autonomy. The ultimate outcome of this is the powerlessness form of
work alienation, as seen in the higher alienation scores for paraprofessionals. In contrast,
the rate of work alienation among librarians is generally lower, despite similar forces of
downsizing and automation affecting librarians. This is due to librarian job autonomy as
well as tasks that cannot easily be automated, such as teaching instruction and performing
reference consultations. Librarians can more easily resist these adverse work conditions
due to job autonomy; this follows the findings of the alienation studies of Pearlin (1962),
Shepherd (1970), and Vallas (1988), which all found that clerical level work, low job
autonomy, and low job specialization were correlated to higher alienation.
An interesting finding of this study was the high rates of work alienation for
administrators. In Marxist theory, administrators would be equivalent to management or
even capitalists, vis a vis the “proletarian” paraprofessionals or “middle-class” librarians.

34
One would surmise that in such roles where they controlled or dictated the work of others
or even the entire organization, administrators would be the least susceptible to forms of
alienation such as meaninglessness, self-estrangement, and powerlessness. However, as
noted above, administrators had the greatest rates of high work alienation in these three
measures across all work classifications. There are several possible explanations for this.
First, from a Marxian perspective, library administrators may experience work alienation
due to being far removed from actual work processes that are actually carried out by
paraprofessionals and librarians; this disconnect may lead to a decrease in intrinsic work
motivation, resulting in work self-estrangement. Another Marxian explanation may be
that library administrators are often themselves responding to external pressures on the
library when carrying out the reorganizations, downsizing, and outsourcing that
paraprofessionals and to a lesser extent librarians find potentially alienating. Especially in
the context of public universities funded by the state, where often budget decisions are
made by the legislature, delivered to the university, and then impact the library,
administrators may feel the quality of their management makes little difference.
Ultimately, this may lead to the feelings of powerlessness and meaninglessness seen in
this study.
Across work areas, it is interesting to note that outside of library workers who
identified as “Other”, levels of high work alienation were relatively low for Public
Services, Technical Services, and Administration. Specifically, the rates for the first two
are worth exploring in more detail, as they are the traditional bipartite divisions of work
in libraries. Technical Services demonstrated higher levels of normlessness (10 percent)

35
and self-estrangement (12.50 percent), but a very low level of powerlessness (2.50
percent). As noted above, Technical Services generally involves more process-oriented
work based in an office setting; workers most often sit at desks on computers, working
with highly specialized software for library tasks such as cataloging, managing electronic
resources, or ordering and invoicing of library resources. Work is very process-oriented,
often with several processes done by several people within a larger unit workflow. Such
work can often be tedious clerical work (entering paper orders or invoices manually into
the acquisitions module of an integrated library system), but also can often be quite
specialized and involve complex problem solving skills (fixing record batch loads or
electronic resource access issues) (Zhu 2012:136-137). The tedious nature of much
technical services work may explain the higher level of self-estrangement; higher levels
of technical specialization may explain the low levels of powerlessness, as technical
services workers often need to understand the immediate effects of their tasks within the
context of larger interrelated workflows. In other words, the low levels of powerlessness
in technical services workers in this study approximates the “continuous process” end of
Blauner's inverted U-curve. This specialization may also give them more authority to
determine and control their work, as well as mitigate against administrative intervention.
Burnout, role ambiguity, and role overload
As has been already noted above, the “Other” category in both work area and
work classification demonstrated the highest levels of work alienation, almost regardless
of score level or score type. It bears mentioning that within the context of the survey,
respondents who selected “Other” as their answer in response to the work area or work

36
classification question were prompted to enter their answer in a text box. This allows
some insight into what “Other” means beyond “not” being the three other enumerated
options. For instance, for work area, the following were entered responses for the other
category: subject academic librarian, both tech and public, both public and tech and
archives, Systems, Electronic Resources, and Interlibrary Loan. Indeed, many of the
responses indicated library workers who identified or belonged to multiple work areas.
Similarly, the following are a few of the “Other” responses for work classification:
archivist, non-library professional, have an MLIS but job title not librarian, librarian and
administration, and supervisor (which occurred four times). Once again, we see instances
of multiple roles and muddied classifications.
“Other” respondents may be experiencing role ambiguity due to these various
“hats” they have to wear across library work areas and classifications. Role ambiguity
occurs “...when employees are unclear about their specific responsibilities or the
boundaries of their job” (Shupe and Pung 2011: 410). As mentioned above, the library
work areas defined for this study entail different kinds of library work, ranging from
interacting with the public dynamically at a service desk (public services) to sitting alone
in an office cubicle entering journal publication coverage into a database (technical
services). If a library worker is expected to work across two or more of these work areas
on a recurring basis, and their expected roles vary significantly, they may experience role
ambiguity (Shupe et al. 2015:265-266). Role ambiguity and the stress and anxiety that it
produces can in turn lead to alienation. For instance, using a work area response from the
study mentioned above, someone who works in technical services, public services, and

37
archives may find themselves over the course of one day working a public service desk,
copy-cataloging books, and digitizing print materials. If seen through the lens of work
duties, ambiguity quickly ensues when one has to navigate conflicting unit meetings,
projects, and expectations. A library worker in this position may quickly begin to feel
powerlessness and meaninglessness; indeed, 15.40 percent and 19.20 percent,
respectively, of library workers in “Other” work areas felt high levels of these measures
of alienation.
Role overload may provide another explanation for the high levels of alienation
among library workers in “Other” work areas and work-classifications. Role overload is
experienced by a worker when their work becomes overwhelming due to it being very
hard, very rapid, of long duration, or requiring skills or resources beyond their ability or
situation (Shupe and Pung 2011:410). Several situations in academic libraries could lead
to role overload. For instance, a library worker who previously only worked or
specialized in one area may quickly feel overwhelmed if asked to contribute in a second,
unfamiliar, area as well. Similarly, a library worker who takes on roles spanning multiple
work-classifications, such as librarian and administrator, may find they simply do not
have the time or skills to maintain their old duties while tackling new ones. However,
they are still held, or perceive they are held accountable, for these responsibilities; the
resulting internal tension leads to stress, burnout, and possibly alienation in the form of
powerlessness (Shupe et al. 2015:265-266). This is demonstrated once again in the high
percentage subscores for powerlessness for both the work area (15.40 percent) and workclassification (10.00 percent) of “Other”.

38
CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSION
As stated before, the purpose of this study was to measure work alienation
among academic library workers to see if alienation varied based on work area or work
classification. Academic libraries, as generally white collar work environments, differ
markedly from the commonly blue collar, factory-type settings featured in many studies
on work alienation. However, research such as Nauratil (1989), Fraser (2002), Vallas
(1988), and Archibald (2009) indicate that alienation is an increasingly salient occurrence
in white-collar office settings, with academic libraries being no exception. Library
workers may be prone to alienation for a variety of reasons; automation, budget
reductions leading to downsizing, tedious work, high levels of semi-structured interaction
with the public at service points, outsourcing, and rigid class distinctions among
paraprofessionals, librarians, and administrators.
Taking as a starting point that work alienation and job satisfaction are correlated
concepts (Leftkowitz and Brigando 1980), this study utilized the Minnesota Satisfaction
Questionnaire (MSQ) as a means to generate “scores” of alienation of surveyed academic
library workers. The hundred questions of the MSQ were each mapped to one of four of
Seeman's measures of alienation, producing an additional level of “subscore”
measurement. The study found that work alienation did vary across work areas and workclassifications; specifically, paraprofessionals were more alienated then their librarian
coworkers, Technical Services and Public Services workers showed little variation in
levels of alienation, and workers that classified their work areas and/or workclassifications as “Other” had the highest levels of both general and relative work

39
alienation.
Contributions
This study contributed in several ways to both the sociological and library
science literature. First, it developed a new methodology of measuring work alienation,
based on a structured combination of Seeman's measures of alienation and the Minnesota
Satisfaction Questionnaire. This methodology, based on the convergent validity of work
alienation and job satisfaction, allows for the relatively easy generation of scores of
alienation for survey respondents; these basic scores can be recoded or manipulated for
further statistical analyses. In addition, the measure subscores provide the opportunity for
more granular investigation of work alienation, especially combined with demographic
variables such as work area and work classification in cross-tabulations. Altogether, the
methodology of this study makes it easily replicated, not only in libraries, but for other
occupational settings as well.
Second, the study contributes fresh research on work alienation to the field of
sociology, in an occupation that has never been studied in that regard other than Nauratil
(1989). As noted previously, the study of alienation within the sociology literature has
declined in the last two decades; the current study contributes a refreshed approach to
measuring and studying the concept, particularly in a white-collar setting. In particular,
the findings of this study take into consideration the effect of continued and even
increased technological change in the 21st century. Whereas previously alienation studies
such as Blauner (1964) and Hull et al. (1982) focused on technology and blue collar
workers, this study demonstrates the potential of automation among white collar workers

40
to cause work alienation as well. This was demonstrated by the high work alienation of
paraprofessionals and library workers who work in more than one area.
Finally, this study provides useful occupational data for both the library
profession as a whole as well as for academic library administrators or decision makers.
Librarianship and libraries in general have been in a state of prolonged transformation
over the last two decades, due to rapid expansion of the Internet and the increasing
proliferation of library materials in digital format, such as e-books, e-journals, and article
databases. These technological changes have affected the informational seeking behavior
of library patrons, which has in turn affected how they utilize the library and what
services they expect from it. The shifts and changes libraries have had to make in this
environment have had a significant effect on the duties and responsibilities of workers.
Administrators and library decision-makers would benefit from the results of this study
indicating how work alienation varies across the library workplace. It could inform future
organizational restructuring decisions, and potentially help avoid creating work roles and
duties conducive to work alienation, such as job ambiguity and overload.
Further Study
The findings of this study only set the stage for further research into work
alienation in academic libraries. Not all the demographic variables collected for this study
were analyzed for the sake of brevity in this paper; further descriptive analysis via crosstabulations of both general and subscores vis-a-vis variables like age, union membership,
and librarian faculty status would greatly enhance the picture of work alienation across
the library workplace. The author intends to carry out this further analysis as the subject

41
of future research.
Another avenue for potential investigation is replicating the study utilizing
libraries at both larger and smaller Carnegie classification universities. The synthesized
findings of such studies combined with the present study would allow for broader
generalizations of explanations of the variations in work alienation within academic
libraries. Additional variables could be studied for possible influences on work
alienation, such as institution size and budget.
Finally, more advanced statistical methods could be utilized to analyze the data
of this study or replications of it. T-tests, ANOVAs, and regression analysis could be
performed, given the proper transformation of the raw survey results in SPSS. Such
analyses would improve upon the results of this study in two ways. First, statistical
significance or lack thereof could be demonstrated for variation in alienation across the
variables studied. Second, the use of multiple linear regression could demonstrate which
of the many variables available in this study were most closely tied to higher levels of
work alienation.
Limitations
There are several limitations to the findings of this study. First, the variation in
work alienation across library workers indicated by this paper are only generalizable to
library workers at medium-sized, Master's level universities in the United States; they are
not indicative of all academic library workers. As noted in the previous section
concerning further study, university and library size, as well as research-level, may have
an effect on variation in work alienation at larger or smaller institutions. Furthermore,

42
only descriptive statistical analysis was utilized on the data of this study; thus, the
findings make no claim to statistical significance. Another limitation of this study was the
relatively low response survey response rate of 11.5 percent. This low rate can be
attributed to the email distribution method utilized to disseminate the survey to the
randomly sampled list of 1600 library workers. Email distribution was deemed by the
author as the only practical method of distribution, due to sample size and the need for
data analysis. Mail distribution and manual data entry of responses were not feasible for
this project.
Over 150 years ago, Karl Marx first wrote about the alienation of the worker
within the then emerging capitalist mode of production. Since then, many sociologists,
including Blauner, Seeman, and Braverman have further developed the idea, often in the
context of industrial society at the time. The concept of alienation, as a literature review
on the subject shows, has proven notoriously hard to define, let alone measure
empirically. Seeman's multi-dimensional definition, based on the five measures of
meaninglessness, powerlessness, normlessness, self-estrangement, and isolation, has been
widely adapted by studies of work alienation in sociology. At its core, work alienation
involves a gap, a disconnection between a worker and their work that is primarily
situationally induced. This study demonstrates that within the context of the white-collar
environs of academic libraries, work alienation not only exists but varies across library
work areas and work classifications, from paraprofessional to librarian and from public
services to administration. Acknowledging the presence of alienation in the library
workplace, the question for future research and library administration alike is the

43
following: what can be done about it?
