Abstract
For thousands of years, libraries in China were treated as book repositories
and remained closed to the public. It was not until the end of Imperial China and the
establishment of a Republican China (1911) that the first public libraries became
available. The Republic of China Era (1912-1949) witnessed various changes, including:
an increased literacy level among the general public, the advent of modern school
systems, the development of modern public libraries, the discovery of childhood, the
growth of child welfare, and the flourishing of children’s literature. Youth services at
public libraries in China emerged in this environment. Since 1909, pioneering librarians
began to address the needs of children in professional settings by introducing Western
youth service models and discussing how to establish, organize, and operate a children’s
library in China. The first children’s reading rooms were founded in public libraries in
the late 1910s, which predated the other elements of youth services librarianship. In
response to the publication peak of children’s reading materials since the 1920s,
librarians set standards for book selection and built library collections to meet children’s
reading interests and needs. Moreover, children’s libraries gradually developed group
methods to connect children with texts. In the 1930s, programs, such as reading guidance,
reader’s club, storytelling, and exhibits became a viable part of youth services. The
foundation of the Library Association of China in 1925, and the Resolution of 1933,
stipulating that every library should have a children’s reading room, further advocated
and formalized youth services. The above factors converged historically and contributed
to the development and progress of youth services in public libraries in China from the
founding of the Republic of China to the eve of the Sino-Japanese War (1912-1937).

Chapter 1: Introduction
“It is not a disgrace for a nation to lack a navy or an army! It is only a disgrace for a
nation to lack public libraries, museums, and art galleries. Our people must get rid of this
kind of disgrace.”
– HU Shi, 1915.
China has a civilized history of more than five thousand years, and the
existence of ancient libraries can be dated back as early as to the sixth century B.C.
However, for thousand of years, the old style libraries in China were treated mainly as
book repositories and were closed to the public. It was not until the end of Imperial China
and the establishment of a Republican China that public libraries became available. Little
has been written on the beginning of the modern public libraries in China and less still on
the genesis of youth services in China. My dissertation aims to trace the development of
youth services in public libraries in China from the founding of the Republic of China to
the eve of the Sino-Japanese War (1912-1937).

1.1 Early Development of Youth Services
The foundation of the Republic of China marked the end of over two thousand
years of Imperial China and the beginning of a promising modern China. The Republic of
China Era (1912-1949) witnessed the discovery of childhood, the flourishing of literature
in vernacular language, the blooming of modern schools as well as the promotion of
social education. Youth services in public libraries in China developed in this context.
At the second annual conference of the Library Association of China (LAC) in

1	  

1933, a resolution was passed, stipulating that every city and county should build
independent children’s libraries and that every library should have children’s reading
rooms (LAC 1933, 54-55). The LAC based its resolution on the principle that children
should be provided with entertaining books to read in their spare time, and children’s
libraries were needed to provide these books and educate children (LAC 1933, 54). A few
decades earlier, children were not so welcome in China’s public libraries. For example,
the Hunan Provincial Library, one of the first public libraries, restricted access to readers
who were at least 12 years of age (Hunan 1982, 152-58). By allowing access and making
room for young readers, public children’s libraries in China evolved tremendously in less
than three decades.
In 1909, CAI Wensen, a productive educator and scholar in the Republic Era,
wrote the essay, “Ways to Establish Children’s Libraries” in the Educational Review.
Cai’s was the first work to discuss, in Chinese, the subject of children’s libraries in
China. Cai argued that Western countries had children’s libraries in every city, and it was
necessary for China to build children’s libraries too (Cai 1909, 49-50). He introduced
some children’s libraries in Japan and discussed how to establish, organize and operate a
children’s library (Cai 1909, 49-50). Though there were no children’s libraries at that
time in China, the paper prepared public opinion for their arrival.
In 1914, the first children’s reading room was founded in the Capital Popular
Library shortly after the library opened (Zheng 1990, 9-12). The library’s collection of
children’s books included textbooks, fairy tales, picture books, novels as well as
magazines; and the titles of these children’s books were written and displayed in the
hallways (Zhuang 1914, 18-20). According to ZHUANG Yu, a prominent educator of the

2	  

era’s diary, on average, there were around thirty readers visiting the library every day,
most of whom were children (Zhuang 1914, 18-20). Later on, Jilin, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and
other provinces also opened children’s reading rooms in the public libraries. In 1917, the
first independent children’s library was established in Tianjin by the Tianjin Social
Education Bureau (Zheng 1990, 9-12). The library provided free services to children
from 8 years old to 12 years old regardless of gender (Lin 1982, 382-84). In addition to
children’s literature books, the library had a collection of various toys that the
administrators would display during open hours (Lin 1982, 382-84). There were also
storytelling, exhibits and other kinds of programs that took place in the library
periodically (Lin 1982, 382-84). In 1931, the Hangzhou Municipal Children’s Library
was established with the goal of connecting children with reading – it stipulated in its
library regulations that the aim of the library was to “increase reading interest, enhance
reading opportunity, guide to read, introduce reading materials and provide reference
materials” (Hangzhou 1931, 23). By 1934, there were 93 independent children’s libraries
in China (Chiu 1935, 16). In 1936, according to surveys conducted by the Zhejiang
Public Library, of all the 34 provincial libraries then, 19 mentioned specifically that they
had at least one separate children’s reading room, with a capacity that varied from 12 to
120 seats (Yan 1983, 63-100). The quantity of juvenile materials varied from 115 titles
and 350 volumes in the Jilin Public Library to 571 titles and 2,923 volumes in the Anhui
Public Library (Yan 1983, 63-100).
Despite the scattered evidence of the existence of library services to youth in
modern public libraries, much work needs to be done to investigate the genesis of youth
services in China.

1.2 Research Questions
The work on the history of the modern Chinese libraries is largely concerned with
the development of library services in public libraries in China since 1949. Little has
been written on the beginning of the modern public libraries in China and less still on the
genesis of youth services in China. A minimal amount of specific research exists that
traces the development of youth services librarianship in modern public libraries in
China. Of the available scholarship, most focuses on the modern public library movement
with youth services librarianship given only minimal consideration. My research will be
the first endeavor to systematically study the genesis of children’s libraries and youth
services in China.
This work tries to answer the following questions:
1) What were specific elements and contributions in the development of
youth services in China from 1912-1937?
In her study of the development of youth services in American public libraries
between the years 1875 and 1906, Fannette Thomas argued that the genesis of youth
services reflected the influence of a multiplicity of factors: “1 the advent of the separate
juvenile book collection; 2 the appearance of the separate children’s room; 3 the
contributions of pioneer librarians; 4 the development of techniques of reader’s services;
5 the mechanism for interagency cooperation” (Thomas 1982). This framework serves as
a useful starting point for examining the development of children’s libraries in China.
Besides the above elements, did other factors contribute to the progress of youth services
in China? What were specific elements and contributions in the development of youth
services in China from 1912-1937?

4	  

2) In what ways did American and other international ideas about librarianship
impact this development?
It is generally acknowledged that Japanese and Western librarianship (especially
American librarianship) greatly impacted the development of the modern library in
China. Research on the impact of Japanese and Western librarianship on Chinese
librarianship in modern times is widely available. What is unknown, however, is
Japanese and Western librarianship’s influence on Chinese youth librarianship. To what
degree does the development of youth services librarianship in modern Chinese public
libraries reflect Japanese and Western influences? While American librarianship had a
considerable and powerful influence on modern Chinese librarianship by providing a
model, helping to train librarians and introducing library science and technology, an
initial examination of primary resources revealed that Japanese librarianship’s influences
ostensibly preceded those of American librarianship. This research reveals the impacts of
American, Japanese and other international youth librarianship on the development of
youth services in China.
3) To what extent did the Republic Era's investment in children and similar
social and cultural changes impact library services to youth?
In the U.S., large social and cultural forces influenced the development of public
library services to children from 1876 to 1900 (McDowell 2007). What’s the situation in
China? The foundation of the Republic of China marked the end of over two thousand
years of Imperial China and the beginning of a promising modern China. The Republic
Era (1912-1949) witnessed the discovery of childhood, the flourishing of literature in
vernacular language, the blooming of modern schools as well as the promotion of social

5	  

education. But there is a whole history that we don’t know. We don’t know the
relationship between the Republic Era’s investment in children and the development of
children’s libraries in China; we don’t know the connection between the Republic Era’s
social and cultural progress and its impacts on library services to youth. To what extent
did the investment in social and cultural changes influence the library services to youth in
China? What did the early development of youth services librarianship in China imply
about the place of children—socially and culturally—in China?

1.3 Methodology and Sources
The principal approach to this study involves a historical research method. I
utilized both primary and secondary materials written in English and Chinese. In
particular, I examined published materials, including early periodicals, historical
documents, and reports. In addition, I examined the archives of the American Library
Association to provide materials relevant to the study. The visits to four libraries in China
produced internal materials not published. I also conducted additional document analysis
and archival work to investigate the history of youth services in Chinese public libraries
from 1912 to 1937.

1.3.1 Published Sources
The three major library journals in the Republic Era—Zhonghua Tu Shu Guan Xie
Hui Hui Bao (Bulletin of the Library Association of China) (1925-1948), Tu Shu Guan
Xue Ji Kan (Library Science Quarterly) (1926-1937), and Wenhua Tu Shu Guan Xue

6	  

Zhuan Ke Xue Xiao Ji Kan (Boone Library School Quarterly) (1927-1937) serve as the
starting point for my research.
The Bulletin of the Library Association of China was a bimonthly journal
published by the Library Association of China from June 1925 to May 1948. The Bulletin
existed for 24 years and produced 21 volumes and 102 issues. Its content included
scholarly writing on topics ranging from library laws and library surveys to library news,
book reviews and members information. It is the “encyclopedia” of Chinese libraries and
librarianship during the Republic Era. With its rich information on national library
surveys, scholarship on library science, library news and publication news, it is regarded
as the must-have historical resource for researchers in Chinese library science.
Library Science Quarterly was a research oriented journal also published by the
Library Association of China from March 1926 to June 1937 (volumes 1-11). It was
“devoted to the study and promotion of theory and practice of library work” (Liu 1935).
By introducing the western library science and assimilating the indigenous Chinese
culture, this journal documented the development of modern library and library science in
China.
The Boone Library School Quarterly was a bilingual (Chinese section and
English section) journal published by the Boone Library School from 1929 to 1937
(volumes 1-9). As a periodical supported and published by a library school, the Boone
Library School Quarterly focused on the theoretical discussion of library science,
research of domestic and international library and librarianship development, as well as
practical issues of cataloging, reference and circulation.
By examining the contents of these three major library journals from the Republic

7	  

Era, an understanding of the general development of library services in China and youth
services in specific was achieved. However, these three major periodicals were published
after 1925, and there was no library journal before that time. To account for the historical
gap, I examined the Jiao Yu Za Zhi (Educational Review) as a supplement. The
Educational Review was the most prominent journal on education in the Republic Era.
Published by the Commercial Press from 1909 to 1948, it had a large collection of
articles on library science. The first Chinese scholarly paper on the children’s library was
also published in this periodical in 1909.
Two compilation works in Chinese provided access to historical documents and
materials not easily found elsewhere. Zhongguo Gu Dai Cang Shu Yu Jin Dai Tu Shu
Guan Shi Liao (The Historical Resources of Ancient Collection and the Modern Library
of China) collected and reprinted 255 historical documents, such as imperial edicts,
government memorandum, and statistics on Chinese library development from around
500 B.C. to 1919. Min Guo Shi Qi Tu Shu Guan Xue Bao Kan Zi Liao Fen Lei Hui Bian:
Er Tong Tu Shu Guan Juan (The Republic of China Era Library Science Periodical
Materials Compilations: Children’s Library) collected and reprinted 356 documents and
periodicals on Chinese children’s library development from 1909 to 1949. These two
sources provided valuable information on the modern development of Chinese libraries
and children’s libraries, in particular.

1.3.2 Archival Sources
The archive of the American Library Association provided resources for

8	  

understanding American influences on the development of Chinese librarianship. The
China Projects File (2 boxes) includes materials on the Books for China Project (19381940), war damage to Chinese libraries and related topics. The Subject File has one box
of correspondence and information on grants for Books for the Kids of China project.
The Library Vertical Files has one box on China-Libraries and A. E. Bostwick, which
includes materials on Chinese libraries and Dr. Bostwick’s visit to China, 1923-1953.
The author also attempted to retrieve archives of the Library Association of China
(1925-1949). The Library Association of the Republic of China (Taiwan) founded in
1953 and the new Library Society of China founded in 1979 are the two descendants of
the Library Association of China. However, representatives of both organizations
confirmed to the author that they didn’t hold any official archives of the Library
Association of China.

1.3.3 Library Visits
To understand the development of the children’s reading room at public libraries,
independent children’s libraries as well as youth services provided during the early
twentieth century, the author visited four Chinese public libraries. The four libraries
include: 1) The National Library of China: the predecessor of which is the Capital
Library founded in 1909, since then, the National Library has functioned as the role
model for other public libraries; 2) The Hubei Provincial Library: the Hubei Provincial
Library was established in 1904 and is one of the first public libraries in China; 3) The
Capital Library of China: one of the predecessors of the Capital Library of China is the
Capital Popular Library, where one of the first children’s reading rooms in China was

9	  

founded in 1914; 4) The Shanghai Children’s Library: established in 1941, the Shanghai
Children’s Library was one of the largest children’s libraries in the Republic Era.1 All of
the four libraries are still in existence today.
The visit to the National Library of China yielded the manuscript of WANG
Bainian’s Zhongguo Er Tong Tu Shu Guan Shi Ye Fa Da Shi (History of Children’s
Library in China), the single unpublished work written during the Republic Era on the
history of Chinese children’s libraries. Visits to the Hubei Province Library and Capital
Library of China garnered internal documents related to each library’s historical
development. The Shanghai Children’s Library was not particularly helpful for this
project. Although it housed the largest collection of children’s literature published in the
Republic Era, the request to examine its resources was denied.

1.4 Significance of the Study
Scholarship on the history of the modern Chinese libraries is largely concerned
with the development of youth services in public libraries in China since 1949. There is a
noticeable lack of literature that addresses the beginning of the modern public libraries in
China or the genesis of youth services in China. A minimal amount of specific research
exists that traces the development of youth services librarianship in modern public
libraries in China. This doctoral dissertation is the first work on the genesis of children’s
libraries in China and endeavors to provide a compelling discovery and analysis of the
growth and the development of youth services in China from 1912 to 1937.

Although the founding of the Shanghai Children’s Library in 1941 falls outside the date range from 1912
to 1937, the library contained a large collection of Chinese children’s literature published in the 1920s and
1930s. Therefore, the author included the library among her library visits.

10	  

This research chronicles the development of children’s libraries in China from
1912-1937, develops a model of internal and external factors that contributed to the
progress of youth services in China, and provides a theoretical framework for further
study on the history of Chinese youth services. By situating the genesis of youth services
in public libraries within the context of general, social, cultural, and educational changes
in the Republic Era, this research addresses how the growth of children’s libraries was
affected by educational, social, and cultural conditions in the Republic Era and
anticipates the development of youth services under the current conditions in China.
Through analyzing the impact of American librarianship on the development of youth
services librarianship in China, this research also contributes to the study of the
relationship between American librarianship and Chinese librarianship as well as to the
history of youth services librarianship in the United States.

1.5 Definition of Terms
Library: The term library refers to the modern library that provides collections to
patrons for reference or borrowing purposes. The term “Tu Shu Guan” (library) was not
introduced to China until the beginning of the twentieth century. It is different from the
term “Cang Shu Lou” (book storing house), which refers to the old libraries that
emphasized the preservation of literary treasure instead of information distribution.
Public library: Public libraries are a system of libraries that are supported by the
government and provide services to the general public. Public libraries may include
national libraries, provincial libraries, city libraries, county libraries and district libraries,
etc. A public library is not necessarily a free public library.

11	  

Children: In Chinese, the term children (er tong/shao nian er tong/shao
er) is often used as an inclusive term for children and young adults, ages 0 to 18. In my
dissertation, I’m going to follow this practice and propose to use the term children to
loosely refer to children and young adults, ages 0 to 18.
Children’s library: Children’s library refers to both independent libraries for
children and children’s departments in public libraries.2 From the start, the coexistence of
children’s departments in public libraries and independent libraries for children has been
a unique character of library services to youth in China.
Youth services: Youth services refers to library services to children and young
adults in public library settings. In this dissertation, youth services, library services to
youth, and library services to children will be used interchangeably.
The Republic Era: The Republic of China Era (Min guo shi qi) is the period
from 1912 to 1949. I use the shortened form, “the Republic Era” to refer to the Republic
of China Era.

1.6 Chapter Overviews
Chapter 1 introduced the early development of youth services in China during the
Republic Era. It raised three research questions related to its development, discussed the

Some scholars and librarians in the Republic Era used the term “children’s library” to broadly refer to
libraries that provided youth services in both public and school settings. It is inevitable for the author to
include some examples of school libraries in the dissertation. However, the major focus remains on the
youth services in public library settings.

12	  

Chapter 2 reviews the historical background of the genesis of Chinese children’s
libraries. It considers the cultural movement and modern educational reform, the
development of modern public libraries, the discovery of children and growth of child
welfare, and the flourishing of children’s literature in the Republic Era. This chapter
analyzes such factors as social, cultural, and educational background of the genesis of
Chinese youth services librarianship.
Chapter 3 considers how the advent and progress of a multiplicity of factors
shaped the genesis of children’s libraries in China from 1912 to 1937. It includes the
advocacy of the library association and the support of favorable library policy, the
provision of separate children’s rooms, the attention to children’s reading and children’s
literature, the advent of separate children’s literature collections, the progress of youth
services programs and the contributions of pioneer librarians. These elements are
analyzed as major factors that contributed to the development of youth services in public
libraries in the Republic Era.
Chapter 4 analyzes four representative children’s libraries to illustrate the
development of the children’s reading room at public libraries and school libraries,
independent children’s libraries, as well as youth services that were provided during the
early twentieth century.
Chapter 5 presents the research findings by chronicling the development of
children’s libraries in China from 1912-1937 and identifying the major elements, external
and internal factors that contributed and influenced this development. This chapter also
summarizes the contributions as well as the limitations of this study. The dissertation is

13	  

concluded with suggestions for future research with the intention of encouraging further
studies on the history of Chinese youth services librarianship.

Chapter 2: Background
The Chinese youth services librarianship emerged in an environment of expansion
amid modern schools, extending the services of modern public libraries, a fuller
understanding of childhood and the advent of indigenous children’s literature. This
chapter canvasses scholarship on the Republic Era’s cultural and educational reform, the
historical progress of Chinese public libraries and librarianship, the development of
modern Chinese children’s literature, and the history of Chinese childhood. It analyzes
these factors as social, cultural, and educational backgrounds of the genesis of Chinese
youth services librarianship.

2.1 Revolution, Cultural Movement and Educational Reform
China experienced never-ending revolutions and reforms during the first half of
the twentieth century. Indeed, “if there is one word to describe China since 1911, it is
revolution” (Schurmann and Schell 1967, xiii). The Revolution of 1911 overthrew the
Qing Dynasty, China’s last imperial dynasty, and established the Republic of China in
1912. During the initial years of the Republic Era, regional warlords fought for
government, and the Republic of China was ruled by a series of military regimes. It was
not until 1927 that the Nationalist Government at Nanking unified the country. During
the years 1928 to 1937, China’s economy, culture and education progressed under the
Nanking Government. On account of the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) and the Civil
War (1945-1949), progress in those areas was thwarted.
Under the political upheavals, years of struggle with foreign domination and

15	  

traditional culture culminated in the May Fourth Movement. On May 4, 1919, students in
Beijing rallied against the pro-Japanese government’s peace negotiation, which ceded the
province of Shandong to Japan. This demonstration led to more struggles and rallies and
lasted until the final surrender of the government (Hu 1967, 52-62). The May Fourth
Movement was the convergence of a revolution in culture and anti-foreign nationalism
(Schurmann and Schell 1967, 50). It simulated a cultural movement directed at the
rejection of Confucian tradition and the absorption of Western culture. The May Fourth
period (1915-1921) takes its name from the movement. It is a high point of China’s
culture revolution and a creative period for many prestigious modern writers that created
great literary works.
A significant part of the May Fourth Movement involves literature movement. In
1917, avant-garde intellectuals like HU Shi launched a campaign to reject classical
language and publish magazines, newspapers and books in vernacular language. This
effort is known as the Chinese Literary Renaissance or the New Culture Movement
(Schurmann and Schell 1967, 51). By 1920, vernacular language assumed the name of
“National Language of China” (Hu 1967, 52-62). By 1922, the Ministry of Education
required that all of the textbooks for first and second graders in primary schools be
rewritten in the “national language” (Hu 1967, 52-62). Within a few years, the living
language of the people replaced the classical language, and the literary revolution brought
“a new language, a new literature, a new outlook on life and society, and a new
scholarship” (Hu 1967, 52-62).
Educational reform is a key aspect associated with the cultural movement. Prior to

16	  

the advent of the modern education system in China, the Sishu (old-style private school)
and civil service examination formed the main parts of the old Chinese educational
system. When children of 7 or 8 years of age entered Sishu, Confucian classics – San Zi
Jing (Three Character Classic), Qian Zi Wen (Thousand Character Classic) and Bai Jia
Xing (Hundred Family Surnames) – written in classical Chinese were the first texts to be
memorized by students. These primers served as textbooks for formative education as
well as moral education. After completing primers, children entered the study of the Four
Books and the Five Classics3 and other classic literature intended to prepare students for
imperial examination. The imperial examination was a kind of civil service examination
to select officers for the imperial. The examination took the form of essay writing, and
students were expected to write literary compositions within a set amount of time. To a
large extent, the rigid requirements for the compositions and examination tested students’
knowledge of the Four Books and Five Classics, which shaped the curricula of the old
education system and the students’ education as a result. It was difficult to trace any
study of science in the old education system’s curricula, which would help to “develop
the thinking faculties, such as reason or invention” (Monroe 1911, 635). This education
system was limited by China’s insularity until its people came into contact with other
countries and cultures. However, after the Treaty of Nanking opened five Chinese ports
to foreigners in 1842, which marked the beginning of a “century of humiliation,” the
traditional education system could no longer support modern China’s need for science,
democracy, and power.
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
3The Four Books and Five Classics are Confucian Classics in China. The Four Books include the following:
Da Xue (Great Learning), Zhong Yong (Doctrine of the Mean), Lun Yu (Analects), and Meng Zi (Mencius).
The Five Classics include Shi Jing (Classic of Poetry), Shang Shu (Book of Documents), Li Ji (Book of
Rites), Yi Jing (I Ching), and Chun Qiu (Spring and Autumn Annals).	  	  	  	  

17	  

In an effort to maintain order, the Qing government attempted to implement a
series of reforms since the late nineteenth century. In 1898, the Emperor issued an edict
that read, “Our scholars are now without solid and practical education; our artisans are
without scientific instructors; when compared with other countries we soon see how weak
we are. …Changes must be made to accord with the necessities of the times…we must
establish elementary and high schools, college and universities, in accordance with those
of foreign countries” (Monroe 1911, 635). This edict and a series of edicts that followed,
which were issued by the Emperor and the Empress, resulted in the implementation of
educational reforms across the country. In 1903, a detailed plan for the first modern
educational system in China was sanctioned by the imperial government and served as a
guideline for educational reforms throughout the country (Kuo 1915, 78). According to
the plan, the modern national educational system would comprise a hierarchy of
kindergarten, lower primary school, higher primary school, middle school, higher school,
university, and school of research (Kuo 1915, 79). Additionally, it would include normal
school, industrial school, and special schools (Kuo 1915, 79).
In 1905, the court abolished the traditional civil service examination, which
finalized the shift from traditional education to modern education in China (Kuo 1915,
86). In the same year, the Ministry of Education was formed to further the cause of the
Qing government’s educational reform. In the following years, modern schools of
different types were established and more diverse courses, such as Chinese classics,
mathematics, history and geography, natural science, physical education were offered in
these schools (Kuo 1915, chap. 5). Until the fall of the Qing government, the number of
modern schools increased from 4,222 in 1905 to 52,343 in 1910; moreover, the number

18	  

of students in those schools increased from 1,274 in 1903 to 1,625,534 in 1910 (Kuo
1915, 108). The Qing government’s educational reforms promoted modern education as
an asset available to the general public. This concept caused a series of institutional
changes, and laid the foundation for modern educational reform in the Republic Era.
Between the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912 and the unification of
the nation in 1927 by Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist Government at Nanking, a large
portion of China was in fragmentary control of local political parties and warlords. China
was in constant turmoil as the result of the conflicts between these parties. Meanwhile,
additional locations in China became open to foreign nations. Consequently, the Republic
China needed to design reforms for its social, political, and educational systems in order
to maintain stability from within and secure safety from without its borders.
Modern educational reform launched in the Republic Era was aimed to promote
the democratization, scientific, internationalization, and localization of education (Xie
2014, 115-19). Many prominent educators of the time believed that “China’s illiterate
millions must be educated, if democracy is to prove a blessing to herself and to mankind”
(Doo 1935, 129). In 1912, the Ministry of Education reorganized and subdivided into
three bureaus: the General Education Bureau, the Professional Education Bureau, and the
Social Education Bureau (Tu 1996, 107). Republican China’s educational reform policies
emphasized social education and aimed at cultivating democracy and disseminating
knowledge through social education institutions, including libraries, museums, and
popular education centers. The central Social Education Bureau and local authorities
were responsible for advancing the development of these social-educational institutions.

19	  

In addition to the development of a more coherent school system with primary,
secondary, middle schools, and universities, the Republic’s central, provincial, and local
governments actively promoted popular (mass) education and institutions for its society
(Chiu 1935, 1-18). The modern educational reform of the Republic Era brought literacy
to a greater part of the population, stimulated the general public’s demand for modern
libraries, and facilitated the establishment of modern public libraries.
Modern educational reforms included the transformation of traditional education
methods. Old (“dead”) teaching methods were abandoned, and modern educators and
schools sought new (“live”) teaching methods. John Dewey’s two-year visit to China
(1919–1921) introduced his pragmatic educational philosophies to Chinese educators and
teachers, resulting in the transformation of Chinese school education. Child-initiative
teaching methods were adopted by most primary and middle schools, child-centered
curriculum was developed, and new textbooks written in vernacular language were
published (Wang 1942; Hoyt 2006; Xie 2014). Such new education concepts emphasized
students’ initiative, self-reliance, and independence. It encouraged them to use books to
assist with self-learning (Hu 1926; Wang 1942; Xie 2014). Therefore, children’s libraries,
complete with a variety of reading materials, emerged as an indispensable part of the new
education system. School libraries of various sizes were established to assist with school
education. Some school libraries, such as the Library of the First Primary School of
Beijing Normal University, and the Library of the Laboratory School of National Central
University, were prominent and served as role models for other school libraries.
However, the inadequate budgets of most schools limited the development of school

20	  

libraries; thus, public children’s libraries with expansive and rich collections became the
ideal place for children’s voluntary reading and self-learning practices.

2.2 Public Library Development
In reviewing the historical development of libraries in China, four distinct periods
can be identified: the ancient period before 1840, the transitional period from Imperial
China to Republican China (1840-1911), the Republic of China period (1912-1948), and
the People’s Republic of China period (1949-) (Proett 1974).4 YAN Wenyu, the
university librarian of Peking University Library in the 1930s, regarded the years from
1905 to 1911 to be the genesis of the modern public libraries in China, and the years from
1912 to 1937 as the growth era of library development (Yan 1983). CHIU Kaiming,
librarian of the Chinese-Japanese library of Harvard University, used the same timeline.
But he further divided the Chinese modern library movement into three periods: 19051916 was the beginning of modern public libraries; 1917-1926 was the second period of
the development of public libraries; 1927-1935 was the development of public libraries
under the Nanking government (Chiu 1935, 1-18). This way of using social and political
divisions to mark the library development period was widely adopted by scholars
domestic and abroad.

2.2.1 Ancient Period (Before 1840)
There were four different kinds of libraries in imperial China prior to the

The Opium War of 1840 marked the beginning of the Modern Period of China.

21	  

establishment of modern public libraries: imperial libraries, imperial academy or state
college libraries, private family libraries, and monastery libraries. The imperial libraries
in each dynasty were established primarily to preserve the nation’s literature and
archives; and they were intended exclusively for the royal family, high-ranking officials
and scholars (Kuo 1926; Chiu 1935). The imperial academy and state college libraries in
different provinces were open to scholars and students only (Kuo 1926; Chiu 1935).
Private libraries also had a long history in China; they were built to meet the specific
needs of private book collections and were seldom open to the public (Kuo 1926; Chiu
1935). Besides those libraries, monastery libraries were maintained for a classics
repository purpose (Kuo 1926; Chiu 1935). Therefore, during the imperial years, libraries
were only available to the royal family, the scholarly elite, and the wealthy; there were no
public libraries “nor were any asked for or required” (Proett 1974, 6).

2.2.2 From Imperial China to Republican China (1840-1911)
At the dawn of the modern period, a growing number of intellectuals began to
advocate for modern education and advise the Qing government to establish public
libraries. Forced by the public opinion, the late Qing government initiated a public library
movement and encouraged provincial governments and local gentry to establish public
libraries (Chiu and Kwei 1926; Cheng 1991). The Hubei Provincial Library, founded by
ZHANG Zhidong in Wuchang, Hubei, and the Hunan Provincial Library, founded by
WEI Zhaowen in Changsha, Hunan, were among the first public libraries established in
China in 1904 (Cheng 1991, 374). In 1910, the Qing government issued the first Chinese
library legislation “The Capital Library and Provincial Library’s General Regulation”,

22	  

which prescribed that “the capital city and each provincial capital should establish a
public library first, and then each county, town and district should set up libraries
consecutively” (Xuebu 1910, 15-18). Therefore, the Capital Library was opened to the
public on August 27, 1912 and followed by the grand openings of 32 public libraries
within a few years (MOE 1982, 252-56). Though these early public libraries were ill
housed and inadequately supported (Proett 1974, chap. 1), and were essentially public
libraries “in name and form” (Cheng 1991, 375), it was the first step in the development
of public libraries.

2.2.3 The Republic of China Period (1912-1948)
After the establishment of the Republic of China, modern libraries of all kinds and
sizes began to emerge. According to Chiu, there were seven different types of libraries in
China in the Republic Era: national libraries; provincial libraries; county and city public
libraries; popular libraries, reading rooms and people’s educational centers; children’s
and primary school libraries; school and college libraries; society and government bureau
libraries (Chiu 1935, 1-18). In Yan’s work on Chinese library development from late
Qing to the Sino-Japanese War, he added township, public and private libraries as well as
special libraries to Chiu’s categories (Yan 1983, chap. 4). Based on Chiu’s categories, LI
Xibi and ZHANG Jiaohua collected primary sources on these libraries and published the
commonly cited book, Zhongguo Gu Dai Cang Shu Yu Jin Dai Tu Shu Guan Shi Liao
(The Historical Resources of Ancient Collection and the Modern Library of China), on
the history of libraries in modern China (Li and Zhang 1982). There were dozens of
published library statistics during the Republic Era, which included information on

23	  

provincial and city public libraries, popular libraries and school libraries (Yan 1983,
chap. 4). According to the first library survey conducted by the Library Association of
China in 1925, there were a total of 502 libraries in China: 259 public libraries accounted
for more than fifty percent (Xie 2005, 348). Based on the various library surveys
conducted from 1916 to 1936, Yan estimated that, until the eve of the Sino-Japanese war,
the total number of libraries in China was somewhere between 2,500 and 3,000 (Yan
1983, 111).
CHENG Huanwen, dean of the Sun Yat-sen University Libraries and professor of
the School of Information Management of Sun Yat-sen University, believed that the early
years of the public library movement, which included the foundations of the first public
libraries, the establishments of library management, the widespread spirit of the public
library, and the advocacy of European, American and Japanese public libraries, laid a
solid foundation for the later development of modern libraries and librarianship in China
(Cheng 1991, 372-87). Yan summarized the characteristics of modern library
development in China by citing five trends: the purpose of library collection had shifted
from storage to usage; libraries had shifted from the privileges of a few to the common
wealth of the general public; the method of managing the library had shifted from simple
to complex; the library work had shifted from repetition to profession and came with the
library science; and the connections among libraries had shifted from random to
systematical (Yan 1983, chap. 4).
The progress of the modern public library movement in China received great
stimulus. KUO Pingwen, an influential Chinese educator, identified three main events
that had influenced the development of public libraries in China. These include modern

24	  

education, the Chinese literary renaissance, and the achievement of publishing houses
(Kuo 1926, 189-94). The modern education movement encouraged the spread of
education among the general public; the Chinese literary renaissance popularized the
colloquial language and made it the medium of literary expression; publishing houses,
such as the Commercial Press had published 14,523 books until August 1925 (Kuo 1926,
189-94). Chiu also listed the Literary Renaissance in 1917 and the Mass Education
Movement in 1920 as the great stimulus of the public library movement, but he added the
May Fourth Movement in 1919 as the third stimulus and argued that these three great
social movements were responsible for the sudden and large growth of popular books and
magazines written in colloquial language (Chiu 1926, 195).
There is another factor that influenced the development of public libraries in
China: examples set by the Western world. In the eve of the twentieth century, along with
the Western learning came the trend of advocating for the modern librarianship of the
West and Japan. Cheng concluded that the librarianship of Japan, Europe and America
was introduced indiscriminately to China at the beginning because each Chinese
intellectual had his own view of foreign librarianship based on his various connections
with foreign libraries and librarianship (Cheng 1991, 372-87). Marianne Bastid, a French
sinologist, focused mainly on the importance of Japanese influence on educational reform
in China in the early twentieth century. Supported by such evidence as the complete
translations of Japanese regulations and works, officials visiting Japanese educational
institutions, an increasing number of students studying in Japan and a large number of
Japanese teachers employed in China, she argued that China was attempting to emulate
the Meji Restoration’s achievements in Japan but failed (Bastid 1988).

25	  

By the 1920s, American librarianship began to be the primary type of
librarianship introduced to China (Cheng 1991, 373; Lin 1998, 5). Cheng summarized in
three points the impact of American librarianship on Chinese librarianship in modern
times. First, American librarianship provided the model for the establishment of modern
Chinese public libraries. Second, the United States helped trained the first group of
modern Chinese librarians. Third, the introduction of American library science and
technology pushed the development of modern Chinese librarianship (Cheng 1991, 37287). LIAO Jing, associate professor of Library Service at the University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign, also acknowledged the American influence on the rise of the modern
library system in China, especially the contributions made by Mary Elizabeth Wood
(1861-1931). She demonstrated Wood’s important position in China’s library history and
analyzed the leadership role Wood and her American-trained Chinese students played in
building China’s first library school and establishing public libraries in major Chinese
cities (Liao 2009, 20-32). Based on the documents of the International Relations
Committee of ALA, located in the ALA archives, TSAY Ming-Yueh, a professor of
library and information science from Taiwan, analyzed the ALA’s influence on the
development of modern Chinese librarianship from 1924 to 1949. Through various
programs such as establishing fellowships for Chinese librarians, sending American
library advisors such as Dr. Arthur E. Bostwick to China, and creating projects for the
encouragement of public libraries and the ALA China Programme, Tsay argued that ALA
introduced new techniques of library service to China. It also shared the American library
ideas with China, such as “the public right to access information, intellectual freedom of

26	  

the public, and libraries as social institutions that provide public self-education” (Tsay
1998, 275-88).

2.3 Chinese Childhood
The traditional attitudes toward children might be traced back as far as
prehistoric China (Kinney 1995; Farquhar 1999). Anne Behnke Kinney, a professor of
Chinese with a focus on the history of childhood in China from University of Virginia,
showed that the early documentations of childhood in China began during the Han
dynasty (206 B.C.– A.D. 220) (Kinney 1995, 2). The thinkers of the Han dynasty were
the first to discuss childhood in philosophical discourse, educational theory and historical
writing (Kinney 1995, 17). Kinney attributed the Han dynasty’s interest in the child to
the “establishment of Confucianism as the state creed with its emphasis on educating
youth” (Kinney 1995, 2). She also suggested that Han educators used the Xiao Jing
(Classic of Filial Piety) as a text to prepare children for the moral transformation and the
filial duties they would later assume as adults. Mary Isabella Bryson, a British missionary
in China in the late nineteenth century, confirmed by her own observation that until the
late Imperial era, filial piety was still the most important duty instilled into children’s
minds, as the proverb says, “of the hundred virtues the chief is filial piety” (Bryson 1885,
51). Kinney concluded that the early Confucians considered childhood not as a valuable
stage of human development but a transformational period necessary for the culmination
of a virtuous adult (Kinney 1995, 17-56).
Nevertheless, many children, especially girls in China never had a chance to

27	  

fulfill the filial obligation. In pre-modern China, children were treated quite differently
based on gender. Male children were preferred because they would contribute labor and
wealth to the family, while female children would leave the family after marriage and
contribute nothing (Waltner 1995, 193-218). Male children were regarded as living
representatives, connecting ancestors with descendant. However, baby girls were
characterized as “dangerous to the stability of the struggling family” (Waltner 1995, 210).
In ancient China, families would “practice female infanticide in an attempt to reserve
limited resources for rearing male children” (Kinney 1995, 7). Ann Waltner, a history
professor with a focus on Chinese history from the University of Minnesota,
demonstrated that there was evidence documenting the custom of killing unwanted
female girls at birth throughout recorded pre-modern Chinese history (Waltner 1995,
193-218).
After the Opium War, China broke down the wall of exclusiveness and opened
the gate to foreigners. In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, a group
of western missionaries and anthropologists went to China: they were interested in
Chinese children’s lives, and they became the first observers of childhood in a Chinese
setting. As Issac Taylor Headland, an American missionary to China noted: “Nothing in
China is more common than babies. Nothing more helpless. Nothing more troublesome.
Nothing more attractive. Nothing more interesting” (Headland 1901, 33). Bryson
documented the lives of children in Chinese homes and narrated the different lives of
Chinese boys and girls in the1880s (Bryson 1885). While boys were sent to school to
learn the “extremely dry and uninteresting” lessons, girls were kept at home, taught to
assist with weaving and embroidering work, entrusted with the care of baby or other kind

28	  

of work (Bryson 1885, 42). Headland focused on the Chinese methods of exercise and
amusement for children and argued that though the majority of children in China were
very poor, they had a very good time with the ample provisions of nursery rhymes,
games, toys, shows and stories (Headland 1901). After consulting Chinese nursery lore,
Headland argued that Chinese people love their children because “there is no language in
the world which contains children’s songs expressive of more keen tender affection than
some of those sung to children in China” (Headland 1901, 16). Terhune further
supplemented the observation with scenes such as at the barber’s, playing music
instruments and flying kites (Terhune 1910). Though Chinese boys and girls were treated
as little men and women, wearing the same kind of clothes as those of their grandparents
and made familiar with all the rules of behavior, Headland believed that they were little
people as were the children of other countries (Headland 1901, 46).
Prevailing notions of childhood changed drastically during the late Qing and early
Republic Era. Many modern intellectuals, such as HU Shi, the prominent enlightened
scholar in twentieth-century China, advocated for the “the symbolic meaning of
childhood and the treatment of children as a measurement of accomplishments of
civilization” (Hsiung 2005, XIV). Catherine Pease noted that while children were always
a symbol of renewal in Chinese culture, modern culture particularly emphasized the
“freshness of the child’s perceptions and the relative ease with which the child moves
across traditional social barriers” (Pease 1995, 280). Mary Ann Farquhar, an Australian
scholar in Chinese culture, further explained that in the past, children represented the
“continuity of family and traditional value”(Farquhar 1998, 1). In the late Qing and early
Republic Era of radical social change, reformers reinterpreted this ideology and

29	  

positioned children as a representation of “national, not family continuity and
evolutionary change, not unchanging tradition” (Farquhar 1998, 1). Pease paralleled
individual’s transition from childhood to adulthood in this era with China’s progress
toward modern nationhood (Pease 1995, 279). Jon L. Saari, the author of the frequently
cited work: Legacies of Childhood: Growing Up Chinese in a Time of Crisis, also chose
to focus on this time of crisis (1890-1920) and analyzed the lives of children who later
became the generation of educated youth in the Republic Era (Saari 1990). He believed
that Chinese views of childhood in the late Qing period were based on two assumptions:
the first was that “the world was a threatening place to born into” because of human’s
incomplete understanding of the outer environment; the second was that “childhood was
the setting for an either/or struggle to become a moral being” (Saari 1990, 7). Therefore,
he argued that this image of children as “weak, vulnerable, and dependent beings” (Saari
1990, 7) governed Chinese people to closely protect and strictly instruct children to make
sure of their survival and become worthy adults (Saari, 1990).
In ancient China, the Sishu (old-style private school) served as the place for
children’s moral education and self-cultivation and was reinforced by Confucianism and
Neo-Confucianism. It typically consisted of one class of boys only, and was taught by
one instructor (Borthwick 1983, 17). Confucian classics, such as Three Character
Classic, Four Books and Five Classics written in classical Chinese were the main texts
for students of all ages to memorize and learn. Sally Borthwick, an Australian scholar on
Chinese affairs, noted that the Sishu not only “gave the child adult texts but demanded of
him adult standards of behavior fitting the stereotype of the ‘educated man’” (Borthwick

30	  

1983, 33). Chinese parents sent their sons to school to help them outgrow childish
behavior.
Toward the end of the nineteenth century, this method of education was
challenged. Educational reformers in early twentieth century China believed that modern
schools would bring power and prosperity to the country and inspire the nation to
modernize. A plan was launched for modern educational reform with the aim of mass
mobilization. “New” subjects such as science, mathematics, physical education, and
vocational education were introduced in the new curriculum (Borthwick 1983). The
traditional examination system was abolished, the coherent school system was
established, and the number of primary schools was increased. According to the survey
conducted by the Ministry of Education in 1929, a total of 7,937,558 students enrolled in
263, 432 kindergarten and primary schools, which accounted for around 17% of school
age children (6-12 years) at that time. Further, the number of students enrolled in schools
more than tripled from 2,793,633 in the beginning of the Republic of China in 1912
(MOE 1933, 999-1003). The foundations for modern education were established within a
single decade in the early twentieth century (Bastid, 1988).
The period between the advent of the New Culture Movement in 1917 and the
Sino-Japanese War of 1937 witnessed an “unprecedented explosion of discourse for and
about children, childhood and child development” (Jones 2001, 103). Andrew Jones, a
professor in Chinese at the University of California, Berkeley, illustrated that this
explosion of discourse involved new academic disciplines, such as child psychology and
educational psychology (Jones 2011, 99-125). It also encouraged a circulation of
knowledge among the general public about the nature of children and childhood.

31	  

Children were not treated as incomplete little people but complete individuals with inner
and outer lives (Zhou 1920, 1-7). Jones also argued that Republican China discovered
childhood as an “epistemological, ideological, institutional and even commercial”
category (Jones 2011, 11). A new culture industry began to depend on the children’s
market as a major source of revenue (Jones 2011, 112).
Society’s recognition of children and childhood reached a pinnacle as China
celebrated its first Children’s Day in 1932. In response to a proposal made by the China
Salesian Society to designate a national children’s day, the Nationalist Government
designated April 4 as Children’s Day in 1931, and it issued the Children’s Day
Commemoration Outline (Wang 1942, 36-37). The goal for celebrating Children Day
was to “encourage children’s interests, inspire children’s love for nation, community and
family, and arose society’s attention to children’s well-being” (MOE 1931, 37-39). Since
1932, schools, libraries, museums, and other social education institutions held special
activities, such as ceremonies, exhibits, contests, and funfairs, to celebrate Children’s
Day.
Additional organizations and agencies held programs and promotions to recognize
children. On 4 April 1933, for instance, in Shanghai city alone, 35 hospitals provided free
vaccinations for children; 28 parks were open to children at no cost; 26 bookstores
offered discounts on book sales (Sun 2012, 19). These activities received massive
coverage by nationwide influential newspapers, such as Shen Bao (Shanghai News) and
Zhong Yang Ri Bao (Central Daily News), as well as local media, such as Wuhan Ri Bao
(Wuhan Daily News) (Sun 2012, 16-17). The first Children’s Day was celebrated in over
twenty provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, and Tianjin. In

32	  

subsequent years, celebrations of the occasion expanded from major cities to include
most cities in the country, including some rural areas (Huang 2008, 44). To develop
Children’s Day and further advance the causes of child welfare, the Nationalist
Government designated 1 August 1935 to 31 July 1936 as National Children’s Year.
Throughout the year, the central government led a series of nationwide movements to
promote children’s well-being: drafting laws and regulations for children’s welfare,
initiating various children’s programs, promoting compulsory education, and improving
conditions for children’s care.
Designating Children’s Day and Children’s Year marked the culmination of
society’s attention to children and their well-being, which demonstrated the improvement
of children’s status in the Republic Era. Moreover, the celebration of Children’s Day and
Children’s Year in turn promoted the society’s recognition of children and childhood.

2.4 Chinese Children’s Literature
Peter Hunt, a British scholar and professor emeritus in children’s literature,
perceived that the history of children’s books throughout the world had similar patterns:
from no books published specifically for children, to a few books intended for broadly
educational purposes or text books for school curriculum, to stories written specially for
children, to the emergence of children’s books of various interests (Hunt 2005, 5). He
quoted Sheila Ray’s observation that developing countries in the twentieth century went
through all the stages of developing children’s books in a relatively short time – thirty or
forty years – compared to European countries’ five hundred years (Hunt 2005, 5). That
applied to developing China. Confucius said, “Young people are not human; they are

33	  

merely in the process of becoming human.” Historically, there were no literary works
published specifically for children in China; there were only a few Confucian classis
texts, mentioned earlier, such as Three Character Classic or Instruction for Girls
intended for educational purposes and good courtesy (Chen 2006, 13-19). Literary works
for children – that is, non-didactic texts – were not widely published in China until the
“discovery of children” and the New Culture Movement in the Republic Era.
Before the advent of modern children’s literature in China, fables and folk stories
were the most popular and accessible form of literature for children. CHEN Minjie, in her
doctoral dissertation for the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the
University of Illinois, noted that Chinese children shared a great deal of popular reading
materials with adults (Chen 2011, 17-18). The most prominent example is the story,
Journey to the West. This fantasy tale about the Monkey King’s adventurous pilgrimage
to the West, in its various adaptations and performances (comic books, oral storytelling,
operas, TV series, etc.) was the favorite among Chinese children (Chen 2011, 17-18).
Mary Hayes Davis, in her retelling of Chinese fables and folk stories in English, argued
that Chinese literature “did possess the fable” and that these stories were “familiar in the
home and school life of the children in China” (Davis 1908, 6). LI Lifang, a professor in
Chinese literature, believed that collecting fairy tales suitable for children was one of the
foundations of Chinese children’s literature and several scholars listed specific standards
for collecting literature from traditional fairy tales for children (Li 2007).
Translation of Western children’s literature was another source for children’s
reading before the born of native Chinese works. LI Li, a professor of translation studies,
studied children’s literature in translation from 1898 to 1919 and identified 120 titles

34	  

translated into Chinese during this era (Li 2005, 103-06). Following the translation of
Around the World in Eighty Days in 1900, works of science fictions from French, Japan,
Holland and the United States were translated into Chinese and welcomed (Li 2005, 10306). European and Middle-Eastern classics like the Grimm’s Fairy Tales, Alice in
Wonderland, Arabian Nights: Tales from One Thousand and One Nights and stories by
Hans Christian Andersen were translated and widely available in 29 magazines (Li 2005,
103-04). In 1909, the first and most popular children’s literature series in China – Tong
Hua (Fairy Tales) – appeared in Shanghai. ZHU Ziqiang, a professor of Chinese
children’s literature, remarked that translated works of Western children’s literature was
considered more qualified for the Tong Hua series than adaptations from Chinese
historical stories on account of the latter’s lack of originality and representativeness (Zhu
2000, 144). Of all the 77 fairly tales edited by SUN Yuxiu from 1909 to 1919, 48 were
translated from Western works while only 29 were adapted from Chinese historical
stories (Li 2005, 104). It is commonly acknowledged that the translation of foreign
children’s literature provided Chinese writers with models and played a significant role in
developing native Chinese children’s literature (Li 2007; Chen 2006; Jones 2011).
In 1920, ZHOU Zuoren (1885-1967), a writer, translator and advocate of literary
reform in the May Fourth Movement, was the first person to foster the phrase “children’s
literature” (Er Tong de Wen Xue) in China (Zhou 1920, 1-7). In his remarkable speech,
he argued that children should be provided with literature that would meet and cultivate
their age-appropriate interests (Zhou 1920, 1-7). He divided children’s literature into
several categories according to each stage of childhood development and recommended
that young children (from 3 to 10 years old) were given rhymes, fairy tales, and stories

35	  

about the natural world; adolescents were given poems, historical legends, realistic
stories and drama (Zhou 1920, 1-7).
LU Xun (1881-1936), one of the major writers of the Republic Era and the
“commander of China’s cultural revolution” (Mao 1940, 21-39), was also a spokesperson
for children and children’s literature. In A Madman’s Diary, the first modern short story
in China, LU Xun ended with the famous cry “save the children” (Farquhar 1998, 2).
Along with LU Xun, many great writers of the Republic Era such as MAO Dun, YE
Shengtao, ZHANG Tianyi, BING Xin and FENG Zikai were actively involved in writing
a distinctly modern children’s literature (Jones 2011, 104). The emergence of modern
children’s literature, written in an easily accessible vernacular language, is part of the
May Fourth literature that was motivated by the New Culture Movement of 1917.
Mary Ann Farquhar, an Australian expert in Chinese culture, contributed the most
systematic study of native children’s literature in China by tracing the evolution of this
genre from the early twentieth century through the 1970s (Farquhar 1999). In her study,
which was recognized with an award from the International Children’s Literature
Association, Farquhar identified the distinguishing characteristics of Chinese children’s
literature, which included the emergence of the child from the confines of Confucian
education, the flourishing of children’s literature in the May Fourth period, and the
production of children’s literature as connected with serious political concerns (Farquhar
1999). LI Lifang discussed the localization process of children’s literature and argued
that modern children’s literature as an emergent force played a vital role in promoting
early children’s libraries in China (Li 2007, chap. 8).
The advent of modern children’s literature in the Republic Era also fostered

36	  

growth for publishing businesses. The Shanghai Commercial Press launched the most
popular Chinese children’s magazine, Er Tong Shi Jie (Children’s World), in 1922 (Chen
2011, 21). Inaugurated in the same year, Xiao Peng You (Little Friend) received similar
popularity. Each boasted biweekly circulations of over 20,000 copies (Jones 2011, 120).
In the 1930s, there were over a dozen periodicals for children, including Xiao Xue Sheng
(Little Student), Xian Dai Er Tong (Modern Child), and Er Tong Za Zhi (Children’s
Magazine) (Jin 1998, 17-19).
In addition to mass-market magazines, LI Ya, a professor of publishing,
introduced the publication of children’s books in the Republic Era and used the
Commercial Press as an example (Li 2007, 9-12). From 1897 to 1949, the Commercial
Press published 88 children’s books and 14 children’s book series (Li 2007, 10).5 Li
found such niche-marketed books to be complimentary to textbooks, and these ultimately
cultivated children’s reading interests.
The Republic Era witnessed an increased literacy level among the general public,
the advent of modern school systems, the development of modern public libraries, the
growth of child welfare, and the flourishing of children’s literature. In this review of the
historical background of the genesis of Chinese children’s libraries, it becomes apparent
that a fuller understanding of youth services librarianship in this period is needed. The
following chapter addresses this need.

Children’s book series were large in size and rich in content and they were mainly targeted at children’s
libraries; one of the famous book series “Fairy Tales” had 102 titles published till 1916.

37	  

Chapter 3: Youth Services in the Republic Era
A multiplicity of factors influenced the genesis of children’s libraries in China.
With child-centered service idea in mind, there emerged library polices that strongly
advocated the necessity of library services to children, separate children’s rooms that
admitted children as readers, indigenous children’s literature and separate children’s
collection that provided materials for children’s reading, youth programs and services
that connected children with texts, as well as pioneering librarians that promoted these
services. This chapter examines the elements that contributed to the development of
youth services in public libraries in the Republic Era.

3.1 Library Policy
The first library legislation appeared in China in 1910. Subsequently, a series of
library legislations, regulations, and resolutions were issued by the central government,
the Ministry of Education, local governments, and national-professional associations.
These library polices served as guidelines for the development of modern Chinese
librarianship and significantly promoted the establishment of public libraries and
children’s libraries in China.

3.1.1 General Library Regulations
As part of the Qing Dynasty’s last effort at reform, Xue Bu (the Ministry of
Education, Science, and Culture of the Qing government) proposed an eight-year
development plan to prepare for constitutionalism, starting in 1909. In the “Memoranda

38	  

of Annual Preparations to the Throne,” Xue Bu scheduled to promulgate library rules in
1909, establish a capital library in 1909, and establish provincial libraries in each
province by 1910 (Xuebu 1909, 1-5). In 1910, Xue Bu submitted a twenty-articles draft
on library regulations to the Throne, as planned. Hence, the Qing court issued the first
Chinese library legislation, “The Capital Library and Provincial Library’s General
Regulation,” in 1910. The first article of the regulation specified that “the purpose of
libraries are to preserve the national treasure, to educate the general public, to facilitate
research for scholars, to offer references for students and to provide reading resources for
all.” The second article articulated that “The capital city and each provincial capital
should establish a public library first, and then each county, town and district should set
up libraries consecutively.” Other articles in the legislation included guidelines and
suggestions for library location and building, library budget and operation, library
organizational structure and personnel, as well as procedures for acquisition,
preservation, and circulation (Xuebu 1910, 15-18).
This regulation also defined the legal status of “library”. Afterward, the term
“library” permanently replaced the term “book repository” (Fan 2004, 174). After the
decree of this legislation, provincial, county and city governments across the country
began to establish public libraries, which indicated the rise of modern public libraries in
China. One national library and 15 provincial libraries were established in China by the
end of 1911 (MOE 1982, 252-56). As the first library legislation in China, this regulation
was regarded as a milestone for the development of the modern Chinese public library. It
signified the advancement of Chinese librarianship from mere advocacy to establishment
by national laws; from the financial support of non-government affiliated intellectuals to

39	  

the financial backing of the government and from mimicking European, Japanese and
American library systems to working out its own rules. It is indeed a great leap forward
for Chinese librarianship and reflects the greater demands that come with academic and
cultural developments (Cheng 1991, 375). However, with the Qing dynasty’s fall in 1911,
this first legislation’s government endorsement ceased.
Upon establishing the Republic of China in 1912, the Ministry of Education
replaced the Xue Bu as the government agency to supervise the development of libraries.
The public libraries established by the Qing government were confined to the capital city
and provincial capital city levels only. Book preservation remained the primary goal of
those libraries, and the readers served were mainly educated elites. Relics of old book
repositories remained. Those public libraries were only “in name and form, in practice
and content, the old feudal library retained its hold” (Cheng 1991, 375). A different kind
of public library emerged to provide popular materials for the purposes of the general
reading public in China. Popular libraries could be easily established in all cities,
counties, schools and factories. Such libraries collected only popular materials and were
easily accessible to the general public.
To guide the development of these kinds of public libraries, the Ministry of
Education promoted two library regulations in 1915: “The Ministry of Education Popular
Library Regulation” and “The Ministry of Education Library Regulation.” “The Ministry
of Education Popular Library Regulation” stipulated that a popular library should “collect
all kinds of popular materials for the public’s reading” and should be “open to the public
free of charge” (MOE 1982, 184-85). This regulation also included guidelines for the
library’s budget, personnel, and administration (MOE 1982, 184-85). Consequently,

40	  

popular libraries around the country developed at an unprecedented speed. A survey
revealed that there were 237 popular libraries in 21 provinces by 1916 (MOE 1982, 25657). “The Ministry of Education Library Regulation” confirmed the preservation role of
provincial and city libraries but stipulated that these public libraries should also collect all
kinds of materials for reading purposes (MOE 1982, 185-86). The regulation further
standardized the operation of public libraries by requiring public libraries to submit to the
Ministry of Education information about the library’s name, location, budget, collection,
floor plan, rules, and open hours and to send annual reports (MOE 1982, 185-86). By
1916, the number of provincial and city level libraries increased to 23 (MOE 1982, 25256). Moreover, these library regulations provided guidelines for local governments to
develop social educational institutions that resulted in the establishment of public
libraries in large quantities. The Popular Library Regulation, in particular, promoted the
development of public libraries in rural areas and extended library services to lesseducated populations, including children.

3.1.2 Special Resolutions on Youth Services
Special resolutions on youth services derived primarily from the national
conference of education and library associations. Prior to the advent of a national library
professional association, the Library Education Division of the Chinese National
Association for the Advancement of Education (CNAAE) was the sole national forum for
librarians to participate, communicate, and cooperate. Since its first meeting in 1922, the
Library Education Division served as the major entity for advocating the course of youth
librarianship.

41	  

At the first annual conference in 1922 of the CNAAE, three resolutions for
children’s libraries were proposed at the divisional meeting of the Library Education
Division (CNAAE 1922, 556-61). DAI Zhiqian,6 the chair of the Division, proposed that
popular libraries should include children’s departments, unfortunately, no one seconded
Dai’s proposal, and the proposal failed without discussion (Wang 1942, 53-55). Despite
its failure to pass, this proposal initiated the groundwork for future discussions on the
need of children’s libraries. HONG Youfeng,7 the co-chair of the Division, proposed that
adjacent primary schools should unite to organize mobile children’s libraries in schools.
Eventually, the resolution was passed, given reasons for why reading habits should be
developed at an early age and that children’s library would be an ideal place for children
to spend their spare time. The resolution suggested that school libraries in the vicinity
should unite as a group and purchase appropriate reading materials for children. In theory,
the shared library collections would be divided into several parts and be placed in each
school by rotation (Wang 1942, 53-55). This resolution to build mobile libraries
promoted coordination and cooperation among school libraries. If school libraries
adopted the resolution, children would benefit by having access to a greater number of
books. SHEN Zurong,8 a faculty member of Boone Library School, proposed that all
primary and secondary schools should be equipped with school libraries; the proposal
was passed (Wang 1942, 53-55). This resolution strengthened the connection between
school and library, emphasizing a library’s role in assisting school education. By
promoting children’s library as “a place with appropriate reading materials for children to
develop their reading habits” (Wang 1942, 55), these resolutions argued for the

importance of library services available to children and served as starting points for the
Library Education Division’s lasting advocacy of youth services and youth librarianship.
At the second annual conference in 1923 of the CNAAE, two resolutions relevant
to youth services were proposed in the divisional meeting of the Library Education
Division. The first resolution proposed that the regional education association was
responsible for selecting and promoting children’s literature. The second resolution asked
for the library’s education division to compile a children’s book bibliography for primary
and secondary school libraries’ reference (Wang 1942, 55-56). These two resolutions
were both about the selection and suggestion of children’s books, implying that
guidelines were needed for selecting children’s books and standards to be applied to
children’s literature.
In 1924, no resolutions pertaining to children’s libraries were made at the third
annual conference of the CNAAE.
At the fourth annual conference in 1925 of the CNAAE, a resolution was passed
that demanded public libraries and popular libraries to add a children’s department. The
resolution was one of four passed in the Library Education Division’s meeting, which
was chaired by YUAN Tongli (Wang 1942, 56-57).9 This resolution is particularly
significant. First of all, by adding children’s departments and guiding their reading,
children’s libraries served an indispensable role in cultivating young readers and future
library patrons. It was believed that children’s libraries would improve the nation’s
literacy level and promote the development of libraries and librarianship. Further, school
libraries were already established in most primary schools by 1925, and children
welcomed these libraries so much that it was difficult to find vacancy during the library’s

open hours. However, funding for education and school libraries was incredibly limited
such that not all children could gain access. In rural areas, for example, not all schools
could afford to operate a school library; in urban areas, some school libraries were
equipped with only well-worn books for adults instead of children’s books. Therefore,
children’s departments in public libraries needed to lend their support and provide library
services for the benefit of an increased number of children. Moreover, for those children
who could not continue education after graduating from primary school (and thus have
access to its library), the absence of public libraries for children meant that there would
be no library services for such students at all. To solve this issue, a children’s library
became necessarily for under-privileged children to pursue self-education after formal
schooling.
In response, the Library Education Division passed this resolution and published
two solutions. First, public libraries and popular libraries should allocate a particular
room for the purpose of a “children’s department” and assign trained personnel to
supervise the department. Second, if necessary, the children’s department could establish
branches near a primary school or other convenient location (CNAAE 1925, 27-28). As
the first national policy on youth services in public libraries, this resolution argued for the
necessity and indispensability of a children’s library. It called for the establishment of
children’s departments and the creation of posts for children’s librarians at public
libraries. As the resolution was addressed and passed at a national education conference,
the major emphasis was on the education function of children’s libraries: to cultivate
future nationals. This resolution served as grounds rationalizing the necessity of
children’s libraries and, to some extent, promoted the development of children’s libraries.

44	  

The early years of children’s library policies were promoted under the
administration of the CNAAE. The Library Education Division’s resolutions boasted a
greater number of advocacy and promotion functions than enforcement functions. After
the founding of the Library Association of China in 1925, it became the primary
determinant on matters related to library regulation.
At the first annual conference of the LAC in 1929, over 100 library scholars and
librarians from across the country gathered at the University of Nanking to discuss ninety
proposals on various issues. These included the promotion of library services, library
administration, library education, library technique, and library building. As regards
children’s libraries, one issue was addressed at the conference. The proposal stated the
necessity for primary schools to establish children’s libraries. Four reasons, in particular,
were given to support the proposal: 1) libraries could cultivate children’s reading habits
at a early age; 2) libraries could aid education in the classrooms; 3) libraries could
promote children’s reading interests; 4) libraries could provide appropriate reading
materials for children (Wang 1942, 58-59). The reasons were well articulated and the
attending librarians acknowledged the importance of children’s libraries. The proposal
was passed as a resolution. The resolution further suggested that adjacent primary schools
could cooperate and jointly establish a children’s library if necessary (Wang 1942, 58-59).
The participant schools would share the library collection and related expenses. To
ensure the resolution’s implementation, the LAC asked the Ministry of Education to send
a memo to all provincial departments of education and to order the education departments
to check that all primary schools have library services for children (LAC 1929, 5-14).
Furthermore, the discussion of issues on children’s libraries at the nation’s library

45	  

association’s first annual conference demonstrated the Chinese library society’s attention
to children’s libraries and incited nationwide promotion, development and improvement
of youth services in subsequent years.
In 1933, at the second annual conference of the LAC, a resolution was passed to
build independent children’s libraries in every city and county and to establish children’s
reading rooms in every library (LAC 1933, 54-55). It was generally agreed that
recreational reading in children’s spare time could cultivate their reading interests and
maintain their reading skills. However, most libraries at that time were intended for
adults’ reading and research and were not appropriate for reading at the children’s level.
Therefore, a proposal on the establishment of independent children’s libraries and
children’s reading rooms was initiated. The proposal argued that the children’s
department should be separate from adults’ departments because special equipment and
guidance were needed for children’s reading (LAC 1933, 54-55). This resolution was
believed to be indispensable for supplementing school education, cultivating children’s
reading habits, and promoting compulsory education. As a result, the LAC published a
official letter demanding that each city and county establish independent children’s
libraries and stipulated that all libraries should be equipped with children’s departments
(LAC 1933, 54-55).
Local governments responded to this resolution in a timely manner and became
actively involved in promoting children’s libraries in their region. For example, in 1933,
the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education forwarded this resolution to the
province’s county and city governments as well as the provincial library to enforce its
implementation (Guangdong 1933, 85-86). In 1934, the Hebei Provincial Department of

46	  

Education forwarded this resolution to local governments and to libraries within the
province. Besides ordering all libraries to establish children’s reading rooms, the
education department emphasized that each primary school should allocate resources for
children’s libraries within its budget (Hong 1934, 34). In the same year, with the
intention of compensating for the limitations of school education (and to develop
children’s reading habits), the Henan Provincial Department of Education forwarded the
resolution to each county’s education bureau and mandated the establishment of
children’s libraries, including children’s reading rooms in existing libraries (Henan 1934,
3). This LAC’s resolution was the most influential library policy on children’s libraries to
that point. It created public awareness about the importance of children’s libraries and
significantly increased the total numbers of children’s libraries.
Another resolution pertaining to school libraries was also passed at the second
annual conference of the LAC. The resolution asked for the Ministry of Education to
issue an order requiring provincial, county, and city education bureaus to invite library
scholars as consultants on school library development (LAC 1933, 54-55). Based on the
fact that most school libraries were stocked with age-inappropriate collections, a lack of
proper management, and insufficient number of school librarians, the conference library
administration panel proposed to set up a school library consultant post (LAC 1933, 5455). The school library consultant would be a library expert that was capable of guiding
the library’s management, training the library staff or group of volunteers, and promoting
cooperation among school libraries (LAC 1933, 54-55). Therefore, the resolution
suggested that provincial departments of education, as well as city and county education
bureaus, hire a library scholar as a school library consultant to guide the work of all of the

47	  

school libraries within a given region (LAC 1933, 54-55). The school library consultant
would be expected to visit each school library and to provide oral as well as written
advice in a timely manner (LAC 1933, 54-55). Also, the consultant would be responsible
for organizing the school library’s seminar on a monthly or yearly basis, and to lecture on
library science, as well as assist school library staff with practical problems (LAC 1933,
54-55). This resolution became a solution to the problems of school libraries, such as
inappropriate collection building, unscientific library techniques, as well as chaotic
library management. It provided a practical way for school libraries to thrive under
limited budgets and contribute to school libraries’ flourishing in the 1930s.
In 1936, the third annual conference of the LAC was held. Three resolutions on
youth services were passed at this conference. The first resolution was a follow-up to the
previous year’s proposal to the Ministry of Education, which asked to enforce provinces,
cities, counties, and public primary schools without children’s libraries to establish one as
soon as possible (Wang 1942, 60-62). The second resolution proposed to establish a
children’s library advisory committee in the LAC (Wang 1942, 60-62). This resolution
indicated the library society’s dedication to advocate and support library services to
children. The third resolution was announced during the library technique session. It
proposed to draft a classification system for children’s books so that children’s libraries
across the country could use it as reference (Li 1936, 1-5). This resolution would promote
cooperation among children’s libraries, accelerate the development of children’s
collections, and anticipate the arrival of additional nationwide guidelines on library
services for children. Despite the goodwill and promise of these resolutions, the outbreak

48	  

of the Sino-Japanese war in 1937, and the unstable political and social situations in most
parts of China, made these resolutions impossible to implement.
Through media dissemination and responses by local governments and agencies,
the CNAAE and LAC’s resolutions received a high volume of public attention and
support. Although neither the CNAAE nor the LAC had power to enforce their
resolutions and these resolutions could not function as government regulations, they did
provide guidelines for local governments to develop children’s libraries and facilitated
the unprecedented development of youth services in the 1920s and 1930s.
The first library legislation decreed by the Qing court laid a solid foundation for
the development of public libraries in China. The promulgation of the 1915 Ministry of
Education’s library regulations indicated the advancement of modern Chinese
librarianship and further promoted the establishment of modern public libraries in large
quantities. Although the national government and the Ministry of Education failed to
issue policies regarding the development of youth services, the two national professional
associations – the Library Education Division of the Chinese National Association for the
Advancement of Education and the Library Association of China – published a series of
resolutions to advocate the importance of youth services and to promote the development
of children’s libraries in the Republic Era.

3.2 Reading Rooms and Facilities
A year after its founding, the capital popular library established a children’s
reading room in a rented, residential property in 1914 (Beijing 1994, 3). This was the first
children’s reading room in the capital city, Beijing. Later, Jilin, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and

49	  

other provinces also opened children’s reading rooms in their public libraries. In 1917,
the Tianjin Social Education Bureau established the first independent children’s library in
Tianjin (Zheng 1990, 10). By 1934, there were 93 independent children’s libraries in
China (Chiu 1935, 16). In 1936, according to surveys conducted by the Zhejiang Public
Library, of all the 34 provincial libraries, 19 mentioned specifically that they had at least
one separate children’s reading room, with a capacity that varied from 12 to 120 seats
(Yan 1983, 63-100).
To attract children to the library, a functional and friendly space would be crucial.
The welcoming environment of a beautifully designed children’s library would be
inviting and encourage children to return. CAI Wensen’s first request to build a
children’s library was in 1909. From that time through 1937, ideas and practices for
planning the children’s reading room and designing children’s library furniture and
equipment evolved greatly.

3.2.1 Library Building
In the early twentieth century, there were no specially designed children’s
libraries. Most children’s reading areas were comprised of a makeshift room or two that
were apportioned from rented residential properties. As CAI Wensen noted, children
could benefit from libraries no matter how small they were; therefore, there was no need
to construct a new building for library use (Cai 1909, 50). Children’s libraries could be
set in residential properties, public spaces, or school classrooms (Cai 1909, 50). In 1905,
Hubei Provincial Library, one of the first public libraries in China, bought a residential
property with 10 rooms and expanded it to a 2,401 square meter (around 25, 844 square

50	  

feet) library building with 20 rooms, and set up a children’s reading room in one of these
rooms (Yu 2007, 37). In 1914, the Capital Popular Library opened its children’s reading
room in a rented residential property. In some rural areas, a corner of a room holding
children’s books could be referred to as a children’s library. Children could read in
various places, including the woods, the meadow, and the valley (Lu 1935, 20).
As an increasing number of libraries constructed their own buildings (instead of
renting), discussions began as to how to plan a children’s library. Location was the first
aspect to consider when setting up a children’s library. A site with ample light and fresh
air that was surrounded by an expansive landscape and located in a tranquil neighborhood
would be an ideal place for building an independent children’s library (Wang 1936, 38).
For a children’s reading room or children’s department within a public library, “location”
referred to the designated children’s space. In general, the children’s room should be on
the first floor10 with ample sunlight and adequate space, and away from the interference
of the adult’s reading rooms (Xu 1936, 73). The suggestions on light, air and
environment were made from the perspective of children’s physical and psychological
development. An ample amount of light, especially sunlight was necessary for protecting
children’s vision while reading. Fresh air would be beneficial to their health, and an
appealing environment would encourage their reading interests. An example of such a
design is the Hubei Provincial Library that chose the foot of a mountain as its new site in
1936, building a library building with three floors. The children’s reading room was
located on the first floor (Yu 2007, 39).
Space was another primary concern when planning a children’s library. A small
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
10

Out of the consideration for children’s safety, Xu suggested that the children’s room should be on the first
floor so that they do not need to walk up and down stairs.

51	  

children’s library would be overcrowded during peak hours, thus making young readers
uncomfortable and preventing their interest in going to the library. WANG Bainian, a
pioneer youth services librarian, calculated that each reader should occupy 12 square feet
of space in a children’s library. Therefore, a library to seat 50 children should have a
space of 600 square feet (Wang 1936, 38). Compared to today’s standard
recommendation of 25 to 40 square feet per seat, and approximately 30 square feet per
seat on average, the space allocated for the children’s library in the Republic Era was
substantially smaller (Dahlgren 2009, 16). However, given the limited budget of most
libraries and the single use of library space at that time, the relatively small library space
managed to meet the goal of serving young readers.

3.2.2 Reading Tables and Chairs
At first no specially designed library furniture existed to accommodate young
readers. At public libraries, children were expected to use the same reading tables and
chairs as adults. In school libraries, children used the same desks and chairs as in their
classrooms. In response to research on children’s physical and mental development and
the innovative idea of a child-centered service, librarians acknowledged the relation
between appropriate library equipment and children’s healthy growth. Discussions about
the standards and arrangements for children’s library reading tables and chairs began in
the early 1920s and continued through the late 1930s.
In 1922, LIU Guojun, the leader of Chinese modern library movement, proposed
a standard on the height for a children’s reading table and reading chair based on the
physical development of children. His proposal included three different table and chair

52	  

sets, aimed for children aged 5-8 years, 8-10 years and 10-14 years, separately (Liu 1922,
1-7). ZENG Xianwen, a library scholar from Boone Library School, seconded Liu’s
standards and argued that children’s reading tables and chairs were not aimed to be
luxurious but aimed to fit. Reading tables and chairs were qualified as long as they were
appropriate for the children’s height and would not impede their development (Zeng
1929, 127-35). LU Jingshan was more practical than Liu in making suggestions, given
that most children’s libraries were on a limited budget. In his monograph on children’s
library, he suggested that regular school desks and chairs were fine for children to read
(Lu 1935, 26). Therefore, he only listed one kind of reading table and chair, which would
be appropriate for most children (Lu 1935, 26).
Moreover, Wang insisted that libraries should consult experts on children’s
libraries or ask for professional opinions from local library associations before
purchasing any furniture or equipment. He understood that the most important
consideration was the children’s physical and psychological development (Wang 1936,
44). Further, he separated children according to categories – high-graders (grade 5 and
grade 6) and low-graders (grade 3 and grade 4). As such, he suggested that reading tables
were built based on the physical difference between high-graders and low-graders; tables
for high-graders were higher and longer than tables for low-graders, and the same
principle applied to reading chairs (Wang 1936, 45). Given that most children went to the
library during one or two hours’ school breaks (their time in the library would not exceed
two hours), reading chairs could be stools without a back support, and the shape of the
reading chairs could vary. Round, square, and rectangle shapes were all acceptable
(Wang 1936, 46).

53	  

XU Jiabi, the librarian from National Beiping library, proposed that the design for
a children’s library should be based on children’s physical appearances as well as their
natural instincts: short, active, social, curious and responsive (Xu 1936, 71). He
suggested that the type of reading tables and chairs should suit the style of the library
building, the needs of children, and the size of the reading room (Xu 1936, 79). For
instance, round tables could conveniently set readers apart and were suitable for
accompanied reading; rectangular tables were better suited for writing and reference
purposes (Xu 1936, 79). Other shapes, such as square, elliptical, and triangular were all
suitable in certain situations. Indeed, foldable tables and chairs were acceptable in the
room for special occasions (Xu 1936, 79). Furthermore, children’s libraries might employ
different table shapes to avoid tedium. Typically, children were divided into three groups
based on age: group 1 included children aged 5-8 years; group 2 included children aged
8-12 years; and group 3 included children aged 12-16 years (Xu 1936, 80). Consequently,
children’s reading tables and desks could have three different heights. The children might
also be separated into two groups: group 1 included children aged 5-10 years; and group
2 included children aged 11-16 years (Xu 1936, 80). For this design, two sets of reading
tables and chairs would be sufficient. If the budget was severely limited, a single-sized
table would suffice (Xu 1936, 80).
In practice, the Library of the FPSBNU had taken the above principles into
consideration. Its library equipment purchases were based on children’s’ needs, school
environment, library budget as well as management situation (Wang 1937, 113). At the
library, reading tables were divided into two types: tables for high-grades and tables for
middle-graders; and so were the reading chairs. The reading tables for high-graders were

54	  

75 inches long, 36 inches wide and 26 inches high; the reading tables for middle-graders
were 74 inches long, 30 inches wide and 23 inches high; the reading chairs for highgraders were round and measured 16 inches high; the reading chairs for low-graders were
rectangular and measured 14 inches high (Wang 1937, 114). Although students in the
same class might be the same age, their height could vary significantly. By including two
sets of reading tables and chairs in the library, taller students in the middle grades could
use higher tables and chairs designed for high-graders.
The author summarizes the children’s library standards for reading tables and
chairs that were proposed by different scholars and adopted by libraries, as is shown in
table 3.1. To review, the general reading table’s height at that time was between 21
inches for younger children and 30 inches for older children. The length was between 60
inches to 75 inches, and the width was either 30 inches or 36 inches, mostly rectangular
shaped. Reading chairs’ height varied from 12 inches for younger readers to 18 inches for
older readers, and their shape could be round, rectangle, or square.

On the subject of tables and chairs for reading, discussions developed beyond
their size. To name a few topics, the surface of a reading table should be smooth and
clear (Wang 1936, 45). The edge and corner of the reading table should be slightly
rounded to prevent accidents, and reading chairs should be heavy enough to prevent
children from overturning them (Xu 1936, 79). In actual settings, reading tables should be
arranged far enough (3 feet to 5 feet apart) to accommodate through traffic (Xu 1936, 79;
Wang 1936, 48).
Providing a safe space for children to read was the priority among the limited
services offered by libraries in the 1920s and 1930s. Library space was mainly organized
to encourage reading, and library equipment was designed to facilitate reading.
Therefore, issues pertaining to tables and chairs designed for reading attracted significant
attention from library scholars and librarians. Attitudes towards children and childhood
changed, and recognition for the status of children occurred in the 1930s. Suggestions,
standards and practices for children’s reading tables and chairs at that time were based on
a library’s daily administration, budget, and took into consideration the physical
56	  

appearance and social character of children. Reading tables and chairs were designed to
fit the needs of different age groups and were arranged to accommodate reading in the
library.

3.2.3 Bookshelves
At first, most children’s libraries adopted closed-stack systems; therefore, there
was not a need for customized children’s bookshelves. Later, as open-shelf systems
became more popular among children’s libraries, special bookshelves were made for
young readers. The simplest kind was an open, four-layer bookshelf, as in Lu’s blueprint
(Figure 3.1). This bookshelf was three-feet wide; it could be single depth (10 inches) or
double depth (18 inches), 40 inches high, and each shelf was 10 inches high (Lu 1935,
22). To shelve more books, the four-layer bookshelf might add three layers to become a
seven-layer bookshelf. The seven-layer bookshelf was still three-feet wide and 40 inches
high; however, each shelf was only 5 inches high so that books could only be stacked, as
shown in Figure 3.2 (Lu 1935, 22). The seven-layer bookshelf could be divided into a 42cell bookshelf, making it easy for children to fetch books and for librarians to reshelve
them, as Figure 3.3 demonstrates (Lu 1935, 23).
Figure 3.1: An open 4-layer bookshelf blueprint

57	  

Figure 3.2: An open 7-layer bookshelf blueprint

Figure 3.3: An open bookcase blueprint

A bookshelf could be made 5 feet high, 3 feet wide, 10 inches deep. It might be
divided into 5 layers, each layer was 10 inches high (Wang 1936, 44). The dimensions of
most children’s books during the Republic Era were duodecimo (width x height: 5 x 7 3/8
inches). Therefore, each shelf could hold 180 books and the 5-layer bookshelf could hold
900 books total (Wang 1936, 44). Each shelf should allocate one-fourth of its size to
“free space,” and for further collection expansion purposes. If the children’s library had a

58	  

collection of 1000 volumes, for example, four bookshelves of this kind were needed
(Wang 1936, 44). To shelve some large-sized children’s books, the 5-layer bookshelf
could be adjusted to a 3-layer or 4-layer bookshelf, and each shelf was 12 inches high
(Xu 1936, 78). The Library of the FPSBNU used an open-access system since it opened,
and the bookshelves were customized to accommodate children’s height. The
bookshelves were made from elm trees. Each 4-layer bookshelf was 5 feet high, 3 feet
wide, and 10 inches deep (Wang 1937, 113).
To summarize, the height of a bookshelf should be suited to the height of
children. The ideal height would enable children to view and fetch books on the top shelf.
Under these circumstances, most children’s bookshelves were between 3 ½ feet and 5 ½
feet. The width of the bookshelf was generally 3 feet. It could hold as many books as
possible on one shelf, while not exceeding the weight limit of the shelf. A more flexible
kind of bookshelf would have shelves with adjustable heights, which was highly
recommended (Wang 1936; Xu 1936). Bookshelves were usually placed along the walls
of libraries for reading convenience. For an open-access children’s library, the goal of
designing and setting-up children’s bookshelves was to be both practical and economical.

3.2.4 Book Displays
Some materials, such as new-arrivals and picture books, were placed in a book
display instead of on a bookshelf to encourage browsing. In children’s libraries, various
book exhibits were used to display and store library collections. Generally, there were
three kinds of book displays: vertical, horizontal and angled. The vertical display was a
regular bookshelf that shelved books vertically, which was easy for readers to fetch

59	  

books; the horizontal display shelved books horizontally to save space; and the angled
display could expose the full cover of children’s book to attract young readers (Wang
1936, 44). The optimal choice was the angled open shelf – the shelf was slightly angled
to the back for easier viewing – as shown in Figure 3.4 (Lu 1935, 25). The book display
was less than 5 feet high, 3 feet wide, and 14 inches deep with a 25° angle; each shelf
was 5 inches high (Lu 1935, 25). For example, the Library of the FPSBNU used display
similar to the one described here for the purpose of showing magazines. The magazine
display’s dimensions were 48"H x 36"W x 15"D with 8 shelves, and each shelf could
display 5 magazines (Wang 1937, 113-14). In practice, this kind of magazine display
made it easy for children to browse and fetch books. However, an 8-shelf book display
could result in too many children browsing at the same time. A 2-shelf book display with
fewer books might be more convenient for children to browse as well as for librarians to
manage (Li 1936, 6).
Figure 3.4: The blueprint of a book display

To be more economical, libraries could recycle an old blackboard to make a
display. A recycled book display could be made by adding three wooden panels to an old
blackboard and nailing the blackboard into a bench, see Figure 3.5 (Lu 1935, 26).

60	  

Figure 3.5: A display made from blackboard

In addition to showcasing books, magazines, and newspapers, a display could be
used to present other library collection materials. For instance, the Beijing Central Park
Reading Place specially made two wooden 5-level shelves to display and store toys, such
as blocks, construction sets, and dolls for their young readers (Zhong 1982, 277-81). The
shelves for toys were located at the east end of the reading room; however, a wooden
fence surrounded the shelves to prevent damage (Zhong 1982, 277-81).

3.2.5 Other Furniture and Equipment
Reading tables and chairs, bookshelves and book displays were regarded as basic
furniture to be found in a children’s reading room. Additionally, there was other furniture
and equipment that might be found in children’s libraries. For example, the Capital
Popular Library used wooden boards to catalogue children’s books and display them in
the hallway (Jingshi 1919, 33-37). The Library of the FPSBNU added a card catalog
cabinet, office desks, and office chairs to enhance the library furniture (Wang 1937, 11314). Other furniture and equipment recommended included the following: circulation
desks, bookcases for valuable books, old books and magazine bookcases, reference
bookshelves, file cabinets, mirrors, and sinks (Lu 1935; Wang 1936; Li 1936). Such

61	  

furniture and equipment were not necessary at that time but could make the children’s
library more comprehensive.

3.2.6 Decoration
Scholars generally agreed that a bright and welcoming children’s reading room
could cultivate children’s reading interests and foster aesthetic appreciation. Light was
the most important aspect of children’s reading room decoration. Considering the fact
that most children visited libraries during the day, natural sunlight would be suitable for a
children’s library. However, not all libraries in the Republic Era were built with enough
windows, and some libraries were located in areas with more rainfall and less sunlight.
To make up for insufficient sunlight and to brighten children’s reading rooms, ceilings
and walls were generally painted with white or nearly white colors. Posters were the most
common decoration element for a children’s reading room. The subjects depicted by
posters varied from famous quotes to pictures of sages, to natural scenery. Plants,
flowers, and miniature sculptures could also be found at some children’s libraries.
Beautiful, convenient, tidy and clean were the major design pursuits when decorating a
children’s library. As Liu concluded, children’s libraries should have “fresh air, bright
light and elegant decoration to both meet children’s need and intrigue aesthetic
perception” (Liu 1922, 1-7).

3.2.7 Arrangement
The question remains, how to arrange and display furniture and equipment to

62	  

make a children’s library inviting and functional? General components for functional
areas in children’s reading rooms during the Republic Era included the following: reading
area, reference area, and circulation area (Zeng 1929; Xu 1936). The reading area should
have the best light in the room and generally be located in the center of the reading room;
reading tables were set at least 3 feet apart from each other to make way for passage and
to prevent congestion. Bookshelves, bookcases, and book displays were usually located
along the walls surrounding the reading area. Reference and circulation desks were
located near the entrance for the convenience of management. Figure 3.6 is the floor plan
of a primary school library in 1935 (Lu 1935, 33). According to Lu, the shortcoming of
this layout was that reading tables and chairs were insufficient. Lu further suggested an
ideal floor plan for a children’s reading room, as shown in Figure 3.7 (Lu 1935, 34). In
this floor plan (of a square children’s reading room), a catalog cabinet was located to the
left of the entrance; the circulation desk was located facing the entrance; five reading
tables were set in the center of the room, and bookshelves were set along the wall.

63	  

Figure 3.7: Lu’s floor plan of a children’s reading room

Wang Bainian, the librarian of the FPSBNU, was highly experienced in
managing a children’s library and strongly advocated specialty-designs for children’s
libraries. Figure 3.8 shows the arrangement of a children’s reading room that could seat
60 children, which was recommended by Wang and demonstrated the ideal children’s
reading room in 1930s (Wang 1937, 47).

According to Wang’s floor plan, the reading room was a 728 square foot single
room (Wang 1937, 47- 48). It was 28 feet in length and 26 feet in width (Wang 1937, 4748). The card catalog cabinet was located near the entrance to facilitate young readers’
research. The staff’s desk was dual-functional as an office desk as well as a circulation
desk; thus, it was located near the entrance as well as to the card catalog cabinet. Nine
bookshelves were located at the east end of the room. Each bookshelf was 3 feet deep and
could hold a total of 500 children’s books (Wang 1937, 47- 48). All together, nine
bookshelves could hold 4,500 books, which was greater than the total number of
children’s literature published at that time. Another one or two customized bookshelves
were used to shelve children’s collected works. Popular materials, like daily newspaper
displays, new magazine displays, and new-arrival displays were all located near the
entrance to facilitate reading. Moreover, reading tables were located in the center of the
reading room for more sunlight and for the convenience of collecting books. Reading
tables for high-graders and middle-graders were located in separate rows, and each table
was three feet apart from the next (Wang 1937, 47- 48).

66	  

The above discussions on children’s library furniture, equipment, decorations,
and arrangements may be evident, to some extent, by the children’s reading room at the
First Municipal Library of Beiping, as shown in Figure 3.9 and 3.10 (Front 1936).

3.2.8 Conclusion
The development of children’s library space related to broader social, economic,
political, and cultural developments; it was also influenced by society’s beliefs (Black
and Rankin 2009, 23). During the Republic Era, children’s space in the 1910s was
allocated from adult space and did not involve elements that specifically addressed
children’s distinct needs. In the 1920s, library scholars and librarians introduced the idea
of providing a safe and inviting space for children’s reading and began to discuss the
issues of a children’s library – building, space, and equipment design. In the 1930s,
society’s attitude towards children and child welfare changed along with an increased
library budget and an increased number of children’s reading materials published. The
development of children’s library space reflected such changes as more libraries paid
attention to the allocation and design of children’s space as well as the employment of
specially-designed library equipment.
An ideal children’s library would include a spacious room, specially-designed
equipment, maintain a functional arrangement, delicate decoration, bright sunlight, fresh
air, and beautiful surroundings (Zeng 1929; Lu 1935; Wang 1936). The planning and
design of children’s libraries in the Republic Era took children’s needs, including their
physical and psychological development into full consideration. Library furniture and
equipment were designed from the viewpoint of children and were arranged for their
convenience. From idea to practice, from blueprint to implementation, children’s libraries
in the Republic Era strived to be functional, inviting, inspiring, and safe learning spaces.

3.3 Children’s Literature
Unlike the development of American children’s libraries in that children’s
literature and specialized children’s collection were the “first conditions for youth
services librarianship” (Jenkins 2000, 109), indigenous Chinese children’s literature
emerged after the advent of children’s reading rooms in China. As discussed before,
Confucian classic texts, fables, folk stories, and translations of Western children’s
literature were the major sources of children’s reading before the emergence of native
Chinese works. Additionally, several short-lived children’s magazines and newspapers
served as early reading material for children before the advent of indigenous Chinese
children’s literature.
The Xiao Hai Yue Bao (Child’s Paper), supported by the New York-based
Presbyterian church, and edited by missionary John Marshall Willoughby Farnham
(1829-1917), published its first issue in Shanghai in 1875 (Guo and Wu 2010, 100).
Known as the forerunner of Chinese children’s literature, this monthly magazine covered
a wide variety of content, such as poems, stories, and biographies of famous people,
science, and others (Wang 1942, 21-22). The illustrations in the magazine were
remarkable. The western printing technology employed by Mr. Farnham made these
illustrations fine and exquisite, welcoming to a large readership. The magazine set a
precedent for using illustrations in the Chinese magazine publishing industry (Wang 1942,
22). Nevertheless, the magazine was discontinued in 1915.
One of the earliest Chinese-operated children’s magazines, Qi Meng Hua Bao
(Enlightenment Pictorial), started publication in 1902 in Beijing (Jiang 1985, 191). This
magazine was edited by PENG Yizhong (1864-1921), the famous Qing Dynasty patriotic

69	  

journalist and the editor of a series of popular newspapers at that time (Wang 2010, 82).
The major purpose of this pictorial was to enlighten children; therefore, its columns
mainly included ethics, history, geography, arithmetic, science, education, nature, and
world news (Jiang 1985, 191-203). To attract children’s interest, the magazine adopted
vivid illustrations and vernacular language. The magazine was widespread and employed
fifty sales offices in over twenty Chinese cities (Peng 2000, 29). Unfortunately, the
magazine survived only 22 months and was discontinued because of the publisher’s lack
of resources (Wang 2010, 84-85).
In 1903, the first Chinese children’s newspaper, Tong Zi Shi Jie (Children’s
World), was published in Shanghai by the Ai Guo Xue She (Patriotic Society) (Jing 1998,
116-17).11 Aimed at enlightening children and disseminating civilization, this daily12
newspaper brought fresh news on revolution to children in a timely manner. It also
published articles on history, geography, and science (Jing 1998, 116-17). Due to its
revolutionary nature, after 32 issues, the newspaper was forced by the Qing Government
to stop publishing (Fu 2006, 4-5).

The Patriotic Society (Ai Guo Xue She) was formed by the dropouts of Nanyang Public School to fight
against autocracy and promote democracy and revolution. Many great scholars such as CAI Yuanpei,
ZHANG Taiyan served as its president and instructors.

The first 20 issues were published daily, the 21-30 issues were published bi-daily, and the last issues were
published every ten days.

Another early Chinese-operated children’s magazine, Er Tong Jiao Yu Hua
(Children’s Education Pictorial), was first published by the Commercial Press in 1908
(Liu 2010, 26). The monthly magazine mainly used colorful pictures to promote
children’s moral, intellectual and physical education. Its contents were divided into 22
topics, such as Chinese, history, arithmetic, nature, science, craft, health, music, fables,

71	  

and news (Liu 2010, 27). The pictorial’s targeted readers were preschoolers as well as
first and second graders. A book review by the Educational Review described it thusly,
“children with one or two year’s school education could read the magazine without
difficulty, even younger children who could not read could still understand the pictures
with some guidance” (Wang 1942, 23). This vivid pictorial was purchased in large
quantity by primary schools as well as libraries at that time.

The early Chinese children’s magazines and newspapers emerged in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth-centuries when traditional Chinese culture met Western
culture, and the cultural and educational circles started to “inspire the people and
enlighten the children.” Therefore, the early children’s reading materials were inevitable
influenced by the western missionary publication, contemporary revolutionary idea and

72	  

the traditional enlightenment education. They served different purposes, such as
spreading Christian doctrine, promoting revolution, or assisting school education.
Although these periodicals were created especially for young children, and adopted
illustrations and vernacular language to attract children’s interests, they were rigid and
lacked literary value. Nonetheless, these early magazines and newspapers provided
much-needed reading materials for children at that time.
In 1909, the first issue of the Tong Hua (Fairy Tales) series appeared in Shanghai.
Edited by SUN Yuxiu and published by the Commercial Press, it was acknowledged as
the precursor to extracurricular reading materials for Chinese children (NLC 2013). It
was read by thousands of children. Over 70 published volumes of Tong Hua, edited by
Sun, contained fairy tales adapted from western sources, such as Arabian Nights,
Grimm’s Fairy Tales, and Andersen’s Fairy Tales (Xie 2010, 49). It also included
Chinese traditional sources, such as Shi Ji (Records of the Historian), Kong Que Dong
Nan Fei (The Peacock Flies Southeast), and Mulan Ci (The Ballad of Mulan) (Xie 2010,
49). The Tong Hua series was targeted at children from seven to ten years old. It was
edited and adapted to suit their reading and comprehension levels. In the same period of
time, the Commercial Press published another popular series, Shao Nian Cong Shu
(Junior Series), which was about the biography of famous people. In about 30 volumes,
the series covered the biography of famous historical figures from abroad, such as
Christopher Columbus and Otto von Bismarck, as well as domestic celebrities, such as
WANG Yangming and ZHU Geliang (NLC 2013; Wang 1942, 27; Chen 1933, 77). The
targeted readership for the Shao Nian Cong Shu was children ten years and older.
However, the biography was written in literary Chinese and failed to attract children’s

73	  

interests. Simply put, the major sources for children’s reading materials during the first
two decades of the twentieth century were either translated and edited from western
children’s literature or adapted from Chinese traditional literature.
Indigenous modern children’s literature in China flourished after the May
Fourth Movement in 1919. More publishing houses, such as Zhonghua Book Company,
Beixin Book Company, and World Book Company began to edit and publish reading
materials for children. Some of the large publishing houses designed a new post for a
children’s literature editor. For instance, the Commercial Press trained three prestigious
editors for children’s literature: SUN Yuxiu, MAO Dun and ZHENG Zhenduo. They
were in charge of the editing work of some of the most popular children’s books and
periodicals published at that time, and they created their own works for children,
encouraging more authors to write for children (Fu 2006, 6; Li 2007, 10-11; Xie 2010,
49-50). These editors made a substantial contribution to the development of modern
Chinese children’s literature. Meanwhile, many prominent writers of the Republic Era,
such as LU Xun, YE Shengtao, ZHANG Tianyi, BING Xin and FENG Zikai became
actively involved in writing native Chinese children’s literature. In 1923, YE Shengtao
published a collection of fairy tales titled, Dao Cao Ren (The Scarecrow), and it is
credited as the first book of children’s literature that placed the image of the child in the
“actual context of contemporary Chinese society” (Farquhar 1998, 93-96). BING Xin’s Ji
Xiao Du Zhe (Letters to Young Readers) (1923-26) was another major publication in the
category of China’s modern children’s literature. Her fiction – “softly tuned to keynotes
of tenderness, love and nostalgia” – was regarded as the first work written specifically for
and about children’s life in China (Farquhar 1998, 115-16).

74	  

The flourishing of children’s literature in the 1920s and 1930s was reflected by
the introduction of native literature works created for children. It was also made evident
by an increase in the quantity and variety of books published for children. In addition to
novels, fairy tales and stories, other genres and types of children’s literature became
available, such as arts, crafts, poems, science, and information books. One of the first
children’s science book series, Chang Shi Tan Hua (On General Knowledge), introduced
new science and technology to children, such as the telescope, microscope, and steam
train (Xie 2010, 49-50). It did so in an appealing way in nine volumes (Xie 2010, 49-50).
Later, most publishing houses published various kinds of children’s book series,
often with numerous volumes. For instance, the Commercial Press published a 500volume Xiao Xue Sheng Wen Ku (Pupils Library) in 1933, and a 200-volume You Tong
Wen Ku (Younger Children Library) in 1934 (Wang 1942, 51). Xiao Xue Sheng Wen Ku
was for primary school students’ reading, and You Tong Wen Ku was intended for
preschoolers’ reading. These two series were consistent in style and complemented each
other. Together they provided an entire package of encyclopedic information for children
(Li 2007, 118; Wang 1942, 51). The Zhonghua Book Company published a 450-volume
Xiao Peng You Wen Ku (Little Friend Library) in 1935. The series covered contents for
children with entry, intermediate, or advanced reading levels (Wang 1942, 52).
Publishing book series in popular science reading, supplementary reading, and
encyclopedic reading met children’s needs for different reading materials and provided
sources for children’s libraries’ collections.
Children’s magazine and newspaper publications peaked in the 1930s, including

75	  

some of the most influential titles in the history of journalism. The Commercial Press
launched two children’s magazines, Er Tong Shi Jie (Children’s World), and Er Tong
Hua Bao (Children’s Pictorial) in 1922 (Wang 1942, 23-24). Er Tong Shi Jie was the
first Chinese periodical aimed at publishing children’s literature. Prominent writers for
children, such as YE Shengtao, SHEN Yanbing, and ZHENG Zhenduo all published in
the magazine (Fu 2006, 6). In the same year, the Zhonghua Book Company published
Xiao Peng You (Little Friend) to compete with Er Tong Shi Jie. Both Er Tong Shi Jie and
Xiao Peng You were the most popular children’s magazines in the Republic Era. Each
boasted biweekly circulations of over 20,000 copies (Jones 2011, 120). Until 1937, over a
dozen periodicals, such as Xiao Peng You Hua Bao (Little Friend Pictorial), Zhong Xue
Sheng (Middle School Students), and Er Tong Ri Bao (Children’s Daily News) were
available for young readers. The children’s periodicals published after the May Fourth
Movement were different from the previous ones insofar as they adopted vernacular
language, catered to children’s psychological development, emphasized the appreciation
and literariness of the content, and survived for a substantial period of time (Fu 2006, 2-7;
NLC 2013).
According to the statistics compiled by CHEN Duxing, a scholar and editor of the
Republic Era, until September 1933, there were over 4,000 volumes of children’s books
published in China. Literature accounted for the largest part of the publications, with over
50 percent. Other categories included social science, science, technology, and arts; these
accounted for less than 50 percent, as shown in Table 3.2 (Chen 1933, 77-79).

Children’s libraries in China emerged in the 1910s and before the advent of
indigenous Chinese children’s literature. Chinese youth services librarianship did not
fully develop, however, until the late 1920s and 1930s. Also, at this time, the publication
of children’s reading materials peaked. Elizabeth Nesbitt, a pioneer and leader of library
service to youth, suggested it might not be an accident that the late nineteenth-century
and early twentieth-century’s development of library services for children constituted the

77	  

“golden age in the writing of children’s literature” in America (Nesbitt 1954, 119). In
China, the flourishing of Chinese children’s literature in the 1920s and 1930s, as well as
the development of library work with children during the same period was not accidental,
either.

3.4 Children’s Reading Interests
Along with new education revolution in the Republic Era came the idea of
promoting students’ independence in learning and encouraging children to read as much
as possible. Reading became a way for assisting with classroom education and for
promoting recreation. Such endeavors would help improve with reading comprehension
and writing abilities as well as encourage cognitive development. As children were
exposed to a large collection of reading materials besides textbooks, educators and
librarians began to investigate and analyze children’s reading habits and interests.
Researchers often employed three different ways of investigating children’s
reading habits and interests at that time. The first one mainly used a quantitative method
to look at children’s libraries’ circulation statistics. The second way employed qualitative
and quantitative methods by sending questionnaires about children’s favorites books and
analyzing the results. The third way relied on observation and maintaining a log of
records. XU Xilin, a researcher at the SUN YAT-SEN University Education Research
Institute, summarized the characteristics of each method as follows. The circulation
statistics method was biased because library borrowed books only accounted for a portion
of children’s reading and borrowed books did not equal children’s favorite books (Xu
1930, 25). The survey method was also biased because children would not answer

78	  

honestly if their favorite books were improper and they might not remember every title of
their favorite ones (Xu 1930, 25). The observation method would be more accurate but
too time-consuming (Xu 1930, 25).
Xu employed the survey method for his own research and conducted the
largest scale survey of children’s reading interest in the Republic Era from October 1929
to June 1930 (Xu 1930, 20-53; Xu 1930, 44-55). To weaken the bias of the survey
method, he adopted an anonymous method in the hope that children would be more
truthful in their questionnaire responses if kept anonymous. This nine-month survey
involved nineteen public schools and private schools in urban and rural Guangzhou city
(Xu 1930, 20-24). The survey sent around 16,000 questionnaires and received over 5,400
responses, with an over 30% response ratio (Xu 1930, 20-24). After initial screening,
3,027 of the 5,400 responses were used as the data set for further analysis (Xu 1930, 2024).13 Table 3.3 is the profile of the respondents. The survey aimed at understanding
children’s reading interests and habits as applied to books, magazines, and newspapers.

To study children’s book-reading interests, Xu asked students to list their favorite
book titles and tried to find the trend in children’s reading interests from those titles (Xu
1930, 24-39).16 His findings on children’s book-reading interests as related to age and

It may be surmised from the table that there was some overlap in different
age’s reading interests. The research results also indicated that the older the children, the
more diverse their reading interests became, and the more books they were able to list as
their favorites (Xu 1930, 24-36). Further, Xu concluded that children’s book-reading
interests and habits in China were comparable to those of American children. As
presented in the study of Gray and Munroe, the following three aspects were identified:
first of all, primary school students in the United States and in China both preferred

Xu compared his research results with Gray and Munroe’s research results. In 1929, William S. Gray and
Ruth Munroe summarized the major results of reader studies between 1900 and 1925 in the United States;
these results were delineated by age, sex, occupation, and education. See William S. Gray and Ruth
Munroe: The Reading Interests and Habits of Adults, a Preliminary Report. New York, Macmillan Co.,
1929.

fiction to other books; secondly, children of the same grades’ reading interests were not
the same; thirdly, junior high school was crucial in shaping children’s reading habits (Xu
1930, 24-36). The difference was that American children’s reading abilities developed
greatly in the late years of primary school while children in China did not show any
improvement in that period (Xu 1930, 24-36).
As to the relationship between gender and children’s book reading interests and
habits, according to his survey results, girls in almost all grades listed more books as their
favorites than boys, which might indicate that girls read more books than boys (Xu 1930,
36-39). The difference between boys and girls’ reading interests was also obvious:
primary school boys preferred books, such as legends, chivalry, and detective novels. In
contrast, primary school girls liked to read books about family life and romance (Xu 1930,
36-39). High school boys’ reading interests covered historical, social, and reference
books; however, high school girls’ favorites were novels and poems (Xu 1930, 36-39).
These findings on the relationship between gender and reading interests was allegedly
similar to Gray and Munroe’s results (Xu 1930, 36-39).
As for book reading motivation, the study listed seven reasons and asked
children to identify the reasons for reading certain books (Xu 1930, 37-38). Students
responded as follows: interesting content was the top reading motivation for all graders,
accounting for more than twenty percent (Xu 1930, 37-38). Coming in second was
enjoyable articles and an effort to increase knowledge (Xu 1930, 37-38). Notably,
teacher-assigned reading was not common among students’ choices of books (Xu 1930,
37-38). The responses were consistent with the results from Gray and Munroe’s study
(Xu 1930, 37-38).

81	  

The primary and middle school curriculum standards at that time stipulated
that primary school graduates should be capable of reading children’s magazines;
therefore, Xu also investigated children’s magazine-reading interests. Students named 48
different magazines among their favorites (Xu 1930, 39-45). Xu analyzed the top seven
magazines’ popularity among different graders, as shown in Figure 3.13 (Xu 1930, 40).
As children grew older, their reading interests shifted from childish magazines, such as
Xiao Peng You (Little Friend) and Er Tong Shi Jie (Children’s World) to adult magazines,
such as Dong Fang Za Zhi (Oriental) and Fu Nv Za Zhi (Women) (Xu 1930, 39-45).
Figure 3.13: Popularity of magazines among students

The relationship among children’s magazine-reading habits, interests, and
age were much like children’s book-reading habits and interests. The older children
became, the more they read, and the more diverse their reading interests became (Xu
1930, 39-45). Gender differences also influenced children’s magazine-reading interests,
though not as obviously as book-reading interests. The fact that boys might read
magazines as often as girls was remarkable as boys could name the same amount of
favorite magazines as girls (Xu 1930, 39-45).17 As the publication of magazines in China
had not reached a steady period and most of the magazines surfaced in the past three to
four years, the study of children’s magazine reading habits and interests could use further
research (Xu 1930, 39-45).
At the time of research, newspapers became part of people’s everyday
lives. Primary school curriculum standards at that time stipulated that primary school
graduates should be able to read popularly published newspapers. Therefore, Xu also
investigated children’s newspaper-reading habits. From the survey results, it could be
decided that the general trend of children’s newspaper-reading habits was that the older
children became, the more likely they would be to read newspapers (Xu 1930, 44-53). On
average, around 40% of primary school students read newspapers, and less than 20% of
them were in the habit of reading newspapers every day (Xu 1930, 47-49). Around 80%
of middle school students read newspapers, and less than 60% of them were in the habit
of reading newspapers every day (Xu 1930, 47-49). However, when compared to
American children’s newspaper-reading habits, the result was not equal. According to
Xu’s comparison, in Gray and Munroe’s research, over 90% of American children read

In the case of book reading, girls identified more book titles than boys.

83	  

newspapers by the time they were in third grade, and over 90% of children developed the
habit of reading newspapers every day by grade 5 (Xu 1930, 49).
Moreover, gender difference as regards children’s newspaper-reading habits
was marked. On average, boys spent over fifty minutes reading newspapers every day,
and girls spent around forty minutes (Xu 1930, 49-53). The fact that the percentage of
girls in the habit of reading newspapers was far less than boys, and that girls of all ages
spent less time reading newspapers than boys, indicated that girls were less interested in
reading newspapers than boys (Xu 1930, 49-53). Girls’ unwilling to reading newspapers
further lowered the percentage of children that had newspaper-reading habits in total (Xu
1930, 49-53). The relatively slow development of children’s newspaper-reading habits
was a large concern for researchers.
As for children’s newspaper-reading interests, Xu divided newspaper articles
into fourteen parts and asked children about their favorites (Xu 1930, 44-48).18 In general,
primary school children liked to read local, provincial, and national news, junior high
students’ reading interests expanded to education news; senior high students began to
read international news and paid less attention to sports news and literature. Girls
preferred literature to news while boys liked to read all kinds of news (Xu 1930, 44-48).
Children’s newspaper-reading preferences demonstrated that newspapers met children’s
interest in reading to stay updated on the news.
As the first and largest survey of children’s reading in the Republic Era, this
survey laid an objective foundation for the further study of children’s reading interests
and habits. Based on the analysis of available children’s literature and children’s reading
interests, this study offered valid suggestions for children’s book and periodical

argued for the necessity of children’s libraries with appropriate reading materials.
This survey of children’s reading interests and habits was based on
Guangzhou city only. Although the survey result could not represent the national level, it
still reflected the general situation of children’s reading interests and habits in the
Republic Era to some extent. As Guangzhou was relatively more developed than other
parts of the nation in cultural and educational development. Students’ performance was
also above national level. Therefore, if the situation of children’s reading in Guangzhou
was not satisfactory, the nationwide situation was inevitably worse, given less resources.
Jiang and Zhang employed the observation method to study children’s leisure
reading in 1930 (Jiang and Zhang 1930, 31-40). To understand children’s real reading
interests, they observed the Central University Laboratory School’s fifth and sixth
graders’ reading behaviors in the school library for ten days (Jiang and Zhang 1930, 3140). The school library had a collection of over 300 volumes, and the researchers
classified the collection into thirteen categories (Jiang and Zhang 1930, 32-34). They
listed the titles of each category as follows: fairy tales: 17; folklore: 5; stories: 89;
chivalry novels: 26; detective novels: 8; popular novels: 14; modern novels: 53; poetry:
17; drama: 21; biography: 6; miscellany: 18; newspapers: 3; magazines: 9 (Jiang and
Zhang 1930, 32-34). During each observation session, each student’s checked-out book
titles, and the corresponding time, were recorded (Jiang and Zhang 1930, 35-38). At the
end of this ten-day observation, twelve observation session sheets were recorded (Jiang
and Zhang 1930, 35-38). Based on the observation log, sixty-eight different book titles

85	  

were checked-out by students, and the students’ reading preferences were presented as
the following table shows (Jiang and Zhang 1930, 39).

Several trends of children’s reading interests may be drawn from the
observation results. Children’s favorite book categories included chivalry novels, stories,
and popular novels (Jiang and Zhang 1930, 39-40). They also preferred magazines and
other kinds of novels (Jiang and Zhang 1930, 39-40). Their least favorite materials were
biography, poetry, and folklore (Jiang and Zhang 1930, 39-40). The study concluded that
this trend of children’s reading interests matched children’s psychological development
(Jiang and Zhang 1930, 39-40).
The study was innovative for employing the observation method; however, it
was not without flaw. The sample was around 100 students from one primary school, and
the children observed were limited to grade five and grade six students. Although the
sample was not representative enough, and the experiment itself had shortcomings, the
observation directly reflected children’s reading interests in real settings. The research
86	  

connected observation findings to children’s developmental characteristics and
demonstrated that children preferred books from which they could find resonance. Thus,
the research provided basic guidelines for creating children’s literature that catered to
their particular psychological characteristics and reading interests.
In 1935, Wang offered free voluntary reading to study children’s reading
practices in the Dahuayuan Experimental School in Kaifeng, Henan Province (Wang
1935, 1-24). He conducted a fourteen-week free voluntary reading experiment to observe
seventeen middle graders’ reading performance (Wang 1935, 1-24). Sixty-eight different
books were provided for students’ free voluntary reading (Wang 1935, 2-4). These
reading materials were divided into four categories: eighteen repetitive stories; twentyfive stories; thirteen social science books; and twelve nature science books; and each
book had three copies (Wang 1935, 2-4). Within fourteen weeks, the average students
read around thirty books, counted over 40, 000 words, and the top student read forty
books, and counted 76,263 words in the same period (Wang 1935, 8).
Some students’ reading speed increased from reading one book in week one
to reading five books in week fourteen (Wang 1935, 8). Wang analyzed that for the first
few weeks, students’ reading speed was slow because their vocabulary was limited, and
they had difficulty with spelling and reading comprehension (Wang 1935, 13-14). As the
free voluntary reading sessions continued, and the more students read, the more fluent
they became with using dictionaries (Wang 1935, 13-14). Their abilities in reading

87	  

comprehension developed, and they read faster than before (Wang 1935, 13-14).
Therefore, the general trend of Figure 3.14 was almost a linear growth (Wang 1935, 12).19
Figure 3.14: Volumes of books read in fourteen weeks

As for reading interests, Wang summarized that students read more
repetitive stories than other books because those stories had fewer new words, were easy
to understand, and suited children’s reading level (Wang 1935, 14-18). Students also
preferred stories because of the interesting content of stories (Wang 1935, 14-18). As for
particular titles, Wang further analyzed that if the book’s depth and interest suited the
average children’s level, or if the book was recommended by peers or promoted by
teachers, most students would read it (Wang 1935, 14-18). Wang also found that students
seldom read ten particular books, including titles such as Robinson Crusoe, the Little
Match Girl, and Cheng Xiang (Weighing the Elephant) (Wang 1935, 14-18). The only

In this figure, the sixth and seventh weeks’ reduction of books read was attributed to the absence of nearly
half of the students because of sickness or other personal reasons. In the last two weeks of the semester,
other school programs occupied some of the students’ time so that they read slightly less than before.

88	  

characteristic these books shared was that the teachers had replaced their original covers
and bindings (Wang 1935, 14-18).
As the experiment continued, Wang employed various methods for testing
students’ reading performances, such as reading notes, presentations in private and in
public, reading tests and oral tests (Wang 1935, 1-24). After the fourteen-weeks free
voluntary reading, all of the students showed improvement in reading interests and
reading abilities (Wang 1935, 1-24). This study proved that free voluntary reading
improved students’ vocabulary and spelling, developed their reading comprehension
ability, and stimulated their reading interests. Furthermore, it revealed that children’s
preference of books was influenced by the book’s content as well as the book level, book
format, and binding. These research findings could be used to encourage children’s
reading by matching them with appropriate books.
In 1936, Chi conducted a large-scale survey of children’s reading interests in
Beijing (Chi 1936, 46-86). He visited five schools in person and asked the children to
finish a questionnaire20 in thirty minutes (Chi 1936, 49-50). The survey elicited 845
responses from students (third graders to sixth graders) (Chi 1936, 50). Over 1,780 book
titles were listed by children as books they had read in their free time, of which 460 titles
were listed by at least five children (Chi 1936, 50-51). Chi based his analysis on these
460 books and further divided these 460 titles into 31 categories, which included
magazine, story, picture book, fairy tale, novel, classic, history, geography, nature, etc
(Chi 1936, 51). According to his analysis, stories and fairy tales were children’s favorite

The questionnaire included three open-ended questions: (1) List the books you have read in your free time.
(2) What are your favorite top three books, and why do you like them? (3) What are your least favorite
three books, and why don’t you like them?

89	  

top two categories, accounting for 16% and 18% of the 460 books, respectively (Chi
1936, 51).
As expected, children’s reading interests varied among different ages and
genders. Boys’ favorites were legends, Kung fu and adventure stories, as well as history
(Chi 1936, 55-57). Girls’ favorites were fictions of romance and family life (Chi 1936,
55-57). Children of the same grade tended to share some common reading interests –
third graders’ favorites were picture books; fourth graders read less picture books and
more fairy tales than the third graders; fifth graders read more novels and began to show
interest in nonfiction; sixth graders’ in general read more books and preferred books with
more words than books with more illustrations (Chi 1936, 57-59). Chi’s research finding
was identical with the above study that children’s reading interests were influenced by
their age, gender, and developmental stage. Thus, his suggestions for reading guidance
were similar to the previous ones that children should be provided with books that match
their reading interests. For instance, boys could be provided with more materials, such as
on subjects including adventure, aviation, and history. Girls could be provided with more
family and school-based stories.
Regarding the above research, several trends of children’s reading and
children’s literature publication in the 1930s could be identified. All of these studies
employed a quantitative research method and based analysis on research data. These were
among the first to study children’s reading interests and habits by involving children as
participants. Biased or not, the research results reflected the general situations for
children’s reading in the Republic Era, to some extent. These studies’ accordant findings
included that children’s reading interests and habits varied among different age and

90	  

gender groups. Moreover, their reading interests and habits were internally shaped by
their psychological development and externally influenced by the availability, contents,
formats, and reading levels of the reading materials. Further, their reading abilities
improved as they read more materials.
These findings offered a solid foundation for further study on this issue as well
as applying the results to library practices. Furthermore, these researches aimed at an
extensive analysis of all the available children’s periodicals and books published at that
time, and it charted children’s preferences towards these materials. For instance, both Xu
and Chi found that information books were in great shortage at that time (Xu 1930; Chi
1936). Information books were occasionally mentioned by students as their favorite
books, not because of the children’s lack of interest but in part because of their short
supply (Xu 1930, 51). Some advice from the research results was made known to
publishers and influenced children’s literature publishing. After Xu’s call for more
information books, a series of information books that presented factual material in an
appropriate and appealing way were published. Children welcomed these books.
According to statistics on the publication of children’s books, until 1933, information
books on social science, science, and technology accounted for around 19% of all the
books published for children (Chen 1933, 77-79).
Additionally, the research results provided guidelines for library practices,
such as collection building and reading guidance. Based on the research findings on the
relationship between gender and reading interests, most children’s libraries expanded
their collections to include fiction, such as adventure and family stories as well as
nonfiction, such as children’s book series, historical and social books. Libraries also

91	  

provided reading guidance to meet different genders’ reading interests. For instance, the
Tianjin Municipal First Popular Library asked children’s reading interests and needs first
before suggesting books for their reading (Lin 1936, 13-16). From the analysis of
children’s reading performance in these studies, leveled reading was suggested to
stimulate children’s reading interests and encouraged children’s reading. For example,
Xu designed a selected bibliography of leveled reading materials, which could be used as
the minimum booklists for library collection-building as well as reference for leveled
reading. Based on the findings of children’s reading interests from these studies and his
own experience, LI Wenyi, the curator of the Beiping First Library, divided young
readers into three groups and provided each group with different level of reading
materials (Li 1936, 1-30).
To conclude, the results of the research on children’s reading habits and
interests provided guidelines for children’s literature publishing, library collection
strategy, as well as library services for children. Most research found that non-fiction
reading materials were insufficient compared to fiction, and thus suggested that more
books and magazines on science, nature, and social science should be published. Those
materials could include more illustrations to appeal to children. The analysis of children’s
reading interests established a foundation for library collection policy. Librarians began
to select materials that met and stimulated children’s interests. The findings on the
relationship among age, gender, and children’s reading interests also shaped library
services to children to some extent. Simply put, children’s libraries placed greater
emphasis on reader’s advisory and strived to provide quality reading guidance.

3.5 Library Collection
A growth in society’s understanding of the value of children’s reading and source
materials coincided with an increased number of publications in the field of children’s
literature. Educators and librarians realized that children’s reading materials could
broaden their vision, inspire their thoughts, increase their knowledge, supplement their
education, encourage their feelings, stimulate their reading interests, and cultivate an
appreciation of literature (Wang 1933; Shang 1933; Sun 1936; Chi 1936). However, not
all children’s reading materials that were published at that time were suitable for
children’s reading. A substantial amount of superficial materials with heavy descriptions
of sex, violence, crime, demons, absurdity, and vulgar language inundated the market.
Therefore, it became crucial for libraries to provide appropriate materials for children’s
reading and keep to lead them away from inappropriate materials. Academics and
librarians started the discussion and practice of book selection and collection building.
It was generally understood in the Republic Era that children’s book selections
should be based on children’s psychological characteristics. Different from adults’
complex psychology, the children’s young age and limited experience made it necessary
to analyze their psychological characteristics (Sun 1936, 149). SUN Ziqiang, a professor
in the Department of Chinese at Nanking University, summarized children’s
characteristics as curious, imitative, motivational, aesthetic, induced, and creative (Sun
1936, 149). For instance, young readers tended to imitate the heroes from fiction, after
reading Journey to the West, they all wanted to be the mighty Monkey King. Therefore,
he suggested, libraries should follow the natural inclinations of young readers and to
select books, such as the biography of a great person and patriotic novels to stimulate

93	  

children’s imitation (Sun 1936, 149). Likewise, libraries could induce children to believe
in cause and effect and select books that fall into the categories of “pride comes before a
fall” and “what goes around comes around” (Sun 1936, 149). In addition, children’s
aesthetic characteristics determined that libraries should select books that were beautiful
in writing as well as in illustration and book design (Sun 1936, 149).
ZHOU Zuoren was among the first to bring up the idea that children should be
provided with literature that would meet and cultivate their age-appropriate interests. He
argued that children’s book selection should be based on the combination of children’s
psychological development stages and literature criticism criteria and recommended
different age group be provided with different categories of children’s books (Zhou 1920,
1-7). According to him, preschoolers’ (3-6 years old) most developed feelings were
sensation and they couldn’t tell the difference between reality and unreality, therefore,
nursery rhyme, fables with interesting contents and fairy tales without sadness, suffering
and cruelty were most suitable for them; children’s observation and memory had evolved
during middle childhood (6-10 years old) and their imagination were gradually limited by
real experiences, they were more attracted by poems with rhymes and meanings, fairy
tales such as Hans Christian Andersen’s collection or some chapters from Journey to the
West, stories about nature; young teens (10-12 years old) further developed their self
consciousness and morals and were no longer interested in nursery rhyme and should be
provided with historical legends abroad or domestic, realistic stories such as
Robinson Crusoe and Don Quixote, fables with education purpose, and dramas (Zhou
1920, 1-7).
Based on children’s developmental phases, identified by Kirkpatrick, Liu

94	  

analyzed different age groups related to children’s characteristics and suggested relevant
types of materials for libraries to choose (Liu 1922, 1-7). For instance, “pre-childhood”
(before age 8) children used imagination to understand the world (Liu 1922, 5-6). Thus,
tales and stories were most suitable for them (Liu 1922, 5-6). “Post-childhood” (age 8 to
12) readers began to understand the difference between imagination and reality and were
interested in creative stories as well as biographies (Liu 1922, 5-6). “Pre-adolescence”
(age 12 to 16) children’s psychological and physical changes were most obvious among
the categories (Liu 1922, 5-6). Libraries could provide poems and romance novels to
meet their emotional needs as well as moral and inspirational materials to cultivate their
spirits (Liu 1922, 5-6).
Research findings on children’s reading interests related to age and gender in the
1930s supported the discussion of the 1920s. They provided some guidance for libraries
to select appropriate reading materials for children, as discussed.
Librarians in the Republic Era were particularly attentive to children deprived of
educational opportunities. Children’s libraries were not intended for school children only.
The library was an educational institution for school graduates and others to pursue
knowledge. According to Du, more than 90% of children could not continue their formal
education beyond primary school, making libraries a key site for informal education (Du
1926, 1-15). He took the example of Andrew Carnegie and his connection with libraries
to emphasize the importance of libraries for educating children. Children’s libraries
should help students to develop the habit of library visits while enrolled in school; thus,
even if children could not continue their education, they could still go to the library for
auto didacticism (Du 1926, 6-10). Therefore, besides fiction and textbooks, libraries

95	  

should select books on the subject of various industries and jobs (Du 1926, 6-10). Zeng
also suggested that libraries should select books that could help children in their daily
lives, guide career choices, and empower them to be productive citizens (Zeng 1929,
255).
Children’s reading level was another guideline for selecting children’s books. For
instance, the Capital Popular Library only selected books that primary school students
could read (Jingshi 1919, 33-37). Any book beyond the primary school students’ reading
level was excluded from the children’s collection (Jingshi 1919, 33-37). Also, the
Xinhuipingshan Primary School examined its collection, marking any book above
students’ reading level as a reference book, and compiling a catalogue of leveled books
(Xinhui 1934, 33).
Since the 1920s, the issue of selecting children’s books was widely discussed in
the fields of education, literature, and library science. Although the criteria for selecting
children’s reading materials for libraries evolved over time, it generally consisted of two
aspects: content and format.
Ethical and moral issues constituted the prevailing criteria for selecting children’s
books. What children read at early ages would shape who they would become in the
future. Therefore, it was agreed that children’s reading materials should have noble ethics
to help children build morality. Du emphasized that every book in the children’s library
should have an “ethical tone” – the book should be able to enhance children’s ethics (Du
1926, 6-10). He insisted that when selecting children’s books, children’s librarians should
read and review every book to eliminate immoral ones. In other words, it was the quality
of a children’s collection, rather then its material quantity, that mattered (Du 1926, 6-10).

96	  

Besides ethics and morality, the criteria for selecting children’s books in the 1920s
included literary value, scientific value, practical value, and revolutionary spirit (Du
1926; Ye 1928; Chu 1929; Zeng 1929).
With the increase in the quantity and variety of books published for children in
the 1930s, the criteria for selecting children’s books became more specific. Ye and Wang
proposed that different criteria applied to different genres of children’s literature. For
instance, nursery rhymes should be in vernacular language and with charming syllables
and easy to understand sentences; poems should have natural syllables and harmonious
rhymes, organized to suit children’s grammar level; jokes and fables should include
lessons to enhance children’s intellectual development; riddles and scientific books
should provoke children’s research interests and enhance their intellectual development
(Ye 1934, 244-45; Wang 1933, 66-69). Moreover, fairy tales, myths, stories, and novels
share the same criteria: anything that described children’s lives or had solid advice could
be selected; anything that was too preposterous and ridiculous should not be selected (Ye
1934, 244-45; Wang 1933, 66-69). As dramas and scripts were mostly adapted from
poems, stories, fairy tales or novels, the criteria for selecting poems, stories, fairy tales,
and novels applied to dramas and scripts (Ye 1934, 244-45; Wang 1933, 66-69). Nonfiction that could train children’s memories, imaginations, and reasoning skills, such as
history, geography, education, military, industry, science and diplomacy books could be
selected (Ye 1934, 244-45; Wang 1933, 66-69). Childish pictures and posters that could
excite children’s emotions could also be selected as part of the children’s collection (Ye
1934, 244-45; Wang 1933, 66-69).
In 1933, the Ministry of Education published guidelines on selecting children’s

97	  

reading materials as follows: “suit the country’s conditions, contain correct information
and advanced thoughts, beautifully written and illustrated, suit children’s experiences,
meet the society’s needs, inspire the national spirit and avoid outworn, violence,
superstition, etc.” (Zhen 1933, 8) Following the Ministry of Education’s guidelines,
various standards and guidelines appeared for selecting children’s reading materials. The
following materials were included: WANG Bainian’s Er Tong Du Wu Biao Zhun
(Standards of Children’s Reading Materials), CHI Shouyi’s Zen Yang Xuan Ze Er Tong
Du Wu (How to Select Children’s Reading Materials), and SUN Ziqiang’s Er Tong Tu
Shu Guan Tu Shu Xuan Ze Zhi Yan Jiu (Study on Book Selection in Children’s Libraries).
These were also the most referenced and cited ones. Standards generally included
specific guidelines, such as “be ethical and moral”; “use plain and easy to understand
language”; “be artistic and empathic”; “have scientific and industrial spirits”; “be
optimistic, passionate, creative and imaginative”; “be harmonious, sincere, vivid and
meaningful” (Wang 1936; Chi 1936; Sun 1936). Some of these guidelines were identical
to the criteria adopted by American professionals in their pioneer years. For instance,
Carolin Hewins, an influential figure in children’s book recommendations, stated in her
renowned Books for Boys and Girls list in 1897 that she chose the books that “broaden
the horizon of children, cultivate their imagination and love of nature, and add to their
stock of general knowledge” (Thomas 1982, 71). In summary, the general criteria for
selecting children’s reading materials at the Republican Era were as follows: children’s
reading materials should account for children’s physical and psychological development,
be suitable for children’s reading level and experiences, appeal to children’s interests,

98	  

exhibit educational and literature value, cultivate moral, and be beautifully written and
illustrated (Jin 1930; Li 1936; Wang 1936; Chi 1936; Sun 1936).
There were also guidelines for reading materials that were not satisfactory. In
general, books that could motivate children to make progress and encourage the spirit of
diligence, justice as well as bravery, and that had educational value were regarded as
good books. In contrast, books that propagated crime, sex, and feudalism, lacked solid
argument, weakened children’s morale, and jeopardize children’s physical and
psychological development were regarded as bad books (Wang 1936, 52-58). For
instance, after reading some low quality martial arts novels, five children from Shanghai
planned to go to Sichuan for Taoist practice (Chi 1936, 53-54). Such books were widely
rejected by children’s libraries because the influences of these martial arts and sensational
novels on children could be detrimental. This trend against “martial arts” novels was
analogous to the American youth services librarians’ against “sensationalism in
children’s books” in the late nineteenth century (Fenwick 1976, 335). Therefore, libraries
should avoid any materials that propagate crime, sex, superstition, sensationalism,
violence, feudalism, etc. Specifically, scholars suggested guidelines for identifying bad
materials, such as “impair morality and ethic”; “be too mysterious, delusive, supernatural,
unreasonable and ferocious”; “be decadent, pessimistic, world-weary, or dispirited”;
“have too coarse, vulgar, and unorganized contents” (Li 1937; Wang 1936; Chi 1936).
Some of these guidelines were identical to Hewins’s early standard for rejecting books,
such as those that might encourage “cruelty, rudeness or disrespect”, or were too
unrealistic, and written in poor English (Thomas 1982, 59).
The format of children’s reading materials received equal attention as did the

99	  

content. Criteria for the format of children’s books in the 1920s were general. Issues such
as illustration, font size, paper quality, binding, and cover design were identified. They
were not discussed in detail, however (Du 1926; Ye 1928). It was not until the 1930s that
specific criteria for formatting children’s reading materials became available. Scholars
suggested standards for appropriate formats for children’s reading materials. For instance,
“paper should be durable, white and non-glare”; “printing should be superior, elegant,
clear, and neat”; “font size should be suitable for children’s age and won’t affect
children’s vision”; “binding should be firm,” etc. (Ye 1934; Wang 1936; Sun 1936; Chi;
1936; Li 1937).
Based on the criteria applied to children’s literature, concerned institutions and
individuals started to recommend bibliographies for children’s reading and children’s
library collections. In 1928, Du first suggested a selected bibliography of children’s
literature, which covered reference books, series, history and geography, science, and
literature (Du 1928, 1-12). In 1929, drawing from his experience as a school librarian,
CHU Zirun published a short booklist for first and second grade students’ reading and
assigned a reading level to each book with the aim of an increased number of library
adoptions (Chu 1929). Based on the survey of children’s reading interests, Xu
recommended a bibliography of children’s books for children’s libraries. Considering the
limited budget of most libraries, Xu listed a modest bibliography with approximately 200
titles (Xu 1930, 44-55). In 1933, the Ministry of Education published a bibliography of
children’s books with approximately 700 titles and chose 360 titles for its selected list
(Zhen 1933, 8). These bibliographies and booklists combined research findings with
practical experience and took the situations of contemporary children’s libraries into

100	  

consideration. This approach provided libraries with much-needed guidance to select
appropriate reading materials for children.
In practice, children’s library collections developed as the result of an
increasing quantity of children’s literature and an evolvement of selection criteria. From
its inception, children’s libraries were only stocked with a handful of classics, such as
Three Character Classic and Hundred Family Surnames and popular novels for adults,
such as Journey to the West and Three Kingdoms. Gradually, textbooks and children’s
periodicals served as the major materials found in early children’s libraries. When the
Capital Popular Library opened its children’s reading room in 1914, the children’s
collection included four categories: textbook, fairy tale, picture book, novel and magazine
(Zhuang 1914, 18-20).
With the advent of native children’s literature and the publication of children’s
books in various genres in the 1920s, children’s libraries expanded their collections to
include more types of reading materials. For instance, in 1926, one children’s library in
Suzhou had a collection of sixteen categories with over a thousand volumes covering
materials such as novel, drama, story, fairy tale, language, science, picture book, and
periodical (Wang 1926, 1-15). Further, children’s libraries in the 1930s continued to
make selections on materials and expand their collections. For example, the Anhui
Provincial Library had a collection of over 3,000 volumes of children’s materials and
published a catalogue for children’s reference in 1932 (Anhui 1932, 1). The library
designated its collection to three main classes, and each class was comprised of nine
divisions, as shown in Table 3.6 (Anhui 1932, 2-5). The Hangzhou Children’s Library
held over 1,500 titles of children’s materials, classified as general works, social sciences,

101	  

language, science, applied science, arts, literature and history, and geography. For some
popular titles, the library provided more than ten copies for children’s reading (Hangzhou
1933).

Biographies

Based on children’s physical and psychological development, children’s libraries
in the Republic Era tried to select appropriate materials to meet and cultivate their
reading interests. Librarians not only developed certain criteria with regard to content,
type, and format for selecting children’s materials but also suggested bibliographies for
children’s reading. With the growth of children’s materials published and the evolvement
of selection criteria, children’s library collections expanded from a handful of textbooks
and classics in the 1910s to hundreds or thousands of titles covering a wide variety of
classes in the 1930s.

3.6 Youth Services and Programming
With the advent of children’s spaces and emergent reading materials, children’s

102	  

libraries began to advocate their services and to develop multiple programs for promoting
reading and literacy.

3.6.1 Library Advocacy
To promote library services and to attract more children to the library, children’s
libraries utilized advertisements, created inviting environments, and employed incentives
across the country. Children’s libraries utilized all of the available media outlets at that
time to promote library services. They regularly publicized library news in magazines,
newspapers, and school bulletins, using flyers and posters to advocate library programs.
Another outlet involved radio-broadcasting programs for advertising services. For print
advertisements, children’s libraries were successful at using words that were easy to read
and comprehend as well as funny and interesting illustrations to attract children’s
interests. For instance, one particular children’s library designed a pyramid shaped flyer
to attract children’s attention and invite them to the library (Huang 1930, 1-6).
Look21
Come look
Come and look
Come here and look
There are many good books
You will be happy reading them
You will not feel tired and fatigued
The books in our library are so interesting
They will also help you to increase your knowledge
Please get away from your games and take some time
Come come come welcome to our library and have a seat

Some libraries also posted flyers on the library’s bulletin boards to promote new books.
One of the flyers read: “Confucius wrote a letter to his father: ‘Shang da ren qiu yi ji hua
san qian qi shi shi er xiao sheng, jiu zi jia zuo ren ke zhi li ye,’ do you understand the

The original flyer was published in Chinese, the author translates it into English.

103	  

letter? If not, take a look at the Volume 17 Issue 9 of the Youth magazine, you’ll find out!”
(Huang 1930, 1-6)
When children arrived at the library, an inviting environment encouraged them to
stay and visit again. A bright and beautiful children’s reading room could encourage
children’s reading interests. Most children’s libraries used posters to decorate their
reading rooms and stimulate children’s reading interests. The subjects of posters varied
from quotes by famous people, excerpts from books to natural scenery. For instance, Sun
Yat-sen’s “Besides revolution, the other hobby of my life is reading” was frequently
quoted and posted on library walls (Huang 1930, 1-6). Book-related models, miniature
sculptures, craft materials, or experiment equipment could also be found on display at
some children’s libraries.
Reading incentives were often employed by children’s libraries to facilitate
reading. There were two kinds of reading incentives: one was based on children’s reading
performance, and the other was based on competition. For children’s reading
performance, a quantitative measurement was generally used to keep track of children’s
library visits and the number of books or pages read. At the end of each week, or each
month, libraries published a table listing children’s visits and reading logs with the hope
that children would be stimulated by the table and would visit and read more. The
Guangxi Provincial Popular Education Library, the Beiping First Library, the Yunnan
Provincial Kunhua Popular Education Library, the Henan Provincial No.11 Primary
School, and the Library of the FPSBNU all published this kind of table regularly. The
other kind of reading incentive was competition. Children’s libraries in China organized
various kinds of competitions to entice children to read. These competitions included

104	  

reading games, essay writing contests, literacy games, calligraphy competitions, and
speech contests, among others. The libraries gave tangible rewards to participants at the
end of the competitions. The rewards were prizes, such as books, pencils, or notebooks.
These kinds of reading incentives met children’s competitive nature, stimulated their
reading interests, and promoted library services.

3.6.2 Youth Service Programs
To invite children to the library, keep them occupied, and connect them with
reading materials, a wide range of services and programs were designed and provided by
children’s libraries since the 1920s. These services and programs included reading
guidance, readers’ club, storytelling, summer reading, exhibits, themed competitions, and
scientific experiments.
3.6.2.1 Reading Guidance
With an increase in the quantity of children’s reading materials, the emergence of
a diversity of library collections, and the growth in the numbers of young readers at
libraries, most children’s libraries during the Republic Era started to provide reading
guidance for children. “Reading guidance” was a broadly used term that referred to any
service that helped with children’s reading. Similar with the motivation for reading
guidance in the early years of library services to children in America aimed “to bring the
best books to the attention of children.” (Fenwick 1976, 344) The goal of reading
guidance in the Republic Era was to stimulate children’s reading interests, match children
with suitable books, guide children to make the best use of reading, and to evaluate
children’s reading achievement.

105	  

Broadly speaking, stimulating children’s interests meant inviting children to the
library, engaging their reading interests, and enticing them to read. Therefore, it could not
be achieved by simply providing reading materials. Librarians needed to coordinate
library collections and library programs to achieve this goal. There were various
discussions and practices on how to attract children to the library and entice them to read.
Such efforts involved advertisements, creating inviting environments, giving rewards,
and organizing competitions. These kinds of simulations were part of library advocacy
and promotion methods, as discussed before.
Based on research findings of children’s reading habits and practical experience,
librarians gradually became aware of the different reading skills and interests among
different children and strived to provide children with suitable books.
Chi suggested that acting in accordance with knowledge of children’s
psychological features would stimulate their reading interests and guide their reading
(Chi 1936, 9-18). For instance, to work with an awareness of children’s gregariousness,
librarians could organize group meetings and discussions to help children to feel more
comfortable in the library (Chi 1936, 11). Librarians could also address children’s
competitive nature, and they could praise and reward young readers, incentivizing them
to read more (Chi 1936, 11). Additionally, librarians could accommodate children’s
instinct of imitation by providing dramas and plays for them to read and to perform (Chi
1936, 11). To meet children’s instinct for publication, librarians could encourage children
to tell stories or to write book reviews (Chi 1936, 11). Additionally, to meet their instinct
for creation, librarians could provide children with art and craft books and invite them to
draw pictures or otherwise participate with craft activities (Chi 1936,11). To meet their

106	  

love of gaming, librarians could suggest books with game ideas or scientific experiments
and inspire children to try them out (Chi 1936,11). To meet their curiosity, librarians
could ask certain questions and refer children to the books that had information to answer
the questions posed (Chi 1936, 12). To meet their collecting hobbies, librarians could
encourage children to excerpt poems, riddles, and short stories (Chi 1936, 12).
Approached from children’s psychological features, this kind of reading guidance would
greatly stimulate children’s reading interests, facilitate them to read spontaneously, and
empower them to choose their own reading materials.
Another method employed by children’s libraries was leveled reading. The
Pingshan Primary School was among the first libraries to trial leveled reading. The school
librarians first divided library collections into six tentative levels; each level represented a
particular grade (Xinhui 1934, 33). Based on leveled reading materials, librarians
designed specific written tests and asked students to finish those tests after reading the
leveled materials (Xinhui 1934, 33). It was assumed that if over fifty percent of a grade’s
students could pass the tests, then the level was assigned appropriately (Xinhui 1934, 33).
The overall test results for all graders appeared to be satisfactory, which deemed the
assigned levels to be acceptable (Xinhui 1934, 33). Therefore, the school library
employed leveled reading to guide children’s reading and published a bibliography of
leveled reading materials (Xinhui 1934, 33). Later, other children’s libraries also built
their own bibliography of leveled reading materials or followed the bibliography
published by the Ministry of Education.
Beyond stimulating reading interests and providing appropriate reading materials,

107	  

libraries also tried to help children make the best use of reading. Cai suggested four kinds
of reading guidance that would help with children’s reading. Personal guidance:
children’s libraries could adopt an open-shelf system, empowering children to read on
their own; when children asked questions, librarians would address their questions in
detail (Cai 1931, 4). Group guidance: a reading club was the most common way for
group guidance. During a reading club meeting, questions could be discussed among the
group and solved by the children. When questions arose, librarians could provide further
guidance or suggest relevant reference books for the children to consult (Cai 1931, 4).
Patrol guidance: instead of passively being approached by children for advice, librarians
could patrol around the reading area and help children with possible questions (Cai 1931,
4). Booktalk guidance: to engage children’s reading interest, librarians could tell a story
to the children that was excerpted from a certain book but then make a sudden stop (Cai
1931, 4-5). Children would be curious to know the end of the story and would be enticed
to read the entire book. If adopted properly, these methods of working with children
would guide children to make the best use of reading.
Specifically, there were discussions on how to guide children to read various
materials. For instance, almost all children liked to read stories. To make the best use of
story reading, librarians could further guide children to tell stories and create stories of
their own (Zhu 1931, 45-52). This kind of guidance would nourish children’s story
reading interests, develop their writing skills, and public speaking abilities.
To keep children updated with the latest news, librarians and teachers created
various ways to encourage children to read newspapers. For instance, librarians marked
important newspaper articles with bold signs to attract children’s reading interests

108	  

(Huang 1937, 5-8). They also provided newspaper summaries or briefings instead of
original newspapers for children to read (Huang 1937, 5-8). Sometimes, the librarians
retold newspaper articles to children, listing specific questions for children to solve first,
and then asked children to read relevant newspapers (Huang 1937, 5-8). Additionally,
they organized newspaper clubs for children to read, retell, and discuss newspaper
articles (Huang 1937, 5-8). These kinds of methods simulated children’s newspaper
reading interests and helped them to develop habits for reading newspapers.
To evaluate children’s reading progress, various kinds of evaluation methods,
such as reading reflections, book reports, oral tests, written tests, and scientific
experiments were employed by librarians across the country. For example, the Yunnan
Provincial Kunhua Popular Education Library designed a questionnaire to evaluate
children’s reading development (Luo 1934, 3-32). The questions included, “How many
books have you read? Please list their names.” “Which books are most interesting?”
“What’s your goal of reading?” (Luo 1934, 21-23) Chi used a book report to keep track
of children’s reading progress. He designed the book report to include a book’s
bibliographic information, book score,22 book level, most interesting page, most attractive
illustration, children’s note, reaction, and questions (Chi 1936, 17-18). This kind of book
report could be used to evaluate children’s reading progress and as a basis for leveled
reading and reading interest studies (Chi 1936, 17-18).
3.6.2.2 Readers’ Clubs
To connect children with books, various reading programs were employed by

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
22

Chi described the calculation method of the score of a book as: Score=words per line × lines per page ×
pages per book. It was actually the approximate number of the word count of the book.

109	  

libraries in the Republic Era. Among such programs, the readers’ club was the most
popular and common. Librarians believed that readers’ club would function to occupy
children’s spare time, facilitate education, provide reference, and guide children to read,
improve their reading ability, develop their reading habits, and enhance their social skills.
Therefore, all kinds of readers’ clubs were formed across the country. For instance, the
Anqing Public Library attracted more than sixty members to its young readers’ club by
1931 (Anqing 1931, 17-18). The club met once every week for a given activity, such as
group reading, group discussion, public lecture, debating, or essay writing (Anqing 1931,
17-18). Moreover, the Guangxi Provincial Popular Education Library formed the
children’s reading club to cultivate children’s reading interests as well as develop
children’s self-education habits (Liang 1938, 1-11). The ultimate goal for the reading
club was to provide educational opportunities for those children who dropped out of
school (Liang 1938, 1-11). Club members were required to read at the library for an hour
every night (Liang 1938, 1-11). The club also held group meeting every week to review
and discuss books (Liang 1938, 1-11). It also organized reading contests, such as
storytelling, speech competition, and riddle guessing every month (Liang 1938, 1-11).
The Tianjin Municipal First Popular Library kept track of children’s reading club
members’ reading log and gave rewards to frequent readers (Tianjin 1936, 10). To
stimulate children’s reading interests, the library assigned certain books for club members’
reading and held essay contest regularly (Tianjin 1936, 10). Essay topics were drawn
from the assigned reading materials (Tianjin 1936, 10). Additionally, the Shanghai Public
Library, the Tianjin Popular Education Library, and the Beiping First Library all had
young readers’ clubs with active members and regular programs. As well as book reviews

110	  

and discussions, contests and rewards were the major incentives that readers’ club
employed to engage children’s reading interests.
Readers’ club became a formalized service for most children’s libraries. This was
evident by readers’ club membership cards, readers’ club regulations, and readers’ club
calendars. In addition to its effort to encourage children to read, the readers’ club also
aimed to facilitate children’s self-learning and to discipline their behavior within the
library. From the various approaches that children’s libraries took to guiding children’s
reading, it may be concluded that libraries aimed to connect children with appropriate
reading materials.
3.6.2.3 Storytelling and Story hours
Libraries began to adopt storytelling in the 1920s to stimulate children’s reading
interests and bring children to the libraries. To attract more children, libraries usually
held story hours during weekends and holidays. Although most of the time it was the
librarians who were responsible for reading and telling stories, schoolteachers and
storytellers could also convey stories in children’s libraries. Similar with the storytelling
practices in American libraries, librarians often chose “strong and beautiful tales”
(Hazeltine 1921, 42). Stories adapted from fairy tales and fables were the most common
topic at story hours in China, too. Other topics included biographies of famous people,
mechanical subjects, such as railways and electric wires, and adventure stories, among
others. Also, topics varied according to seasonal theme. For instance, stories about New
Years were told during a particular holiday season, and stories about Tomb-sweeping
Day were told during early April.
Zeng suggested that libraries hold different children’s story hours for different age

111	  

groups. For instance, there would be separate storytelling times for children at 3-5 years,
6-9 years, 10-12 years, and 13-16 years (Zeng 1929, 251-58). In this way, librarians
could choose age appropriate stories to tell, and children would benefit more from this
method. Some libraries also used slide shows to aid with storytelling and to attract
children’s varied interests. This was different from the American practices at that time
which emphasized the “telling” of stories to make children “see with the mind” (Fu 1927,
38; Hazeltine 1921, 41-42).
Storytelling was considered a bridge to connect children to the library. It helped
to build a bond between librarians and children. Children often become attached to a
particular librarian or library and have affection for the library in general. Story hours
were especially crucial to preschoolers who often could not read. It also created a literacy
environment for young readers, and storytelling cultivated the interests of future readers.
For school children, storytelling was also effective because it could entice children to
read the books that contained the stories told to them.
3.6.2.4 Summer Reading
Some libraries realized that summer vacation without formal schooling was too
long. Thus, libraries began summer reading programs in the 1930s to motivate children to
read during summer vacation. The typical summer reading program was similarly
designed as the Tianjin Fifth Popular Library’s program. In 1934, the library provided a
summer reading program to enhance children’s reading interests (Pan 1934, 11-12).
During this one-month program, children went to the library to read everyday (Pan 1934,
11-12). The library logged each child’s reading time and the number of pages read as a
way of measuring their reading achievements (Pan 1934, 11-12). At the end of the

112	  

summer, the library rewarded participants with small prizes (Pan 1934, 11-12). This kind
of summer reading program stimulated children’s reading interests and encouraged them
to read during the summer and while not in school.
To promote the library’s youth services, compensate for the lack of reading
resources available to children during the summer, and guide children to read, the
Yunnan Kunhua Popular Education Library also launched a large-scale summer reading
program in 1934 (Luo 1934, 3-32). Over eight hundred children from thirty schools
enrolled in the summer reading program within four days (Luo 1934, 7-8). Because of the
limited capacity of the children’s reading room and the high volume of participants, the
library separated the children into two groups and asked them to come to the library at
different times (Luo 1934, 8-9). During the summer reading days, lower graders came to
the library in the morning and higher graders came to the library in the afternoon (Luo
1934, 8-9). Each group spent three hours in the library per day (Luo 1934, 8-9). The
three-hour program was comprised of two reading sessions with each session lasting for
one hour (Luo 1934, 9-11). It also included a fifteen-minute break, and a forty-five
minute speech or group discussion at the end of the session (Luo 1934, 9-11). Around
five hundred children actively involved in this program came to the library to read for
each of the twenty-five days (Luo 1934, 10). On the last day of the program, the library
held a reading contest to evaluate the children’s reading progress and awarded achievers
(Luo 1934, 21-25). At the end of the summer reading program, the library organized a
children’s reading club to continue providing the opportunity for children to read (Luo
1934, 26-29). This summer reading program stimulated children’s reading interests and
developed their reading abilities. It also helped librarians to identify potential problems in

113	  

programming and reading guidance, thus improving the quality of the library’s youth
services.
In 1936, the FPSBNU initiated a special summer reading program (Wang 1936,
107-14). It was part of a summer camp located in a serene mountain on the outskirts of
Beijing. The librarian brought thirty books on health, thirty historical and geographical
books, and ten kinds of children’s magazines (Wang 1936, 108-09). This totaled fifty
volumes at the summer camp. The librarian was aware that these children liked to read
fiction the most, followed by historical and geographical books, and finally, newspapers
and magazines (Wang 1936, 109). However, to encourage children to read more
newspapers and magazines as well as information books, the librarian intentionally did
not bring works of fiction to the camp (Wang 1936, 109). During the two-week summer
camp, children read freely at any time of the day, and the librarian provided news
broadcasting every morning and storytelling every night (Wang 1936, 107-14). The effect
of this summer reading program was particularly effective for the following reasons: the
natural environment and beautiful nature setting, the amount of time available to children
for reading, and the on-site reading guidance of the librarian at all times. The summer
reading program connected the reading theme with the summer camp, inspired children’s
reading interests, improved their reading skills, and strengthened the relationship between
librarians and children.

With schools closed and a lack of literacy resources for children at home,
children’s libraries became the ideal place for children to read during summer vacation.
Although libraries had not fully developed their summer reading programs (such as not
having a theme for the program, suggested reading lists, or convenient reading times), the
summer reading program proved, nevertheless, to benefit children by encouraging them
to go to the library. It also inspired children’s reading interests and improved their
reading skills. Despite its benefits the summer reading program was not a wellestablished aspect of youth services in the Republic Era.
3.6.2.5 Exhibits
Children’s libraries in the Republic Era often held exhibits on special occasions or
on certain themes. On special occasions, such as national holidays, anniversaries, or
Children’s Day, children’s libraries tended to organize exhibits to celebrate and to

115	  

promote library services. In 1932, to celebrate the first Children’s Day in China, libraries
in Hangzhou city held various exhibits for young readers (Hangzhou 1932, 3-5). The
Zhejiang Provincial Library displayed books on parenting and childrearing, held story
hours several times throughout the day, and gave a special Children’s Day autograph
book to children (Hangzhou 1932, 3-5). The Hangzhou Municipal Children’s Library
organized an exhibit of children’s photographs and illustrations for stories (Hangzhou
1932, 3-5). The Zhejiang Provincial Popular Education Library held children’s book
exhibits for ten days and treated children with candy (Hangzhou 1932, 3-5). These events
attracted thousands of children to the libraries and promoted library services to children
in Hangzhou city.
In the following year, the Zhejiang Provincial Library continued to celebrate
Children’s Day and held an exhibit for children on 4 April 1933 (Zhejiang 1933, 12-14).
The library decorated the entire branch for the event, displayed children’s new books and
hundreds of illustrations, distributed pamphlets on library youth services to visitors, and
published a special edition of the library newsletter on children’s reading (Zhejiang 1933,
12-14). More than two thousand children came to the library for the exhibit that day,
which was an unprecedented number since the library’s opening (Zhejiang 1933, 12-14).
In 1934, the Guangdong Xinhui Pingshan Primary School launched a two-week
new book exhibit (Pingshan 1934, 30-31). At that time, 228 volumes of new books were
exhibited to promote children’s reading (Pingshan 1934, 30-31). The new books were
divided into four categories for display purposes, including: books for high graders,
books for middle graders, books for low graders, and arts and craft books (Pingshan 1934,
30-31). Before the exhibit, librarians lectured on how to take notes when reading; during

116	  

the exhibit, printed information on reading methods was provided, and each child was
equipped with a prepared notebook (Pingshan 1934, 30-31). As a result, the school
children’s reading reached a pinnacle in the exhibit week. This new books exhibit
encouraged children to read at the library and helped train their reading habits.
In addition to exhibiting its existing collection, libraries also exhibited materials
from other sources. For instance, in 1935, the Primary School of the Shanxi Provincial
Normal School contacted the major publishers of children’s books and asked them to
send children’s books for its library book exhibition (Shanxi 1935, 2-4). During the
exhibition, each publisher was given a room to display their published children’s books
(Shanxi 1935, 2-4). Publishers that took part of this exhibit included the Commercial
Press, the Zhonghua Book Company, and the Jinxin Bookstore (Shanxi 1935, 2-4). The
school library organized this exhibit to stimulate children’s reading interests. It also
aimed to investigate the range of available children’s reading materials and to provide
reading guidance.
In addition to holiday and anniversary celebrations, new book exhibits, other
theme-based events, library exhibits included the following topics: health, science, and
children’s calligraphy, among others. The collections displayed included books as well as
illustrations, equipment, and models.
Children’s libraries in the Republic Era held exhibits on various occasions,
adopted various themes, and displayed various items. These exhibits highlighted
materials from library collections, cultivated children’s interest in library reading, and
promoted youth services ultimately. Thus, the library exhibit became one of the most
popular programs for children’s libraries and was welcomed by young readers.

117	  

3.6.2.6 Competitions
Children’s libraries in China enjoyed the tradition of holding competitions to
stimulate children’s reading interests. Librarians and educators at that time believed that
children had the instinct of competitiveness. Therefore, it was understood that
competition would appeal to children’s instinct and encourage them to visit the library
more often and to read more.
Reading competition was the most common competition that libraries organized.
Most libraries kept a log of children’s reading activities, such as how many visits or how
many books each child read per month. For instance, the Library of the FPSBNU and the
Dahuayuan Experimental School kept track of each student’s reading activity, charting
the volumes of books that they read, and publishing the results, periodically (Wang 1937;
Wang 1935). The Tianjin Municipal First Popular Library initiated its frequent reader
program, published the names of children with the most visits monthly in the library
magazine, and awarded those that visited the library over thirty times and over fifty times
with small rewards (Lin 1936, 13-16). The Beiping First Library kept track of children’s
reading by recording titles and the number of pages read (Li 1936, 1-30). It organized
reading contests every month and published the contest results annually (Li 1936, 1-30).
Other kinds of competitions took place in children’s libraries across the country.
These included essay contest, speech competition, calligraphy competition, and modeling
contest. The Tianjin Municipal First Popular Library held essay contests regularly in an
effort to engage children’s reading interests as well as to help improve their reading and
writing skills (Tianjin 1936, 10). For the contest, librarians would assign ten books for
children’s reading, and the essay topic would be drawn from these book; children would

118	  

be given three weeks to read the books and one week to write the essay (Tianjin 1936,
10). The essay topics included fresh air and health; who invented the train, telegraph, and
airplane; origins of Buddhism; species of sheep, among others (Lin 1936, 13). This essay
contest proved to be an effective way to stimulate children’s reading. As a matter of fact,
during the contest season, every day between 100 and 200 children went to the library to
read (Lin 1936, 13).
To encourage children’s reading interest in newspapers and to keep them updated
with current events, the Hangzhou Children’s Library held a “current events” quiz in
1935. The library had a newspaper collection of various national and local newspapers as
well as children’s newspapers, and the quiz was based on news from these sources
(Hangzhou 1935, 2-3). Around 80 children participated in the quiz, and those with high
scores were given awards by the library (Hangzhou 1935, 2-3). In this way, the library
managed to entice children to read newspapers.
Since the emergence of youth services in China, competition was employed
by libraries to simulate children’s reading interests. Later, this service was widely
adopted by libraries across the country with the hope of bringing children to the library,
getting them involved in library programs, and encouraging them to read. By the end of
the 1930s, it became an indispensable part of youth programs for most libraries.
With the purpose of promoting reading, youth services evolved over time and
were associated with library programs – library advocacy, readers’ club, storytelling,
summer reading, exhibit, and competition. Children’s libraries developed a variety of
programs suited to children’s mental and psychological development and provided
services from a child-oriented perspective. In its pioneer era, the practices of American

119	  

children’s libraries tried to reach individuals via groups by providing group service, such
as reading guidance, book talks and storytelling (Nesbitt 1954, 119-20). Chinese
children’s libraries also addressed young readers as a group and developed group
methods to stimulate children’s reading interests and to provide reading materials
collectively instead of individually. Such libraries did not allocate the time or resources
(service technique) to accommodate the individualized moral, intellectual, emotional, and
aesthetic reading needs for every child. Nonetheless, these programs strengthened the
connection between children and libraries, promoted literacy, and ultimately facilitated
reading. Some programs, like the readers’ club became formalized as a regular library
service, and some programs, such as exhibits and competitions, were refined to better
stimulate children’s interests. This section provides evidence that youth services
programs became a viable part of public library services in the Republic Era.

3.7 Youth Services Librarians
“Children’s rooms, but as yet no children’s librarians worthy of the name.”
– Ruth A. Hill, 1937.
In most modern public libraries, children’s rooms were established, children’s
books were made available, and youth services were provided. However, librarians for
the children were absent. In the Republic Era, qualified children’s librarians were
difficult to find despite advocacy from the progressive leaders of the modern library
movement and discussions intended to raise awareness for youth services and
librarianship in professional literature.

120	  

3.7.1 Librarians
Progressive Leaders of the Modern Library Movement
LIU Guojun (1898-1980) – Kwoh-Chuin Liu in English – was one of the greatest
scholars in twentieth-century Chinese library history. Also, he was among the first to
advocate for children’s libraries in China. Upon graduation from the College of Liberal
Arts at the University of Nanking23 in 1920, he worked at the university’s library before
moving to the United States for graduate study. He studied philosophy and library science
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and finished his master thesis, John Dewey’s
Logical Theory, in 1923, and Ph.D. dissertation, The Problem of Meaning in
Contemporary American and British Philosophy, in 1925 in the same school. After
returning to China, he worked as the university’s librarian at the University of Nanking
and professor of the College of Liberal Arts where he taught courses on library science.
Later, he moved to Beijing and worked as the editor-in-chief of Library Science
Quarterly, professor and dean of the Department of Library Science of Peking University.
In 1979, he was elected as the honorary president of the Library Society of China. His
most prominent publication was A System of Book Classification for Chinese Libraries in
1929, and this classification system is still used today in many libraries in Hong Kong,
Taiwan, and Macau.
The national library classification scheme in China today – Chinese Library
Classification (CLC) – is also based on his system. In addition to his innovative
classification methods, he was also actively involved in introducing the idea and
philosophy of modern public libraries to Chinese library world and published many

University of Nanking (Jin Ling Da Xue) was a private university sponsored by American churches in
1888 and was registered with the New York State Education Department. Until 1928, its presidents were all
Americans and most of its courses were taught in English.

121	  

renowned articles such as “The Nature of Modern Library” and “The Spirit of American
Public Library” (Zhang 1983, 1-10). Through his interest in education, knowledge of
library science, and experience of studying in the United States, he proposed the idea of
“saving the nation by education” and focused on one specific area of education: the
children’s library as an educational institution. The single and most valuable work that he
published on the children’s library was in 1922, titled “Children’s Library and Children’s
Literature.” In this work, he introduced the theory of child psychology to library science,
justified the importance of children’s libraries, and proposed three elements of children’s
libraries – facilities, librarians, and books – and analyzed them systematically (Liu 1922,
1-7). From the “discovery of children” to children’s education, from children’s education
to children’s libraries, Liu became one of the leading advocacy figures for children’s
libraries.
Another great library scholar who shared a similar fame to LIU Guojun was
DU Dingyou (1898-1967), as he was so-called in “North LIU and South DU.” In English,
he was known as Ding U Doo. He was one of the founders of modern Chinese
librarianship and leaders of the Modern Library Movement in China. In 1918, Du was
sent by the Shanghai Industrial College24 to study library science in the University of the
Philippines.25 During his time in the Philippines, he majored in literature and library
science, minored in education, and worked as an assistant at the university library. In
1920, he finished three theses: “Chinese Books and Libraries” for library science,
“Chinese Education in the Philippines” for education, and “Proposals for Reorganization

Formerly Nanyang Public School (Nanyang Gong Xue), Shanghai Industrial College(Shanghai Gong Ye
Zhuan Men Xue Xiao) was the predecessor of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
25
The authority of the U.S. government in 1908 founded the University of the Philippines. The director of
the library science department then was Mary Polk, an American librarian who graduated from the School
of Library Economy, Columbia College.

122	  

of Chinese Education Association in the Philippines” for a high school teachers’ study
(Cheng 2012). He was honored with four degrees – Bachelor of Arts in Literature,
Bachelor of Science in Library Science, Bachelor of Science in Education, and High
School Teacher’s Certificate (Cheng 2012). This task took him three years to accomplish;
for many, it would take typically six years of study to finish. Upon his return to China in
1921, he worked as the principal of Guangzhou Normal School, professor and director of
Shanghai Jiao Tong University Library, dean of Sun Yat-sen University Library, and
director of Guangdong Provincial Library (Cheng 2012). In 1922, he founded the first
Chinese library training school in Guangzhou, served as the first president of the Library
Association of China in 1925, and hosted the first library exhibition in Shanghai in 1926
(Cheng 2012).
Additionally, he made significant theoretical contributions to the field of Chinese
library science. In particular, his work focused on library theory, classification and
cataloging, filing order of Chinese characters, library administration, library building, and
local archives (Wang 2002). Book Cataloging, published in 1926, was his first book on
the cataloging of Chinese books. From 1916 to 1965, he wrote 55 books and 448 articles
(316 published, 132 unpublished), counting over 6,500,000 words (Cheng 2012).
Further background information worth mentioning is that in 1921 he taught
courses on reference services and school library management at the Guangzhou Normal
School. His aim for these courses was to prepare future schoolteachers with the skills
necessary to guide children’s reading. In 1922, at the first annual conference of the
CNAAE, he represented the library education section. His proposal to promote school
libraries was one of the eight motions that were passed. Concurrently, he published

123	  

several articles on the school library, the children’s library, and children’s book selection.
In his most renowned article on the children’s library — “Issues on Children’s Libraries,”
he regarded childhood as the most important period of a person’s life and children as the
hope of China’s future (Du 1926, 1-15). He called for attention to children’s education
and children’s libraries, and he understood youth librarianship and youth services as an
independent and challenging field within the study of library science (Du 1926, 1-15). In
the same paper, he argued for the necessity and importance of children’s libraries,
emphasizing that the goal of children’s libraries is to cultivate the habit of reading and to
develop the habit of visiting the library (Du 1926, 1-15). He discussed in depth about the
organization, personnel, facility, collection, circulation, and reading issues of children’s
libraries (Du 1926, 1-15). His knowledge of literature, education and library science,
expertise in library administration and empathy towards children made him the founder
of the youth librarianship and a leader in the development of youth services in China.
Other prestigious library scholars of the Republic Era include the following
people. LI Xiaoyuan was the founder and dean of the department of library science at the
University of Nanking in 1927. Hong Youfeng was the university librarian at the
University of Nanking Library. QIAN Yaxin was the honorary director of the Library
Society of China. All of these scholars were actively involved in writing and advocating
for children’s libraries.
Pioneer Youth Librarians
A 1934 graduate of the library school at the University of Nanking, WANG
Bainian became the librarian of the FPSBNU and joined the Library Association of China
in 1936 (Huang 2013, 97-102). As youth services librarian, he ensured that all of the

124	  

library furniture and equipment were customized to best suit children (Wang 1937, 11125). Additionally, he instituted specific criteria for selecting children’s books, and he
increased the library collection from a handful of books to over 4,000 volumes (Wang
1937, 111-25). He also adapted the He Yuan Chinese Books Decimal Classification to
classify children’s books and employed card catalogs (Wang 1937, 111-25). Also, he
adopted the open-shelf system, instructed children to read, conducted statistics on
children’s reading, provided various library programs, and opened communication with
publishing house as well as public libraries and academic institutions across the country
(Wang 1937, 247-70).
Moreover, as a youth services pioneer, Wang published the library introduction
brochure to advocate youth services, organized exhibits and contests to promote
children’s libraries, and submitted proposals on improving children’s libraries at the third
annual conference of the LAC in 1936. As a scholar, he published over 22 articles on
various issues including children’s library practice, children’s library management,
children’s books selection and classification, and children’s library history. After
“reading around 300 papers on children’s libraries,” he complied “The Bibliography of
Articles On Children’s Libraries” in 1937 (Wang 1942). Based on a thorough literature
review and visits to children’s libraries in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and
Wuxi, he wrote the book, History of Children’s Library in China in 1942, which was the
first historical work on the development of children’s libraries in the Republic Era (Wang
1942). A youth librarian as well as a scholar on library science, he was successful in
managing the library, enthusiastic in promoting library services to youth, and productive
in academic publishing.

125	  

3.7.2 Education For Librarianship
The need to train modern librarians emerged along with the modern library.
Before the advent of modern public libraries, libraries were established for the royal
family, officials, scholars and elites’ private use. Those who could gain access to the
libraries were intellectual people who knew how to use them. Therefore, there was no
need to train librarians. As SHEN Zurong, also known as Samuel T.Y. Seng in English,
the Father of Chinese Library Education noted, “throughout Chinese history there was no
idea of formal library training nor the library training as we understand it today” (Seng
1935, 59).
3.7.2.1 Library School
The first library school in China, Boone Library School, was founded in 1920 by
Mary Elizabeth Wood, an American missionary and librarian. At first, the Boone Library
School was ancillary to a department of Boone University, and admission required two
years of college (Seng 1935, 1-18). Each year, the school admitted around four to eleven
students (Seng 1935, 1-18). In 1929, the school became an independent institution and
was recognized by the government with college standing (Seng 1935, 1-18). The Ministry
of Education endorsed the diplomas that were issued (Seng 1935, 1-18). The curriculum
was designed to resemble the Library School of the New York Public Library and to suit
Chinese situations. The courses included Chinese bibliography, Chinese and English
reference works, Chinese and English book cataloguing and subject headings, Chinese
and English book classifications, Chinese and English book selection and book review,
library economy, history of libraries, library administration, library buildings, seminars
and practicum; all courses were taught in English except the Chinese-specific courses

126	  

(Wu 1929, 231-34; Boettcher 1989, 274). According to statistics, from 1920 to 1949, the
Boone Library School graduated 311 students, of them 128 received a university diploma,
125 received a college diploma, and 58 people received training certificates (School of
Information Management 2010). Consequently, it was called “cradle of modern Chinese
librarians.” Its graduates accounted for more than half of the senior professional
librarians in China at that time (Cheng 1990, 67).
Although the first library school in China was founded in 1920, the first courses
on library science were introduced by Harry Clemons at the University of Nanking in
1913 (Lin 1985, 371). Clemons, formerly a reference librarian and English teacher at
Princeton University, was then a professor of English and the director of the university
library at the University of Nanking. He brought the idea of western librarianship to
China and trained China’s first generation of professional librarians, such as HONG
Youfeng, LIU Guojun and LI Xiaoyuan (Ye and Xu 2002, 17-20). In 1927, the
Department of Library Science was founded at the University of Nanking. Its curriculum
was similar to the Boone Library School, which included reference work, bibliography,
cataloguing, classification, indexing, book selection, and history of libraries (Ye and Xu
2002, 18). The Department of Library Science graduates held important positions in
libraries across China. However, the department was discontinued after only a few years
(Lin 1985, 371).
Besides university and college level courses, library science courses were also
provided in traditional schools. In 1921, DU Dingyou founded the division of library
science at the Guangzhou Normal School and taught courses on reference work and
school library management (Cheng 2012). In 1922, at the first annual conference of the

127	  

CNAAE, the library education section was formed. As the first national library
association conference, the library education section recommended that traditional
schools all over the country should add a course on library science to their curriculum
(Seng 1935, 1-18).
3.7.2.2 Short-Term Programs
Another kind of library training was the short-term programs, such as
summer schools or vocational training. For instance, in 1922, DU Dingyou initiated the
Guangdong provincial librarians’ training program aimed to train schoolteachers. Of the
97 secondary schools in the Guangdong province, 44 schools sent their teachers to the
training program. Courses on book acquisition, cataloguing and classification, and library
management were provided as part of this program (Cheng 2012). In 1923, HONG
Youfeng, alumni of New York State Library School and director of National
Southeastern University Library, instructed the library science summer courses in the
university; 80 students enrolled in the four weeks summer courses (Ye and Xu 2002, 18).
Moreover, in 1925, the first nationwide librarians’ training program (The Summer School
of Library Association of China) opened at the University of Nanking. The nation’s most
prestigious library science scholars, such as YUAN Tongli, LIU Guojun, DU Dingyou,
HONG Youfeng, and LI Xiaoyuan were invited to teach courses on library economy,
library administration, classification and others (LAC 1925, 3). These kinds of programs
were productive in training entry-level library staff.

128	  

3.7.2.3 Study Abroad
A productive, but admittedly privileged, way of library training was to study
abroad. The first Chinese student to study abroad in an American library school was
SHEN Zurong (1883-1976). He graduated from the Boone College in 1910, and he
worked as an assistant librarian to Mary Elizabeth Wood at the Boone University. He was
funded through a scholarship from the Chinese government, which made it financially
feasible for him to attend the Library School of the New York Public Library from 1914
to 1916 (Cheng 1990, 54-58). He received his diploma from the Library School of the
New York Public Library in 1915 and a Bachelor of Science degree from Columbia
University one year later (Plummer 1916, 489-90). When he returned to China in 1917,
another Boone graduate, HU Qingsheng (1895-1968), known as Thomas C.S.Hu in
English, was sent to the Library School of the New York Public Library for library
training (Boettcher 1989, 274). DAI Zhiqian (1888-1963), known as Tse-Chien Tai in
English, was the librarian of Tsing Hua College. He also joined the class of 1918 at the
Library School of the New York Public Library (NYSL 1933, 145). A few years later, he
attended the State University of Iowa for a doctoral program and in 1925 completed his
doctoral dissertation on library education. His dissertation, “Professional Education for
Librarianship: A Proposal for a Library School at the University of Iowa,” was later
published by H.W.Wilson and frequently cited (Tai 1925).
Around the same time, DU Dingyou was sponsored to study library science at the
University of the Philippines and was honored there for a Bachelor of Science degree in
Library Science in 1920. In 1919, HONG Youfeng (1893-1963), also known as Yu-Feng
Hung, a University of Nanking graduate and the acting librarian of the university library

129	  

then, enrolled in the New York State Library School as a senior student and was granted
a bachelor of library science degree in 1921 (NYSL 1921, 9-11). Meanwhile, he worked
as a temporary cataloger for the Chinese collection at the Library of Congress in the
summer of 1920 (NYSL 1921, 9-11). The other two University of Nanking alumni, LIU
Guojun and LI Xiaoyuan, also advanced their study in the United States. Liu
accomplished his master’s and doctoral program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
(1922 to 1925). Li attended the New York State Library School in 1921 and received a
bachelor of library science degree in 1923 (NYSL 1923, 7-10). Li was not the only
Chinese student in the class of 1923 of New York State Library School. Indeed, his
classmate, YUAN Tongli, known as Tung-Li Yuan, graduated from the National
University of Peking, and was also a librarian at Tsing Hua College, was granted a
bachelor of library science degree in 1924 (NYSL 1924, 12). Li and Yuan also shared a
similar experience working as a cataloger of Chinese collections in the Library of
Congress during the summer break (NYSL 1923, 7-17).
Upon their return to China, these American-trained librarians became
indispensable role models for promoting modern librarianship, founding library schools,
and teaching library science courses. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all of the first generation
study-abroad Chinese librarians were also progressive leaders of the Modern Library
Movement.
3.7.2.4 Youth Librarian Training
The professional training of librarians was insufficient in Republican China;
however, the training of youth librarians was nearly nonexistent. There were only a
handful of traditional schools that offered courses on reference work and school library

130	  

work for the training of future teachers. For instance, DU Dingyou founded the division
of library science in the Guangzhou Normal School in 1921 and taught courses on
reference work and school library management with the aim of preparing future school
teachers for the skills of guiding children’s reading (Cheng 2012). Occasionally, some
short-termed vocational programs provided courses on youth services. For example, in
1920, the Beijing Normal University held a summer library training program and invited
SHEN Zurong and DAI Zhiqian to lecture on the issues of library administration,
cataloging and classification of academic libraries, public libraries and children’s
libraries (BNU 1982, 355-56). In 1924, DU Dingyou instructed library-training courses
on primary school library management at the Henan Primary School Teacher Workshop
(Tu 1996, 131). In 1925, two courses on youth services were offered at the summer
school for the Library Association of China, held at the University of Nanking (LAC
1925, 3). LI Xiaoyuan and LIU Guojun co-instructed a course on the children’s library,
and DU Dingyou taught a course on the school library (LAC 1925, 3). Each course
session lasted two hours per week (LAC 1925, 3).
Despite evidence as to the existence of library training programs in the Republic
Era, library education in China was relatively underdeveloped. The highest government
agency that oversaw the development of library in China, the Ministry of Education, did
not attempt to institute national policy for the professional education of librarianship or
establish a curriculum on library science in government-funded national universities or
colleges. The Library Association of China failed to plan a suitable professional library
training system or professional qualifications for librarians. The short-life of some
universities and institutions that provided library programs made once ambitious

131	  

endeavors fruitless. The competitive requirements for library school admission26 and the
demanding course load for students27 made the Boone Library School the only steady
library school in China, which never succeeded in attracting a large number of students.
Further, most of its graduates filled positions in academic libraries instead of public
libraries. Compared to the growing number of modern libraries, the number of
professionally trained librarians was insufficient. The majority of library staff during the
early period worked without qualifications or training. An unstable political environment,
a lack of government support, a lack of professional qualifications, and a shortage of
library education programs, contributed to the inadequacy of library education in the
Republican China. Again, it did not adequately foster youth services education and
training for youth librarians.

3.7.3 Discussion of the Requirement and Responsibility of Children’s Librarians
Although education for youth librarianship was scarce and children’s librarians
were a rare find in public children’s libraries, discussions existed about the competencies
of children’s librarians. For example, the Library Science Quarterly dedicated one issue
to the discussion of children’s libraries in 1936. LENG Shuyuan’s “The Training of
Children’s Library Workers and Their Duties” was among the seven articles published in
this Children’s Library Number. Other library scholars such as DU Dingyou and library
science educators such as ZENG Xianwen also took part in the discussions. The ideal
children’s librarians were expected to be responsible for managing children’s libraries,

promoting library services, instructing and encouraging children to read, improving
children’s morality, and cultivating future nationals (Du 1926; Leng 1936). The
responsibility of cultivating noble nationals demanding, it also demonstrated society’s
belief in the importance of children’s librarians.
The expected competencies for librarians serving children usually included three
parts: knowledge of children, teaching skills, and library skills. Specifically, children’s
librarians should be able to understand the psychology and needs of children, have
knowledge of children’s literature, guide children to read, promote library services to
children, and manage children’s libraries (Du 1926; Zeng 1929). In addition to the
requirement of general and professional knowledge, the personality, virtues, manners,
and temperament of children’s librarians were also emphasized. A woman with manners,
a mild temperament, friendly attitude, and pleasing appearance was depicted as the most
suitable candidate to be a children’s librarian (Du 1926; Zeng 1929; Leng 1936).
To become a competent children’s librarian, professional education was desirable.
Leng suggested that children’s librarians should receive both library training and teacher
education (Leng 1936, 83-89). For library training, children’s librarians should acquire
the knowledge of library history, library law and regulation, library planning, children’s
library administration and management, children’s collection selection, cataloging,
classification and indexing (Leng 1936, 83-89). For teacher education, children’s
librarians should study children’s psychology, education psychology, and education
principles (Leng 1936, 83-89). Significantly, neither literature nor children’s literature
were listed as part of the education program.
In the first decades of the twentieth century, the innovative leaders of the public

133	  

library movement were advocating for children’s libraries. The discussions and diffusion
of youth librarianship were ongoing, and the few children’s librarians were dedicated to
their work. However, the youth librarianship education and training were still inadequate,
and the youth services librarians were lacking in number.
Youth services evolved into a viable part of modern public library services in
the Republic Era. This occurred through the advocacy of the library association and the
support of favorable library policy. It also involved the provision of separate children’s
rooms, attention to children’s reading and children’s literature, the advent of separate
children’s literature collections, the progress of youth services programs, and the
contributions of pioneer librarians. This is demonstrated in the next chapter through
examples of children’s libraries.

134	  

Chapter 4: Children’s Libraries in the Republic Era: Four Libraries
To illustrate the development of the children’s reading room at public libraries
and school libraries, independent children’s libraries, as well as youth services provided
during the early twentieth century, the author analyzes four libraries in the following
parts. The four libraries included: 1) The Capital Library of China: one of the
predecessors of the Capital Library of China is the Capital Popular Library, where the
first children’s reading room in the capital city was founded in 1914; 2) The Tianjin
Children’s Library: the Tianjin Children’s Library was established by the Tianjin Social
Education Bureau in 1917 and was the first independent children’s library; 3) The
Library of the First Primary School of Beijing Normal University,28 the school library
was a model library in the 1930s; 4) The Shanghai Children’s Library,29 established in
1941, the Shanghai Children’s Library was one of the largest children’s libraries during
the Republic Era.

4.1 The Capital Library of China
The first children’s reading room in the capital city Beijing was founded in 1914

Although the Library of the First Primary School of Beijing Normal University was a school library, it
was named “Shi da yi xiao er tong tu shu guan (the children’s library of FPSBNU),” and the librarian
WANG Bainian managed it as a regular children’s library instead of a school library. According to Ruth A
Hill’s observation, “‘reading for pleasure’ is the motto of this library…though the children are contacted
through the school, the use of the library is primarily recreational.” Additionally, the library was so
renowned in the 1930s that every week it hosted a couple of visitors who were interested in youth services
librarianship. The librarian introduced every detail of the library to the visitors. In this way, it served as a
role model for other children’s libraries across the country. For this reason, the author included this library
in this section.
29
The author was always wondering: if there was no Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) and Civil War (19451949), what would be the progress of children’s libraries in the Republic Era? The Shanghai Children’s
Library was opened in 1941 and was among the few children’s libraries to remain open during wartime.
Therefore, the author included this library to glimpse the possible development of children’s libraries.

135	  

in the Capital Popular Library, which was one of the predecessors of the Capital Library
of China. After the revolution of 1911, the mass transformation of the old book repository
to the modern public library took place. During a time when society began to emphasize
and propose the idea of popular education, the popular libraries came into being. In 1913,
the Ministry of Education allocated 2,400 yuan, rented a 315m2 (around 3390 square feet)
residential property with 21 rooms and collected over 10,000 volumes of popular
literature for the preparation of a popular library in the capital city of Beijing (Beijing
1994, 3 & 324). The Capital Popular Library was the first popular library in China, and
its aim was to serve as a role model for the other popular libraries that followed. On 21
October 1913, the Capital Popular Library opened to the public. In 1914, the Capital
Popular Library rented another 180m2 (around 1938 square feet) residential property with
12 rooms and a spacious yard to construct a children’s reading room and playground
(Beijing 1994, 3). It had four major characteristics that made it popular: most of the
collections of popular library were popular materials written in vernacular with easy to
understand contents, such as drama and fiction; besides general reading rooms, the
popular library established a children’s reading room as well as a playground;30 the
library’s targeted clients were the general public and children; reading was available at no
charge. Given these characteristics, this library was one of the most visited libraries in
China. As a library with only eight staff members, 20,000 volumes of books, 495m2
(around 5328 square feet), and 100 seats, it was very much welcomed by general readers

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
30

Having various facilities for public activities is a unique character of the popular library. It was stated in
the 1915 “Ministry of Education Popular Library Regulation” that popular library should include a public
stadium, in practice, popular libraries conceived of various ways to achieve that goal.

136	  

(Beijing 1994, 309-37). The daily number of visitors in 1914 reached 620 and increased
to 895 in 1919 (Beijing 1994, 3).
Since its inception, the Capital Popular Library recognized children as their
primary clients and strived to provide quality services for them. The library staff realized
that serving children was more challenging than serving adult readers. Adult readers
generally followed the library’s reading rules regarding behavior, such as reading quietly
and being respectful of the library’s materials and equipment. Children, however, were
often too young to be regulated by the same standards and rules. They tended to fetch
several books at a time, share a book together, sitting wherever they wanted to, place
books upside down, speak and laugh loudly in public. The space seemed more like a
public market to them than a library (Jingshi 1918, 38-40). The librarians concluded that
too many restrictions on children’s behavior would preclude them from reading, but too
much indulgence would result in misbehavior. While respecting children’s behavior in
most aspects, the librarians also emphasized some guidelines for children to follow, such
as lining up to request books, sitting quiet while reading, and placing books in order
(Jingshi 1918, 38-40). All of this effort to provide guidelines produced positive results.
The Capital Popular Library’s children’s collection in 1914 was divided into four
categories. These included the following: textbook; fairy tale; picture book; fiction and
magazine (Zhuang 1914, 18-20). In 1916, with an increase in the number of volumes in
the collection, children’s books were further divided into 10 categories. These included
the following: Chinese classics; history and geography; science; calligraphy; handcraft,
music, and gymnastics; fairy tale; series and magazine; fiction and biography; textbook
and stories about famous people; picture book; and photography of attractions (Beijing

137	  

1994, 88). Of the books checked, young readers’ top choices were the picture books and
fairy tales, seconded by collected works, and primary school textbooks were ranked
number three (Jingshi 1917, 75-76). For the convenience of children to find books, the
names of children’s books were mimeographed and pasted on 24 wooden boards and
displayed in the hallway (Jingshi 1919, 33-37).
In addition to providing books for reading, the Capital Popular Library also set up
a playground for adults to exercise and for children to play. According to ZHUANG Yu’s
visiting diary, the playground had swings, bars, beams and other facilities, and there was
a room for storing sports equipment and accessories. As well as checking out books,
readers could also check out sports equipment. On average, there were approximately 30
readers checking out the equipment every day, most of them were children (Zhuang 1914,
18-20).
The Capital Popular Library’s resolution to provide services to children resulted
in high volumes of young visitors. According to the Capital Popular Library’s annual
report,31 from 1916 to 1918, children accounted for the largest part of the library’s users,
as shown in Table 4.1 (compiled from Beijing 1994, 127-30 & 317).

The Capital Popular Library used voucher system for administration purpose. There were three kinds of
vouchers: General Voucher, Children’s Voucher, Newspaper and Magazine Voucher. Readers got free
vouchers for reading. The statistics from annual report were based on the calculation of vouchers.

138	  

From 1919 to 1926, the Capital Popular Library remained open six days a week
and 11 hours per day, with reduced hours in summer (Beijing 1994, 130).32 It was the free
library that had the longest open time, and the highest number of readers among all public
libraries at that time (Beijing 1994, 131). It served as a model for other provinces’
libraries to follow.
Another public library in Beijing that provided services to children was the
Central Park Reading Place, a predecessor to the Capital Library of China. The Central
Park Reading Place opened to the public on 21 August 1917 (Beijing 1994, 131). It had
three reading rooms: one room was for book reading, one room was for newspaper and
magazine reading, and the third room was the children’s reading room (Beijing 1994,
131). At the very beginning, like the Capital Popular Library, it adopted two catalogs, one
was a general book catalog, and the other was a children’s books catalog (Zhong 1919,
10-19).
Although the Central Park Reading Place did not have a playground, it found
other ways to attract young readers. Toys, such as blocks, dolls, stuffed animals, and
miniatures were collected by the library and placed in two custom-made five-level
wooden shelves (Zhong 1982, 277-81). The shelves were located at the east end of the
reading room, and the area was surrounded by wooden fence (Zhong 1982, 277-81). The
librarians began to consider the function of toys and their association with children’s
psychological development and knowledge building.
In 1927, the Capital Library and Capital Popular Library merged and renamed

The library remained open for 10 hours a day from July to September.

139	  

as the Beiping33 First Library. The Central Park Reading Place was renamed as the
Beiping Second Library, and then became the Beiping Central Library (Beijing 1994,
338). The Beiping First Library continued to consider youth services as one of the most
important aspects of its readers’ services. Children welcomed the merger of the libraries.
In 1930, the capacity of the library’s children’s reading room was 30 to 40 seats.
However, it was not rare to see that 50 to 60 children shared the room at the same time
(Beijing 1994, 133). Daily children visitors reached 400-500 in 1934 (Beiping 1934, 1617). To better accommodate more children, the library established a new children’s
reading room, updated the desks and chairs, and expanded the children’s room’s capacity
to 60 seats in 1936, which accounted for nearly one third of the total 204 seats in the
library (Beijing 1994, 135).
The Beiping First Library’s curator LI Wenyi (in office from July 1935 to
September 1942) played an indispensable role in providing youth services to the library.
Since he assumed office, he prioritized youth services, such as a children’s reading club
and reading advisory (Beijing 1994, 139). He emphasized and promoted youth services in
the library, and he also advocated library services for youth in the public sphere and
published several articles and books on the topic of youth services.
To cultivate children’s reading interests, promote their reading abilities and guide
them to read, the Beiping First Library organized a children’s reading club in 1936. The
library formed the children’s reading club regulations, enrolled members, organized
monthly tests, and awarded young readers (Beijing 1994, 139). One hundred fifty four
children between the ages of 7 and 16 enrolled during the first year (Beiping 1936, 28).
Each of them read at least one book a week, gathered several times a month to participate

The city of Beijing was called Beiping from 1928 to 1949, when the capital city of China was Nanjing.

140	  

in a reading contest, and discussed the book content or attended a seminar (Beiping 1936,
28). Children also frequented the Beiping Central Library. From October 1933 to June
1934, 10,006 children visited the library, of which 7,811 were boys and 2,195 were girls
(Beijing 1994, 142).
After the Sino-Japanese War, the Beiping First Library was renamed as the
Beiping Municipal Library, in 1945. The Beiping Central Library merged as a branch of
the Beiping Municipal Library (Beijing 1994, 339). In 1948, a substantial portion of the
building, collection, and staff from the Beiping Municipal Library Central Branch were
reassigned to form the new Beiping Children’s Library. With a collection of 12,000
volumes of children’s books, the Beiping Children’s Library opened on 10 October 1948
(Beijing 1994, 99). From the children’s reading room to an independent children’s library,
the public libraries of Beijing gave special attention to youth services from the very
beginning and served as role models for other regions’ public libraries to follow.

4.2 The Tianjin Children’s Library
The Tianjin Children’s Library was the first independent children’s library in
China. The Tianjin Social Education Bureau established it in 1917 (Zheng 1990, 10).
The library provided services to 8 to 12 year-old children who could write their own
names (Lin 1982, 382-84). Reading in the library was free of charge. Upon arrival,
children received a voucher and wrote their name, age, school name, and the book
number on the voucher; then, for the book, they handed the voucher to the staff (Lin
1982, 382-84). The library was unique in that it collected toys from all over the world,

141	  

and the librarians would display one or two toys during library open hours each day,
because the administrator believed that toys could cultivate children’s interest for leaning.
Tianjin Children’s Library was an innovative leader in promoting other
library programs. The library held youth service programs, such as book talk, game day,
and toy play once every month. It also held symposia and exhibits once or twice per year
(Zheng 1990, 10). Additionally, the library promoted educational development.
Since its establishment, the Tianjin Children’s Library effected the promotion of
children’s reading and learning interests, building connections with schools, and
providing guidance for publishers and toy makers.

4.3 The Library of the First Primary School of Beijing Normal University
Founded in 1902 with the philosophy of “A university stands on teacher
education” (Beijing Normal University 2010), the Beijing Normal University was the first
university in China aimed at training teachers. The First Primary School was an
experimental primary school for students from the Beijing Normal University; therefore,
it was a benchmark primary school for the country. Each part of the primary school
strived to be well equipped in order to serve as a model for schools across the country to
follow, including the school library. The school library opened on 3 November 1934 and
served as a model library ever since (Wang 1937, 112).
The library was equipped with specially-designed bookshelves, magazine racks,
reading tables and chairs for children. For example, there were two sets of reading tables
and chairs; the lower and smaller sets were for younger children and the higher and larger
sets were for older children (Wang 1937, 113-14). Small as the school library was, it had

142	  

all of the equipment that a library needed. It was clean, ventilated, lighted, and decorated
with seasonal flowers to cultivate children’s interests (Wang 1937, 114). The school
librarian adhered to the rules that the library should be designed and decorated to suit
children’s needs, to match the school’s environment, to meet its budget, and facilitate
management (Wang 1937, 114).
Also, the library adopted certain rules for children’s book acquisition. As regards
the book type, high graders’ books should be mainly words, middle graders’ books
should combine words and pictures, low graders’ books should focus on pictures with
bigger words, and kindergarteners’ books should contain colorful pictures (Wang 1937,
115). With regard to the content, the books should be practical, anti-superstition, promote
science, empower children’s noble ideas, teach common sense, include literature of
quality, and offer history lessons (Wang 1937, 115). With regard to outlook, the
librarians were attentive to the form, printing, binding, and paper quality of the book
(Wang 1937, 115). Although the librarians were mainly responsible for acquiring
materials, the teachers of the school could also suggest a purchase for the library.
Librarians distributed book suggestion forms to teachers at the beginning of every
semester and made necessary purchases during the semester (Wang 1937, 116). Until
1937, the library had a children’s collection of 2,317 titles and 4,841 volumes that met
the above rules and the number continued to increase (Wang 1937, 118). As shown by
Table 4.2, children’s book series and children’s literature accounted for the largest part of
the library’s collection (Wang 1937, 118).

Given the fact that most of the students who graduated from the primary school
would go to the affiliated middle school and potentially the Normal University, the
librarians adopted the same classification system as the Normal School: the He Yuan
Chinese Books Decimal Classification (Wang 1937, 119).34 The library also made title
catalog cards and classified catalog cards to assist students with finding books (Wang
1937, 124). This library was among the few libraries that used open access stacks. All of
the library collections were placed on bookshelves surrounding the reading room, and
students were encouraged to find books by themselves.
The library was open to students for voluntary reading twice everyday. To
accommodate students’ reading needs, readers were divided into two groups: high
graders and middle graders. Each group had its own reading time (Wang 1937, 247).
During lunch break, from 12:10 PM to 1:50 PM Monday to Saturday, both groups could

The He Yuan Chinese Books Decimal Classification was created by Rizhang He and Yongjin Yuan in
1933. It was based on Dewey Decimal Classification and was adapted to classify Chinese books. This
classification system is still used by some university libraries in Taiwan. The system includes 10 classes: 0
General Works, 1 Philosophy, 3 Religion, 4 Social Science, 5 Language, 6 Science, 7 Applied Science, 8
Art, 9 Literature, 10 History and Geography.

read in the library; during the afternoon break Monday to Friday, the library was opened
3:10 PM to 3:40 PM for middle graders only, and 3:40 PM to 4:10 for high graders only
(Wang 1937, 247).
To promote and advocate children’s reading, the school library counted library
visits by individual and by class. The number was calculated every week, and the school
principal would announce the result every Monday (Wang 1937, 248-53). The library
visitation sheet was also displayed as a billboard. Additionally, the library used various
sheets and statistics to reflect and manage students’ reading progress. For example, the
library calculated students’ library visits by week, marked students with over 100 visits,
compared middle graders and high graders’ reading interests, and collected students’
reading reports (Wang 1937, 248-53). Below are two examples of the various sheets that
the library created. Figure 4.1 is the library weekly reading statistics sheet. Figure 4.2 is
the middle-graders with over 40 visits in a five-weeks sheet. The author translated Figure
4.1 to English, as shown in Table 4.3.

In addition to reading in the library, students could check out books to read
elsewhere. There were 400 to 500 books checked out every week (Wang 1937, 258).
Although the librarians promoted science, history and geography books, the students
often preferred children’s literature books. According to the circulation statistics, in the
spring of 1936, 7,310 books were checked out, 973 of them were children’s literature
books (Wang 1937, 259). The following figure shows the statistics of checked-out books
by class (1936 spring), and the author translated it to English in Table 4.4.

The school library made library training and library education a priority because it
believed that if students could not pursue higher education after graduation, they could
still use the set of skills they had in order to study at public libraries and to make
educational progress (Wang 1937, 258). Therefore, the librarians taught students how to
find, retrieve and use a book, and they also educated students about how to act and
behave in public places (Wang 1937, 260).
Furthermore, the school library held various programs year-round. It held new
book exhibits, science book exhibits, music book exhibits, script exhibits, and hero
biography exhibits to cultivate students’ reading interests or to assist in students’ ongoing
projects (Wang 1937, 265). The library also held special events to promote library
services. Take the “Build a Plane” program, for example, the students were asked to build
149	  

a plane by themselves, and the winning planes would be displayed in the library (Wang
1937, 269-69). The librarians listed 23 relevant books as reference books and encouraged
students to turn to those books for help (Wang 1937, 268-69).
The Library of the FPSBNU established a model for other children’s libraries to
follow in almost all aspects: library building and environment, acquisition and collection
building, cataloging and classification, reading promoting and circulation, reader
education and programming. The success of the library was attributed to the hard work of
librarian WANG Bainian and the support of the school principal. A 1934 graduate of the
library school at the University of Nanking, he worked as a local primary school principal
and then moved to Beijing and started his work as head librarian of the Library of
FPSBNU (Huang 2013, 97-102). He was dedicated to the course of library youth services,
as discussed before. The library would be less successful had the librarian not put so
much effort toward improving it.

4.4 The Shanghai Children’s Library
Established in 1941, the Shanghai Children’s Library was one of the largest
children’s libraries in the Republic Era. In celebration of the 1940’s Children’s Day, 11
organizations jointly proposed to found the Shanghai Children’s Library (Shanghai 1940,
15). These organizations included the following: China Salesian Society Shanghai Office,
Shanghai Child Protection Bureau, Shanghai Parents’ Education Research Board,
Shanghai Children’s Hospital, China Women and Children Relief Association and
Chinese Medical Association (Shanghai 1940, 15). On 28 September 1940, the

150	  

Organizing Committee for the Shanghai Children’s Library was established (Shanghai
1941, 3).
From 21 March 1941 to 5 April 1941, the Organizing Committee for the Shanghai
Children’s Library initiated a fundraising campaign and received generous donations
from individuals and organizations that were local, domestic and abroad (Shanghai 1941,
4). The Shanghai Children’s Library opened on 12 July 1941. It remained open
every day from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, except Tuesdays (Shanghai 1941, 10). The library
held a collection of over 10,000 books, divided into high grades, middle grades, and low
grades (Shanghai 1941, 10). Those books were further classified by genre and marked by
different color for the use of children (Shanghai 1941, 10).
The library was located in the downtown area of Shanghai and covered an area of
more than 3,000 square feet (Shanghai 1998). Its main building was a Western style. The
library had small, open bookshelves for children. The walls were decorated with pictures
of celebrities, from domestic to abroad, such as Confucius, YUE Fei, SUN Yat-Sen, Isaac
Newton, Thomas Edison, and Abraham Lincoln (Shanghai 1941, 10). The librarian’s
speech at the ceremony described how the Shanghai Children’s Library’s main mission
was to serve the city children’s needs, to provide quality children’s books and to guide
children’s reading (Hu 1941, 1). To serve more children, the Shanghai Children’s Library
set up 30 circulation stations across the city where children could check out books for
free using a library card (Shanghai 1941, 11). The circulation stations were located in
organizations, groups, associations, or shops, and run by volunteers. Each station was
stocked with books provided by the library, and the books rotated every ten days
(Shanghai 1941, 11).

4.5 The Developmental Models
The process of developing children’s library in China started with children’s
rooms. In conjunction with the growing interest towards children’s reading and books,
there appeared separate children’s literature collection and youth services programs that
connected children with texts as well as a few pioneer youth services librarians. The
discussion of children’s libraries above demonstrates these developmental models. As
Ruth A. Hill, the American youth services librarian who visited China in 1937, stated in
her writing on children’s libraries in China, these early children’s libraries “demonstrate
most encouragingly that China can have, and no doubt soon will have, general library
service for children.” (Hill 1937, 157)
The Capital Popular Library children’s reading room, Central Park Reading Place
children’s reading room, and Tianjin Children’s Library emerged in the 1910s, at a time
when society began to emphasize and propose the idea of popular education. Under the
influence of the “The Ministry of Education Popular Library Regulation”, popular
libraries developed across the country and extended their services to less-educated
populations, including children. As the first children’s libraries in China, these early
children’s reading areas were comprised of a makeshift room or two that were
apportioned from rented residential properties, without specially designed children’s
space. Although the collections for these early children’s libraries were limited in
quantity and variety, and the youth services programs that they provided were premature,
these children’s libraries were welcomed by young readers from the beginning.
With the development of modern libraries and the evolvement of youth

152	  

services techniques in the 1930s, the Beiping First Library expanded its children’s
departments. This included a specially designed and arranged children’s reading room,
and it provided regular programs, such as a children’s reading club that attracted
hundreds of young readers. Meanwhile, the newly established library of FPSBNU
integrated children’s needs into every aspect of library services – from library design and
arrangement, acquisition and collection building, cataloging and classification, reading
promoting and circulation, to reader education and programming. Under the
administration of the professional youth service librarian, the library served as a model
for other children’s libraries to follow in almost all aspects. Youth services in the
Republic Era reached a pinnacle when the Shanghai Children’s Library was opened in the
1940s, with a specially-formed organizing committee, a spacious and inviting library
space, a large children’s literature collection of over 10,000 volumes and a team of
professional librarians. The Shanghai Children’s Library was dedicated to serving the city
children’s needs, providing quality children’s books and guiding children’s reading.
The above mentioned representative children’s libraries illustrates the
development of the children’s reading room at public libraries and school libraries,
independent children’s libraries, as well as youth services that were provided during the
early twentieth century. The development of these libraries also demonstrates the
developmental models that were established in the previous chapters.

Chapter 5: Conclusion
This part concludes the research findings, chronicling the development of
children’s libraries in China from 1912-1937. It summarizes the major elements that
contributed to the progress of youth services in China and identifies external and internal
factors that influenced this development. The author reflects upon the contributions of
this study as well as the limitations of it. Suggestions for future research are included
with the intention of continuing this study of the history of youth services librarianship.

5.1 Research Findings
Since 1909, librarians began to address the needs of children in professional
settings by introducing Western youth service models and discussing how to establish,
organize, and operate children’s library in China. The first children’s reading rooms were
founded in public libraries in late 1910s. Programs, such as story time, exhibits, and
readers clubs took place in these libraries periodically. Motivated by the New Culture
Movement of 1917, modern children’s literature – non-didactic texts written in an easily
accessible vernacular language – began to flourish in China. The foundation of the
Library Association of China in 1925 and the Resolution of 1933, stipulating that every
library should have a children’s reading room, further advocated and formalized youth
services. From theoretical discussions to policy support, Chinese children’s libraries
showed a steady development in the Republic Era.

154	  

5.1.1 Development of Children’s Libraries in the Republic Era
Four phases may be identified from the development of children’s libraries in the
Republic Era. These include advocating for children’s libraries (1909-1914), the
emergence of early children’s libraries (1914-1925), the development of children’s
libraries (1925-1933), and the flourishing of children’s libraries and youth services
(1933-1937).
5.1.1.1 The Advocate of Children’s Libraries (1909-1914)
In 1909, CAI Wensen’s publication and first work on the subject of children’s
libraries in China, “Ways to Establish Children’s Libraries,” which appeared in the first
volume of the Educational Review, marked the beginning of a century’s long history of
advocating for children’s libraries and youth services librarianship in China. Since then,
scholars, educators, and librarians began the dialogue of youth services librarianship in
professional settings by introducing Western youth service models and discussing how to
establish, organize, and operate children’s library in China. Although there were no
children’s libraries at that time in China, these works introduced the model for children’s
libraries and disseminated the idea of youth services to the public, thus preparing public
opinion for their arrival.
5.1.1.2 The Emergence of Early Children’s Libraries (1914-1925)
In 1914, one of the first children’s reading rooms was founded in the Capital
Popular Library in Beijing. Although some of the early public libraries, such as the
Hunan Provincial Library, admitted young readers over age twelve to the libraries since
1905, there were no special services or collections provided for children (Li and Zhang
1985, 152-158). Children either shared the same reading room and/or the same reading

155	  

materials with adult readers. Notably, the children’s reading room in the Capital Popular
Library was the first reading room to be set apart from the adult’s reading room, and it
was equipped with age appropriate collections for young children. The Capital Popular
Library was also among the first libraries to provide youth services to children. In 1917,
the first independent children’s library was established in Tianjin by the Tianjin social
Education Bureau (Zheng 1990, 9-12). In addition to providing reading materials for
children, the library initiated youth services programs, such as book talk, game day, toy
play, and exhibit, to attract young readers (Zheng 1990, 10). A handful of other early
children’s libraries also emerged in the period between 1914 and 1925, such as children’s
reading rooms in the Beijing Central Park Reading Place, Jiangxi Provincial Library and
Zhejiang Public Library (Beijing 1994; Jiangxi 1982; Zhejiang 1918).
Although a separate space was allocated for children’s reading during this time,
the space was not different from an adult’s space. In other words, there was no special
design for young readers. The collections for these early children’s libraries combined
Confucian classics, textbooks, popular reading materials, as well as children’s periodicals
and books. Some youth services programs, such as book talk and exhibits, were
occasionally provided in these children’s libraries by library staff (instead of youth
services librarians). Due to the lack of professional associations and overall guidance, the
emergence of these early children’s libraries during this period was spontaneous, and the
services provided were premature.
5.1.1.3 The Development of Children’s Libraries (1925-1933)
The founding of the Library Association of China in 1925 launched a nationwide
advocacy and promotion of youth service. It started a period of rapid development for

156	  

children’s libraries. Independent children’s libraries, children’s departments in public
libraries, and children’s reading rooms emerged across the country. For instance, the
Hangzhou Municipal Children’s Library was founded in 1931 with over 5,000 volumes
of children’s reading materials (Wang 1942, 40-45). The Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and
Guangdong provincial libraries and Nanjing, Beijing, Tianjin municipal libraries all
expanded their children’s departments (Wang 1942, 40-45). Popular libraries were also
actively involved in establishing children’s reading rooms and providing services to
young readers.
As an increasing number of libraries constructed their own library building,
discussions began as to how to plan and design children’s space. Children’s space
became more appealing and functional than early models that were stern and dull. The
collection size of most children’s libraries increased due to a growing number of
children’s periodicals and books published during this time. Meanwhile, educators and
librarians started to discuss general criteria for selecting children’s reading materials for
libraries and recommended bibliographies and booklists for children’s reading and
children’s library collections. With the advent of children’s spaces and the increasing
amount of children’s reading materials, children’s libraries began to advocate their
services and to develop multiple programs to promote reading and literacy. A wide range
of services and programs, such as reading guidance, readers’ club, storytelling, summer
reading, and themed competitions were designed and provided by children’s libraries.
Various media, including periodicals, bulletins, broadcasts, and flyers were utilized to
advertise these services. Some children’s libraries consolidated and standardized their
services by publishing library general rules and regulations. Training programs, including

157	  

courses on youth services librarianship, were occasionally provided during this period,
and discussions on the competencies for children’s librarians were on-going. Nonetheless,
most children’s libraries were still managed by persons with little or no educational
background on youth services librarianship.
5.1.1.4 The Flourishing of Children’s Libraries and Youth Services (1933-1937)
In the second annual conference of the LAC in 1933, a resolution was passed to
build independent children’s libraries in every city and county and to establish children’s
reading rooms in every library (LAC 1933, 54-55). The resolution was the most
influential library policy on children’s libraries to date. Local governments responded to
this resolution promptly, and they became actively involved in promoting children’s
libraries in their regions. By 1934, there were 93 independent children’s libraries in
China (Chiu 1935, 16). In 1936, according to surveys conducted by the Zhejiang Public
Library, of all the 34 provincial libraries then, 19 mentioned specifically that it had at
least one separate children’s reading room (Yan 1983, 63-100).
With the great increase in the number of children’s libraries, discussions about
children’s library design became more serious. There were specific guidelines on the
design of children’s libraries’ equipment, such as reading tables and chairs, as well as
bookshelves and the arrangement of them. Children’s space evolved to be more
functional, inviting, and inspiring. The publication of children’s literature also peaked in
this period with the increased quantity and increased variety of books. Librarians
developed more specific criteria for content, type, and format, for selecting children’s
materials. They tried to select appropriate materials to meet and cultivate children’s
reading interests. Moreover, children’s library collections expanded from a small number

158	  

of books in the 1910s to hundreds or thousands of titles, covering a wide variety of
classes in the 1930s. Diverse youth services programs were provided to better connect
children with texts. These included readers’ club, which had been formalized into regular
library services. However, the youth librarianship education and training were still
inadequate, and the youth services librarians were lacking in number.
Until the eve of the Sino-Japanese war in 1937, children’s space was widely
established in public libraries. Youth services became a viable part of public library
services, and children’s libraries developed to be an indispensable part of Chinese
modern libraries.

5.1.2 Factors Influencing the Development of Youth Services
Several factors emerged from the analysis of historical materials: the influences of
Western librarianship, the cultural movement and modern educational reform, the public
library movement, the Republic Era’s investment in child welfare, and the advocacy of
the Library Association of China. These factors converged historically and contributed to
the development and progress of youth services in the Republic Era.
External Factors
In the wave of Western Learning, the development of Chinese modern public
libraries in general and children’s libraries, in particular, was greatly influenced by
external forces, such as Japanese librarianship and American librarianship.
5.1.2.1 Japanese Influences
At the turn of the twentieth century, to seek advanced education and to strengthen

159	  

the nation’s power, the Qing government and prominent educators encouraged students to
study abroad. Due to the vicinity of the border, the similarity of the culture, and the
success of adapting western knowledge to its own education, Japan became the top
destination for students’ studying abroad and for government officials’ study visits. The
number of students studying in Japan increased from around 1,100 in 1904 to the peak of
12,000 in 1906; the number then decreased to 1,400 in 1912 (Zhang 2000, 71). It was
estimated that a total of over 38,000 students studied in the Japan until 1911 (Zhang
2000, 71). During the same period, the number of Chinese students studying in the
United States was around 300 (Fryer 1909, IX). Some of these students formed the major
force that translated Japanese library science books, introduced Japanese library models,
and advocated for modern librarianship.
In 1908, the Tokyo Hibiya Library established the first children’s library in Japan.
It held a sizable collection of children’s literature, such as picture books, fairy tales,
geography and history, and science (Ertong 1910, 15-16). In the next year, inspired by the
Hibiya Library’s youth services, CAI Wensen, an educator with the experience of
studying in Japan, published, “Ways to Establish Children’s Libraries,” which was the
first work of its kind to discuss the subject of children’s libraries in China (Cai 1909, 4950). In 1910, based on Tokyo Hibiya Library’s children’s collection, another essay was
published in the Educational Review discussing the issues of children’s literature and
children’s reading (Ertong 1910, 15-16).
In 1924, the Commercial Press published a translated work, Er Tong Tu Shu
Guan Zhi Yan Jiu (A Study of Children’s Library). Originally written in Japanese, this
work discussed in detail elements of children’s libraries, such as facilities and equipment,

160	  

youth service programs, children’s collection and classification, and library
administration. As the first monograph on the topic of children’s library published in
China, this work introduced the elements of a children’s library to the Chinese public and
provided theoretical guidelines for managing a children’s library. Among the handful of
works on the subject of children’s libraries in the early twentieth century, the introduction
of Japanese models, translation of Japanese works, and reflections of Japanese practice
accounted for a substantial part.
Although European and American children’s libraries were widely established
and fully developed at that time, in practice, it was difficult for nascent Chinese modern
libraries to emulate these models because the gap was overwhelming (Wang 1942, 16).
Therefore, SUN Yuxiu suggested that Chinese public libraries follow the Japanese model
by allocating a space in the library for children’s reading (Wang 1942, 16). Through the
introduction and dissemination of Japanese ideas by translation, the understanding and
transforming of Japanese practices by official visits and students studying in Japan, and
the implementation of Japanese models (by setting up children’s space), Japanese youth
services librarianship influenced the emergence of children’s libraries in China.
Later, as Chinese modern libraries developed further, a more modern and
advanced system of librarianship became necessary. Chinese library society came to
realize that Japanese librarianship was mainly borrowed from Western librarianship and
that Chinese libraries could benefit more by directly studying modern Western
librarianship. Moreover, without library school available until 1918, Japan could neither
disseminate library science to China systematically nor help train the much needed
professional librarians for Chinese libraries (Wu 2003, 4-8). Therefore, the influences of

161	  

Japanese librarianship on Chinese librarianship did not sustain. By the 1920s, American
librarianship gradually became the primary type of librarianship in China (Cheng 1991,
373; Lin 1998, 5).
5.1.2.2 American Influences
SHEN Zurong was the first Chinese librarian to receive advanced library
science training in the United States. He received his diploma and returned to China in
1917. Until 1924, seven other Chinese librarians went to the United States for advanced
library education. During that time, public libraries in the United States served more than
half of the nation’s population, provided extended user-oriented services, like the adult
reference service, reader’s advisory, and reading promotion. Meanwhile, American
public libraries established youth services on a department basis, extended it to branches,
developed reading guidance techniques, provided booklists, story hours and displays to
attract young readers. Additionally, a group of professional trained youth services
librarians established their work on the evaluation and selection of children’s literature.
Upon their return to China, these first generation study-abroad Chinese librarians became
the progressive leaders of the Chinese Modern Library Movement. Not only did they
bring American library science and technology to the emerging Chinese libraries, leading
the development of modern Chinese libraries, some of them, such as LIU Guojun, DU
Dingyou and LI Xiaoyuan, also strongly advocated children’s libraries and were actively
involved in writing or teaching the subject of library services to youth. These progressive
leaders of the Chinese Modern Library Movement exerted great influence on the
development of Chinese youth services librarianship.
Two prominent Americans also left their mark on the development of youth

162	  

services in China. Mary Elizabeth Wood, the American librarian and missionary, came to
China in 1899 and significantly influenced the development of the modern library
movement in thirty years. In 1910, she founded the Boone Public Library in Wuchang.
Following the practices of American public libraries, the Boone Public Library collected
large amount of modern books, adopted an open-shelf system, allowing free access, and
providing other services, such as lectures and story time (Cheng 1992, 377). This library
demonstrated American librarianship to Chinese librarians and set a model for a modern
public library for Chinese libraries.
In 1920, Wood established the Boone Library School, the first library school in
China. The library school designed its curriculum to resemble the American library
school and appointed American-educated library scholars as well as American librarians
as lecturers. For instance, two American librarians, Grace Darling Phillips and Ruth A.
Hill, successively taught courses, including children’s librarianship and library economy
from 1934 to 1937 (Tu 1996, 212). From 1920 to 1949, the school trained over 300
students, which accounted for more than half of the senior professional librarians in
China at that time. Further, Wood led a campaign for the return of the Boxer Indemnity
Fund and the usage of the fund to promote modern library development in China. The
fund returned by the U.S. government was used to establish modern libraries, support
librarians studying in the American library schools, and to fund scholarships and
professorships for the Boone Library School. Renowned as the “Queen of Modern
Library Movement in China” by Chinese librarians, Wood’s activities in China spread
American librarianship and promoted the development of modern Chinese librarianship.
The other American was Dr. Arthur E. Bostwick, then librarian of the St. Louis

163	  

Public Library. As an ALA official delegate, he visited more than fifty Chinese libraries
in 1925 and delivered public lectures on American librarianship and library practice such
as public support, free access, open-shelf, home use, and user-oriented services on many
occasions, which were accompanied by film (Cheng 1997, 371). In his report to the ALA
and LAC after his trips, he strongly recommended that Chinese libraries make their
collections “as useful and as freely accessible to the reading public as possible”
(Bostwick 1926, 45). His promotion of American library philosophy and practice was so
successful that “almost every librarian in China at that time wanted to emulate the
American way of operating libraries” (Cheng 1997, 371). Under Bostwick’s
recommendation, free access of library materials became the main objective for public
libraries over the next twenty years (Tu 1996, 380). In Du’s influential article, “Issues on
Children’s Libraries,” he quoted Bostiwick’s words – “we buy children book by tons in
U.S.” – to advocate free and open access of reading materials for children (Du 1926, 115). Through the recommendation of Bostwick and promotion of Du, an increased
number of Chinese children’s libraries gradually shifted from a closed-shelf system to an
open one and aimed to provide reading materials for young readers at no cost.
The influences of American’s youth services librarianship on Chinese youth
services librarianship was also reflected by Chinese scholar’s discussions and research on
children’s libraries. Among the early standards of children’s space allocation and
equipment design introduced by librarians in the 1920s and 1930s, most of the librarians,
such as LIU Guojun, ZENG Xianwen, and XU Jiabi, based their suggestions on the
existing practices of American children’s libraries. Of the works on children’s reading in
the 1930s, Chinese scholars introduced American peers’ studies of the relationship

164	  

between children’s reading interests and their age. For example, JIANG Licai, translated
American works related to ways for stimulating children’s reading interests (Jiang 1930,
1-37). Others compared their research results with American trends, such as XU Xilin’s
investigation and his reference to Gray and Munroe’s report on the reading interests and
habits of American children (Xu 1930, 20-53).
Meanwhile, inspired by American youth services librarians’ practice of
suggesting booklists for children’s reading, Du first introduced the idea of children’s
book selection to Chinese libraries. Then, he suggested the first selected bibliography of
children’s literature for Chinese children. This was followed by other bibliographies and
booklists that were suggested by librarians and educators in the 1930s (Du 1926; Du
1928). Other works on American youth services librarians’ training, introductions of
children’s library operation, and case studies of American’s children’s libraries were
continuously translated and introduced to Chinese libraries.
Through the advocacy of American-trained progressive leaders of the Chinese
Modern Library Movement, as well as Wood and Bostwick’s promotion of American
library philosophy, and prominent scholars’ dissemination of American youth services
techniques, the theories and practices of American youth services librarianship were
widely introduced to Chinese libraries. The American youth services librarianship
provided a much-needed model for emerging Chinese children’s libraries to follow and
influenced the development of youth services librarianship in China during the 1920s and
1930s.
5.1.2.3 Other International Influences
Except for a few articles introducing models of children’s libraries and practices

165	  

of youth services in England, France, Philippines, etc. (Qian 1929; Dan 1934; Yu 1935),
the influences of other country’s youth services librarianship on the development of
Chinese youth services in China were difficult to trace. It was fair to conclude that, of the
international youth services librarianship that were introduced to Chinese libraries in the
Republic Era, Japanese models were first introduced and influenced the emergence of
children’s libraries in China until the 1920s. Since then, American youth services
librarianship became the most influential librarianship to impact the development of
youth services librarianship in China.
5.1.2.4 Internal Factors
The development of children’s libraries in China in the Republic Era was
influenced by external factors, such as international youth services librarianship,
especially the American one, as well as a combination of factors from within.
The cultural movements and educational reforms in the Republic Era popularized
colloquial language, brought literacy to a large portion of the population, stimulated the
extensive publication of periodicals and books in colloquial language, promoted mass
education and established institutions for social education, thus facilitating the modern
public libraries and services available to children.
From the opening of the first public libraries in 1905 to the existence of over
2,000 libraries until the eve of the Sino-Japanese war, China’s modern libraries
developed at an unprecedented speed. The establishment of these modern public libraries
and the widespread spirit of the public librarianship established a foundation for the
development of youth services librarianship in China.

166	  

In Republican China, views of children and childhood became more complex.
Children were increasingly viewed holistically, having inner and outer lives, while
childhood came to be understood more as a crucial, discrete period, separate from
adulthood. The understanding of children and childhood, and the evolving discourse on
child psychology, child development prompted society’s attention to children’s welfare.
Various agencies and institutions were formed to ensure children’s health, protect their
rights, and promote their well-being, among which children’s libraries emerged as a
social-educational institution to offer child-centered education and services.
Under this tide, many great writers of the Republic Era became evolved in writing
native modern children’s literature for Chinese children. Publishing houses started to
produce large amounts of children’s periodicals and books in vernacular language.
Chinese children’s literature flourished in the 1930s with a steady growth in quantity and
variety. Modern children’s literature replaced the Confucian classics and adult popular
literature and comprised the collections of most children’s libraries.
The foundation of the Library Association of China in 1925, and the annual
conference of the association, provided policy support for the development of children’s
libraries. It offered a national forum for children’s libraries and library staff to exchange
ideas and experiences. Additionally, it organized library training and published research
journals to advocate library science and youth services librarianship.
To conclude, the genesis of youth services librarianship from 1912 to 1937 was
the result of a series of factors that attributed to the Republic Era’s social, cultural and
educational changes. The cultural movements and educational reforms brought literacy to
the general public and stimulated the needs of modern public libraries. The development

167	  

of modern public libraries directly led to the emergence of children’s libraries. Society’s
discovery of children and childhood provided a rationale for child-centered library
services to youth. The flourishing of indigenous children’s literature facilitated the
fostering of youth services, and the support of the Library Association of China further
promoted the development of youth services librarianship.

5.2 Significance of Research
Scholarship on the history of the modern Chinese libraries is largely concerned
with the development of youth services in public libraries in China since 1949. There is a
noticeable lack of literature that addresses the beginning of the modern public libraries in
China or the genesis of youth services in China. A minimal amount of specific research
exists that traces the development of youth services librarianship in modern public
libraries in China. Of the available scholarship, most focuses on the modern public
library movement, and youth services librarianship is given only minimal consideration.
Significantly, this research is the first endeavor to systematically study the genesis of
children’s libraries and youth services in China, and it writes the history of Chinese youth
services librarianship.
This research chronicles the development of children’s libraries in China from
1912-1937. It examines the major elements that contributed to the progress of youth
services in China and identifies external and internal factors that influenced this
development. Through the analysis of elements, including the support of the library
association and library policy, the appearance of separate children’s rooms, the advent of
separate children’s literature collections, the progress of youth services programs, and the

168	  

contributions of pioneer librarians, this research demonstrates encouragingly that China
had children’s libraries since the establishment of the Republic of China and that youth
services became a viable part of modern public library services since its inception.
Further, this research contributes to the study of the relationship between
American librarianship and Chinese librarianship. In her study of the history of youth
services librarianship in the U.S., Jenkins regarded American youth services librarianship
as a “classic success” and wondered, “Has the U.S. model been used in other countries?
If so, How? If not, what other models have been followed?” (Jenkins 2000, 129). This
work responds to these questions and analyzes the impact of American and international
librarianship on the development of youth services librarianship in China. It contributes
to the history of children’s libraries in China as well as to the history of youth services
librarianship in the United States.
Finally, this work contributes to the understanding of the Republic Era’s
investment in social, cultural, and educational discourses in relation to the development
of library services for youth in China. This research situates the genesis of youth services
in public libraries within the context of general, social, cultural, and educational changes
in the Republic Era. Chinese youth services emerged in an environment that extended the
services of modern public libraries and realized a fuller understanding of childhood. This
work offers an indispensable contribution to a burgeoning research focus on modern
educational and social development in the Republic Era. Specifically, it addresses how
the growth of children’s libraries was affected by educational, social, and cultural
conditions in the Republic Era and anticipates the development of youth services under
the current conditions in China.

169	  

Chinese public libraries today are increasingly attentive to youth services. The
National Library of China Children’s Library opened to children in May 2010. It marked
the end of no service to children in the National Library of China. It also initiated the
promotion of services for children in public libraries nationwide. Since 2012, the Library
Society of China launched the “Library Services to Children Improvement Plan” to
further the discourse of youth services librarianship and to advocate library services for
children (LSC 2012). When current trends are reviewed, the history should not be
forgotten, and the first question to ask is: How did youth services librarianship begin in
China? This doctoral dissertation is the first work on the genesis of children’s libraries in
China and endeavors to provide a compelling discovery and analysis of the growth and
the development of youth services in China from 1912 to 1937.

5.3 Limitations of This Study
Although the author attempted exhaustive examinations of archives and
published materials on the research subject, a series of upheavals hindered the discovery
of some primary and secondary sources and limited the kinds of work that could be
finished. First of all, although the official documents from the Library Association of
China would be a useful source for primary research, these documents are almost
impossible to trace because the Library Association of China no longer exists. The
Library Association of China was founded in June of 1925 and remained until 1949. The
Library Association of the Republic of China (Taiwan) founded in 1953 and the new
Library Society of China founded in 1979 are the two descendants of the Library
Association of China; however, according to the author’s correspondence with the two

170	  

organizations’ representatives, none of them hold official archives of the Library
Association of China. Secondly, many libraries were shut down, destroyed or forced to
move elsewhere during the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) and the Civil War (19451949). During those periods, part of the library collection was destroyed, and part of the
library collection was transferred and never returned. Moreover, the entirety of China’s
library system was disrupted on an “unprecedented scale” during the Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976). Libraries were undermined, librarians were exiled, and library collections
were carried off, robbed, or burned (Ting 1983, 134-60). These situations made it
impossible to acquire all of the primary resources that were once available.
The author also tried to examine archival materials from early children’s libraries.
However, most of the early children’s libraries were shut down during the Sino-Japanese
War (1937-1945) and the Civil War (1945-1949) and never reopened. For example, the
author supposed that the current Tianjin Children’s Library was the same children’s
library that was the first independent children’s library in China established in 1917.
After corresponding with the current Tianjin Children’s Library curator, it became
apparent that the current Tianjin Children’s Library was built in the 1970s and had only a
nominal connection with the old one. Of the four libraries that are still in existence today,
and that the author visited, the attempt to examine archival resources was not always as
productive as expected. Few systematical archives were kept in these libraries. Given the
situations of upheaval discussed above, it is possible that other libraries that the author
did not have a chance to visit did not keep value archives, either. However, if time and
budget allows, the author intends in the future to identify more Chinese children’s

171	  

libraries that are still in existence today or current libraries that are descendants of early
children’s libraries. The author would consult their archives, if there were any.
Although archival materials from early libraries might be limited, this research
could rely more on governmental archives as supplements. For instance, as one of the
national archives of China, the Second Historical Archives of China in Nanjing held a
large collection of official documents and original records of the central government
during the Republic Era. Provincial, city archives, and local chronicle offices may also
hold documents, records, and materials related to library development during the
Republic Era. Exploring these governmental archives may yield documents and materials
including central and local funding and policies towards libraries, which would provide
additional insight on how libraries in general and youth services in particular were shaped
from 1912 to 1937.
This study might be more complete if the author was able to use the oral history
method to recapture this part of history from those who have experienced children’s
libraries in the Republic Era first-hand. Though it is unlikely to locate any of the
progressive leaders of the modern public library movements or the librarians that worked
with children during the Republic Era on account of the extensive amount of time that
has passed, it is still possible to locate participants who were young library users at that
time and who had personal experience with the children’s libraries and library services
provided. Also this methodology carries limitations, such as biased, unreliable personal
memory and the limitations of personal experiences, if the participants’ stories were
analyzed properly, they could provide information about the Republic Era’s children’s

172	  

libraries that could not be found elsewhere in printed sources, thus adding detail to this
study.
Although the emergence and development of youth services in China reflected
external influences, these influences might be more complex than particularly American
or particularly Japanese influences. It was not easy to separate Japanese librarianship
from Western librarianship because part of Japanese librarianship was borrowed from
Western librarianship. In a similar way, it might be too early to eliminate the possibility
of other Western librarianship’s influences because of the modern globalization in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth century. It is hoped that a more complete analysis of
the external librarianship’s influences on the development of youth services in China will
be revealed in future study.

5.4 Suggestions for Further Research
This research initiated the study on the history of the genesis of youth services
librarianship in China and demonstrated the existence of library services to children since
the Republic Era. It also prompted questions that await answering: Why did specialized
children’s spaces appear before specialized children’s collections in China? Who
influenced the progress from admitting young readers to the allocation of children’s space
and the establishment of children’s libraries (Policy makers? Educators? Librarians?
Adult library users?) Librarians created evaluative standards and recommended book lists
since 1920s, but there were no book awards for children in the Republic Era. Why did
these standards and booklists not culminate with the advent of any book awards? Did
children’s library collections reflect these evolving standards? Why was there no formal

173	  

library education program for youth librarians in the Republic Era, or today? Who were
the key leaders, library educators, and librarians that prompted the genesis of library
services for youth in China? What was the role that they played in the development of
children’s libraries? Besides modern schools and children’s libraries, were there any
other types of child welfare institutions that developed during this period? What were the
connections among children’s libraries and these organization and agencies?
The other indispensable part of library services to youth is school libraries. They
had a longer history in China than public children’s libraries. The first kind of library
services available to youth in China was provided in school settings in the late Qing
dynasty and early Republic Era. This occurred when the emerging modern schools started
to adopt the students’ initiative teaching method and establish school libraries to assist
students’ self-learning. An initial examination of the primary sources indicated that
professional organizations and prominent library leaders strongly advocated library
services to youth in schools. It revealed that special courses on library science were
provided to normal school students with the hope of training future school librarians.
Also, school libraries existed in most primary and secondary schools in the Republic Era.
However, of the available scholarship, most focuses on the modern public library
movement and the academic library development, with school libraries given
approximately no consideration. If the history of library services to youth in public
settings received little attention from library scholars, then the history of library services
to youth in school settings received almost none. It is time to write the history of Chinese
school libraries. It is hoped that the study of history and progress of school library
services would empower people still developing school libraries in China to provide

174	  

wider access to a variety of materials and information, and to help more children succeed
in school.
Another area that is worth further study is the history of children’s libraries in
China from 1937-1949 and after 1949. Although it is generally agreed that library
services were interrupted, reduced, depressed, stopped and even retrograded during war
time: Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) and the Civil War (1945-1949), some children’s
libraries still thrived (or at least survived) through the war. The establishment of
Shanghai Children’s Library in 1941 is one example. However, was the case of Shanghai
Children’s Library only a unique one because of the special status of Shanghai?35 What
about children’s libraries in other parts of China?
After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the government paid
special attention to the development of modern libraries and Chinese libraries in general
made great progress after 1949. What is the history of Chinese youth services
librarianship since 1949? Were the youth services librarianship in the People’s Republic
of China inherited from the Republic Era or did children’s libraries emerge as completely
new ones? How was the progress of children’s libraries achieved in the People’s
Republic of China compared to the advances made by the general library development?
As the Chinese saying goes, “learn from history we can see the rise and fall.”

Shanghai was opened to foreign trade as a treaty port after the defeat of the First Opium War in 1942.
Since then, its territory was gradually divided as the International Settlement, French Concession, and
Chinese administered parts. Each part had a considerable degree of political autonomy. It grew to be the
Asian financial center in the 1930s. The Japanese occupied the Chinese administered parts and the
International Settlement after 1937. The Shanghai Children’s Library was located within the French
Concession.

175	  

The study of the history and progress of children’s libraries in China would provide
lessons for today’s development of youth services librarianship and continue to
encourage society’s attention to library services for children.

Appendix B: Comparison of Conditions in the United States and China during the
First Half of the Twentieth Century

Public
Libraries

China
• A transition period from
traditional book storage houses to
modern libraries.
• The first public libraries were
opened to public in 1904. In 1909,
the first law pertaining to the
establishment of public libraries
was promulgated. By 1916, most

2 Absence or infrequency of modern
books.
3 Restriction to use in the library

of American public libraries.
• In the late 19th century and
20th centuries, public library
services were expanded and
strengthened:
Branches were established, women
and children were recognized as
legitimate clientele for the library, the
concept of open stacks was generally
accepted, hours of services were
greatly increased, and the belief that
the library should provide
informational or reference service to
its patrons was widely endorsed.

By 1913, the U.S. Office of
Education reported that the
nation had 3,000 public
libraries and each contained
over 1,000 volumes.
In the 1920s, the focus of public
libraries shifted from
collections to readers and from
preservation to use; useroriented services, like the adult
reference service, reader’s
advisory, youth service and
reading promoting, all made
significant progress.
By 1923, 3873 towns with
populations over 1,000 opened
public libraries and thus served

Nanking made a significant effort
to promote the aims of public
libraries and consider the
recommendations of Dr.Bostwick.
By 1935, approximately 1,000
public libraries existed in China,
and these libraries offered a
colloquial style of popular
publications to appeal to
middlebrow readers.
During 1937-1949, most of the
public libraries were closed, and a
great number of collections (15
million volumes) were destroyed
or lost.
Boys and girls were treated as
little men and women; children
were representation for
maintaining family traditions of
the past.
Male children were preferred in
old China.
The nation’s attitude toward
childhood changed in the early
20th century: children were
regarded as the future of a nation.
The period between 1917 and
1937 witnessed an unprecedented
explosion of discourse for and
about children, childhood and
child development.
In the 1920s and 1930s,
intellectuals such as Zhou Zuoren
argued for children’s rights:
children should not be treated as
incomplete little people but
complete individuals with their
own inner and outer lives.
The Republic China discovered
childhood as an “epistemological,
ideological, institutional and even
commercial” category.

Public libraries survived and
provided enhanced services
during the Depress and WWII,
1930-1945.
In 1939, ALA adapted the
Library Bill of Rights to guide
library services.

The idea of “modern
childhood” emerged in the
middle of the 18th century and
regarded children as innocent
and fragile.
Since then, childhood was
viewed as a separate stage of
life that required special care
and protection.
At the turn of the 20th century,
the invention of a “long
childhood” and the “discovery”
of adolescence emerged and
was devoted to extending
children’s education and freeing
children from early labor.
To save the child, a series of
laws were passed to restrict
child labor in the early 20th
century.
Meanwhile, child welfare
professionals also focused
scientific study on children’s
emotional, physical and sexual
development and advised a
scientific approach to
childrearing.
During the Depression, the
concept of “the teenager”
appeared and young people
ended their childhood earlier
