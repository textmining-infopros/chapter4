Acknowledgements
I wish to heartily thank the following people without which this work could not have been completed. (1)
My doctoral advisor, Katy Börner, who first inspired me when I saw her give a talk in 2002 to the Indiana
Chapter of ASIS&T at a hotel near the Indianapolis Airport. She has been a source of inspiration ever
since. I consider it a great luxury in life to have both found and been mentored by someone intellectually
interested in very similar things as I am. (2) My other research committee members. Your hard work and
modeling of successful academic careers continue to inspire me. Staša Milojević and Cassidy Sugimoto:
always kind and encouraging. Both of you are great examples of highly productive young faculty
members. Jonathan Plucker: a good friend, collaborator, and a great doctoral minor advisor who was
always patient with me and willing to discuss something other than academics. William Henderson:
another good friend whose chance encounter at the SRSC swimming pool introduced me to the dataset
and the exciting research collaboration that led to this dissertation. (3) My fellow principal investigators
and other team members on the LSAC grant: William Henderson, Olufunmilayo (Funmi) Arewa, Kenneth
G. Dau-Schmidt, Andrew Morriss, and Mark Newton. (4) The SLIS and other student workers that
assisted in the data harvesting of the AALS data, some of whom have gone on to become my friends:
Vaughn Ganiyu, Sonya Huser, Amy Ihnen, Kabara Korth, Jeong Lee, Erin Mack, Daniel Pierz, Amy
Price, and Caitlin Watt. (5) The Law School Admissions Council whose generous grant of $159,511
helped to make this research possible. (6) Loet Leydesdorff: who kindly saw an early presentation of the
research and provided invaluable suggestions as to techniques to use. (7) Those that read draft sections of
this manuscript and generously provided their feedback—in particular, Ludo Waltman and Nees Jan van
Eck. (8) My parents, Pat and Chuck, whose untiring support throughout my life extended even to
processing some data for this dissertation. (9) My eighteen human subjects who gave generously of their
time and greatly assisted me in making sense of my data. (10) My life partner, Maggie Remstad, and my
new daughter—Amelia Remstad Hook (born July 8, 2014). Thank you for giving me the motivation to
finish and to move on to the next step in life. May I always strive to be worthy of your love.

THE STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION OF THE ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE OF LAW IN
THE UNITED STATES: GENERATION AND VALIDATION OF COURSE-SUBJECT
CO-OCCURRENCE (CSCO) MAPS
This dissertation proposes, exemplifies, and validates the usage of course-subject co-occurrence (CSCO)
data to generate topic maps of an academic discipline. CSCO is defined as course-subjects taught in the
same academic year by the same teacher. This work is premised on the assumption that in the aggregate
and for reasons of efficiency, faculty members teach course-subjects that are topically similar to one
another. To exemplify and validate CSCO, more than 112,000 CSCO events were extracted from the
annual directories of the American Association of Law Schools covering nearly eighty years of law
school teaching in the United States. The CSCO events are used to extract and visualize the structure and
evolution of law for the years 1931-32, 1972-73, and 2010-11—roughly, forty year intervals. Different
normalization, ordination (layout), and clustering algorithms are compared and the best algorithm of each
type is used to generate the final map. Validation studies demonstrate that CSCO produces topic maps
that are consistent with expert opinion and four other indicators of the topical similarity of law school
course-subjects. Resulting maps of the educational domain of law are useful as a reference system for
additional thematic overlay of information about law school education in the United States. This research
is the first to use CSCO to produce visualizations of a domain. It is the first to use an expanded, multipart gold-standard to evaluate the validity of domain maps and the intermediate steps in their creation.
Last but not least, this research contributes a metric analysis and visualizations of the evolution of law
school course-subjects over nearly eighty years.

1. Introduction
He should consider his course as a general map of the law, making out the shape of the
country, its connections and boundaries, its greater divisions and principal cities: it is not
his business to describe minutely the subordinate limits, or to fix the longitude and
latitude of every inconsiderable hamlet. His attention should be engaged . . . in tracing
out the originals and as it were the elements of the law (Blackstone, 1783, p. 35).
In the statement above, Blackstone describes the role of the legal commentator as making the law more
comprehensible by figuratively mapping the field. However, the structure of the academic discipline of
law in the United States has never been empirically determined and literally mapped in two dimensions.
While the course-subject structure of legal academia in the United States has been described in essays
(Kennedy, 1983) and other writings on the history of law school education (Stevens, 1983), it has never
been revealed through the exploration of large datasets and determined through replicable, empirical
means. The main purpose of this dissertation is to ascertain the similarity of legal course-subjects in
terms of their topical relatedness and to rigorously and in a replicable manner, best distribute those
course-subjects in a two-dimensional mapping so that they may be quickly perceived by the viewer using
the distance-similarity metaphor 1

(Montello et al., 2003).

Once created, domain maps provide

cognitive scaffolding for learning (Greenfield, 1984; Wood et al., 1976). These big-picture, global
perspectives have the potential to allow a novice to more quickly become familiar with the domain and
experts to contextualize their teaching and research in a broader perspective. Additionally, domain maps
of legal course-subjects allow for numerous thematic overlays that facilitate insight about legal education
in the United States. The dataset that makes this possible also permits an empirical and longitudinal
exploration of course-subject offerings in law schools in the United States.

1.1 Course-Subject Co-Occurrence (CSCO) Defined and a Brief Introduction to
the Dataset
This research relies, in part, on a large dataset created by the author and his fellow investigators in a grant
from the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), see Section 3.1.1. Specifically, this research uses
networks of course-subject co-occurrence events from 1931 through 2011.

Course-subject co-

occurrence (CSCO), coined herein, is defined as the same professor teaching multiple, different coursesubjects over some period of time. In this instance, the period of time is one academic year as captured in
the annual directories of the American Association of Law Schools (AALS). Furthermore, courses with
differing individual course names are controlled through a proscribed subject vocabulary supplied by the
AALS. In other words, courses with similar content, but with differing titles, are harmonized through a
common course-subject listing. This is why the data is described as course-subject co-occurrence. Thus,
the main unit of analysis is the teaching of different course-subjects (not individually named courses). In
2010-11, there were 104 academic course-subjects.
If a professor teaches two different course-subjects in a given year, those course-subjects are
connected by a single link when the two mode network (professors and course-subjects) is collapsed to a
single mode network (just course-subjects).

If a professor teaches three different course-subjects in a

given year, this results in the creation of three course-subject links. Four different course-subjects taught
in a given year results in the creation of six course-subject links, and so forth, see Figure 1. Additionally,
when two professors teach the same two course-subjects, this results in an edge weight between those
course-subjects of two when the network is collapsed from a two mode network to a single mode
network, see Figure 2. In 2010-11, 536 faculty members taught both Criminal Law and Criminal
Procedure—the highest amount of pairwise co-occurrence between any of the 104 course-subjects. At the
other end of the spectrum, 1,467 of the 5,356 possible course-subject pairs (((104 x 104) - 104) / 2) were
not taught by any of the same faculty members.

Figure 2: Course-Subject Co-Occurrence Networks (CSCO), Different Edge Weights
The explanatory power of CSCO networks is premised on the assumption that in the aggregate, and
for reasons of efficiency, faculty members specialize and focus their energy teaching courses that are
topically similar to other courses they teach. The use of CSCO networks to make structural claims about
a domain is supported by the numerous uses of co-occurrence data that have been used to create domain
maps, see Section 2. Utilizing a relational database, this work harvested and organized data about
courses taught and the school affiliation of the faculty members that taught them, from the annual
directories of the AALS. Spatialization techniques have been used to create domain maps for three
different academic years of CSCO networks: 1931-32, 1972-73, and 2010-11—roughly forty year
intervals.
In addition to the novelty of the of the CSCO approach, the intellectual contribution of this
dissertation rests with the simultaneous use of several different sources of topical similarity for legal
4

course-subjects to validate the domain maps and to assess the intermediate steps in their creation. While
also including the traditional approach of soliciting expert opinion via a card-sort of the 104, 2010-11
controlled AALS course-subjects, four other sources of topical similarity were used: (1) the syndetic
structure (cross-references) contained in the AALS directories (AALS, 1931, 2011); (2) the mergence and
divergence of AALS course subjects over time; (3) Jackson and Gee categories of law school courses
(1975); and (4) topic categories of the Current Index to Legal Periodicals (CILP) (Gallaghar Law
Library—University of Washington, 2011). The dataset and its subsequent analysis also revealed how the
canon of law school course-subjects changed over time.

1.2 Research Goals, Questions, and Core Contributions
The intention of this research may be broken into three parts: research goals, research questions, and core
contributions.
1.2.1 Research Goals
The goal of this research was to produce the best two-dimensional spatial representation of the topical
relatedness of law school course-subjects in the United States and to reveal the evolution of law school
course subjects over time. Once created, the maps were used to overlay thematic information about law
school education in the United States in order to efficiently convey information about the course-subjects.
These goals are reflected in the following research questions.
1.2.2 Research Questions
•

Research Question 1: Do faculty members, on the whole, specialize and focus their energy
teaching courses that are topically similar to other courses they teach? This is the threshold
question which is also the assumed premise underlying the use of CSCO to create valid domain
maps of academic course-subjects. See Section 4.1.1.

5

•

Research Question 2: Can course-subject co-occurrence (CSCO) be used to produce topic maps
that are consistent with expert opinion and other indicators of the topical similarity of law school
course-subjects? See Section 4.2.4.

•

Research Question 3: When using CSCO network data to compare normalization algorithms
(association strength, cosine, and no normalization) and spatial ordination and layout techniques
(Proxscal MDS, VOSviewer, and spring-force algorithms), which combination of algorithms,
tools, and techniques is best at portraying the overall structure of law school course-subjects as
compared to an extrinsic ‘gold-standard’ of similar course-subject pairs? See Figure 3 for a
schematic representation of the map making treatments. See Sections 4.1.6, 4.1.7, and 4.2.4.

•

Research Question 4: How well does cluster analysis of course-subject co-occurrence data
capture the higher level groupings of law school course subjects compared with the subject
groupings created by experts? See Section 4.3.

•

Research Question 5: How have law school course-subjects changed over time? See Section
5.1

•

Research Question 6: What do thematic overlays reveal about the relative amount certain
course-subjects are taught, which course-subjects are taught as a seminar, and other metric
evaluations of the law school canon? This question addresses the utility of overlays applied to
CSCO network produced domain maps. See Section 6.

Figure 3: Different Treatments Applied to the Map Making Steps
1.2.3 Core Contributions
This research provides a number of core and original contributions. It introduces the use of coursesubject co-occurrence to do analysis, scientometrics, and visualizations of a domain. Additionally, this
work introduces an expanded, broader, multi-part gold-standard to evaluate the validity of domain maps.
Perhaps the most significant contribution of this work is the analytic framework to compare multiple
different algorithms, tools, and techniques at each stage of domain map production. The research
demonstrates how multiple different treatments can be compared with each other at each stage of domain
map construction and how their cumulative effects may be compared across stages. This work provides
additional evidence as to which is the best normalization and ordination techniques amongst those
commonly used in domain map production. Also, this work provides empirical proof that in the law
7

school domain, more often than not, faculty members teach courses that are topically similar. Finally,
once articles have been published from the research, the dataset will be made freely available to other
researchers to replicate and expand upon the findings or to be used as a sample dataset to explore
networks.

1.3 Situating the Work in Information Science
While interdisciplinary in nature, this dissertation is thoroughly grounded in the paradigms, foci, and
methods of information science. “Information science is the study of the gathering, organizing, storing,
retrieving, and dissemination of information” (Bates, 1999, p. 1044; Borko, 1968; Rubin, 1998).
Information science has been characterized as a meta-discipline (Bates, 1999). In other words, it
“conduct[s] research and develop[s] theory around the documentary products of other disciplines and
activities” (Bates, 1999, p. 1043). This dissertation research is a quintessential meta-pursuit—using tools
and techniques from the fields of data mining, information visualization, and domain mapping to derive
new understanding of another field from existing data. In this instance, the other field is law.
Additionally, like most endeavors in information science, this dissertation has utilized the “recorded
information” that is a product of the “human agency” of a particular field (Bates, 1999, p. 1048). In this
case, the recorded information is the annual directories of law teachers of the AALS.

These detailed,

yearly accounts of biographical information about law faculty members list the institutional affiliation of
each faculty member and more importantly, what subjects they taught. Representing information is also
at the heart of information science (Bates, 1999, p. 1045) and was also the aim of this research. The
domain maps produced from the CSCO networks provide users a quick, visual means to assess the
structure of the academic domain of law. In this sense, this work responds to Bates’ third big question of
information science, “How can access to recorded information be made most rapid and effective?” (Bates,
1999, p. 1048).

1.4 Law School Education in the United States
Law school education in the United States is a three year, graduate professional degree (ABA & LSAC,
2011) followed by a state licensing exam for those that wish to practice law in a particular jurisdiction.
The American Bar Association (ABA), the accrediting body for law school education in the United
States, does not specify an undergraduate focus in order to prepare students for the graduate law degree.
Instead, students are advised that they “may choose to major in subjects that are considered to be
traditional preparation for law school, such as history, English, philosophy, political science, economics,
or business, or … may focus … in areas as diverse as art, music, science, mathematics, computer science,
engineering, nursing, or education” (ABA & LSAC, 2011, p. 4). Assessment in law school is unique.
“[I]n most courses, grades [are] determined primarily from examinations administered at the end of the
semester or, at some schools, the end of the year. The professor may give little feedback until the final
examination” (ABA & LSAC, 2011, p. 6). Law students are frequently taught by the “case method.” In
this approach, law professors question students about the issues, facts, legal holdings and rationales in
specific cases. Through this “Socratic dialogue” with their professors, students inductively internalize the
major principles of the various areas of the law.
There is no dissertation or thesis requirement for the traditional three year, Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree.
Also, the terminal degree for law professors has traditionally been the same three year Juris Doctor degree
that is common to all law school graduates. Increasingly however, faculty members are being hired that
have a PhD in addition to their J.D. (Rachlinski, 2011) in subjects such as economics, political science,
history, sociology, etc. There is a typical first-year curriculum that includes the following required
courses: (1) Contracts, (2) Civil Procedure, (3) Property, (4) Torts, (5) Criminal Law, (6) Constitutional
Law, and (7) Legal Research and Writing (Carpenter, 2012, pp. 50-55). Additionally, the Multi-State Bar
Examination (MBE), a multiple-choice standardized component of almost all state bar examinations, tests
aspiring lawyers in the following subjects: (1) Constitutional Law, (2) Contracts, (3) Criminal Law and
Procedure, (4) Evidence, (5) Real Property, and (6) Torts (National Conference of Bar Examiners
9

(NCBE)). Individual states mandate additional bar exam topics such as Administrative Law, Business
Associations, Taxation, Wills and Trusts, etc. However, “[t]ested subject matter of bar examinations does
not appear to play a prominent role in a law school’s determination of which courses to require for
graduation” (Carpenter, 2012, p. 15). The overwhelming majority of courses that law students take are
electives. The choice of these electives could be aided by the use of a domain map.

1.5 Structure of the Dissertation
This dissertation is broken into the following additional parts. Section 2, Literature Review, surveys the
literature upon which this research is based. It includes a general introduction to the specific methods and
techniques used. Section 3, Methods, Data, and Data Collection, describes the data used for this study,
how it was obtained, and the specific steps used to manipulate the data in order to derive the results given
in the subsequent section. It also describes the creation and constituent parts of the ‘gold-standard’ used
to evaluate the various map making input techniques. Section 4, Results, reveals summary statistics as to
which domain map input technique performed the best relative to the gold-standard. Section 5, Mapping
the Structure and Evolution of the Domain of Law, provides a map for each map year, 1931-32, 1972-73,
and 2010-11, as well as a metric and visual evaluation of how the course-subjects have changed over
time. Section 6, Thematic Overlays, demonstrates the utility of domain maps to succinctly convey
information by overlaying thematic data upon the base-maps established in the previous section. Section
7, Conclusions, summarizes the findings of the dissertation and addresses the significance of the research
in terms of its intellectual merit and broader impacts.

2. Literature Review
Relevant literature for this dissertation involves the spatial studies of disciplines (Section 2.1) and other
co-occurrence studies (Section 2.2). Additionally, important methodological considerations include: the
normalization of co-occurrence data (Section 2.3.1), techniques to spatialize multi-dimensional data:
Proxscal MDS, VOSviewer, spring-force algorithms (Section 2.3.2), cluster analysis techniques (Section
2.3.3), and the common ways in which domain maps are validated (Section 2.4). Another crucial element
of the literature relied upon for this dissertation is indicators of the topical similarity of courses in legal
academia (Section 2.5). The literature review concludes with a discussion of the use of AALS coursesubjects by legal scholars (Section 2.6) and additional claims about law school course-subjects (Section
2.7).

2.1 Spatial and Longitudinal Studies of Disciplines
This dissertation involves a: (1) longitudinal, (2) spatial mapping analysis, (3) of academic courses, (4)
based on the co-occurrence of different course-subjects taught by the same professor. Longitudinal is
defined as: “concerned with the development of persons or groups [or things or entities] over time”
(Pickett, 2006, p. 1031). Diachronic is a synonym that is also used in the literature (White & Calhoun,
1984, p. 83): “of or concerned with phenomena … as they change through time” (Pickett, 2006, p. 499).
A spatial mapping analysis is one that uses spatialization (Fabrikant & Skupin, 2005, p. 668; Slocum,
2005, p. 459) and the distance-similarity metaphor (Montello et al., 2003) to derive insight into a
particular domain. In other words, proximity is an indicator of topical or conceptual similarity. For this
work, a course is the basic unit of academic study. A course usually lasts for one semester (or possibly a
quarter), is comprised of one or more credit hours, and has its own entry on a student’s academic
transcript. While no study has been conducted employing all four of the elements set out above, the
studies discussed in this section are the most similar to and informative for this dissertation.

11

2.1.1 Spatial Representations of Academic Courses or Disciplines
The two most similar studies to this dissertation research also involve a spatial mapping analysis of either
academic courses or disciplines (Biglan, 1973; White & Calhoun, 1984). The Biglan study was a
pioneering work in empirical topic mapping. Biglan was one of the first domain mappers to employ an
expert card-sorting exercise to create a similarity matrix of 36 academic disciplines (accounting, finance,
horticulture, zoology, etc.) from the perspective of university professors (see Figure 4). White and
Calhoun (1984) produced a spatial map of the curriculum of the Library and Information Science program
at Drexel University based on the co-occurrence of elective courses taken by the same students from
1977-1982 (see Figure 5). White and Calhoun did several things that are illustrative for this dissertation.
They labeled the axes in both directions (left-right, up-down), identified a core group of courses
applicable to general library studies at the center, and noted various specializations that radiated from the
core. Furthermore, instead of raw co-occurrence counts, they used normalized, Pearson r correlation
coefficients. See (Boll & Zweizig, 1985) for criticism of this work and the authors’ reply (White &
Calhoun, 1985). Both the Biglan and White and Calhoun studies used multidimensional scaling (MDS)
as the spatialization technique and reported stress values for the preferred two-dimensional solutions.
Stress values are “Kruskal’s index of goodness of fit between the similarity data and the multidimensional
solution” (Biglan, 1973, p. 197).

The Biglan study had a two-dimensional stress coefficient of 0.311

while that in the White and Calhoun study was 0.27.

2.1.2 Spatial Longitudinal Studies of Disciplines
Three studies are similar to this dissertation in that they are a longitudinal spatial mapping analysis of
either academic courses (White & Nolt, 1987), academic sub-fields (White & McCain, 1998), or subject
assignments in a dissertation abstracts database (Jeong, 2001). All three use MDS for their spatialization.
They are informative in how they illustrate change over time. White and Nolt expand on the earlier work
of (White & Calhoun, 1984) by adding an additional time-slice (1982-84) to the previous work (1977-82).
What is methodologically interesting is that they evaluated change in course location by looking at a
specific course’s placement on the horizontal and vertical axes of each of the two maps using Pearson r
values. They also noted various ‘course careers.’ These are changes in the adjacencies of individual
subjects over time— changes that sometimes reflect the merger or splintering of previous course subjects.
White and McCain used author co-citation analysis (ACA) as applied to articles from twelve key
journals from 1972-1995 to do a longitudinal analysis of the field of information science in three distinct
time bins (White & McCain, 1998). Most interestingly for this dissertation is the map showing the shift
in topic space location of the most changing 19 authors over the three time periods. Lines indicate
movement of each author in the topic space of the three superimposed time periods (see Figure 6).

14

Figure 6: The Shift in Citation Images for 19 Authors for 3 Time Spans: (1) 1972-1979, (2) 1980-1987,
and (3) 1988-1995. Reproduced from (White & McCain, 1998, p. 349).
Jeong conducted a longitudinal study of academic disciplines by analyzing the co-occurrence of
subject assignments in the UMI Dissertation Abstracts database (2001). While particularly interested in
the change over time of the adjacencies of information science, library science, and computer science
against a background of fifteen other disciplines (1970-1997), Jeong noted that the three MDS maps
corresponding to each time frame have different scales and that only the relative positions may be
compared. Jeong made a conscious decision to not emulate the work of White and his collaborators in
regards to labeling the axes. Instead, Jeong chose to let the spatial layout speak for itself (see Figure 7
and Figure 8).

2.1.3 Course Catalog Studies
There are also studies that analyze course catalogs for trends in academic disciplines such as change and
development in the overall subject matter, first appearances of particular subjects, and the end of
16

particular subjects. While not spatial in nature, these studies are both longitudinal and deal with academic
courses. For instance, Perlman and McCann examined 400 college catalogs to do an analysis of course
offerings in undergraduate psychology curriculums (Perlman & McCann, 1999).

Comparing their

contemporary findings with earlier studies allowed the authors to identify new pedagogical approaches,
clinical advances, other trends, and the changes in the discipline’s ‘constituencies’ over time (e.g., the
balance between such things as vocational / non-vocational or applied / non-applied courses). Similarly,
as part of his survey of doctoral education in Library and Information Science, Bobinski looked at the
academic catalogs of twenty-one doctoral programs and analyzed their program requirements and course
listings (Bobinski, 1986).
2.1.4 Studies Involving Law School Courses
There have also been several studies or essays about the law school curriculum over the years (Agnor,
1950; Gee & Jackson, 1975; Jackson & Gee, 1975; Powers, 1986, 1987; Reed, 1928). Collectively, these
articles reveal changes over time and things about the law school curriculum that have remained the same.
From the earliest study, law school courses are frequently associated with particular years in the
traditional three year graduate curriculum. Courses are most frequently divided into two groups: (1) first
year courses, and (2) second and third year courses. Reed (1928, p. 256) identified a core group of first
year courses taught by almost all law schools: Contracts, Torts, Crimes, and Property. Sixty percent of
schools also included Pleading and Agency in their first year program schedule. Reed also identified the
“twenty-five standard components of the law school curriculum” 2 (1928, p. 254). Agnor (1950) surveyed
the catalogs of 100 AALS law schools and reported the eighteen courses for which there was a clear
consensus in terms of inclusion in catalogs. Agnor also reported the “average curriculum” broken down

2

Agency, Bailments and Carriers, Bankruptcy, Bills and Notes, Conflicts, Constitutional Law, Contracts, Corporations (Private),
Corporations (Public), Crimes, Damages, Domestic Relations, Equity, Evidence, Insurance, Mortgages, Partnership, Pleading,
Property, Quasi-Contracts, Sales, Surtyship, Torts, Trusts, Wills and Administration.

17

by year (First Year 3, Second Year 4, and Third Year 5). In a pamphlet length exploration of law school
curriculums, Gee and Jackson (1975) performed a content analysis of the catalogs of 127 American Bar
Association (ABA) approved law schools for 1974-75. They also reported typical curriculums for several
different time periods: 1832-69 (Harvard Law School); 1879-80 (Harvard Law School); 1916-17
(Harvard Law School); 1925-26 (Reed, 1928); 1949-50 (Agnor, 1950); 1969-70 (the authors’ own survey
of 62 catalogs); and 1974-75 (the authors’ own survey of 127 catalogs). Gee and Jackson reported that 12
courses were required by at least 25% of the surveyed schools. 6 The first seven of these are the ‘almost
consensual’ First Year curriculum (Gee & Jackson, 1975, pp. 14-15).
Reed (1928) identified two different types of law school curriculums: (1) proscribed, and (2) elective.
In the former, the student’s curriculum is set out and is not open to many electives. Reed strongly
endorsed the elective curriculum type and speculated that the elective approach is better for a school’s
faculty in that it encourages them to “extend its own knowledge over widening areas of the law … [and]
contributes to the development of productive scholarship” (Reed, 1928, p. 232). Almost all first year
curriculums discussed above are required courses (proscribed). The more interesting topical variance
occurs in the context of elective courses. Gee and Jackson surveyed the elective courses offered by ABA
approved law schools (1975). The authors grouped these electives into thirty-three categories 7 and gave

numerous statistics about each elective course. See Appendix 1: Crosswalk Between Jackson and Gee
and AALS Subjects. The grouping of the thirty-three law school course categories are used in this
dissertation as one of five external indicators of topical similarity between course-subjects. See Section
3.5.3.
Powers and the ABA’s Office of the Consultant on Legal Education replicated Gee and Jackson’s
work ten years later (Powers, 1986). As to courses required by more than 25% of Law Schools, two
courses dropped off the list in this latter study—Legal Method and Taxation. The biggest gain was the
Legal Profession course (Professional Responsibility). This moved from being a required class in 53.5%
of schools in 1974-75 to being required in 80.5% of schools in 1984-86 (Powers, 1986, pp. 12-13). The
Powers study also analyzed elective offerings in the same thirty-three categories used by Gee and
Jackson. The biggest increase in elective offerings were in the areas of Discrimination and the Law
(69.5% increase), Patent, Copyright and Trademark (59.4% increase), and Juvenile Law and Process
(57% increase). The biggest decline was in the area of Law and Social Issues (-32%) (Powers, 1986, pp.
26-27).
Gee and Jackson (1975) were also innovative in exploring the way that bar examination subjects also
impact the law school curriculum. At the time of their study, 85-95% of the graduates from ABAapproved law schools took at least one state bar examination (Gee & Jackson, 1975, p. 33). The authors
received information from 43 of the 51 jurisdictions solicited as to what subjects were tested on their bar
examinations. The authors reported these subjects as well as their frequencies 8 (Gee & Jackson, 1975, p.
37). Gee and Jackson noted that the additional bar examination courses, combined with the already

have live client contact), (27) Regulation of Business and Industry, (28) Remedies, (29) State and Local Government Law, Policy
and Relations, (30) State Law, Practices, and Procedures, (31) Taxation, (32) Torts and Compensation for Injuries, and (33)
Miscellaneous.

Mortgages, Oil and Gas Law, and Water Law” (Gee & Jackson, 1975, p. 37).

19

required law school courses, are in reality the true law school curriculum that most students should be
taking.
Reed (1928) was one of the first to remark on the fissuring of legal subjects—the creation of new
subjects from existing ones. He noted that this was true for ‘Wills and Administration’ and ‘Mortgages’
splintering off from ‘Property’ and ‘Bills and Notes (Negotiable Instruments),’ ‘Sales,’ ‘Insurance,’ and
‘Suretyship’ splintering off from ‘Contracts.’ Reed is also one of the first to identify law schools that
pioneered individual legal subjects. He noted that Harvard Law School pioneered courses in ‘Restraint of
Trade,’ ‘Labor Law’, and ‘Legal Liability’ (Reed, 1928, p. 254). Reed also identified ‘Moot’ or ‘Practice
Court,’ ‘Legal Bibliography,’ and ‘Legal Ethics’ as three courses that do not fall into “any of the
recognized branches of practitioners’ law” (Reed, 1928, p. 255). Reed noted that the latter two subjects
were relatively new in 1928.
Reed (1928) identified several subjects that fall between the responsibility of college (undergraduate
education) and law school.

He called these “borderland subjects.”

They are: “international law,

comparative law, legal history, and legal philosophy or jurisprudence” (Reed, 1928, p. 224). As evidence
by their long inclusion in the AALS course-subject canon, these are firmly considered law school subjects
today (AALS, 2011).

Reed also identified four subjects which he separated out as professional

specialties: Admiralty, Patent Law, Mining Law, and Irrigation Law. Perhaps the most interesting
statement made by Reed is his assertion that there is no logical plan to the law school curriculum: “The
curriculum is not an organic whole, divided into parts. It is a mere aggregate or conglomerate of
independently developed units” (Reed, 1928, p. 252). This work reveals that while course-subjects might
have developed in an agglomerative fashion, there is a consistent structure to the law school curriculum as
revealed by domain maps for the years 1931-32, 1972-73, and 2010-11.

2.2 Co-Occurrence Studies
There is a long history of utilizing the co-occurrence of specific events to conduct an analysis of a
particular domain. The underlying assumption is that items that co-occur together are categorically or
substantively more similar than those that do not.

This includes co-voting, word co-occurrence,

bibliometric coupling, co-authorship, co-citation, co-nomination, co-courses taken, co-classification, and
co-membership. These developments have been surveyed in several places (Bar-Ilan, 2008; Börner,
2010). They are discussed below in chronological order of their initial discovery and use. However, to
the best of the author’s knowledge, there has not been a study that utilizes incidences of CSCO—the same
professor teaching multiple, different courses-subjects during the same academic year. This is most likely
due to the scarcity of data of this type.
2.2.1 Co-Voting (1941)
Co-voting analysis has been conducted for decades and has been surveyed by Hook (2007a, pp. 224-227).
Co-voting analysis generally includes either: (1) judges voting together on judicial opinions, or (2)
legislators voting together on proposed legislation.
2.2.1.1 Judicial Co-Voting
The genesis for voting alignment matrices (co-voting frequency tables) in the judicial context appears to
be the work of C. Herman Pritchett (Pritchett, 1941, 1942, 1948, 1954). Also, beginning with the 1956
Term, the Harvard Law Review has annually published co-voting matrices for the nine justices of the
United States Supreme Court (Harvard Law Review, 1957, 2010). Additional resources break down
Supreme Court co-voting by specific issue areas (Epstein et al., 2007c; Riggs, 1988; Wilkins et al., 2005).
Fifty-five years of United States Supreme Court co-voting data is freely available in The Supreme Court
Database (Spaeth et al., 2012).
Early efforts to spatially visualize the relationship of the Justices to one another based on their covoting behavior were discussed in (White, 2005). Perhaps the first was Pritchett’s linear distribution of
21

the Justices (1941, p. 894).

Thurston and Degan (1951) used factorial analysis to produce three

dimensional vector-space representations of the Justices’ co-voting patterns in the 1943 and 1944 Terms
(see Figure 9). Schubert also used factorial analysis to produce spatial distributions of the Justices
(Schubert, 1962, 1963). Subsequently, many other scholars have also used co-voting data to produce
spatial representations of the voting relationships amongst the Justices: hand-drawn diagrams of the
influence relationships amongst the Justices (Spaeth & Altfeld, 1985); Markov chain Monte Carlo
methods with a Bayesian measurement model (Epstein et al., 2003; Epstein et al., 2007a; Martin &
Quinn, 2002, p. 797; Martin et al., 2005); statistical scaling techniques also involving the voting patterns
of Courts of Appeal judges (Epstein et al., 2007b); network science and correspondence analysis (Johnson
et al., 2005); vector models and singular value decomposition (Sirovich, 2003); and multidimensional
scaling and network layout techniques (Hook, 2007a, 2014).

1943 and 1944 Terms. Reproduced from (Thurstone & Degan, 1951, p. 630).
2.2.1.2 Legislative Co-Voting
Legislative votes are often referred to as ‘roll call’ votes. While seldom referred to as co-voting, this
is indeed the phenomenon being analyzed—the incidences of legislators voting together on particular
issues. Poole (2005) wrote a book-length treatment of spatial models for legislative co-voting. This type
22

of analysis is also being integrated into common statistical software programs (Poole et al., 2008). Other
scholars have also used co-voting analysis to produce spatial representations of a particular group of
legislators (Clinton et al., 2004; Clinton & Meirowitz, 2001; Jackman, 2001; Moody & Mucha, 2013;
Poole & Rosenthal, 1991).
2.2.2 Word Co-Occurrence (Term Co-Occurrence) (1961)

Doyle, an information retrieval researcher, was perhaps the first to use word co-occurrence in a document
set to produce a spatial representation of that document. In 1961, Doyle called for literatures to be
presented with a ‘master framework’ or ‘semantic road map’ such that the documents they contained
would be visible like items on a shelf in a supermarket (Doyle, 1961). In order to create such document
maps, Doyle used the frequency of words in documents focusing on highly correlated word pairs
appearing in 618 psychological abstracts

(Doyle, 1962).

The structure of the domain map was

determined based on Pearson correlation coefficients. In the network map image, these coefficients are
displayed along the edges. Dashed linkages indicate word pairings that co-occur less frequently than solid
links. The arcs (arrows) point to the second word of commonly occurring two-word pairs (e.g. ‘stimulus
response,’ ‘college students,’ ‘group therapy,’ etc.) (see Figure 10). Also, just like domain map creators
today, Doyle had to determine a reasonable, co-occurrence threshold amount so the map would neither be
too dense nor too sparse.
Since Doyle, numerous other domain mappers have used term co-occurrence to both study domains
and to produce spatial representations of those domains (Callon et al., 1983; Callon et al., 1986; Jacobs,
2002; Leydesdorff & Hellsten, 2005; Noyons & Van Raan, 1994; Su & Lee, 2010). Furthermore, the use
of the related concept of term frequencies has become a staple of the information retrieval community.
The term frequency in a document relative to the inverse of the frequency of the term in an entire
document collection (tf–idf (term frequency–inverse document frequency)) and other such term frequency

23

metrics are extensively used to optimize search engines—including co-term (term-term) frequency
measures (Salton, 1968; Salton & Buckley, 1988).

from (L. B. Doyle, 1962, p. 382).
2.2.3 Bibliographic Coupling (Reference Co-Occurrence) (1963)

Bibliographic coupling is when two works each cite a common third work (Kessler, 1963)). Thus, it may
be conceptualized as the co-occurrence of citing the same work. In 1968, Price and Schiminovich used

bibliographic coupling to map a corpus of 240 articles on high energy physics (Price & Schiminovich,
1968). The authors produced simple domain maps in the form of network graphs. Papers with a higher
percentage of common citations are portrayed as being linked together with thicker edges (see Figure 11).
24

Other researchers have also used bibliographic coupling to both study domains and to produce spatial
representations of those domains (Glänzel & Czerwon, 1996; Jarneving, 2001; Vladutz & Cook, 1984).
Furthermore, at least one group of researchers has concluded that bibliographic coupling outperforms
other similarity techniques (co-citation, and direct citation) in terms of accuracy (Boyack & Klavans,
2010). However, this assertion is questioned in a more recent paper (Waltman & Van Eck, 2012). 9

Cluster). Reproduced from (Price & Schiminovich, 1968, p. 278).
2.2.4 Co-Authoring (1966)

Co-Author linkages are another means to map a literature. This technique involves the instances of “two
authors (or their institutions and countries) listed on one paper, patent, or grant[.] The more often two
authors collaborate, the greater the weight of their joint coauthor link” (Börner, 2010, p. 55). Amongst
the first to do extensive co-author analysis were De Solla Price and Beaver (1966). Since, numerous
scholars have used co-author status to analyze and map domains (Edelman & George, 2007, 2008; Logan
& Shaw, 1987; Peters & Van Raan, 1991; Stokes & Hartley, 1989) (see Figure 12).

“[R]ecently Nees and I had several discussions with Boyack and Klavans on a paper that we have written
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.22748), and it seems that Boyack and Klavans have somewhat changed their opinion on the
performance of bibliographic coupling relative to direct citations. It seems they agree with Nees and me that, given a sufficiently
long period of analysis, direct citations may be preferable over bibliographic coupling. This is more or less what we claim in our
paper.” Email correspondence with the author from Ludo Waltman.

2.2.5 Co-Citation (1973)

The use of co-citation to map literatures was pioneered by Henry Small (1973) working in the United
States (see Figure 13) and Irina Marshakova working independently in the Soviet Union (1973). There
are several varieties of co-citation analysis (Börner, 2010, p. 55). Document co-citation analysis (DCA)
is when two articles (documents) are both cited by a third article. Author co-citation Analysis (ACA) is
when two authors are both cited by a common work. Thus, author co-citation analysis is slightly more
generalized (expansive) than document co-citation analysis. ACA was pioneered by Howard White
(White, 1981; White & Griffith, 1981). Co-citation in both of these forms has been used extensively to
study and map domains (Braam et al., 1991a, 1991b; Marshakova, 1981; Small, 1999; White & McCain,
1998). Co-citation has also been conducted at the journal level (McCain, 1991).

Physics. Reproduced from (Small, 1973, p. 266).
2.2.6 Other Co-Occurrence Data
There are still more studies that rely on the incidence of co-occurring phenomena to assess the similarity
of various entities and to distribute them spatially. Lenk (1983) produced a spatial, topical map of
research scholars based on their being co-nominated by survey participants who were asked to identify
researchers in their field that they most esteemed. Also, as discussed above, White and his collaborators
used the co-occurrence of the same student taking multiple different elective courses in order to map the
library and information science curriculum at Drexel University (White & Calhoun, 1984; White & Nolt,
1987). The incidence of the same classification terms being assigned to the same work have also been
used to produce spatial maps of domains (Spasser, 1997; Todorov, 1989). In an earlier, theoretical work,
McGrath speculated on the use of books co-checked out from libraries (by the same patrons) to map book
27

literatures (McGrath, 1984). Hook used co-classification of the West Topic and Key Numbers assigned
to Supreme Court cases to produce a domain map of the topic space of the United States Supreme Court
(2007b). Furthermore, McCain (1993) used the incidence of the same person belonging to multiple
special interest groups (SIG’s) to map the topical space of the American Society for Information Science.
All of the co-occurrence examples referenced in this section lend support to the legitimacy of using
CSCO to produced topical domain maps of law school course-subjects.

2.3 Map Production
The domain maps produced by this research have been created by and enhanced through several
intermediate steps. These steps are normalization, ordination (spatialization), and clustering analysis.
Accordingly, the literature associated with these techniques is surveyed below.
2.3.1 Normalization of Co-Occurrence Data
Normalization is a mathematical transformation of one’s data in order to more fairly and accurately
compare items that occur in varying frequencies. Van Eck and Waltman surveyed and organized the
various normalization approaches (or similarity measures) used with co-occurrence data in the
scientometrics community (2009).

The authors identify two major categories of normalization

techniques: (1) Direct Similarity Measures (cosine, inclusion index, Jaccard index, generalized similarity
index, and association strength) and (2) Indirect Similarity Measures (Bhattacharyya distance, cosine
[different from previous], Jensen-Shannon distance, Pearson correlation, and chi-squared distance). As to
indirect similarity measures, Leydesdorff has stated that “[f]or purposes of visualization, the cosine is the
preferred measure for the reasons given by Ahlgren et al. [(Ahlgren et al., 2003)]” (Leydesdorff, 2008).
While having previously analyzed Indirect Similarity Measures (Van Eck & Waltman, 2008), the authors
conclude that Direct Similarity Measures are “closer to the intuitive idea of similarity” as used for
normalization by the scientometrics community (Van Eck & Waltman, 2009, p. 1645). The authors make
this assertion because indirect similarity measures rely on the overall co-occurrence profiles of two items
28

being compared. Thus, items that have similar co-occurrence profiles but no direct co-occurrence will still
be considered highly related. Indirect Similarity Measures have traditionally been used for author cocitation analysis (Van Eck & Waltman, 2009, p. 1635).
Direct Similarity Measures can further be broken down into two categories: (A) Set-Theoretic
Similarity Measures (cosine, inclusion index, Jaccard index and generalized similarity index) and (B)
Probabilistic Similarity Measures (association strength).

Van Eck and Waltman demonstrate that

Probabilistic Similarity Measures such as the association strength are better than Set-Theoretic Similarity
Measures as the later “do not properly correct for size effects” (Van Eck & Waltman, 2009, p. 1648). The
two authors also note that “[t]he cosine seems to be the most popular direct similarity measure in the field
of scientometrics” (2009, p. 1638). Based on theoretical and empirical observations, Van Eck and
Waltman concluded that the association strength normalization transformation is the best direct similarity
measure. There have been additional discussions as to what properties good normalization measures
should have (Egghe, 2010a, 2010b; Egghe & Leydesdorff, 2009).
There has been some discussion in the information science literature as to whether or not to normalize
symmetrical co-occurrence (pairwise association) matrices.

Leydesdorff and Vaughan argued

symmetrical co-citation matrixes should not be normalized prior to the application of spatialization
techniques such as MDS (Leydesdorff & Vaughan, 2006). This assertion was refuted by Waltman and
Van Eck (2007) and in turn rebutted by Leydesdorff (2007). At least one group of scholars has found
that raw, non-normalized values consistently underperform normalized values of a symmetrical cooccurrence matrix when spatialized (Boyack et al., 2005; Klavans & Boyack, 2006a).
2.3.2 Ordination/Spatialization Techniques
Once pair-wise similarity has been obtained in a co-occurrence matrix, an ordination or spatial layout
must be performed to visualize the data. While there are many different techniques (Börner, 2010, p. 62;
Börner et al., 2003; Wilkinson & Friendly, 2009), three specific approaches are commonly used in the
production of domain maps. They are: multidimensional scaling (MDS); the VOS mapping technique
29

(visualization of similarities) and its corresponding software platform, VOSviewer (Van Eck & Waltman,
2010); and spring force layout algorithms.
2.3.2.1 MDS
MDS is a structural modeling technique that takes a multitude of pair-wise associations, conceptualized as
a scaled unit of distance between the pairings of any two particular concepts, and reduces all such pairings
to a finite number of dimensions (Kruskal & Wish, 1978). It is this dimensionality reduction that allows
one to begin to understand the structure inherent in a summation of all of the pair-wise associations. The
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm is freely available in the R statistical software package (R
Project). Poole has remarked that the MDS process is analogous to taking the mileage matrix of miles
between cities found on many highway maps and creating a spatial distribution of the cities from that
matrix (Poole, 2005). See also (Leydesdorff, 2014).
MDS iteratively seeks to optimize a stress function and begins from an initial solution that is
oftentimes chosen at random. This results in solutions that vary in appearance. However, the Proxscal
version of MDS implemented in SPSS (IBM Corp., 2010) uses the simplex initial configuration and
behaves deterministically unless another initial configuration is chosen. This means that repeated
processing of the data will produce similar spatial distributions. However, the image might be inverted up
or down or left to right. In other words, the layout is invariant except for rotation and mirroring.
Deterministic spatializations using the same scaled axes are important for making numerical comparisons
as to the movement of particular course subjects when comparing domain maps representing different
time periods. Also with MDS, the axes of the distributed points can often be interpreted by such
continuums as liberal to conservative or theoretical to pragmatic.
2.3.2.2 VOS
The VOS (visualization of similarities) mapping technique and its software platform, VOSviewer, is
an alternative to MDS (Van Eck & Waltman, 2010). “The idea of the VOS mapping technique is to
30

minimize a weighted sum of the squared Euclidean distances between all pairs of items. The higher the
similarity between two items, the higher the weight of their squared distance in the summation” (Van Eck
& Waltman, 2010, p. 531). As to co-occurrence data, the creators of the VOS technique contend that it is
superior to MDS because it avoids two common artifacts of MDS: (1) “the tendency to locate the most
important items in the center of a map and less important items in the periphery;” and (2) “the tendency to
locate items in a circular structure” (Van Eck et al., 2010, p. 2414). VOS purposefully produces results
that are deterministic. “It is of course important that VOSviewer produces consistent results. The same
co-occurrence matrix should therefore always yield the same map (ignoring differences caused by local
optima)” (Van Eck & Waltman, 2010, p. 532). As with MDS, the VOS layout is invariant and in this case
not even susceptible to rotation and mirroring unless commanded by the user.
2.3.2.3 Spring Force Algorithms
Spring force algorithms, also known as force directed placement algorithms, are particularly useful in
visualizing network data. The algorithms work as if the aggregate pair-wise similarities in the data were
forces, like rubber bands, pulling with different strengths on the various concepts. Spring Force layout
algorithms are embedded in the Pajek network analysis software (Batagelj & Mrvar, 1998). FruchtermanReingold (1991) and Kamada-Kawai (1989) are used frequently. Depending on the implementation of
the layout algorithms, the network visualizations are most often stochastic. This means that repeated
processing of the data will produce different images. However, with complex node and link structures,
the large-scale morphology will be more or less the same. But, the orientation may be different (left/right
and up/down) and some nodes will be slightly different compared to each other. It is important to note
that spring force algorithms (like MDS, VOS) can be run with predefined initial parameters to make them
deterministic.

31

2.3.3 Cluster Analysis and the QAP Technique
Cluster analysis, or aggregation, is used to “identify data entities with common attribute values or dense
connectivity patterns” (Börner, 2010, p. 50). It is a means of achieving insight through simplification.
For a good review of the subject, see (Fortunato, 2010). Furthermore, cluster analysis facilitates cognitive
chunking. Well-defined regions on a domain map allow a viewer to perform regional chunking and to
develop hierarchical memory structures based on those regions (MacEachren, 2004, pp. 78-79, 107).
This, in turn, facilitates image memory and the learnability of the domain map. Well-defined regions can
be identified through cluster analysis. Two common cluster techniques used in the scientometrics
literature are factor analysis and k-means clustering. Additionally, QAP analysis is a means of comparing
two matrices of similarity data to obtain how similar the underlying networks are in terms of their
structure. These techniques are discussed further below.
2.3.3.1 Factor Analysis
“Factor analysis is a complex algebraic method used to discover patterns among the variations in values
of several variables. This is done essentially through the generation of artificial dimensions (factors) that
correlate highly with several of the real variables and that are independent of one another” (Babbie, 2004,
p. 455). Scientometricians have used factor analysis to identify clusters of topics in a domain
(Leydesdorff et al., 2011; Leydesdorff & Rafols, 2009; Moya-Anegón et al., 2007). Usually, factor
analysis is performed on normalized data. Exploratory factor analysis is when the amount of factors or
principle components is not known ahead of time and a researcher is trying to determine the amount of
factors present. “[T]he criterion for the optimization in the case of factor analysis is no longer to explain
as much variance as possible in the data, but to find common factors in the set that explain the covariance
between the variables” (Leydesdorff & Rafols, 2009, p. 352). Covariance in this sense means that two or
more variables react in predictable ways when acted upon by an outside force.

32

2.3.3.2 K-Means
“K-means clustering consists of a greedy-algorithm which iteratively assigns items to a pre-determined
number of clusters to optimize both inter-cluster distance and intra-cluster cohesion. It therefore belongs
to a class of unsupervised clustering algorithms which includes Kohonen self-organizing maps
[(Kohonen, 1995)] and automated probabilistic classifiers such as decision-tree learners [(Tufekci,
1993)]” (Bollen & Van de Sompel, 2006, pp. 233-234). The algorithm has a complex history that is well
described in (Zitt et al., 2011, p. 23). K-means clustering has been used by scientometricians to identify
clusters in a domain analysis (Bollen & Van de Sompel, 2006; Boyack et al., 2005; Gomez et al., 2009).
It requires the number of resultant clusters, k, to be supplied ahead of time (Norusis, 2005) and can either
be stochastic or deterministic dependent on its implementation. Frequently, k-means cluster analysis is
performed over a range of predetermined cluster amounts (5, 10, 15, 20 etc.), and when stochastic, with
multiple iterations for each cluster amount. Additionally, the cluster results are often validated against
another source of group similarity that is frequently determined by human input.
2.3.3.3 QAP Analysis
The QAP (quadratic assignment problem) procedure (Lawler, 1963), also known as quadratic assignment
procedure, “considers a set of objects to be assigned on a set of available locations, considering the flow
between all of the objects, and the distances between all of the locations, aiming to minimize the overall
flow cost” (Inostroza-Ponta et al., 2007, p. 157). While QAP analysis has been used to cluster items
(Inostroza-Ponta et al., 2007), it is primarily used by the scientometrics community to ascertain the
similarity of two or more networks based on their underlying similarity matrices (Ni et al., 2013; White et
al., 2004). The implementation of the QAP algorithm most often used appears to be the one in UCINET
(Borgatti et al., 2002). The network matrices being compared must be of equal size and completely
square (same number of rows as columns). Also, the column and row headers should be organized
(sorted) the same way. The procedure gives a correlation coefficient between two or more networks as to
33

the likelihood of a large value in one cell of the network matrix corresponding to a similarly sized number
in the corresponding cell in the other network matrix. The procedure handles statistical significance by
running numerous (e.g. 5000) permutations of the scrambled matrixes (rows and columns both
permutated) in order to establish the frequency that a similar coefficient value happens by chance. If a
similar or larger coefficient happens by chance below or at the standard 5% of all random permutations,
the correlation coefficient is said to be statistically significant to the 95% confidence interval.
2.3.4 Studies that Compare Different Techniques
Studies that compare different map production techniques either in comparison with themselves or to an
external standard (“statistical validation” (Boyack et al., 2005, p. 354)) are informative as to which
normalization, ordination (spatialization), and clustering approaches should be used. Klavans and Boyack
compared different normalization techniques for both intercitation and co-citation rates for 7121 journals
at the journal level (2006a). The authors articulated a framework of criteria for choosing the input
measures and normalization that consists of four components: (1) accuracy, (2) coverage, (3) scalability,
and (4) robustness.

Accuracy is further broken down into local accuracy and global accuracy. Local

accuracy is a measure of how well individual items are indicated as being similar relative to some
independent (external) source of similarity. Global accuracy is a measure of how well clusters of
individual items relate to other clusters. Coverage is “the percentage of unique tokens that are identified
for a specific threshold of relatedness” (2006a, p. 253). Scalability is how easily the normalization
measure can be applied to large datasets. Robustness is a measure of how accurate the normalized data is
after ordination. It also refers to how sensitive a solution is to noise. In other words, when random values
are added to a certain percentage of the input data, what is the amount that the layout and cluster solutions
are affected.
For their initial paper, Klavans and Boyack (2006a) only looked at local accuracy as opposed to
global accuracy. The authors used rankings of the similarity values between any two journals for each
normalization scheme, as opposed to the actual normalized values, to compare the different input
34

measures and normalization techniques. The authors used the rankings approach as it is not possible to
directly compare the values from different normalization techniques as the values will vary greatly in
magnitude between any two techniques while being consistent in magnitude within a particular technique.
Klavans and Boyack found that local accuracy actually increased after ordination for all of the
normalization techniques. This may be a result of the fact that the authors did not use the full similarity
matrix for ordination, but rather only the 15 highest ranking similarities for each journal.

While

intercitation data (not available to the author in the course-subject context) out performed co-citation data,
the best normalized measures for each, at high coverage, were the cosine and K50 (a modified cosine
technique). The same authors, with the addition of Börner, used the same data (7121 journals) and
comparative standard (ISI journal category assignments) to assess the global accuracy (relationships
between clusters) of their data (Boyack et al., 2005). The authors used a mutual information measure (zscore) from genomics research (Gibbons & Roth, 2002) to compare clusters of content for different
normalization approaches after their ordination using VxOrd, with cluster information from ISI journal
category assignments. K-means clustering at several different cluster sizes was used and the authors
concluded that for co-citation data, the K50 normalization technique produced the best global accuracy
with clusters that were balanced and not too tight (Boyack et al., 2005).

2.4 Validation
Domain maps should be validated (Börner, 2010, pp. 50-51) in order to verify their structural accuracy to
the furthest extent possible. Validation has traditionally occurred in one of two ways: (1) examination by
experts in the domain, and (2) consistency with extrinsic (from outside the data or technique) sources of
structure of the domain (McCain, 1985). Ideally, it’s best to use both methods as few experts, and in
some cases no experts, have global knowledge of an entire, large domain. Additionally, there is both
local and global accuracy (Klavans & Boyack, 2006a). Domain experts might be particularly good as to
local accuracy for map regions that most closely match their subject expertise. As to legal academia with
35

only up to 104 controlled course-subjects, it is possible that some domain experts will have a sense of the
global structure. However, it is still prudent to validate CSCO maps with extrinsic sources of structure
that do not involve domain experts.
2.4.1 Validation by Experts
The long tradition of validating domain maps through the use of experts has been surveyed and
summarized in an article by Klavans & Boyack (2006a). Katherine McCain was one of the first to
thoroughly explore the topic in her doctoral dissertation (McCain, 1985). In order to validate her domain
maps, McCain obtained the opinions of experts (“subjective similarity judgments”) by having them sort
cards containing the names of scholars into piles based on similarity. She then converted these results
into a similarity matrix and performed MDS and cluster analysis on the data. McCain concluded that the
maps produced from the card sort analysis were sufficiently similar to the author co-citation analysis
(ACA) maps she produced of the same domain so as to validate the ACA maps. She made this
conclusion after a statistical technique called canonical correlation that compares the plotting of all of the
points on the two maps to see if they are correlated to a high degree beyond random chance. In another
example of using human expertise, Tijssen had fourteen subject experts create mental maps of the domain
of neural-networks which he then connected together and proposed using to validate domain maps created
from bibliometric data (1993). Skupin, Biberstine, and Börner, also used subject experts to validate and
comment on a large scale map of the medical sciences (2013).
2.4.2 Validation by Extrinsic Sources of Data
The validation of domain maps through the use of extrinsic sources of data can take one of two forms: (1)
empirical data not reliant on human judgment, and (2) extrinsic sources of structure that are also based on
expert opinion (taxonomies, table of contents, essays on the structure of a domain, etc.).

36

2.4.2.1 Extrinsic Empirical Data
Klavans and Boyack used textual coherence to compare the accuracy of two maps of the same domain but
produced using different methods (Klavans & Boyack, 2011). Using title and abstract data for papers in
the domain, the authors applied word probability vector techniques to arrive at clustering and structural
data independent of the citation-based methods used to spatially portray the domain. The authors cite
other studies that use similar textual analyses to assess cluster quality: (Boyack & Klavans, 2010; Braam
et al., 1991a; Glänzel & Czerwon, 1996; Janssens et al., 2006; Janssens et al., 2009; Jarneving, 2007).
These are all examples of empirical, extrinsic validation techniques that do not rely on human
categorization or organization.
2.4.2.2 Extrinsic Expert Opinions
Additionally, many domain maps have been validated based on a comparison with knowledge
organization systems created by human judgment.

For instance, Klavans and Boyack, used the

disciplinary category assigned to journals by human indexers and abstracters to assess the accuracy of the
spatial adjacencies of their domain maps (Boyack et al., 2005; Klavans & Boyack, 2006a, 2006b).

2.5 Indicia of Structure of Law School Courses
In addition to validating the course-subject co-occurrence maps by having domain experts do a card sort
and interviewing them about the maps, the course-subject maps should be validated using extrinsic
sources of structure. As full-text electronic versions of legal academic textbooks are not easily available
for textual validation, this dissertation validated the maps from several extrinsic sources of structure that
are products of human judgment. The first is the syndetic structure (‘see also’ statements) inherent in the
AALS listings of teachers by subject. The second are the course-subjects that have either merged or
diverged throughout the years as set out in the same AALS listings of teachers by subject. The third is
Jackson and Gee’s 1975 grouping of 33 larger categories of law school courses. See Appendix 1:
Crosswalk between Jackson & Gee Categories and AALS Subjects. The fourth is the contemporary,
37

2011, super groupings of academic subjects from the Current Index to Legal Periodicals. See Appendix
2: Organization of the Current Index to Legal Periodicals.
In addition, Kennedy structurally described the law school curriculum (1983). Kennedy asserted that
at the core of legal academia are doctrinal courses. See Figure 14. Doctrinal courses are the pillar of the
common law and include contracts, property, and torts. These courses are also private law courses—legal
matters between individuals and/or businesses that do not involve the government. It is around these
doctrinal courses that all other courses are situated. These other courses include the following types:
public law (involving the government), clinical, legal process, interdisciplinary, and policy-oriented. It
will be interesting to see if the doctrinal courses, which are also first-year courses, are as central on the
CSCO domain maps of legal academia as conceptualized by Kennedy.

2.6 Use of AALS Course-Subjects by Legal Scholars
An additional source of validation of either the structural aspects or the metric analysis of the dissertation
is claims made by scholars related to the AALS course-subjects. Garvin used the AALS “List of
Teachers by Subject” data to bolster his assertion that commercial law is “a dying field, and one with few
signs of revival” (2007, p. 403). Garvin compared the number of commercial law professors with those in
criminal law (‘a stable field’) and intellectual property (‘a booming field’) over a forty year timespan
38

1965-66 to 2005-06. Commercial law saw a marked decline relative to those two other fields. Garvin
also lamented the comparative aging of commercial law noting that “[y]oung scholars tend to be more
productive than their seniors” and that “[a]n aging field will tend to produce less scholarship and thus
figure less in the minds of prospective law teachers” (Garvin, 2007, pp. 408-409).

Additionally,

Michigan law professor Layman Allen used the counts of faculty members teaching environmental law,
law and medicine, and legal process to show that survey data reporting the number of law schools
conducting jurimetrics (“the scientific investigation of legal problems”) might be low (1975).

2.7 Additional Claims about Law School Courses
Stadler made assertions about which legal subjects were waning in interest, and which were on the rise
(2006). The author hand coded fifty-eight years of the Harvard Law Review (1946-2003) by correlating
article content with law school course-subjects. She also coded if the article was written by a student
(usually called a ‘note’ or ‘comment’) or by a non-student law professor or other legal professional.
Using normalized values and a metric that captured the incidence of the number of student written articles
on a particular topic exceeding non-student written articles, Stadler made judgments as to which subjects
were popular and which were not. She couched her recommendations in the language of Wall Street and
catered her recommendations for lawyers wishing to become law professors in terms of strong buys, 10
weak buys, 11 weak sells, 12 and strong sells. 13

2.8 Literature Review Summary
The research described above is the ‘prior art’ in terms of studies that perform spatial and longitudinal
studies of disciplines. Their very existence lends support to the desire to see how the legal canon of

10

Strong Buys: bankruptcy, education, energy, family and gender, health, labor and employment, and tax law.
Weak Buys: alternative dispute resolution, first amendment, intellectual property, international and comparative, international
trade, ‘law ands,’ and media law.
12
Weak Sells: civil procedure, evidence, contracts, corporations, criminal law and procedure, elections, legal history, property,
and tort law.
13
Strong Sells: administrative, antitrust, commercial, constitutional, environmental, jurisprudence, admiralty, and trusts and
estates.

course-subjects in the United States has developed over time. Furthermore, the use of CSCO data to
produce domain maps for law school education is supported by the numerous and diverse uses of other
co-occurrence studies to map and visualize domains. Also, this research has been performed with and
informed and motivated by: the specific techniques used by previous scientometricians to create and
validate domain maps; the data that exists to validate the legitimacy of CSCO maps in the context of law
school education; and studies that make use of and evaluate changes in the law school curriculum.

40

3. Methods, Data, and Data Collection
This dissertation was completed in the following eleven steps. (1) Prior studies on the longitudinal
analysis of disciplines were researched to inform the author’s research questions and methods. (2) The
author and student workers harvested course-subject data from the AALS directories and stored it in a
relational database. (3) The author and student workers harvested “list[s] of teachers by subject’ from
AALS directories and stored them in the same relational database. (4) The author produced the cooccurrence matrix of CSCO events for the studied time slices: 1931-32, 1972-73, and 2010-11. (5) The
author derived a ‘gold-standard’ of related course-subject pairs based on five external sources of coursesubject topical similarity that included a card sort exercise with 18 experts in legal education. (6) The
author normalized the co-occurrence data using three different techniques and evaluated which was most
accurate when compared to the gold-standard. (7) The author used each of the three different sets of
normalized and raw values and spatially rendered them using three different ordination techniques. (8)
The spatialized results were compared to the gold-standard to ascertain which was most accurate. (9) The
author employed two different clustering techniques and compared them to the card-sort similarity matrix.
(10) The best clustering data as well as additional thematic data was overlaid on the most accurate map
for map year 2010-11. (11) Domain maps for 1931-32 and 1972-73 were produced from the best
normalization and ordination techniques as determined by the analysis of the 2010-11 data compared to
the gold-standard. See Figure 15 for a schematic representation of the different treatments applied to the
different map making steps.

3.1 AALS Data
The Association of American Law Schools (AALS) was founded in 1900 (AALS, 2013) and is the main
learned society for law school professors in the United States. Its purpose is “the improvement of the
legal profession through legal education” (AALS, 2010b). Presently, very few law schools in the United
States are not members of the AALS. However, at its inception and by design, the AALS was much more
exclusive. The early motivation for the creation of the AALS was to promote law schools that had fulltime students and full-time faculty. The AALS actively lobbied against and excluded profitable, often
proprietary, part-time law schools (and/or night schools) which the AALS regarded as having lower
standards (Mazza, 1998; Stevens, 1983, pp. 96-103). In 1921, there were 142 law schools in the United

42

States (Reed, 1921, p. 443). However, in 1922, there were only 55 law schools that were members of the
AALS (AALS, 1923).
Since 1922, the AALS has produced an annual directory of its members that contains biographical
information about law professors, administrators, and librarians at each member school (AALS, 1923).
See Appendix 3: AALS Directories—Titles, Content, and Notes. Each directory contains a list of
faculty members by school for that particular year. Also, beginning in academic year 1931-32 (AALS,
1931), and appearing in most years thereafter, the AALS directories include lists of what subjects were
taught by which faculty member. This information is contained in the lists of “Law Teachers by Subject.”
See Appendix 3.

Much of the information contained within the AALS Directories was manually

harvested pursuant to a grant from the Law School Admission Council.
3.1.1 LSAC Grant
The Law School Admission Council (LSAC) is a nonprofit corporation founded in 1947 that administers
the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) (LSAC, 2010a). The LSAC also awards grants to study legal
education and the legal profession (LSAC, 2010b). In November 2006, the Law School Admission
Council (‘LSAC’) funded a two-year grant on the longitudinal analysis of legal scholarship.14 Originally,
and as funded, there were four co-principal investigators (PI’s) 15 and two ‘other key personnel’ 16—
including the author in the latter category. However, shortly after work started on the grant, the author
was made a co-PI in light of the substantial contribution that he would make towards the project.17 The
work that resulted from the grant produced an extensive infrastructure from which to conduct an analysis
of the legal academy’s production, content, and consumption of scholarship.

School of Law, (3) Kenneth G. Dau-Schmidt (Indiana University—Maurer School of Law, and (4) Andrew Morriss (University

16
Mark A. Newton (database consultant) and Peter A. Hook (librarian consultant).
17
This was accomplished via a phone conversation between Ann Gallagher of the LSAC and Bill Henderson and was
subsequently memorialized in an email to Ann Gallagher dated March 6, 2007 10:14 A.M from Bill Henderson: “Peter Hook,
who is currently listed as project consultant, will be added as a principal investigator. We are doing this because Peter's
knowledge of both library science and information systems are proving indispensable to several facets of the project. The change
in his designation reflects his anticipated contribution.”
15

43

This infrastructure is in the form of a large-scale, relational database that incorporates information
from the Association of American Law Schools (‘AALS’) annual directories of law teachers. The author
worked extensively with the database consultant, Mark Newton, to both structure the database and to
choose which data elements to harvest so as to yield the greatest benefit for subsequent bibliometric
studies. As pertains to this data, all co-PI’s have given their express consent for the author to exclusively
investigate CSCO events to produce spatial representations of the topic space of law school course
subjects for purposes of this doctoral dissertation.
3.1.2 Law Teacher Universe (1922 – 1989)
A threshold question for the LSAC grant analysis was who is/was in the American legal academy. In
order to answer this question, the co-PI’s oversaw the harvesting of data from the AALS directories of
law teachers from their inception in 1922-23 until 1989-90. This component of the relational database
infrastructure is referred to as the ‘Law Teacher Universe.’ The co-PI’s hired up to seven student workers
at a time to do manual, data-entry utilizing an intelligent database template and rigorous logistics to help
manage the work flow. Over the course of a year and a half, the students harvested all of the data from
the lists of “Law Teachers by School.”
The resulting Law Teacher Universe includes the full names of over 37,000 professors, lecturers,
librarians, and administrators. Aggregated from the values captured for each academic year, the Law
Teacher Universe includes each instructor’s employment history at an AALS law school.

This

employment information, along with occasional reliance on the full biographical information about an
author, enabled the student workers to disambiguate the identities of individuals with similar first and last
names. The PI’s took extensive steps to insure that the Law Teacher Universe contains very few merged
or duplicate records for individual law school teachers.
The data includes 179 schools located in the United States, twenty-two located in Canada (most
appearing after 1975 with the inception of the separate ‘Canadian Law Teachers by School’ list in
44

academic year 1976-77 (AALS, 1976)), three located in Puerto Rico, and one located in the Philippines
(during the time it was a territory of the United States). See Appendix 4: Law School Information. The
data includes 8,318 ‘school faculty events’—all faculty members, by school, for a particular directory
year. Furthermore, there were over 267,800 ‘affiliation events’—each faculty member’s affiliation by
year. In other words, the co-PI’s captured year by year listings of every person’s academic affiliation as
reported in the AALS directories.
After each directory year was inputted using the method described above, students validated the
results. Comparing printouts (or screen views) from the database’s listing of faculty members by school
for a particular directory year with photocopied pages from the AALS directories, the students made sure
that the two lists were identical. The law schools included in the AALS Directories are not the complete
universe of law schools in the United States. In fact, as the AALS became more established as an
organization, more schools joined. The following chart gives the number of schools included in the
AALS directories and the amount of ABA accredited law schools (still in existence during the present
day) for a given year. After 1960-61, all, or close to all of the ABA accredited schools are included in the
AALS directories. See Table 1. What is not known is the amount of law schools that were both not in
the AALS directories and not accredited by the ABA for each time period.

Throughout the data harvesting process, the co-PI’s were on guard against two types of mistakes: (1)
conflating distinct individuals with the same name as the same person, and (2) creating multiple unique
ID’s for the same person. Mistake type 1 was combated by looking at the full biographical information
when the facts were anomalous—person was teaching for a long period of time or concurrently in widely
separated locations. A notebook was kept that detailed such problems until they could be corrected by one
of the principal investigators or the database consultant.
Mistake type 2 was combated through an intensive effort by one of the student workers. The student
sorted the list of faculty members in the database (‘Law Teacher Universe’) and identified all of the same,
or near equivalent names (differing by one or two letters, or a near equivalent first or middle name—
Albert Abel; Albert S. Abel; Albert Salisbury Abel; or Gary J. Abraham; Gerald Abraham). The student
had in front of her affiliation data and dates for the potential duplicates. When necessary, she consulted
additional biographical information about the people from the full biographical entries in the directories
(law school and undergraduate institution attended, work history, publications, etc.).

In those

circumstances in which the student could be reasonably certain that the person was the same (by a
‘preponderance of the evidence standard’), the unique ID’s were merged into one and a paper trail was
created documenting this process. This was an investment of several weeks of student worker time.
However, as over seven hundred people with multiple ID’s were detected and merged, this made the
dataset significantly more accurate.
3.1.3 AALS Subjects Taught By Year
Another key item of information that the co-PI’s captured was the course-subjects appearing in the list of
“Law Teachers by Subject.” Beginning in academic year 1931-32 (AALS, 1931) and appearing in most
years thereafter the AALS directories include lists of all of the teachers that taught a particular course-

46

subject. 18 These lists represent the ‘canon’ of law course-subjects for a particular year and changed
remarkably over time. They reveal a great amount of information about the advent of new coursesubjects and the merging, diverging, or removal of others. Furthermore, these are ‘controlled’ coursesubjects. While controlled from the outset by unknown individuals, after some uncertain date, survey
respondents chose from a preselected list (‘canon’) of course-subjects supplied by the AALS. The
appearance of the survey instrument sent to each faculty member and first published in the directory itself
in academic year 1968-69, reveals the instructions used to collect this data:
10. SUBJECTS TAUGHT: Include subject titles and code numbers appearing on the List of
Subjects on the back page of the Instruction Sheet. Choose those which are the nearest
equivalents to the actual titles of your courses. If your subject or a near equivalent does not
appear in the List, you may include it if, and only if, it is an entirely new subject of general
interest not heretofore in the curriculum of the schools. Indicate with “X” the subjects you
will be teaching during the coming school year. After each subject, indicate “S” if a seminar
and either “A” for those taught 1-5 years, “B” for those taught 6-10 years, or “C” for those
taught over 10 years (e.g., Agency 040 C X, Torts 730 B X, Trusts and Estates 760 S A.) You
should be listed only under subjects (1) in which you are now teaching or (2) in which you
are an experienced teacher and wish to continue to be recognized. [Emphasis in the
original.] (AALS, 1969b, p. 9).
It is assumed that prior to law faculty selecting from a controlled list of course-subjects, slightly diverging
subjects were collected into controlled groupings by the producers of the list of “Law Teachers by
Subject.”
3.1.3.1 Binning by Years Taught
Furthermore, in all lists of “Teachers by Subject,” the teachers are grouped into bins as to the length they
have taught a particular subject: (1) “One to five years,” (2) “Six to ten years,” (3) or “Over ten years.”

18

More recently, some have asserted that faculty members are not entirely honest in reporting this data. (1) “[The] list of “Law
Teachers by Subject” is more fiction than fact. The explanation has to do with intellectual curiosity, I think: When asked to list
the subjects in which she has an interest, what scholar would not select as many subjects as she could? She might not be
teaching courses or writing articles on those subjects now, but as a fictional Atlantan famously declared, “After all, tomorrow is
another day” (Stadler, 2006, p. 41). (2) An Indiana University Maurer School of Law professor also told the author that faculty
members had an incentive to say they are teaching a lot of subjects early. That way, they will reach the “over ten year” category
faster and they will be more marketable when they go on the job market for a lateral transition. (3) Another Indiana University
Maurer School of Law professor told the author that he claims that he teaches certain subjects when he does not because he wants
publishers to send him free evaluation copies of casebooks for those subjects.

47

This additional information is helpful in making determinations as to the experience a particular instructor
has in a subject area.
3.1.3.2 Harvested Data
Data as to course-subjects taught was harvested for five academic years by the student workers: 1931-32;
1941-42; 1949-50; 1961-62; and 1972-73. Additionally, the author harvested course-subjects data for
1932-33 as well as 2010-11. As to the 2010-11 data, this was not incorporated into the relational database
but exists as a stand-alone database. Unfortunately, in the more recent years, there were widespread
redundancies in the lists of teachers by subject that would have otherwise corrupted the count
information. Teachers were frequently listed several times under the same time bin (one to five years, six
to ten years, over ten years) and frequently in more than one time bin. For academic year 2010-11, there
was a duplication rate of 8.3%. Worse, some course-subjects had a much higher duplication rate. The
highest was 26% for the course-subject, Intellectual Property. The duplicates were removed so that a
faculty member appeared only once under each course-subject and in the highest time bin in which his or
her name appears. The clean totals for the map years of interest (1931-32, 1972-73, and 2010-11) are set
out in Table 2. Data for the remaining years has not been cleaned for redundancies.

3.1.3.3 Syndetic Structure
Syndetic structure refers to “[c]ross-reference links between descriptors or headings in an indexing
system” (Anderson & Pérez-Carballo, 2005) (e.g. ‘related to,’ ‘broader than,’ ‘narrow than,’ ‘use for,’
etc.). Syndetic structure appears in the controlled, AALS list of course-subjects taught as one of four
types: (1) statements of inclusion, (2) ‘see’ statements, (3) ‘see also’ statements, and (4) ‘cross-referenced
under’ statements. (The latter three manifestations have the same meaning.) Below are some examples
of each:
Includes – “International Transactions (Includes Common Market, Foreign Patents,
International Policies, International Taxation and Regional Organizations)” (AALS, 1963, p.
389).
See – “Titles (See Conveyances)” (AALS, 1938, p. 220).
See Also – “Suretyship (See also Securities)” (AALS, 1935, p. 180).
Cross-Referenced Under – “Financial Institutions (Cross-referenced under Regulated
Industries)” (AALS, 2004, p. 1239).
All permutations of the course-subjects as they varied year by year, including the syndetic structure, have
been captured in the AALS database. They reveal the growth and evolution of the academic field of law
as conceptualized by the AALS survey instrument. The ‘includes’ statements are particularly helpful in
determining which subjects were folded into later subjects. See Appendix 5: Subjects in AALS Lists of
Teachers by Subject and Appendix 6: AALS Subject Changes, Year by Year. In fact, the ‘includes’
statements were the only method to conclusively track the particularly byzantine convergence of five
topics into one (Estates and Trusts), see Figure 25.

Most importantly, this knowledge allows for

longitudinal comparisons by making sure that the course-subject bins appropriately account for the
evolution of topics (mergers, divisions, and entirely new topics).
The most recent, completely new subjects added were ‘Disability Law’ and ‘National Security Law’
(AALS, 2009, pp. 1469-1470). The database captures whether the subjects are compound ‘C’ (have
49

‘includes’ statements), simple ‘S’ (no ‘includes’ statements), or involve cross-references ‘see also or
‘cross-referenced under’ without any ‘includes’ statement (“R”). Any topic that was ever a top level
subject in its own right is labeled as a ‘Subject.’ Those topics which only appear as nested includes
within a larger topic are labeled as ‘Includes.’
3.1.3.4 Uncontrolled Subjects
Uncontrolled subjects, those not governed by the pre-populated list provided to all survey recipients,
appear in the classes taught portion of a faculty member’s full biography. This is most likely the place to
look to detect the first appearance of a particular subject being taught.

3.2 Conversion of Two Mode Network to Single Mode Network
As harvested and stored in the database, the teacher/course-subject events were stored as a two mode, arc
list. This consisted of teachers affiliated with (or pointing to) a single course-subject that they taught for a
particular directory year. (Individual teachers could be listed multiple times for each of the different
subjects that they taught during a directory year.) To be visualized, this two mode network had to be
collapsed to a single mode network—counts of the incidence of course-subjects being taught together by
the same teacher (CSCO). In other words, the teachers had to be removed from the network leaving only
course-subjects and how often they were taught together. While there are several different ways to do
this, as done in this dissertation, the first step was to utilize a database program (Microsoft Access) and a
crosstab query to obtain a list of each faculty member and the one or more courses they taught for the
given year on the same row of a table. Each course that an individual taught was in a different column.
Next columns were manipulated in a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) to obtain all different pairings of the
different course-subjects a person taught.
For those incidences of individuals teaching only one course-subject for a particular academic year,
this resulted in no pairwise co-occurrences of course-subjects and these events were not reflected in the
single mode network. If a person taught two course-subjects, this resulted in only one pairwise co50

occurrence. If a person taught three course-subjects, this resulted in three pairwise co-occurrences. If a
person taught four course-subjects, this resulted in six pairwise occurrences, and so forth. The general
formula for the number of pairwise occurrences for some number of items in a group consisting of x
different items is: (x * (x-1))/2. Thus, if a person taught five different course-subjects in a given year this
results in 10 pairwise co-occurrences ((5 * 4) /2), or ten pairwise counts of two different course-subjects
being taught together relative to one another. These are the desired CSCO counts. While producing such
pairwise co-occurrences, the smaller of each of the two unique identifier numbers for each course was
kept on the right of its pairing with a larger course-subject identifier number. This made it easy to query a
database to obtain the counts of how often two course-subjects were taught by the same faculty member.
This revised edge list consisting of all pairwise co-occurrences with counts was fed into the Sci2 Tool
(Sci2 Team, 2009) to obtain a co-occurrence matrix.

3.3 Map Generation
Scientometricians have articulated six steps for creating domain maps (Börner, 2010, p. 62; Börner et al.,
2003). The following are these steps and their specific implementation in regards to this work. (1) Data
Extraction. Data was harvested from the list of teachers by subject in the annual directories of the
American Association of Law Schools (AALS). (2) Unit of Analysis. This is the course-subjects taught.
(3) Measures. For this research, measures are the co-occurrence counts of the same course-subjects being
taught by the same faculty member. (4) Similarity. For this research, similarity consists of a symmetrical
co-occurrence matrix normalized by variants of the Association Strength technique, the Cosine technique,
and non-normalized (raw) data. (5) Ordination. This step consists of three sub-parts, all applicable to this
dissertation: (5a) Dimensionality Reduction—MDS, and the VOS mapping technique, (5b) Cluster
Analysis—Factor Analysis, K-Means, and QAP Analysis, (5c) Force-Directed Placement—KamadaKawai and Fruchterman-Reingold.

The final step is, (6) Display.

51

Display includes analysis and

interpretation of the maps produced from the best interim techniques when evaluated against the ‘goldstandard.’
3.3.1 Normalization
As discussed in Section 2.3.1 there are numerous ways to normalize co-occurrence data and even
disagreement as to whether co-occurrence data should be normalized prior to ordination.

This

dissertation employs three different normalization treatments: (1) Association Strength, (2) Cosine, and
(3) no normalization (raw). Furthermore, as discussed by Van Eck and Waltman (2009, pp. 1636-1637)
there are two significantly different ways to calculate the denominator for each method: (1) using the total
number of occurrences and (2) using the total number of co-occurrences (column sums). These two
variants lead to potentially different results and should be empirically compared and discussed.
Additionally, Klavans and Boyack (2006a, p. 255) identify another set of variants applicable to each
method—whether or not to include the matrix diagonal (the amount an item occurs in the dataset, or in
other words, co-occurs with itself) in normalization calculations. Klavans and Boyack note that most
scientometricians treat the diagonal as missing when calculating normalization values and the practice is
followed in this dissertation. As applied to this dissertation, the various ways to normalize the data using
the Association Strength and Cosine techniques are set out below.
3.3.1.1 Association Strength
3.3.1.1.1 Association Strength (Van Eck & Waltman, 2007)
Van Eck and Waltman employed the Association Strength normalization technique in a paper that used
the co-occurrence of concepts from abstracts to map the computational intelligence field (2007). In that
work, the “association strength aij for concepts i and j is defined as aij = mcij /ciicjj for i ≠ j, where cij
denotes the number of abstracts in which the concepts i and j both occur, cii denotes the number of
abstracts in which concept i occurs, and m denotes the total number of abstracts” (Van Eck & Waltman,

52

2007, p. 630). As applied to CSCO data used herein, this 2007 version of the Association Strength
normalization formula is:

(total number of teachers per year) x (co-occurrence counts between subjects a and b)
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(count of people teaching subject a) x (count of people teaching subject b).

3.3.1.1.2 Association Strength (Van Eck & Waltman, 2009)
In their 2009 paper analyzing the properties of various normalization measures, Van Eck and Waltman
define Association Strength more simply as one of two variations: (1) the total number of co-occurrences
between objects i and j / ((total number of occurrences of object i) x (total number of occurrences of
object j) or (2) the total number of co-occurrences between objects i and j / ((total number of cooccurrences involving object i) x (total number of co-occurrences involving object j)). Variation (2)
involves column summations of the co-occurrence matrix for each object i and j in the denominator. Van
Eck and Waltman assert that “[b]oth [methods of calculating the denominator] are used in scientometric
research … but [variation 1] seems to be more popular” (2009, p. 1637). In fact, the authors use the first
variation for all of the theoretical analyses in their paper. They also acknowledge the difference between
the method used in their 2007 paper and their 2009 analysis. However, the differences are proportional
and thus the two formulas are not significantly different. As to the two methods of calculating the
denominator (applicable to most normalization methods and not just the Association Strength technique),
this difference appears non-trivial and should be tested against an externally derived gold-standard for
differences in results. As applied to CSCO data used herein, the two versions of the Association Strength
normalization technique are as follows:

53

(1) Association Strength (2009): Total Occurrences Method
(co-occurrence counts between course-subjects a and b)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(count of people teaching course-subject a) x (count of people teaching course-subject b)

(2) Association Strength (2009): Column Totals Method
(co-occurrence counts between course-subjects a and b)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(total co-occurrences involving course-subject a) x (total co-occurrences involving course-subject b)

3.3.1.2 Cosine Normalization
Similarly, cosine normalization also has two variants (Van Eck & Waltman, 2009):

(1) Cosine Total Occurrences Method
(co-occurrence counts between course-subjects a and b)
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

�(count of people teaching course-subject a) x (count of people teaching course-subject b)
(2) Cosine Normalization: Column Totals Method
(co-occurrence counts between course-subjects a and b)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

�(total co-occurrences involving course-subject a) x (total cooccurrences involving course-subject b)
It is worth noting that the cosine normalization formula used by (Boyack et al., 2005; Klavans & Boyack,
2006a) is the column totals method and not the total occurrences method used for the analysis in (Van
Eck & Waltman, 2009).

54

3.3.1.3 Rank Order for Meaningful Comparisons
Similar to the analysis used in (Boyack et al., 2005; Klavans & Boyack, 2006a), a rankings analysis of all
normalized co-occurrence values was used in this dissertation to assess the different normalization
techniques and their denominator variants against a comparative ‘gold-standard’ (see Section 3.5). The
rankings approach was used because it is not possible to directly compare the values from different
normalization techniques as the values vary greatly in magnitude between any two techniques while being
consistent in magnitude within a particular technique. For each normalization technique and variant, the
values in the upper half of the normalized matrix were sorted by the highest normalized value and
assigned a ranking (1,2,3 etc.). 5,356 (((104x104)-104)/2)) pairwise co-occurrence values for the 2010-11
course-subjects were thus placed in rank order. The same values (ties) resulted in the same ranking
number (1,2,3…1247, 1248, 1248, 1250, 1251, etc.). However, there were very few ties with the
exception of the 1,467 course-subject pairs that were never taught by the same faculty member and had a
normalized value of zero. The average of the rankings values for each of the pair of course-subjects
identified as related by the ‘gold-standard’ were then used to evaluate the success or deficiencies of each
normalization technique and their variants as pertains to the CSCO data used in this dissertation. Also,
rank quintiles of how often each of the applicable course-subjects was taught by faculty members were
used in order to evaluate how each normalization technique handled the vastly differing amounts that
course-subjects were taught.
3.3.2 Ordination/Spatialization
After normalization, the next step in domain map creation is ordination/spatialization. This dissertation
employs three different ordination/spatialization treatments: (1) MDS, (2) VOS, and (3) spring force
algorithms. The goal is to convert measures of similarity into a two-dimensional spatial representation of
the course-subjects that employs the distance-similarity metaphor. Each of the normalization treatments
are used as inputs for each of the ordination/spatialization treatments. While producing two-dimensional
55

maps, each treatment also results in a matrix of distances between each of the course-subjects for a
particular map year.

As done with the normalization analysis, each of these distance matrixes is

converted to an edge list with rankings of the distances—from closest (most similar, highest ranking) to
furthest apart (least similar, lowest ranking). These rankings are then compared against the gold-standard
to ascertain which of the ordination/spatialization techniques, with which of the different normalization
treatments, produces the lowest average of the ranked values of the gold-standard pairs of similar coursesubjects.
3.3.2.1 Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
The version of MDS used in this dissertation is Proxscal (Commaneur & Heiser, 1993) as implemented in
SPSS version 19 (IBM Corp., 2010).

For replicability, the applicable decision points in the

implementation of the software are set out in the following footnote.19 SPSS allows one to save out
Viewer Files (.spv) that includes the “Final Coordinates” of each of the course-subjects in the commonspace, Proxscal MDS solution. These x,y values were then correlated with the appropriate course-subjects
for each of the 5,356 possible course-subject pairs (for map year 2010-11). Using this formula:

�((X1 − X2)2 + (Y1 − Y2)2 )

Interval transformation was chosen over ordinal transformation because the data was truly an interval measure—the interval
distances between values are consistent and have meaning (Babbie, 2004, p. 135). This is consistent with the Proxscal help
information on transformations: “TRANSFORMATION offers four different options for optimal transformation of the original
proximities. The resulting values are called transformed proximities. The distances between the objects in the configuration
should
match
these
transformed
proximities
as
closely
as
possible”
http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/spssstat/v20r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.spss.statistics.help%2Fsyn_proxscal_transfor
mation.htm (visited May 9, 2014). Also: “If theoretical or empirical reasons speak for a certain scale level, then it usually makes
sense to pick a corresponding MDS model. In practice, however, one often scales given proximities with both ordinal and interval
MDS: Ordinal MDS normally leads to smaller Stress values, but it can also over-fit the data (rather than smoothing out noise in
the distances) and, occasionally, it can lead to largely meaningless degenerate solutions (Borg et al., 2013, p. 39). This was
consistent with a pretest of the data—interval transformation produced much more intuitively satisfying layouts than ordinal
transformation.

56

distances were calculated for each of the 5,356 course-subject pairs. Rank values were given for each of
these distances—1 to 5,356, with 1 being the closest and 5,356 being the furthest. The average of the
ranking values was calculated for each of the 115 gold-standard pairs and this average was used to
compare results amongst the five different normalization approaches when used as input for the MDS
implementation for map year 2010-11.
3.3.2.2 VOS (Visualization of Similarities)
The version of VOS used in this dissertation was that implemented in VOSViewer version 1.5.4. For
replicability, the applicable decision points in the implementation of the software are set out in the
following footnote. 20 Once created, a map file (.txt) may be saved out of VOSViewer that contains x,y
coordinates for each of the course-subject nodes. A similar analysis as that performed for the MDS
distances was used to obtain the average ranking of the VOS distances of the gold-standard pairs for each
of the five normalization input methods for map year 2010-11.
3.3.2.3 Spring Force Algorithms
The layout of the CSCO data using spring force algorithms was accomplished through the
implementation of those algorithms in the network analysis software, Pajek (Batagelj & Mrvar, 1998),
version Pajek64 3.14. The two algorithms used were: Fruchterman-Reingold (1991) and Kamada-Kawai
(1989). The five input files (for all normalization variants, 2010-11) were the same Pajek formatted input
files used for the VOSViewer analysis.

For replicability, the applicable decision points in the

implementation of the software are as follows. In the draw function, the “meaning of the lines” (edge
weights) is “similarities” as the normalization procedures produced higher edge weights for the more

similar course-subjects. All ordinations using the spring force algorithms, both initially, and as export
files were two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional. Kamada-Kawai Free was used instead of
Kamada-Kawai Separate Components as the dataset did not have any separate, disconnected components.
To obtain x,y coordinates, the rendered layouts were exported as SVG files (SVG General). As spring
force algorithms are stochastic, five iterations were performed for each of the two types of spring force
algorithms and each of the five different normalization variant input values, (2 x (5 x 5)) or 50 treatments
total. Additionally, there are two methodological variants from which to ultimately compare the results of
the spring force ordinations.
3.3.2.3.1 Spring Force Algorithm Method 1

In this method, for each of the normalization variants being tested ((1) Association Strength (2009) Total
Occurrences, (2) Association Strength (2009) Column Totals, (3) Cosine Total Occurrences, (4) Cosine
Column Totals, and (5) Non-Normalized), the results were fully calculated for each of the five iterations
similar to the methodological technique used for the MDS and VOS results. In other words, x,y values
were correlated with the appropriate course-subjects for each of the 5,356 possible course-subject pairs,
distances were calculated, ranking values were assigned, and the average of the 115 gold-standard pair
ranking values was determined. Afterwards, the five separate iteration results were averaged together to
make comparisons between the different normalization approaches as rendered by the specific spring
force algorithm. In other words, this is an average of averages approach.
3.3.2.3.2 Spring Force Algorithm Method 2

In this method, for the five different iterations, all five distances obtained for each of the 5,356 possible
course-subject pairs were averaged. Then, the averaged distances were ranked (1 to 5,356), and the
average of the 115 gold-standard pair ranking values was determined.

58

3.3.3 Clustering
Cluster analysis requires complex and numerous mathematical calculations and is almost always
performed with the aid of statistical software programs. The specific methods, software, and decision
points are set out below for each of the clustering techniques.
3.3.3.1 Factor Analysis
Based on the results of the normalization and ordination analysis, factor analysis was performed on the
best performing normalized 2010-11 data. The matrix of course-subject co-occurrence data, normalized
by the association strength (2009) total occurrences method, was analyzed using SPSS Version 21.0 (IBM
Corp., 2012) to identify principle components, or factors, that aggregate the course-subjects into larger
groupings. 21 Comparisons were then made to the groupings identified by the eighteen human subjects
(see Section 3.6), as well as a similar factor analysis performed on the matrix of course-subjects identified
as similar by the human subjects. This later data did not have to be normalized as all 104 course-subjects
were present for each card sort exercise and had the same opportunity to be identified as similar to each of
the 103 other course-subjects.
3.3.3.2 K-Means
K-means clustering was performed using the algorithm implemented in SPSS Version 21.0 (IBM Corp.,
2012). As K-means analysis is sensitive to the selection of each of its component variants, it is important
to note the decision points made in the analysis. 22 Once again, the CSCO cluster analysis results were

compared against the human subject card sort data to see differences in how the two datasets cluster. The
clustering algorithm was run on both datasets at increasing numbers of predetermined cluster sizes (15,
20, and 25).
3.3.3.2 QAP Analysis
QAP analysis was used to compare the best performing CSCO normalized network (association strength
(2009) total occurrences method) to the card sort matrix of expert determined related course-subjects.
The implementation of the algorithm was that used by UCINET (Borgatti et al., 2002). Both matrixes
were loaded into UCINET after selecting the following path: Tools -> Testing Hypotheses -> Dyadic
(QAP) -> QAP Correlation (old). (Note: The new version of the QAP Correlation did not produce an
observed Pearson correlation value. The MR (multiple regression) options were not appropriate as there
were only two matrices being compared.) The amount of random permutations to test against for
significance was changed from 2500 to 5000.

3.4 Human Subjects
This research involved human subjects in two different ways. First, a large amount of data about
identifiable humans was harvested from the AALS Directories. This included the school affiliation of law
school faculty members and the subjects they taught for the sampled years. As this information is
publically available, it was determined to be not under the purview of the Internal Review Board.
Second, this research involved human subjects answering questions about legal course-subjects and
sorting index cards containing law school course-subjects into piles based on topical similarity. The
eighteen human subjects were law professors, law librarians, and/or legal taxonomers. This part of the
research study was classed as exempt after consideration by the Internal Review Board (IRB) at Indiana

Cluster information for each case; Missing Values, Exclude cases listwise).

the appendix.
3.4.1 Human Subject Demographics
The human subjects that participated in this study included eighteen experts in various aspects of law
school education in the United States. Given the amount of time requested of the subjects (one to two
hours) they were individually contacted by the author and asked to participate. In other words, all
subjects were previously known to the author and had a sufficient affiliation with the author so as to give
of their time uncompensated. Additionally, all willing subjects were accepted into the study. Subjects
were chosen to represent a wide array of subject expertise (Constitutional Law, Criminal Justice,
Evidence, Legal History, Legal Taxonomy, Regulatory Law, Taxation, etc.) and the author avoided
duplication once a participant with particular subject expertise agreed to participate. Subjects were
generally chosen from two, large, Midwestern, public law schools. Their demographic information is as
follows:
•

18 subjects (11 males, 7 females)

•

Position:

•

o

10 law professors of various non-repeating specialties,

o

4 academic law librarians,

o

1 legal research and writing faculty member,

o

1 history professor specializing in the history of law,

o

1 clinical law professor,

o

1 person in the legal publishing industry knowledgeable about legal taxonomy.

Law Degree: 16 with law degrees, 2 without law degrees.

61

3.4.2 Card Sort
Individually, with the author present and at a location convenient to each subject, the subjects were
handed a stack of 104 index cards. Each card contained the name of one course-subject from the list of
“Law Teachers by Subject” from the AALS annual directory covering academic year 2010-11 (AALS,
2010a). The includes statements (“Includes Agency and Partnership; Corporations; Business Planning”)
and cross references (“Cross-referenced under REGULATED INDUSTRIES”) were not contained on the
index cards. The subjects were given the following instructions:
In front of you, in random order, are 104 index cards with the course subjects currently
used in the American Association of Law Schools (AALS) annual directory’s listing of
Teachers by Subject. Please place them in as many groupings and sub-groupings as
appropriate based on their topical similarity. Once the cards are in groupings and subgroupings, please label the groupings and sub-groupings with the yellow sticky notes and
a descriptor word or words for each grouping and subgrouping. Finally, please arrange
the groupings and sub groupings spatially on the table based on the topical similarity of
the groupings. Upon completion of the sorting and labeling, I will ask you a few
questions about the process and the topical relatedness of the groupings.
The card sorting exercise and some interview questions asked by the author took the human subjects a
range of 35 minutes to 106 minutes to complete. The average was 68 minutes. Subjects were not
instructed as to how many levels in their hierarchy of nested categories to include. Without prompting,
this resulted in the following distribution:
•

4 subjects:

1 level (no category containing sub-categories)

•

11 subjects:

2 levels

•

1 subject:

3 levels

•

2 subjects:

4 levels

For reasons of expediency and simplicity, only relationships in the first level of categorization were
considered. This resulted in 4690 pairwise co-occurrences of course-subjects that the eighteen human
subjects found to be topically related (includes duplicates). While all subjects were instructed to group
62

the course-subject cards based on their topical similarity with one another, not every human expert did
this entirely based on factual or subject matter similarity of the course-subjects. Other conceptual
similarities could also have been captured. One human expert commented that in addition to topical
similarity, there was procedural similarity (same type of procedures or methods used), as well as source of
law similarity (derived primarily from statutes, administrative regulations, or cases).

3.5 Indicators of Topical Similarity
This dissertation spatially distributes law school course-subjects based on their topical similarity as
deduced from course-subjects taught by the same faculty member. The interim steps used to produce the
course-subject maps, as well as the final validation of the maps, were guided and evaluated by indicators
of topical similarity of law school course-subjects contained in several sources. These sources are: (1) the
syndetic structure (cross-references) contained in the AALS directories (AALS, 1931, 2011); (2) the
mergence and divergence of AALS course subjects over time; (3) the Jackson and Gee categories of law
school courses (1975); (4) the topic categories of the Current Index to Legal Periodicals (CILP)
(Gallaghar Law Library—University of Washington, 2011); and (5) the results of a card sorting exercise
performed by experts in legal education.

A summary of the resultant edge counts (pairwise co-

occurrences) from these different similarity indicators are set out in Table 3 and explained subsequently.
The best of the course-subject pairwise co-occurrences, as obtained through the analysis described below,
became the ‘gold-standard’ from which to evaluate all course-subject maps and the interim steps used in
their creation.

Syndetic Structure

3.5.1 Syndetic Structure of AALS Course Subjects
Included in the AALS lists of “Teachers by Subject,” the source of the course-subject data, are crossreferences (or see also references) between some of the course-subjects. Cross-referenced course-subjects
are one indication that the course-subjects are topically similar. The cross-references are not always
symmetrical. For instance, academic year 1931-32 contains the following two course-subjects: (1)
“REAL PROPERTY (See also Future Interests)” and (2) “FUTURE INTERESTS” (AALS, 1931). This
asymmetrical cross-reference is a unidirectional edge, or arc, pointing from the node ‘Real Property’ to
‘Future Interests.’ The amount of cross-references applicable for each of the mapped years is given in
Table 4 and Table 5. It should be noted that cross-references or includes statements were not used
(given) for academic years 1947-48 to 1969-70.

Cross-references in subsequent, or earlier years, may also be an indicator of topical similarity for each
of the mapped years evaluated. Figure 16 represents all of the cross-references contained in the AALS
lists of “Teachers by Subject” from 1931-32 to 2011-12—all 45 iterations of changes in the listing of
course subjects over that same time period. They are portrayed as a node-link diagram with the 60 nodes
being course-subjects using the earliest instantiation of the course-subject name and arcs representing the
cross-references. Table 5 includes the total count of cross-references for both the actual map year, and all
additional cross references that may be used as indicators of similarity when taking into account relevant
cross-reference relationships that arose in previous or subsequent years to the mapped academic years.
This substantially increases the number of relevant edges.

Figure 16: All Cross-References Rendered as a Node-Link Diagram
3.5.1.1 1931-32
Appendix 8 includes all of the cross-references that are applicable to map year 1931-32, even though
some of them first occurred after 1931-32. The table also states how soon after map year 1931-32 a
cross-referenced relationship arose as well as the total count of the amount of directory years the crossreferenced relationship persisted. The column ‘Strength of Indicator of Similarity’ is derived from the
66

count of the number of directory years a cross-reference link existed. ‘Weak’ is assigned for those crossreferences that existed for only one or two directory years. “Mid” is assigned for those cross-references
(or corollaries of the cross-references for those asymmetrical cross-references) that persisted for three to
nine years. ‘Strong’ is assigned for cross-references (or corollaries of the cross-references for those
asymmetrical cross-references) that persisted for ten or more years.
While it may be valid to privilege the eight cross-references that occurred in the mapped year itself,
1931-32, it is important to note that this was the very first year that the AALS directories included lists of
teachers by subject. Thus, the nascent taxonomy was subject to immediate changes. Several of the crossreference relationships only persisted for that initial year. However, cross-references that began occurring
after the 1931-32 year often persisted for numerous years and should be considered as indicators of
similarity between the 1931-32 course-subjects.

One cross-reference relationship, that between

‘administrative law’ and ‘trade regulation’ did not arise until 39 years after academic year 1931-32.
However, it persisted for 35 directory years and may be seen as some indication of similarity between the
two 1931-32 course subjects.
3.5.1.1 1972-73
Appendix 9 includes all of the cross-references that are applicable for map year 1972-72, even though
some of them first occurred either before or after 1972-73. Furthermore, course-subjects are given with
two names: (1) the name first used, and (2) the name used during academic year (1972-73). Appendix 9
also includes cross-references that were subsumed, in part, by another course-subject. For instance, there
is some indication of relatedness between Negotiable Instruments and Regulated Industrial and Other
Activities in 1972-73 as a cross-reference between Banking and Regulated Industries began in academic
year 1987-88 and persisted for 24 years (until the present). Furthermore, in 1972-73, Banking was part of
Negotiable Instruments (“NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS Includes Banking, Bills and Notes and
Commercial Paper”) (AALS, 1972, p. 766).

Thus, there is some relatedness between “Negotiable

Instruments” and “Regulated Industrial and Other Activities.”
67

3.5.1.1 2010-11
Employing the same criteria for inclusion as the two previous map years, Appendix 10 includes all
applicable cross-references for map year 2010-11.
3.5.2 Mergence and Divergence of AALS Course Subjects
Changes in the canon of AALS course-subject lists may also be indicators of topical similarity. For
instance, when two course-subjects are merged into one, this may be taken as an indicator that they are
related. For map years covering the time when the course-subjects are still separate, the subsequently
merged course-subjects should be spatially proximate on the map. Similarly, two course-subjects that
diverge from a common course-subject may also be considered similar. For map years in which there are
two course-subjects that formerly used to be one, these course-subjects should be spatially proximate. At
the outset of the AALS course-subject canon in 1931-32, there were 58 course-subjects. Only seventeen
were neither merged, or diverged, or considerably changed in scope from 1931-32 to 2011-12. See Table
7. Only six course-subjects ended with the exact same name as which the course-subject began. Only
two course-subjects (“Conflict of Laws” and “Contracts”) used that exact same name throughout the
dataset. (These seventeen unchanged topics do not provide any indicia of similarity deduced from
mergence or divergence.)

As 1931-32 is the first year in which a list of faculty members by subject appears in the AALS
directories, only subsequently merged course-subjects provide indicia of similarity for map year 1931-32.
These 26 bi-directional edges, or 52 uni-directional arcs, are set out in Appendix 11. For map year 197273, course-subjects that were formerly joined and subsequently diverged (divergence) as well as coursesubjects that were subsequently merged (mergence) provide indicia of topical similarity. These 30 bidirectional edges, or 60 uni-directional arcs, are set out in Appendix 12. For map year 2010-11, there
was no applicable mergence that occurred in the one remaining academic year of the dissertation dataset
(2011-12). Thus, all indicia of similarity are derived from formerly joined and subsequently diverged
(divergence) course-subjects. These 40 bi-directional edges, or 80 uni-directional arcs, are set out in
Appendix 13.
3.5.3 Jackson and Gee
Jackson and Gee published a report on the type and frequency of electives offered at law schools in the
United States (1975). They analyzed law school courses by placing them in 33 categories. Their
Appendix II lists the courses included in each of the categories and these allow one to construct a
crosswalk to the AALS course-subjects. Appendix 1: Crosswalk between Jackson & Gee Categories
and AALS Subjects, maps the Jackson and Gee categories onto the AALS course-subjects in use in
1975-76. Inclusion in the same Jackson and Gee category is evidence of topical similarity between the
course-subjects. The resultant pairwise co-occurrences of AALS course-subjects by inclusion in the same
Jackson and Gee category are set out in Appendix 14, Appendix 15, and Appendix 16 for each
applicable map year. The analysis excludes those courses listed in Jackson and Gee’s “Miscellaneous”
category.

This catchall does not provide evidence of topical similarity, but rather an inability to

decisively include the course in one of the other thirty-two categories.

3.5.4 Current Index to Legal Periodicals (CILP)
Another source of topical similarity for law school course-subjects is the Current Index to Legal
Periodicals (‘CILP’). It is known as the Washington List as it was created and is maintained by the law
library at the University of Washington School of Law (Wolotira, 2012). It is a current awareness service
(table of contents service) for legal academics and provides a listing of recent legal articles by subject.
Users can elect to receive email notifications as to new articles pertaining to subjects of their choice. To
aid the process of subject selection, there are twelve ‘topics’ that allow one to subscribe to several related
subjects at once. See Appendix 2: Organization of the Current Index to Legal Periodicals. These
super categories are indicators of similarity for their constituent subjects and indicate pairwise similarity
between each of the included subjects. Appendix 17 contains the CILP topic categories, their constituent
subject members, and the correlating AALS course-subjects for each of the map years. CILP subjects
may appear in more than one CILP topic category. Of the 98 CILP subjects, only 53 appear in topic
71

categories. Appendix 18, Appendix 19, and Appendix 20 provide the resultant pairwise course-subject
associations for each of the map years.

3.5.5 Human Subjects Card Sort
The results of the card sorting exercise (see Section 3.4.2) provide additional data as to the topical
similarity of law school course-subjects. For purposes of validating the maps and as well as the selection
of their preliminary treatments, the 3,456 course-subject pairings that resulted from the card sorting data
(out of 5,356 theoretically possible—(((104 x 104)-104)/2) had to be reduced (thresholded) to a usable
amount. Included in the analysis below are all course-subject pairings that at least ten out of the eighteen
subjects (taking into account only the first level of their categorization scheme if they had multiple levels)
indicated were related. As to the 2010-11 mapping year, this resulted in 149 course-subject pairs—a
figure roughly equal to the amount of pairings from the Jackson and Gee (147) and CILP (122) data.
While the human subjects were asked to sort 2010-11 course-subjects, their results have been extrapolated
72

by the author backwards in time as to what the relevant course-subjects would have been, if in existence,
for the other mapping years (1931-32 and 1972-73). The resultant similar course-subjects are given in
Appendix 21, Appendix 22, and Appendix 23 for each of the relevant map years.

3.5.5 Combined Indicators of Similarity
The results of the five individual sources of course-subject similarity have been aggregated to reveal the
amount of overlap and the overall percentage of AALS course-subjects included for each of the mapped
years. These aggregated charts are the basis of evaluation for the domain maps as well the component
steps and treatments in the creation of the domain maps. As Table 11 indicates, almost all coursesubjects, for each of the mapped years, are included in at least one pair-wise co-occurrence. Table 12
reveals that the CILP data has the highest percentage of pairwise co-occurrence that is not replicated in
any of the four other methods. The aggregated pairwise-co-occurrences for each relevant map year,

73

ranked by the amount of sources that indicated similarity, are set out in Appendix 24, Appendix 25, and
Appendix 26.

3.5.6 Analysis and Thresholding of Similarity Pairwise Co-Occurrence
The author was limited as to how many course-subject co-occurrence pairs he could use to evaluate the
different inputs for each step in the map creation process. Accordingly, an analysis was conducted as to
the five indicator sources and their level of agreement for map year 2010-11 (321 total pairwise cooccurrences) to help inform the possibility of reducing, or thresholding, the 321 pairs and to arrive at a
workable ‘gold-standard’ to validate the maps and their interim steps. This analysis was conducted by
two separate methods—(1) comparisons with course-subject co-occurrence (CSCO) teaching data in
order to find the best value at which to threshold, and (2) outlier detection using normalization, MDS, and
K-means clustering.
3.5.6.1 Comparisons with Course-Subject Co-Occurrence (CSCO) Teaching Data
This analysis was conducted using the Association Strength normalization technique (2007 total
occurrences method) (see section 2.3.1) as to the counts of the course-subjects taught by the same faculty
members in 2010-11. The values in the upper half of the normalized matrix were sorted by the highest
normalized value and assigned a ranking (1,2,3 etc.). 5,356 (((104x104)-104)/2)) pairwise co-occurrence
values for the 2010-11 course-subjects were thus placed in rank order. The same values (ties) resulted in
the same ranking number (1,2,3…1247, 1248, 1248, 1250, 1251, etc.). Of the 5,356 possible, there were
328 ties in addition to the 1,467 ties that resulted from course-subject pairs that were never taught by the
same faculty member and had an Association Strength normalized value of zero. Table 13 shows the
distributions and amounts of the five quintiles as well as the 311 indicated similar course-subject pairs.
(Ten pairings containing Forensic Medicine were excluded as this course-subject was an anomaly that
was only taught by one faculty member who also taught four other course-subjects).

The fact that the overwhelming preponderance of indicated similar course-subject pairs appear in the
top quintile is strong evidence that faculty members teach courses that are topically similar. However, of
the 100 highest ranked, normalized course-subject pairs, only 60 are indicated as similar by one of the
five similarity indicator methods. Assuming the correctness of the hypothesis that faculty members teach
topically related courses, this may indicate that while good, the five external sources of topical similarity
do not reveal the full picture and omit some course-subject pairings that are quite similar. Furthermore,
the comparison with the course-subject data allows an analysis of each of the five similarity indicators
and how well the 311 similar course-subject pairings correspond to the normalized frequency in which
those course-subjects were taught by the same faculty member. Table 14 shows the correlation between
the CSCO rankings data and each level of similarity method agreement. Generally, as the agreement
amongst the similarity methods goes down, the average (arithmetic mean) of the rankings increases. The
pairwise course-subjects that only one method indicated as similar are far less correlated with the
rankings of the frequency with which they are taught by the same faculty member. This indicates that it
may be reasonable to threshold the pairwise co-occurrence to only instances in which two or more
methods indicate that they are similar.

Ultimately, a gold-standard was desired to assess the maps and the steps used in their creation. It is
analytically circular to use teaching data to inform a thresholding decision that is then used to evaluate the
validity of domain maps created from teaching data. However, the analysis above suggests that when
only one of the five different methods indicates similarity, that similarity is suspect. Given the need to
reduce the amount of pairwise co-occurrences used as the evaluative “gold-standard,” it is reasonable to
threshold at the level that at least two of the five methods indicate similarity between the course-subject
pairs. This assertion would have also had validity a priori and apart from using the teaching data to
confirm a good point for thresholding.
A similar analysis can be used to evaluate the relative accuracy of each of the individual similarity
indicator methods (at least relative to their correspondence with teaching data). Table 15 relates the
averaged rankings data for each of the five similarity methods. In order of their correspondence to
teaching data based on the mean of the Association Strength normalized values they are (from most
77

correspondence to least): (1) Mergence/Divergence, (2) Syndetic Structure, (3) Card Sort, (4) Jackson and
Gee, and (5) CILP. It is interesting to note that when the mean of ranked values is evaluated, Syndetic
Structure is the best (instead of Mergence/Divergence) and Jackson and Gee is the worst (instead of
CILP).

3.5.6.2 Outlier Detection Using Normalization, MDS, and Clustering
A second assessment of the five topical similarity indicator sources was performed by conceptualizing the
different methods as nodes with their resulting overlap of course-subject pairwise co-occurrences creating
a fully connected clique. The goal was to see which of the five sources, if any, was an outlier compared
to the others. Table 16 provides a matrix of the counts of the overlap of pairwise co-occurrences for each
of the five sources for map year 2010-11. The parenthetical number in the column and row headings is
the total amount of topically similar course-subject pairwise co-occurrences that were indicated by each
source. The percentage number in parentheses in each of the data cells is the percentage overlap relative
to the overall amount of pairwise-co-occurrences per each column heading.

3.5.6.2.1 Normalization

To be more meaningful, this overlap data was normalized using the Association Strength normalization
technique, total occurrences method (see section 2.3.1 and Table 17). As applied to this data, the formula
was: (amount of unique pairwise co-occurrences x count of overlap between similarity sources A &
B)/(total co-occurrences indicated by source A x total co-occurrences indicated by source B). The data
cells for each of the first five rows contain a normalized value—the higher the number, the more two
similarity sources overlap. It is not surprising that Syndetic Structure and Mergence/Divergence are the
most correlated.

Both stem from the course-subject categorizations published by the AALS and,

presumably, were created by the same team. The ‘column sum’ row in Table 17 is a sum of all of the
79

normalized values of similarity for each of the indicator sources listed in the column heading. The fact
that CILP has the lowest sum solidifies its status as an outlier. (It also has the highest percentage of
pairwise co-occurrences with which no other source agrees. See Table 12.) Mergence/Divergence is
most central in the network as it has the highest sum of Association Strength values.

3.5.6.2.2 Layout

This normalized data was visualized using MDS (Proxscal in SPSS version 19, same decision points as
footnote 19 above). See Figure 17. As can be seen from the layout, CILP is indeed an outlier, but not by
much. See Table 18 for the stress and fit measures for this MDS solution.

3.5.6.2.3 Clustering Analysis

Clustering of the normalized overlap data was also performed in order to garner any additional insights.
Employing K-means clustering with the creation of two cluster groupings (the number of clusters is
required to be specified at the outset), the five similarity sources cluster into the following two groups: (1)
Syndetic Structure, Jackson and Gee, and Card Sort and, (2) Mergence/Divergence and CILP. The fact
that Jackson and Gee and CILP are grouped in different clusters indicates that the two potential outliers
are affiliated with different similarity indicators. Because CILP clusters with a similarity indicator that is
strongly correlated as accurate (in terms of CSCO data), Mergence/Divergence, this diminishes CILP’s
status as a clear outlier and supports thresholding at the level of at least two similarity sources in
agreement rather than merely excluding the CILP indicated similar course-subjects that are not indicated
as similar by one of the four other similarity sources. The same is also true for Jackson and Gee.
3.5.7 Final ‘Gold-standards’
Because of the analysis set out above, the final evaluative gold-standard for each of the map years is all
pairwise co-occurrences that at least two of the five indicators of similarity suggest are similar (less three
pairings in 2010-11 that include Forensic Medicine). See Appendix 24, Appendix 25, and Appendix 26.
This results in the metrics set out in Table 19.

The distribution of the rank quintiles of the overall

amount of teachers teaching a particular course-subject are helpful for evaluating and understanding the
results of the different normalization formulas.

3.6 Categories Identified by Human Subjects
In addition to information about the relatedness of the various 2010-11 course-subjects, the human
subjects also provided valuable information as to higher order categories and their labels into which the
individual course-subjects may be aggregated. This information was particularly informative when
analyzing the results of the various clustering techniques in Section 4.3. In total, the subjects assigned
511 category names (includes duplicates) to groupings of law school course-subjects. Table 20 contains
the top 25 category names as well as all of those categories used by five or more of the human subjects.
These category names were controlled, in part, by the author—similar category names were counted as
being an iteration of one controlled category label. See Table 21. (It is the controlled category label that
is given in Table 20.) It is interesting to note that all of the traditional first year law school courses (see
Section 1.4) are represented as categories: ((1) Contracts, (2) Civil Procedure, (3) Property, (4) Torts, (5)
Criminal Law, (6) Constitutional Law, and (7) Legal Research and Writing). This is not surprising as
these are bedrock components of law school education. Some of the category labels would have higher
counts if the other levels of the experts’ hierarchy were also used in the analysis.

The gold-standard created for this work allows for a comparison of domain map production techniques
and an assessment as to which is best relative to CSCO data. It provides insights useful for data miners,
information visualization experts, scientometricians, and domain mappers.

4.1 Normalization Results and Analysis
Normalization is extremely important. As the results below indicate, without efforts to normalize data,
one cannot fairly draw comparisons between groups of items that occur with differing frequencies.
Accordingly, an information scientist must be equipped with the best normalization algorithms to
understand and make predictions using co-occurrence data. This section explains how five different
normalization algorithms perform and provides additional evidence as to why the Association Strength
normalization algorithm is best for co-occurrence data.
4.1.1 Support for the Hypothesis That Teachers Teach Topically Similar Course-Subjects
A first point of analysis is how well the CSCO data correlates with the gold-standard for each map year.
Table 22 reports the amount of gold-standard course-subject pairs in the top quintile of the ranked,
normalized, CSCO values for the entire map year taking into account each of the normalization
techniques and variants. Generally, most gold-standard pairs are in the top quintile of the normalized
CSCO data. This is consistent with expectations if the following two things are true: (1) the goldstandard is an accurate reflection of course-subject topical similarity; and (2) in general, faculty members
teach course-subjects that are topically similar such that topically similar course-subjects will have a
higher normalized similarity value. Based on the variety of the gold-standard inputs and the manner of
their selection, it is assumed that the gold-standard for each map year is an accurate representation of the
topical similarity for the course-subject pairs included in the gold-standard. (The gold-standard does not
purport to be an exhaustive list of all similar course-subjects.) As to the two most recent map years,
1972-73 and 2010-11, 83% to 97% (depending on the technique and variant) of the gold-standard course86

subject pairs are in the first quintile of normalized CSCO data. This is strong support for the hypothesis
that generally, faculty members teach course-subjects that are topically similar. Furthermore, and as will
be demonstrated in the subsection 4.2, this lends support to the validity of using CSCO data to make topic
maps of the domain of law.

4.1.2 Should CSCO Data be Normalized?
Table 23, Table 24, and Table 25 provide the distribution of the gold-standard course-subject pairs over
all quintiles of the ranked normalized and non-normalized CSCO data.

The gold-standard pairs

consistently skew towards the first quintile when applied to normalized CSCO data. However, the
distribution of gold-standard pairs as to the non-normalized data is consistently less skewed (over all map
years) and more evenly distributed throughout the five quintiles. This is to be expected as no effort has
been made to fairly account for the vastly differing amounts that each course-subject is taught. With the
non-normalized CSCO data, courses that are frequently taught will disproportionally have higher CSCO
values as the magnitude of their co-occurrence numbers will be greater (even for comparatively lower
overall co-occurrence percentages) than for course-subject pairs that are taught by comparatively few
faculty members and thus have very low co-occurrence counts (comparatively speaking by magnitude).
87

Thus, more of these pairs of frequently taught courses will occupy the top quintiles causing the goldstandard pairs that feature course-subjects that are taught more infrequently to occur lower in the overall
rankings. Again, assuming the desirability of a large proportion of gold-standard pairs occurring early in
the ranked ordering of all course-subject pairs, it appears that CSCO data should be normalized before
drawing meaningful comparisons as to how often any two course-subjects are taught by the same
professor. Further examples are provided below.

4.1.3 Variance in the Strength of the Gold-standard by Map Year
Based on the distributions of the gold-standard pairs over the entire CSCO rankings for a given map year,
it appears that the gold-standard is ‘best’ for map year 1972-73, second ‘best’ for 2010-11, and least
‘best’ for 1931-32. Best, in this case, is defined as having the highest proportion of gold-standard pairs
taken from the first quintile of all ranked course-subject pairs. The differences may be accounted for in
several ways. First, the strength of the gold-standard as an indicator of topical similarity may vary for the
three map years. Second, the assumption that people teach courses that are topically similar when
teaching more than one course per AALS directory year, may be less true for some of the map years.
Additionally, the variance may be a result of a combination of both of these two phenomena.
The gold-standard is the aggregate of five sources of topical similarity. Two of these sources reflect a
contemporary notion of topical similarity: (1) the card sort with experts (conducted in April through July,
2011), and (2) the CILP super categories of related topics harvested online February 14, 2011. See Table
26. Furthermore, a third gold-standard similarity source, Jackson and Gee was also created on a specific
date, 1975. These first two contemporary notions of similarity were projected backwards on coursesubjects that were in existence eighty or forty years earlier, respectively, for each of the two first map
years. However, contemporary notions of topical similarity may be less applicable to the legal academy
80 years in the past as pertains to the 1931-32 CSCO data.

April through July, 2011

Furthermore, the assumption that professors teach topically similar courses may have been less true in
1931-32 as it is today. Academic year 1931-32 is the first year that the AALS published its “List of Law
92

Teachers by Subject.” Law schools were newer then and teaching practices might not have stabilized
according to contemporary notions of topical specialization and efficiency. More law faculty members
might have been obligated to teach widely disparate course-subjects so that law schools might offer the
full range of course-subjects necessary to educate lawyers.

Nonetheless, with both normalization

methods and each of their variants, at least 75% of the gold-standard pairs in 1931-32 are in the first two
quintiles of all ranked course-subject pairs. This still suggests that in 1931-32, more often than not,
faculty members taught topically similar courses—just not to the same extent as in subsequent map years.
There are also several reasons why the gold-standard might have correlated more highly with CSCO
data in 1972-73 than in 2010-11.

First, Jackson and Gee (created in 1975) is probably most

authoritatively an indicator of topical similarity for the most proximate map year, 1972-73. Second, in
the intervening years between1972-73 and 2010-11 there was a proliferation in the number of “law and”
courses: (1) Law and Psychiatry (1974-75); (2) Law and Economics (1987-88); (3) Law and Literature
(2004-05), and (4) Law and Religion (2004-05). The gold-standard sources of similarity often lump these
“law and” courses together. This is likely due to their shared interdisciplinary application of legal
concepts. However, this does not mean that topically or doctrinally they share much of an overlap in
content such that they are likely to be taught by the same faculty members. For instance, while (1) Law
and Economics and (2) Law and Psychiatry is a gold-standard pair, this pairing was very low in the
ranking of overall course-subject similarity for map year 2010-11. This may be an example in which the
gold-standard indicates that two course-subjects are similar based on one conceptualization of similarity
(in this case, a higher or more abstract conceptualization), but that in practice they are not similar enough
to be frequently taught by the same faculty members seeking to maximize their teaching efficiency and
subject expertise.
4.1.4 Less Successful Gold-standard Pairs
Only one gold-standard course subject pair, (1) Air Law and (2) Trade Regulation (or their contemporary
equivalents), was not taught by any of the same faculty members for any of the map years—1931-32,
93

1972-73, or 2010-11. This may stem from the fact that only two of the five similarity sources indicate
that Air Law and Trade Regulation are similar—Jackson and Gee and CILP. Aviation and Space Law is
a highly regulated industry. Thus, Jackson and Gee have both course-subjects under the category,
“Regulation of Business and Industry.” CILP has them under the category, “Technology Group.” While
high tech industries are often highly regulated and involve consumer protection and trade regulation, this
co-listing might be inappropriate when it comes to topical similarity. Also, both of these course-subjects
are not frequently taught—thus diminishing the chance that they would be taught together.
The remaining 1931-32 gold-standard pairs with no teaching overlap are also surprising by modern
conceptualizations of similarity. One would expect more teaching overlap amongst the various flavors of
what is today known as civil procedure. Generally, civil procedure encompasses the rules governing how
and where non-criminal lawsuits are brought and conducted. As to the 1931-32 course-subjects, the civil
procedure course-subjects are: (1) Code Pleading, (2) Pleading, and (3) Common Law Pleading. While
there was no direct teaching overlap between several combinations of these course-subjects, (1) Code
Pleading and (2) Pleading; and (1) Common Law Pleading and (2) Pleading, the relationship between (1)
Code Pleading & (2) Common Law Pleading (not a gold-standard pair) was one of the highest ranked in
terms of CSCO similarity for 1931-32. It remains to be seen whether ordination techniques, when
exhaustively accounting for all of the myriad similarity relationships in a given map year, might bring
these modernly related course-subjects together for map year 1931-32.
The sources of topical similarity suggest that the course-subjects (1) Mining Law, (2) Oil and Gas,
and (3) Water Rights are within the same category. Jackson and Gee has these three course-subjects in
the “Natural Resources and the Environment” category. CILP has them in the “Environmental Law
Group” category. In 1931-32, some of these course-subjects had no teaching overlap: (1) Mining Law
and (2) Oil and Gas; and (1) Oil and Gas and (2) Water Rights. However, (1) Mining Law and (2) Water
Rights (a gold-standard pair) is frequently ranked as one of the most similar course-subject pairs in 1931-

94

32. This might be another example of contemporary notions of similarity not having time to manifest in
actual teaching practice in 1931-32.
4.1.6 Sensitivity of the Association Strength to Small Numbers
Ludo Waltman and Nees Jan Van Eck note the following:
[There is a] tendency of the association strength to give very high values for combinations of
items that both have very low total occurrences (or very low column totals). In our
experience, often the pairs of items with the highest association strengths have very low total
occurrences/column totals. The reliability of these very high association strengths then is
relatively low (i.e., adding or removing a single co-occurrence would directly lead to a quite
different association strength value) (email correspondence with the author on August 14,
2013).
This may be seen with the 1931-32 CSCO data and the course-subject, Air Law. Air Law is only taught
by three people and ranks last in terms of the amount of people teaching the course-subject for 1931-32.
See Appendix 41: Course-Subject Metrics 1931-32. Thus, for normalization purposes, Air Law has both
very low total occurrences and very low column totals. Yet, for both variants of the Association Strength,
course-subject pairs that include Air Law are three of the five most similar course-subjects based on the
normalized CSCO data. Alternatively, pairs involving Air Law have much more divergent ranks when
employing either variant of the Cosine normalization. See Table 27. (However, the ordering is the same
for each variant—either total occurrences or column totals, regardless of whether Association Strength or
Cosine was used.) Similar observations might be made about course-subject pairs involving Forensic
Medicine. In the 2010-11 CSCO data, Forensic Medicine was only taught by one individual who
happened to teach four other course-subjects as well. (This was the only course-subject that was excluded
from otherwise being in the gold-standard for unreasonably small numbers.) As to the Association
Strength normalization variants, the course-subject pair (1) Forensic Medicine & (2) Labor Law appears
on each list of top five most similar course-subjects. The same pair is absent from the top five list for
each of the Cosine variants, see Table 25.

4.1.7 Best Normalization Technique and Variant
It is possible to compare each of the normalization techniques and their variants as applied to the CSCO
data in order to determine which normalization approach works best. This is done by comparing the
average rank value of all gold-standard course-subject pairs, see Table 28. Again, this analysis assumes
that the ‘gold-standard’ is accurate and that the average of the ranked values for each of the gold-standard
pairs should be as low as possible. (Note: Lower values equate with higher rankings—1 being best.)

The data provides some support for the assertion of Van Eck and Waltman (2009) that the
Association Strength normalization technique is better than the Cosine normalization technique,
particularly for map year 2010-11. For map years 1931-32 and 1972-73, the data is inconclusive. Also,
amongst each normalization technique, there is no consistency as to which variant is better. While the
Association Strength technique does have the lowest mean ranking for all three map years, in 1931-32 the
other Association Strength variant has the highest average. Both normalization techniques and their
variants far outperform the non-normalized CSCO data.
As to the 2010-11 map year, the data supports the assertion of Van Eck and Waltman (2009, p. 1646)
that the Association Strength technique does a better job than the Cosine technique and other set-theoretic
similarity measures as the later “do not properly correct for the size effect and, consequently, do not
properly normalize co-occurrence data.” An example of this size effect was seen earlier with the coursesubject, Air Law. This can also be seen in the vastly different averages of the ranked Cosine normalized
values when comparing data from different quintile ranks of the amount that a particular course-subject
was taught, see Table 29. When both course-subjects of the gold-standard pairs are in the top 20% of the
97

amount that a particular course-subject was taught, the average ranks for the Cosine normalized values are
very high (low numbers). The reverse is true when both gold-standard course-subject pairs are in the
lowest quintile (lowest 20%) of the amount that a particular course-subject was taught. The difference is
even more pronounced for the non-normalized (raw) data and lends further support to the assertion that
the data should be normalized before making comparisons of the co-occurrence values. In contrast, and
true to the assertion of Van Eck and Waltman, the Association Strength normalization technique is more
consistent, and thus does a better job, across the vastly different amounts that the course-subjects were
taught. In other words, with the Association Strength, there is less variance than with the Cosine
technique in the average rank of the ‘gold-standard’ course-subject pairs between the different quintile
ranks.

The comparison with the gold-standard of the two different denominator variants of each
normalization technique ((1) total occurrences and (2) column totals) reveals significant differences and a
possible explanation for those differences. As might be reasoned a priori, the column totals method will
be significantly different than the total occurrences method for those subjects that are taught in large
numbers but are frequently the only course-subject that a particular instructor is teaching. Table 30
contains the top ten (fourteen because of ties) 2010-11 course-subjects with the highest percentage of
being the only course-subject taught by an instructor and also reports the average rank of the
normalization values of all pairs containing that particular course-subject within the gold-standard. (Eight
of these fourteen course-subjects happen to be amongst the 27% of course-subjects not included in any of
99

the gold-standard pairs.) However, Legal Research and Writing as well as Legal Drafting, both within the
top ten percentages of being the only course-subject taught by a professor, have great differences for each
normalization technique denominator variant. These two course-subjects are included in four of the top
ten greatest differences in normalized values between the two Association Strength variants (see Table
31), but in only one of the top ten greatest differences in the normalized values between the two Cosine
variants (see Table 32). As to the top ten biggest differences between the Cosine denominator variants, it
appears that more of these are from the lowest quintiles of how many teachers teach a particular coursesubject than was true for the Association Strength denominator variants.

As between the two denominator variants of each normalization technique, the data is inconclusive as
to which is best. More studies with larger and different datasets and gold-standards should be conducted.
However, the differences are striking and scientometricians should be aware of them, the reason for them,
as well as the sensitivity (both positive and negative) of the Association Strength to items occurring only
a few times. The fact that the Association Strength performs the best for the 2010-11 data suggests that a
higher proportion of its gold-standard course-subject pairs involve individual course-subjects that are not
frequently taught or come from pairs of course-subjects that are not frequently taught. This is indeed the
case. See Table 33. Compared to 1931-32 and 1972-73, the 2010-11 gold-standard is more skewed
towards those course-subjects that are taught less frequently. See Figure 18. Based on the analysis
above, it is not surprising that the two normalization techniques are less distinguished for map years in
which the gold-standard co-occurrence pairs are derived more often from the most frequently occurring
103

137

97

items. As the Association Strength normalization technique does a better job than Cosine in data years
with widely varying occurrences of course-subjects (or is skewed to including more items from the less
frequently occurring items), and just as good as Cosine in years without a wide variance, Association
Strength is the preferred normalization technique (either variant) to use with co-occurrence data.

Often the Constituent Course-Subjects are Taught
4.1.8 Section Conclusion
Many conclusions may be drawn from the work completed in Section 4. First, there is strong support for
the underlying hypothesis that in general, teachers specialize and teach course-subjects that are topically
related to the other course-subjects they teach. This is evidenced by the fact that a high percentage (83%
to 95% for map years 1972-73 and 2010-11) of gold-standard pairs are in the top quintile of overall
ranked values of the CSCO normalized data. Second, CSCO data should be normalized before making
comparisons as to how often course-subjects are taught.

Third, because the Association Strength

normalization technique does a better job than Cosine in data years with widely varying occurrences of
course-subjects (more course-subjects in the gold-standard that are infrequently taught), and just as good
105

as Cosine in years without a wide variance, the Association Strength is the preferred normalization
technique (either variant) to use with co-occurrence data. This confirms the findings of Van Eck and
Waltman (2009).

However, the Association Strength normalization technique does show greater

sensitivity to course-subjects occurring in very small numbers. Depending on the context, this can be a
good or bad thing. Scientometricians, however, need to be aware of the phenomena.
4.1.9 Future Work as to Normalization Inputs
In the future, the author would like to conduct similar comparisons with other normalization techniques
discussed in the literature. This includes those used in (Boyack et al., 2005; Klavans & Boyack, 2006a)
as well as indirect similarity measures and other set-theoretic similarity measures identified in (Van Eck
& Waltman, 2009).

106

4.2 Ordination/Spatialization Results and Analysis
The next step in domain map creation after normalization is ordination. With ordination, the topics are
distributed in two dimensional space (or three-dimensional) using the distance similarity metaphor—more
similar topics are closer together. Normalized similarity for the course-subjects was determined by how
often they were taught by the same faculty member. The next step in the evaluative process is to see how
three popular ordination, or layout, techniques compare relative to the gold-standard.

The three

ordination techniques are the Proxscal implementation of MDS in SPSS 19, the Visualization of
Similarities (VOS) algorithm implemented in VOSViewer, and two spring force algorithms implemented
in Pajek (Kamada-Kawai and Fruchterman-Reingold). Because of the complexity of evaluating the
ordination measures, map year 2010-11, with the largest number of course-subjects and most recent in
time, is the only year evaluated. The specific implementation of each ordination method is set out in
Section 3.3.2 with two variant methods for calculating the results for each of the spring force algorithms.
The results for each ordination technique are set out below in separate sections with the final sections
being an analysis of which is best of the three approaches.
4.2.1 Proxscal MDS Distances Compared to the Gold-standard.
For each normalization input measure discussed in section 4.1, an analysis was conducted pursuant to the
methodology discussed in Section 3.3.2. As stated in (Van Eck & Waltman, 2009), the Association
Strength (2007) Total Occurrences normalization measure and the Association Strength (2009) Total
Occurrences normalization measure are proportional and functionally equivalent. As can be seen below
in Table 34, they result in the same ordination values. Hereafter, only the Association Strength (2009)
will be used.

Using Proxscal MDS, the Association Strength (2007, 2009) Total Occurrences

normalization method led to the best ordination result relative to the 2010-11 gold-standard.

Also, as may be seen in Table 35 and Table 36, the different normalization inputs produce vastly
different ranks of distances when rendered with Proxscal MDS. As discussed in Section 4.1, these
differences are most likely attributable to the differing amounts that some course-subjects are the only
course-subject taught by an instructor and how this phenomena causes great fluctuations between the
normalization techniques and their individual variants. The range of fluctuations once again emphasizes
how crucial the choice is between normalization techniques as the different normalization inputs result in
vastly different layouts.

4.2.2 VOS Distances Compared to the Gold-standard
For each normalization input measure discussed in section 4.1, an analysis was conducted pursuant to the
methodology discussed in Section 3.3.2. As to VOSviewer ordination with each of the five normalization
techniques as input, the Association Strength normalization technique outperformed the Cosine
normalization technique and the non-normalized data.

See Table 37.

Furthermore, the Total

Occurrences method slightly outperformed the Columns Totals method for both normalization techniques
(Association Strength and Cosine).

Also, compared to Proxscal MDS, the VOSviewer ordination

technique resulted in less variance both between the different denominator variants for each normalization
technique and between the Association Strength and Cosine normalization techniques. See Table 38.
110

This consistency is a good thing for an ordination algorithm as the results produced will be more uniform
and less variable.

4.2.3 Spring Force Algorithms Distances Compared to the Gold-standard
For each normalization input measure discussed in section 4.1, an analysis was conducted pursuant to the
two methodologies described in Section 3.3.2.3.1 (Spring Force Algorithm Method 1) and Section
112

3.3.2.3.2 (Spring Force Algorithm Method 2). Contrary to the previous ordination results, the Cosine
normalization input used with both spring force algorithm variants outperformed the Association Strength
normalized data. See Table 40, next section. However, the top five adjacencies for each of the best of
the five iterations for each normalization input and spring force algorithm pairing created strange course
pairings that would cause a domain expert to question the results. Examples include: Computers and the
Law and Taxation, State & Local; Feminist Legal Theory and Trade Regulation; Sports Law and Water
Rights; and Commercial Law and Family Law. With only one exception, none of the top five pairings
was in the gold-standard. See Table 39. Also, none of the five pairings for each input method overlap.
In other words, while the overall accuracy (global accuracy) for the Cosine normalization input used with
both spring force algorithms may be better than that for the Association Strength normalized data, the
local accuracy leaves much to be desired.

Also, as can be seen in Table 40, the two different

methodologies produce substantially different results.

4.2.4 Best Ordination Technique
The VOS ordination algorithm utilizing the Association Strength (2009) Total Occurrences method of
normalization produced the map that was most consistent with the gold-standard.

See Table 40.

Consequently, it will be used as a base map for all subsequent thematic overlays of data and applied to the
mapmaking of the two previous map years—1931-32 and 1972-73. As can be seen in Figure 19, the
114

different ordination techniques, with different normalization inputs, vary substantially in their sensitivity
to outliers. All Proxscal MDS ordinations were circular and evenly filled the space. However, the
VOSviewer ordination using Cosine normalization was much more affected by the fact that Forensic
Evidence was only taught by one instructor who also taught four other course-subjects.
The answer to Research Question 2 is yes. (Can course-subject co-occurrence (CSCO) be used to
produce topic maps that are consistent with expert opinion and other indicators of the topical similarity of
law school course-subjects?) The average rank of distances of all CSCO gold-standard identified edges
(derived from 5 extrinsic sources of topical similarity) are within the top 15% of all possible 2010-11
edges when using the best normalization (Association Strength Total Occurrences) and ordination (VOS)
techniques. It is important to note that the results are not as good as the best normalized edge lists as
stress has been introduced during the process of reducing the multidimensional space to two dimensions
and locating those central course-subjects that are pulled in many different directions.

4.2.5 Section Conclusion
Course-subject co-occurrence (CSCO) can be used to produce topic maps that are consistent with
expert opinion and other indicators of the topical similarity of law school course-subjects. This is
evidenced by the fact that the average rank of distances of all CSCO gold-standard identified edges are
within the top 15% of all possible 2010-11 edges when using the best normalization and ordination
techniques. The VOS ordination algorithm, utilizing the Association Strength (2009) Total Occurrences
method of normalization, produced the map that was most consistent with the gold-standard. Until
demonstrated that a different combination is superior, the author will use VOS ordination and Association
Strength (2009) Total Occurrences for all future domain maps.
4.2.6 Future Work
In the future, the author would like to repeat the ranking comparison using a two mode network (both
course-subjects and faculty members as nodes) for both spring force algorithms to see if the results are
improved. Also, the author would like to replicate the Boyack and Klavens approach of doing the
ordination while only using the top 15 co-occurring course-subjects for each individual course-subject
(rather than all 103 other course-subjects in 2010-11). Similarly, the author would like to analyze the Top
5, Top10, Top 20, Top 25, and Top 50 co-occurring course-subjects to see the affect this has on the
ordination. Finally, the author would like to apply the CSCO approach to mapping other domains. A
number of possible datasets might enable such an analysis. For example, one could use instances of
faculty members teaching two or more MOOC’s (Massive Online Open Course) as determined by the
following Websites: www.mooc-list.com and https://www.coursera.org. Additionally, one might be able
to map all of academia using CSCO data from the International Research Network (IRN) available at
http://nrn.cns.iu.edu.

118

4.3 Cluster Results and Analysis
It is desirable to aggregate the course-subjects into groupings. This facilitates both cognitive and regional
chunking. In order to accomplish this goal, two clustering approaches were analyzed and compared using
the course-subject data: factor analysis and k-means clustering. Additionally, QAP analysis was used to
compare the matrix of CSCO data with that of the human subjects’ card sort data. This was done as the
card sort matrix cluster analysis was used to compare and contrast the CSCO matrix cluster analysis.
Additionally, a priori, a good clustering treatment satisfies four basic criteria: (1) all of the coursesubjects are assigned to groups, (2) there are few or no groupings with only one course-subject, (3) there
are few or no mega-clusters that include too many course-subjects to be interpretable as to their general,
unifying theme, and (4) a course-subject can only be included in one, and only, one cluster.
4.3.1 Factor Analysis
For purposes of comparison, a factor analysis was performed on two datasets: (1) the 2010-11 CSCO
data, and (2) the human subject matrix of topically similar course-subjects. The later was derived from
most detailed level (level one) of the card sorting exercise. This allowed for a comparison of groupings
from the incidences of what law faculty members taught (CSCO data) and what the human experts
identified as topically similar (card sort data).
4.3.1.1 CSCO Data
For map year 2010-11, a factor analysis was performed on the best normalized CSCO data (association
strength (2009) total occurrences).

See Section 3.3.3.1.

The factor analysis identified 28 factors

(categories) with eigenvalues above an absolute value of 1.00. This is Kaiser’s stopping rule as to how
many factors to retain (1960). However, not all of these are interpretable. In other words, a person
knowledgeable about the domain cannot always succinctly summarize the higher level factor that explains
the included course-subjects. Traditional scree plot analysis (Cattell, 1966) was performed on the factor
analysis results. This involves putting a line tangent to the ‘elbow’ of the scree plot curve and vertically
119

extending the intersection point down to the x axis (Leydesdorff & Rafols, 2009) in order to reveal the
amount of factors that should be maintained. The scree plot analysis of the CSCO data reveals that the
first 15 factors should be maintained (a 15 factor solution). See Figure 20.

Figure 20: CSCO Factor Analysis Scree Plot

120

Table 41 sets out the information about these 28 total factors and their course-subject components.
The 28 factors account for 79% of the variance in the data. Each course-subject has a factor coefficient of
an absolute value of .3 or higher. This is a common threshold when deciding what items to include in a
particular factor (Bryant & Yarnold, 1995). As factor titles are not supplied by the statistical software,
they must be supplied by the interpreter of the factor analysis. The factor labels below have been
supplied by the dissertation author based on the top 25 category names given by the human subjects (see
Section 3.6) as well as the author’s experience with legal education (licensed attorney with a law degree
plus ten years of experience working in law schools as an academic law librarian). With factor analysis, a
course-subject may appear in more than one factor category. However, shown below, course-subjects are
only included with the factor in which their factor coefficient is the highest. This is the factor on which
the course-subject most ‘loads.’

This factor was hard to interpret and
makes little sense. Labor Law is the
least well-fitting course-subject in this

would have been the better labor and

litigation.

path to resolve employment
discrimination claims.

4.3.1.2 Card Sort Data
A similar factor analysis was conducted on the human subject matrix of topically similar course-subjects
derived from the most detailed level (level one) of the card sorting exercise and factored the same way as
the CSCO data.

The factor analysis of the human subject card sort matrix identified 14 factors
124

(categories) with eigenvalues above 1.00. These 14 factors account for 74% of the variance in the data.
See Table 42. Additionally, a scree plot analysis revealed that all 14 factors with eigenvalues above 1.00
should be maintained. See Figure 21. The maintaining of all 14 factors with eigenvalues above 1.00 as
determined by the scree plot analysis probably indicates that, as compared to the CSCO data, the expert
determined similarity of the course-subjects is less multidimensional and fractured.

The inclusion of torts with the criminal
course-subjects is a large anomaly.
However, there are torts (civil liability)
that also subject one to criminal
liability. Products Liability has a factor
coefficient that would otherwise
exclude it from the list. However, it has
to go somewhere and this is the factor
on which it most strongly loads.

4.3.1.3 Discussion
While it may be that CSCO analysis is a demonstrably valid way to produce domain maps of the
academic discipline of law in the United States, it may not be the best way. For instance, a map derived
from the similarity matrix of the human identified similar course-subjects may be better. However, the
latter is much more laborious to produce and may be questionable for distant academic years of which
contemporary experts have little familiarity. Similarly, cluster groupings made from CSCO data are
definitely correct in one sense. They capture the underlying reality of course similarity based on what
people actually teach. They also incorporate the vagaries of scheduling in which some faculty members
are obligated to teach course-subjects outside of their main field of teaching and research. In this sense,
the cluster groupings made from the human subject data might be superior. Taken in their entirety, the
author would choose the 14 factors from the card sort data over the 28 factors from the CSCO data. The
former better satisfy the a priori desired characteristics of a clustering approach that avoids the existence
of many small groupings of only one or two course-subjects. Also, if one were to accept the diminished
number of factors determined by the scree plot analysis, the clustering approach of the factor analysis on
128

the CSCO data would also violate the desired characteristic of every course-subject belonging to a
category.
However, a more nuanced analysis reveals that some groupings may be better derived from the CSCO
data. The table below illustrates this point. For instance, human experts may be biased by course-subject
names. It is easy to group the taxation course-subjects together as they all have taxation in their name.
However, the CSCO grouping reveals a more topical approach that also includes those course-subjects
that exist largely to reduce tax obligations—the estate planning course-subjects as well as Employee
Benefit Plans. See Table 43. These course-subjects were placed in other categories by the experts.

4.3.2 K-Means
The k-means clustering algorithm was used to compare the CSCO data against the human subject card
sort data to see differences in how the two datasets cluster. The analysis revealed structural differences in
the relationships between the course-subjects in each dataset. As required by the algorithm, three
predetermined cluster amounts were used (15, 20, and 25 clusters) to see how each dataset responded to
the k-means treatment. The choice of 15, 20, and 25 clusters was determined in part by the factor analysis
(14 factors above the elbow line of the card sort data) and the 25 clusters suggested by category names
used by five or more of the human subjects (see Section 3.6).
The accompanying ANOVA analysis output from SPSS states: “The F tests should be used only for
descriptive purposes because the clusters have been chosen to maximize the differences among cases in
different clusters. The observed significance levels are not corrected for this and thus cannot be
interpreted as tests of the hypothesis that the cluster means are equal.” However, high F-Test values have
been interpreted as an indicator of cluster cohesiveness and how well a cluster loads on a particular
course-subject (Burns & Burns, 2008, p. 558). Additionally, repeated running of the CSCO and card sort
k-means analysis produced the exact same results at all three cluster intervals.

The specific

implementation of the K-means algorithm in SPSS appears deterministic.
The CSCO k-means cluster analysis grossly violated some of the desired conditions of a clustering
treatment. Over the three predetermined cluster amounts (15, 20, 25 clusters), the k-means algorithm
produced numerous clusters consisting of only one member and large and uninterpretable mega-clusters
consisting of 38, 41 and 31 clusters. See Figure 22. Additionally, as the number of clusters increased, it
was hoped that the large mega-clusters would break into several interpretable clusters. Instead, with a
few exceptions, the already small clusters fragmented into even smaller clusters and there still remained
an uninterpretable mega-cluster. See Table 44. Also, there was not a consistent evolution of cluster
memberships over the three cluster solutions as course-subjects sometimes went back and forth between
otherwise disparate clusters. These same traits were largely absent from the card sort k-means analysis.
130

See Figure 23 and Table 45. Again, this is probably a result of the CSCO data being inherently more
multi-dimensional than the card sort data.

Legal History

There is at least one instance in which the experts misunderstood a course-subject—Trade
Regulation. As revealed by a casebook on the topic of Trade Regulation (Pitofsky et al., 2010), the
course-subject deals with the regulation of business to protect consumers. This includes topics such as
antitrust, Federal Trade Commission guidelines, consumer protections, lemon laws, etc. It is not about
the governance of international trade. (That is the subject matter of International Business Transactions).
A preponderance of experts mistakenly grouped Trade Regulation with international themed coursesubjects. That is why at the 15 and 20 k-means cluster solutions Trade Regulation is included with the
International Law cluster. It is not until the 25 cluster solution that it is situated in its rightful place—a
cluster category called Trade Regulation. The CSCO data does not make this mistake. Over all three
cluster intervals, it places Trade Regulation with business and regulated entities course-subjects. This is
one instance in which the empirical technique of analyzing what faculty members taught was more
correct than the human experts.
Furthermore, the grouping of all of the “Law and” course-subjects (Law and Accounting, Law and
Economics, Law and Literature, Law and Medicine, Law and Psychiatry, Law and Religion, Law and
Science, Law and Social Science) into one or two interdisciplinary categories because they all involve law
and one other discipline, is too simplistic. The CSCO data does a better job of revealing how these
subjects cluster based on their actual subject matter and not due to the fact that they are simply

interdisciplinary in nature. Similarly, Workers’ Compensation is more related to Torts than the other
Labor and Employment course-subjects as revealed by the CSCO clustering.

The human subjects

probably grouped Workers’ Compensation with other labor and employment law course-subjects because
of worker in the title. Similarly, CSCO cluster analysis reveals that International Business Transactions is
better grouped with regulated industries than the other international law subjects.
4.3.3 QAP Analysis
QAP analysis was performed on the two networks relied upon in the above clustering analysis—the
normalized CSCO data (association strength (2009) total occurrences method) and the card sort matrix of
expert determined related course-subjects. The Pearson correlation value of 0.535 (see Figure 24)
indicates that the matrixes are halfway between being entirely correlated (1 or -1) and not correlated at all
0. Also, the results are definitely statistically significant well past the 95% confidence interval as none of
the 5000 random permutations produced networks that were more highly correlated. This means that
CSCO data is about 53% correlated with human subjects’ views of the topical relatedness of the coursesubjects. The lack of a perfect correlation probably comes from a number of realities. First, teaching
assignments (CSCO data) rely on extenuating factors such as shortages, unexpected class enrollment,
teachers teaching in more than one general subject area for variety, etc. In other words, the CSCO data
contains relationships that exceed mere topical relatedness. Second, as discussed above, there were errors
in the human subjects’ understanding of the course-subjects (Trade Regulation). Additionally, the human
subjects made groupings based on higher level conceptual similarity (see the interdisciplinary cluster) that
might not reflect pure topical overlap. These are probably the major reasons that the two matrices are not
better correlated.

4.3.4 Best Clusters
For reasons described in Section 2.3.3, clusters are needed for the domain map of CSCO data. The
following clusters are distilled from the best of the cluster analysis results from the two techniques above.
These will be overlain on the 2010-11 base-map. Selection of the clusters and their membership was
informed by the analysis of the grouping labels (see Section 3.6) used by the experts. Also, whenever
possible, preference was given to CSCO data as clusters on the final CSCO map that are based on the
CSCO cluster analysis will be more contiguous than if relying on the card sort cluster data. The seven
typical required first year course-subjects were privileged in the labeling of the clusters as law students
and American trained lawyers will be accustomed to these labels—(1) Contracts, (2) Civil Procedure, (3)
Property, (4) Torts, (5) Criminal Law, (6) Constitutional Law, and (7) Legal Research and Writing
(Carpenter, 2012, pp. 50-55). The clusters have all of the characteristics that are desired in a cluster
141

scheme. Chief among these characteristics are no clusters with only one member (the lowest is two,
Entertainment Law) and no disproportionately large clusters (there are two clusters with 9 course subjects
each—(1) Taxation / Wealth Preservation, and (2) Jurisprudence. The average amount of course-subjects
per cluster is six. See Table 46.

4.3.5 Section Conclusion
While informative, the CSCO k-means cluster treatment created clusters at all three chosen cluster
amounts that were unsuited for thematic overlay on a base-map. This was because clusters both had too
many constituent course-subjects (38, 41, or 31) and were largely uninterpretable, or there were too many
instances of clusters comprised of a single course-subject. The clusters produced by the CSCO factor
analysis were more interpretable and more capable of being used for thematic overlay on a base-map than
the CSCO k-means analysis. While correlated, the card-sort network of similar course-subjects contains
much less multi-dimensional complexity than the CSCO data, and might be considered generally
preferable. However, there were instances in which the human subjects were incorrect as to their
144

understanding of a particular course-subject and the empirical, CSCO, technique was either more correct,
or nuanced.
4.3.6 Future Work
In the future, the author would like to conduct a similar performance analysis of factor, k-means, and
QAP analysis on the 1931-32 and 1972-73 map year data. Also, the author would like to explore other
cluster approaches such as hierarchical clustering and that implemented in the VOSviewer software.

145

5. Understanding the Structure and Evolution of the Domain of Law
The insights gained from the analysis set out above are used to render CSCO domain maps of the
academic discipline of law in the United States for map years 1931-32, 1972-73, and 2010-11. These
maps provide a birds-eye view of how the field of law has evolved over almost eighty years.
Furthermore, these insights are enhanced by the metric analysis that precedes it.

5.1 Metric Analysis
As discussed above in Section 3.1.3.3, the author was able to glean how the course-subjects changed over
time. Course-subjects merging together or diverging from a common parent was mostly discernable from
the scope notes (“includes statements”) that frequently accompanied a course-subject. Furthermore, the
author was aided by cross-references and “see also” statements contained in some of the course-subjects.
Finally, the timing of the appearance and disappearance of specific course-subjects and their includes
statements were also used to determine which course-subjects continued others after a discontinuance or
name change. For a sense of this nesting of course-subjects for years 1931-32, 1972-73, and 2010-11, see
Appendix 7: Count and Percentage of Faculty Teaching Each Course-Subject Over all Map Years. Also,
schematic diagrams were used to visualize the mergence and divergence of two particularly troublesome
groupings of course-subjects—estate planning and procedural course-subjects, see Figure 25 and Figure
26. These diagrams tell an interesting story of the evolution of the legal course-subject canon. Judging
by the number of course-subjects in the canon, early law school education in the United States was much
more concerned about the means to hold and convey assets than it is today. Similarly, early law school
education involved many more, and presumably more complex forms, of pleading than used today. But
most importantly, knowing how course-subjects relate to each other over time allows for meaningful
metric comparisons across the seventy-nine years of the dataset.

5.1.1 Most Gains in Percentage of the Overall Canon
The dataset allows for an evaluation of the changes in percentage of the overall course-subject canon from
1931-32 to 2010-11—for either individual course-subjects or groupings of course-subjects. A ranking of
the five greatest increases in the overall percentages is informative as to changes in the allocation of
teaching resources in American law schools during the 79 years of the dataset. See Table 47. The
greatest percentage increase is in faculty teaching courses related to International Law. This is most
likely due to the increase in globalization that has occurred in the interim and the rise of Immigration and
Human Rights.

Constitutional Law is also much more prominent in 2010-11 than it was in 1931-32.

This is most likely attributable to the rise in individual rights that has occurred over that same time period.
Legal Research and Writing has become a much more established part of the law school curriculum. In
the past, some schools did not have legal research and writing faculty. Instead, third year students taught
the first year students these skills. The various criminal and tax course-subjects have also all increased as
to their overall percentage of how many faculty are teaching them.

5.1.2 Most Losses in Percentage of Overall Canon
Because percentages of the overall total are being evaluated, the gains discussed above must come at the
expense of some course-subjects or course-subject groupings. A ranking of the five greatest decreases in
the overall percentage of course-subjects taught is informative as to changes in the allocation of teaching
resources in American law schools from 1931-32 to 2010-11. See Table 48. In the past, American law
schools were far more concerned about how one inherits property. This topic has greatly diminished in
importance in terms of the number of faculty members that presently teach it. At least one scholar has
noted that commercial law was “a dying field, and one with few signs of revival” (Garvin, 2007, p. 403).
150

This is empirically supported by the metric analysis. Contemporary law schools, in order to teach new
course-subjects such as Environmental Law, Sports Law, National Security Law, and Entertainment Law,
must necessarily diminish the amount of resources devoted to teaching other parts of the canon that
previously enjoyed a high percentage of the overall canon. This includes business organization courses
(ranked 3rd in overall losses). Similarly, equity and property have also diminished in terms of the overall
percentage of what faculty members are teaching.

5.1.3 Average Length Courses Have Been Taught
Metric analysis may also be applied to the length of time faculty members have been teaching a particular
course-subject. This is made possible because the AALS directories bin the faculty teaching the various
course-subjects by the amount of years they have been teaching—(1) one to five years, (2) six to ten
years, and (3) over ten years. See Appendix 41 through Appendix 43. This allows scientometricians to
know which courses are comparatively aged and not attracting new faculty. This may be accomplished
by averaging the length of time one has been teaching a subject based on the following formula: ((1 x
Amount in Category 1 (teaching one to five years)) + (2 x Amount in Category 2 (teaching six to ten
years)) + (3 x Amount in Category 3 (teaching over ten years))) / Overall amount of faculty teaching that
particular course-subject. Table 49 displays the five most aged course-subjects for each of the map years.
Each of these course-subjects would most likely trigger a similar admonition that Garvin applied to
Commercial Law: “[y]oung scholars tend to be more productive than their seniors” and that “[a]n aging
field will tend to produce less scholarship and thus figure less in the minds of prospective law teachers”
(2007, pp. 408-409). Similarly, Stadler would likely classify each of these course-subjects as ‘strong
sells’ (2006).

5.2 Global Structure of the Law Domain
The global structure of the academic domain of law in the United States according to CSCO data is
visualized below. Three domain maps portray time slices spaced roughly forty years apart—1931-32,
1972-73, and 2010-11. The data would allow for the creation of more domain maps covering additional
time slices. However, the three domain maps cover the broad sweep of the overall dataset. Additionally,
two-dimensional domain maps were created (as opposed to three-dimensional maps) because they better
serve as base-maps for additional thematic overlay, see Section 6. Each map was created using the best
identified normalization and ordination methods from the analysis above—Association Strength (Total
Occurrences) and VOS.
5.2.1 1931-32 CSCO Map
The initial rendering of the 1931-32 data is not very helpful given the outlier status of Patent Law, see
Figure 27. In 1931-32, Patent Law was only taught by eight people and is involved in only two coursesubject co-occurrences: one with Procedure and one with Sales. This explains its placement from the
ordination process far from the more connected whole on the left.

Figure 27: 1931-32 Initial CSCO Map
However, the close-up on the main component of the 1931-32 CSCO domain map is much more
interpretable and useful, see Figure 28. There are numerous satisfactory proximities. Many of these are
in the 1931-32 gold-standard. For instance, most of the procedural course-subjects, Practice, Common
Law Pleading, Code Pleading, and Equity Pleading & Practice) cluster together on the lower right portion
153

of the domain map. (However, Pleading, remains by itself in the center of the map.) Additionally, the
three estate planning subjects are in near proximity in the middle to upper right of the map: Trusts, Wills
and Administration, and Future Interests. As estate planning involves property and wealth preservation, it
is appropriate that these three course-subjects are also adjacent to the two property subjects: Personal
Property and Real Property. Furthermore, two natural resources topics, Mining Law and Water Rights,
almost overlap on the far right of the map. However, they are distant from another natural resource topic,
Oil and Gas.

154

Figure 28: 1931-32 CSCO Map (Without Patent Law)
155

5.2.2 1972-73 CSCO Map
The 1972-73 domain map does not have any extreme outliers like the 1931-32 map (Patent Law) and the
2010-11 map (Forensic Medicine), see Figure 29. In order to better comprehend the placement of the
course-subjects, it is best to view the several details of the 1972-73 domain map. The inset image shows
the map as a whole and the overlain rectangle indicates the area of detail portrayed, see Figure 30, Figure
31, Figure 32, and Figure 33. Once again there are numerous intuitively satisfying adjacencies that are
also in the 1972-73 gold-standard. Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure are proximate in the middle left
of the map. Agency, Business Organizations and Corporations are all proximate on the upper right of the
map. So are Natural Resources, Environmental Law, Water Rights, and Oil and Gas. Furthermore, the
Estate Planning topics are also proximate on the lower right of the map and, similar to 1931-32, are
included with the Property subjects: Trusts and Estates, Future Interests, Decedents’ Estates, Fiduciary
Administration, Real Property, and Personal Property.

5.2.3 2010-11 CSCO Map
Figure 34 is the entire 2010-11 CSCSO domain map. In order to better comprehend the placement of the
course-subjects, it is best to view the several details of the 2010-11 CSCO map, see Figure 35, Figure
36, and Figure 37. The success of the adjacencies relative to the 2010-11 gold-standard has been
discussed in Section 4.2. However, moving clockwise from the lower left one can get a sense of the
broad sweep of the general areas of the law—taxation, flowing into business matters, flowing into natural
resources and the environment, flowing into international topics, flowing into criminal law topics,
flowing into medical topics. With the exception of Criminal Law, the doctrinal first year courses
generally occupy the center (Constitutional Law, Property, Torts, Contracts, and Civil Procedure). This is
true of the previous map years as well. These are the doctrinal pillars of the common law that Kennedy
(1983) describes as central to the schematic of law school education, see Section 2.5. However, their
centrality most likely is a result of the fact that many people are needed to teach the first year curriculum
and that those professors also have other, non-topically related teaching interests. Thus, these first year
course-subjects are pulled in all directions and are consequently placed in the center by the ordination
layout.

5.2.4 2010-11 Card Sort Map
As a point of comparison, the card sort data was rendered using the same VOS ordination technique. No
normalization was used as each of the 104 course-subjects had an equal chance to be paired with all other
103 course-subjects by each of the 18 experts. (However, even when employing the default association
strength (Normalization 1) normalization as implemented in VOSviewer, the map looked essentially the
same.) Unlike the clustering analysis with the card sort data which produced arguable better cluster
results than the CSCO data, the ordination of the card sort data was clumpy and lacked the nuance of the
CSCO data. Items were grouped in their most obvious (and sometimes incorrect) clusters and the more
sophisticated layout of the CSCO data is not present. Once again, to interpret and use the resultant card
sort map at the resolution allowed by 8.5 x 11 inch paper, details are necessary, see Figure 38, Figure 39,
Figure 40, and Figure 41
The card sort map is clumpier with many topics displayed on top of each other. This is a product of
the human experts being more united in the pairings of many of the course-subjects such as the
International Law course-subjects (International Law and International Organizations). This alone is not
a failure in map creation as there are strategies to offset the overlapping course-subjects to make them
comprehensible and less visibly jarring. Of greater interest is the lack of nuance that more organically
and meaningful distributes the course subjects in the overall map space. Juvenile law is in reasonably
close proximity to Family Law. However, it was originally a criminal law subcategory. The CSCO map
better reflects this bridge status of Juvenile Law between Family Law and Criminal Law.

Trade

Regulation and International Business Transactions is another adjacency that is slightly overstated on the
card sort map. Their placement on the CSCO map is a little more true to their topical subject matter and
does not stem from the mere similarity of the word ‘trade.’ See discussion in Section 4.3.2. However,
the same general sweep of course-subjects appearing on the CSCO map is also mostly present on the
card-sort map—“moving clockwise from the lower left, taxation, flowing into business matters, flowing
into natural resources and the environment, flowing into international topics, flowing into criminal law
167

topics, flowing into medical topics.” This is further evidence that CSCO analysis is a valid technique to
make domain maps.

5.2.5 Observations about the CSCO Maps
The domain maps for each of the map years have many intuitively satisfying aspects and illustrate
important concepts in legal education. As discussed in the literature review, domain mappers frequently
label the horizontal (x) and vertical axes (y) of their two-dimensional domain maps. For map years 197273 and 2010-11, commercial, business, and taxation law course-subjects are on one side of the horizontal
axis of the map while criminal law courses are on the other. In the broadest terms, this illustrates the
private law / public law divide.

Private law course-subjects involve legal matters between individuals

and/or businesses that do not involve the government. Public law course-subjects, on the other hand,
necessarily involve the government as either a participant or a protector. This public law / private law
dichotomy is largely absent from the 1931-32 CSCO map. This might be because the legal landscape
over 80 years ago was much more focused on private law matters. Private law course-subjects occupy the
center of the 1931-32 map while, with few exceptions, public law courses occupy the periphery of the
map. This change over 80 years reflects the proliferation of public law course-subjects and interest in law
school education in the United States.
Similarly for the 1972-73 and 2010-11 CSCO maps, there is a perceivable continuum on the Y axis in
terms of locality of focus. For both maps, generally speaking, more local and geographically specific
legal issues appear on the bottom while course-subjects with international aspects appear on the top.
Neither horizontal nor vertical continuum discussed in this section is entirely consistent. For instance,
Torts is a quintessential private law course-subject as it entails all of the wrongs individuals or corporate
entities do to each other. However, in all three map years it is very central. This is probably an artifact of
Torts being a core, first year course-subject that is required for all law students.

It is probably

disproportionally taught by faculty members that teach a diverse range of other course-subjects and is
pulled towards the center during ordination.
Additionally, the most recent CSCO domain map may be used by course advisors to inform students
as to which courses to take. For instance, sports lawyers provide contract, property, and general business
173

advice to athletes. Thus, it is potentially illuminating for novices to see that Sports Law is proximate to
these types of course-subjects on the 2010-11 CSCO map. (Sports Law came into existence as a coursesubject in 1988-89. Thus, it is not present on either the 1931-32 or 1972-73 CSCO maps.) It is not
enough to merely enjoy sports. It is advisable for a young attorney interested in sports law to also be both
interested in and competent in basic contracts, property, and business issues. Course counselors may use
the 2010-11 domain map to point this out to students.
5.2.6 Future Work
As suggested by a domain expert during the card sort, I want to compare and contrast two variant CSCO
maps of the legal domain. The first will use CSCO data from the highest tier (top 25%) of law schools
according to the U.S. News and World Reports rankings. The second will use course-subject data from
the lowest tier (bottom 25%) of law schools according to the U.S. News and World Reports rankings. It
is hypothesized that the map from the top fifty ranked law schools will be more topically coherent and
accurate. This is because the more prestigious schools have larger budgets and a greater ability to allow
their faculty to specialize and teach course-subjects of their choice.

6. Thematic Overlays
One of the greatest uses for domain maps, as well as conventional cartographic maps, is the ability to
overlay thematic information for the efficient visual processing and comprehension of the overlaid
information (Dent et al., 2009). Domain maps of academic legal course-subjects allow for the efficient
conveyance of such data as the amount of teachers teaching a particular subject, the average length of
time a subject has been taught by faculty members, the frequency that a course-subject is taught as a
seminar, and perhaps most importantly, higher level clusters. Overlays are demonstrated below for the
2010-11 CSCO map. Domain maps may also be used as interactive front-ends to additional online related
content as will also be demonstrated.
Domain maps have the potential to serve a pedagogical function as navigable front-ends to
additional content. Holley and Dansereau have documented the long history of spatial learning strategies
in the field of education (1984). The structure inherent in visual representations of the big picture acts as
‘scaffolding’ which a learner may use to organize the details of a particular subject and to assimilate new
knowledge with the learner’s existing knowledge (West et al., 1991). Additionally, “big picture displays
make explicit the connections between conceptual subparts and how they are related to the whole” (Hook
& Börner, 2005, p. 188).
Domain maps utilize spatial metaphors in order to convey associations between concepts to the
viewer (Fabrikant & Skupin, 2005). They are an effort to explicitly convey the underlying structure of a
domain to a user so that he or she can internalize the framework presented in the domain map and
reconcile it with his or her existing framework. “By seeing where a topic is placed on a [domain map],
the user may draw from his or her store of existing knowledge about adjacent topics to begin to
understand what an unknown topic is about” (Hook & Börner, 2005, p. 199). Domain maps can also play
an important role in academic story telling (Gershon & Page, 2001) such as when they are marshaled to
show the evolution of the topic space of legal course-subjects from 1931-32 to 2010-11. Ellingham was

175

perhaps the first to use a domain map as a front-end to a body of literature (1948). Others have also found
domain maps useful in this regard (Börner & Chen, 2002).

6.1 Counts of Teachers by Subject
Not all course-subjects are taught in equal amounts.

Some course-subjects, such as the first year

curriculum, are taught by a large number of faculty members. Other course-subjects are extremely
specialized and are only taught by comparatively few faculty members. Figure 42 conveys to the viewer
that course-subjects such as Constitutional Law, Legal Research and Writing, and Clinical Teaching are
course-subjects taught by numerous faculty members. 23

In fact, they are the top three in rank.

Conversely, course-subjects such as Employee Benefit Plans, Disability Law, Judicial Administration,
and Forensic Medicine are taught by comparatively few faculty members. For complete data, see
Appendix 43: Course-Subject Metrics 2010-11. 1,630 different faculty members, or 4.5% of all law
faculty members, are listed in the AALS Directory as teaching Constitutional Law—the largest amount.
Only one faculty member teaches Forensic Medicine—the smallest amount. Domain maps with thematic
overlay have the potential of doing a better job of instructing the viewer as to the comparative amount that
different course-subjects are taught than the tabular data presented in Appendix 43. However, for
detailed and specific information, tabular data is important as well.

23

The scaled image that was produced by VOSviewer was not graphically sufficient to be included herein. There
were 3D effects on the nodes that made it difficult to distinguish nodes that are taught by a small number of people
and those that appear to be further away from the viewer in the picture plane because of the illusion of the 3D
effects. Furthermore, VOSviewer does not permit the option to include a legend and both the VOSviewer Manual
(1.5.4) and (Van Eck & Waltman, 2010) are silent as to the mechanics of how the size variation slider works in
terms of node size. It is unknown whether the slider scales the input values linearly or logarithmically. The nodes
in Figure 42, produced by the author using Adobe Illustrator, vary by five sizes that represent the different quintiles
of how many faculty members teach a particular course-subject.

176

Figure 42: 2010-11 CSCO Map (Faculty Counts)

6.2 Percentage Taught as Seminar
Another piece of information captured in recent AALS Directories is whether or not a course-subject has
been offered by an instructor as a seminar. Seminars are readings based courses that frequently do not
have a textbook (or casebook), and instead of an exam, the evaluation is based on a final research paper.
Discussion is often lead by the students and class participation is usually expected. Here, the thematic
overlay quickly conveys a surprising trend. Course-subjects that are only taught by a few faculty
members are more likely to have been taught as seminars, see Figure 43. Examples include: Tax Policy,
Critical Race Theory, Bioethics, National Security Law, and Judicial Administration. When comparing
the two maps, Figure 42: 2010-11 CSCO Map (Faculty Counts) and Figure 43: 2010-11 CSCO Map
(Percent Ever Having Taught as a Seminar), this fact soon becomes apparent to the viewer. Additionally,
the standard first year course-subjects are seldom taught as seminars. Base-maps with thematic overlay
allow for these types of visual discoveries. 24

24

The course-subject with the highest percentage of ever having been taught by the instructor as a seminar is Tax
Policy (71%). The lowest is Payment Systems (00%). The following are the percentages for the additional coursesubjects discussed above: Critical Race Theory (69%), Bioethics (55%), National Security Law (36%), and Judicial
Administration (50%).

6.3 Front Ends to Additional Online Content
Figure 44 is a mockup of the 2010-11 CSCO map being used as a digital front end to additional
course content. The modified screenshot is of an actual webpage of a law school at a Midwestern
university. 25 The presumed intent of the webpage is to provide information about the required first year
course-subjects. The author proposes that instead of interacting with an enumerated list of coursesubjects, the viewer navigates a domain map (with overlaid thematic content—first year course-subjects).
By using hyperlinked nodes, the user will be able to find additional information about the course-subjects
clicked upon, just as if s/he were using the non-modified page. However, the user might also explore
other areas of the map and learn how the first year course-subjects relate to other courses of which s/he
might have little knowledge. In other words, s/he might be able to intuit something about the topical
content of unknown course-subjects that are in proximity to known course-subjects. Also, the viewer
might be able to begin to internalize the big picture framework of how all of the course-subjects are
topically related.

6.4 Higher Level Groupings (Clusters)
Higher level groupings, or clusters, are important for breaking the domain map into chunks, or more
learnable pieces. The best cluster categories from the cluster analysis in Section 4.3.4 have been applied
to the 2010-11 CSCO map. The map illustrates the utility of using higher ordered groupings to assist a
novice in becoming familiar with a domain or an expert to quickly situate him or herself on the domain
map, see Figure 45 and Figure 46.
One problem commonly faced by domain mappers is clearly conveying many different cluster
categories—eighteen for the 2010-11 CSCO map. Here, the clusters have been coded in different colors.
However, there are not enough clearly distinguishable colors in the human visual processing spectrum to
make eighteen cluster categories readily understood. Thus, the clusters have also been placed in bounded
regions in order to make them more discriminable. These bounded regions were created by hand using
the pencil tool of Adobe Illustrator and adhering to the cluster categories established by the cluster
analysis in Section 4.3.4. When the bounded regions could not contain all of the clusters without
overlapping, separate topical enclaves were created for the non-contiguous members.
Not all course-subjects fall neatly into contiguous regions. Instead, course-subjects of one cluster
intermingle or overlap with course-subjects belonging to another cluster or are entirely surrounded by
other clusters (topical enclaves). This is common with the reduction of a highly multidimensional space
into two dimensions. With the 2010-11 map, some course-subjects form relatively contiguous and tightly
arranged clusters, see Figure 47 and Figure 48. However, other course-subjects such as those forming
the Professional Skills cluster, see Figure 49, are pulled in numerous directions and result in four separate
topical enclaves. The Professional Skills course-subjects are a bit like methods classes in graduate
education—they can be taught by faculty members with numerous different doctrinal specialties. Thus,
these course-subjects are pulled apart from being a tightly grouped area and occupy several different
regions in the domain map center. The same could also be said about the Civil Procedure course-subjects.

182

Other individual course-subjects are comprised of topics that strongly relate them to two or more
different course-subjects. This also causes stress in the two-dimensional ordination as the course-subject
is “pulled” in different directions by the two or more related course-subjects. For instance, Juvenile Law
is both related to Family Law (in terms of the well-being and cohesiveness of the family that also includes
juveniles) as well as Criminal Procedure (in the context of juvenile delinquency). Similarly, Elder Law is
both about the physical well-being of senior citizens (protecting them from harm) as well as making sure
that older people have their financial affairs in order. Consequently, Elder Law is pulled both towards the
Taxation / Wealth Preservation course-subjects as well as the Family Law and Compassion coursesubjects in which it clusters.
Another problem with clustering that also results in topical enclaves is that even though a particular
course-subject could be placed in two or more cluster groupings, it has to be placed in its best cluster. For
instance, Education Law is most about constitutional issues addressing students and schools. Thus, it best
fits in the Constitutional Law cluster. However, Education Law is also about the health and well-being of
the students. Consequently, it could have also been included in the Law and Medicine or Family Law and
Compassion clusters. Additionally, Education Law also implicates Torts and Harm Prevention issues.
Similarly, Law and Social Science, could also be included in numerous different clusters. However, as
the course-subject is most often applied to Criminal Law issues, it remains best clustered with the
Criminal Law cluster.
One solution to the non-contiguous cluster bounding problem would be to utilize the interactivity of
the online environment. Ideally, a user would be able to either click on or mouse-over one cluster
category and all of the constituent course-subjects would be highlighted (or alternatively, all of the noncluster course-subjects would become muted). This would assist the user in identifying course-subjects
that are in the same cluster, but not all bounded by the same contiguous region. Also, Klavens and
Boyack’s thresholding of the top 15 relationships for any particular entity undergoing ordination might

183

also help with this problem. This might reduce some of the many different directional ‘tugs’ on a
particular course-subject and might result in more contiguous clusters. 26

26

It was requested of the author to “explain to a non-expert in easy terms how the visualization in [Figure 45] was
created, how one reads such a visualization, and what one can learn from it”: In the image below, law school courses
have been arranged by a computer based on how frequently they are taught together. More similar courses appear
closer together and less similar courses appear further apart. The clusters have also been determined by a computer.
The courses within the same color regions are topically similar. One can learn from the image the major groupings
of law school courses, and different practice areas for attorneys as well as areas of focus for law students.
Furthermore, a person might be able to infer the topical content of an unknown course based on that course’s spatial
proximity to a known course.

6.5 Section Conclusion
The examples above illustrate the benefits of using domain maps as a base-map for the overlay of
additional thematic content.

In this fashion, a large amount of data that would otherwise occupy

numerous cells in a spreadsheet can be quickly perceived by the viewer using his or her highly developed
visual and cognitive processing system. Furthermore, domain maps serve a pedagogical function by
providing scaffolding or big picture conceptual overviews to the user. To this end, it is important to
include cluster information to assist in the learning of the domain. Much can be accomplished in terms of
thematic overlay on top of a good base-map. For instance, the overwhelming majority of courses that law
students take are electives. The choice of these electives could be aided by the use of a domain map. The
maps could also be used to illustrate other criteria by third parties. For instance, law firms could quickly
convey to new students the course-subjects from the overall legal canon that the firm most values and
wants to see taken by its new associates.
Once the utility of CSCO domain maps become known, certain policy issues might arise. For
instance, absent from the 2010-11 base-map are widely taught law school course-subjects such as
Election Law and Commercial Paper. Conversely there are two course-subjects involving women’s
issues: Women and the Law and Feminine Jurisprudence. Once CSCO base-maps are used for presenting
data and as navigational front-ends to literatures, more faculty members might lobby the AALS for
inclusion of their particular course topic in the List of Faculty by Subject. In other words, what is
currently included in the annual directory as a convenience to help faculty members locate other faculty
members teaching similar courses might assume significantly greater importance in conceptualizing how
legal education is organized and presented to the world.

7. Conclusions
Leydesdorff and Rafols note that: “One should not expect a unique map of science, but a number of
possible representations … . Each map contains a projection from a specific perspective” (Leydesdorff &
Rafols, 2009, p. 350).

This post-modern view might be applicable to the CSCO dataset as well.

However, while there are many different and often competing dimensions to be captured and represented
by domain maps, if one articulates criteria with sufficient specificity, for any given domain criteria, there
is likely to be a best or most accurate domain map representation. This research has striven to obtain the
best domain map of topically related legal course-subjects in law school education in the United States.
Additionally, the dissertation has produced some evidence of the best practices for the constituent domain
mapping steps—normalization and ordination. Domain mapping as a field will not be mature until there
have been numerous studies that demonstrate the best techniques for the many different data situations
encountered by scientometricians. This dissertation is one step along that path and follows a trail
previously marked by others.
Perhaps the most significant contribution of this dissertation is the analytic framework to compare
multiple different algorithms, tools, and techniques at each stage of domain map production. Most
domain maps involve normalization and ordination. Additionally, clusters are also a desired feature of
most domain maps. This work, and the schematic framework set out in Figure 3, illustrate how multiple
different treatments can be compared with each other at each stage of domain map construction and how
their cumulative effects may be compared across stages. The answer to both of these questions—best
inner-stage performance, and best cumulative effects across multiple stages, are necessary to identify the
best individual and combinations of algorithms, tools and techniques.

Future studies can use the

framework presented herein to compare existing and novel algorithms, tool, and techniques. In fact, this
framework provides a potential standardization for comparing all constituent steps of domain map
production against gold-standards.

191

7.1 Answers to Specific Research Questions
•

Research Question 1: Do faculty members, on the whole, specialize and focus their energy
teaching courses that are topically similar to other courses they teach? This is the threshold
question which is also the assumed premise underlying the use of CSCO to create valid domain
maps of academic course-subjects.
Yes. The fact that a high percentage (83% to 95% for map years 1972-73 and 2010-11) of
gold-standard pairs are in the top quintile of overall ranked values of the CSCO
normalized data, provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that generally, faculty
members teach course-subjects that are topically similar. See Section 4.1.1.

•

Research Question 2: Can course-subject co-occurrence (CSCO) be used to produce topic maps
that are consistent with expert opinion and other indicators of the topical similarity of law school
course-subjects?
Yes. The average rank of distances of all CSCO gold-standard identified edges (derived
from 5 extrinsic sources of topical similarity) are within the top 15% of all possible 201011 edges when using the best normalization (Association Strength Total Occurrences)
and ordination (VOS) techniques. See Section 4.2.4.

•

Research Question 3: When using CSCO network data to compare normalization algorithms
(association strength, cosine, and no normalization) and spatial ordination and layout techniques
(Proxscal MDS, VOSviewer, and spring-force algorithms), which combination of algorithms,

192

tools, and techniques is best at portraying the overall structure of law school course-subjects as
compared to an extrinsic ‘gold-standard’ of similar course-subject pairs?
As the Association Strength normalization technique does a better job than Cosine in data
years with widely varying occurrences of course-subjects, and just as good as Cosine in
years without a wide variance, the Association Strength is the preferred normalization
technique (either variant) to use with co-occurrence data. This confirms the findings of
Van Eck and Waltman (2009). See Section 4.1.7. This dissertation has also contributed
to an understanding of how both normalization techniques and their variants differ in
response to different conditions of the data. See Section 4.1.6.
As to CSCO data of legal course-subjects and the gold-standard used herein, the VOS
ordination algorithm utilizing the Association Strength (2009) Total Occurrences method
of normalization produced the best results. This is some evidence of the superiority of
the combination. Until shown otherwise, this author will use this combination for all
subsequent domain mapping needs. See Section 4.2.4.

•

Research Question 4: How well does cluster analysis of course-subject co-occurrence data
capture the higher level groupings of law school course subjects compared with the subject
groupings created by experts?
The results in this case were mixed. While the two networks (CSCO and card sort) are
more similar than they are dissimilar, they diverge in some important ways. Sometimes
the card sort data is a more correct indicator of topical similarity. However, in some
instances the CSCO data may be shown to be a more correct indicator of topical
similarity. See Section 4.3.

•

Research Question 5: How have law school course-subjects changed over time?
193

The number of course-subjects has almost doubled—104 in 2010-11 compared to 58 in
1931-32. Topics such as International Law, Constitutional Law, Legal Research and
Writing, Criminal Law, and Taxation have come to represent a higher proportion of the
legal canon in terms of percentage gains in the amount of all faculty members teaching
them. Conversely, based on a decrease in the percentage amount of faculty members
teaching the related course-subjects, the legal academy is now less concerned about how
one inherits property, conducts commerce, organizes business entities, and holds
property. See Section 5.1.
•

Research Question 6: What do thematic overlays reveal about the relative amount certain
course-subjects are taught, which course-subjects are taught as a seminar, and other metric
evaluations of the law school canon? This question addresses the utility of overlays applied to
CSCO network produced domain maps.
Section 6 illustrates the use of domain maps as base-maps on which to layer additional
thematic information. The human visual and cognitive processing system is able to
quickly perceive and distinguish the most taught course-subjects, the course-subjects
most taught as seminars, the first year course-subjects, and how the course-subjects
cluster in higher level groupings.

7.2 Significance of the Research
The National Science Foundation (NSF) requires all grant applicants to address the intellectual merit and
broader impacts of their proposed grants. The NSF gives guidance as to what is meant by these terms
(NSF, 2011). It is helpful to contextualize the significance of the research described in this dissertation
using the NSF guidelines for intellectual merit and broader impacts.
194

7.2.1 Intellectual Merit
This research advances the knowledge and understanding of the legal education domain in the United
States by representing the topical relatedness of law school course-subjects for the first time in an
efficient, visual manner. The domain maps created, and subsequently validated, utilize the distance
similarity metaphor to show the topical relatedness of the course-subjects and their larger groupings. This
helps students to become familiar with the law school curriculum. It allows novices to infer something
about unknown topics based on their proximity to known topics. Furthermore, the domain maps function
as base-maps for the efficient overlay and presentation of thematic information such as statistics about the
law school curriculum. This is the first time that the structure of the academic discipline of law in the
United States has been revealed through the exploration of large datasets and determined through
replicable, empirical means. Additionally, this research is the first to capture and analyze changes in the
law school curriculum as reflected by changes in course-subjects and their corresponding CSCO
networks.

Prior to the collection and assimilation of the data used for this dissertation, such a

comprehensive study of the field was not possible. Another potentially transformative aspect of the work
will come once the most recent domain map is adopted as a visual front end to online law school course
catalogs. This will allow students to learn about specific courses within a global framework as they
navigate the online course offerings to identify courses they want to take.
As to the field of information science, this is the first work to use course-subjects data to visualize the
teaching space of an academic discipline.

Furthermore, while employing well known techniques,

algorithms, and software, this work contributes to the field by analyzing which combination of these
techniques, algorithms, and software programs works best with the applicable data. The author of the
dissertation was well qualified to perform this investigation and to bridge the two domains from which
the work is drawn—law and information science. In addition to being a doctoral candidate in information
science specializing in data mining, information visualization, and domain mapping, the author is trained
in the law and has over ten years of experience working in law schools in the United States. The author
195

was also well positioned to find, manipulate, and examine the data that was used both to create and
validate the domain maps as well as to identify and secure the participation of knowledgeable experts.
7.2.2 Broader Impacts
This work advances discovery and understanding about the law school curriculum by allowing global
overviews of the field. Experts have well developed schemas about the interrelatedness of coursesubjects in their area of expertise. Administrators, familiar with curricular development, sometimes have
a greater sense of the overall relatedness of the 104 controlled course-subjects of the AALS. Domain
maps make this local and global knowledge available to novices. Domain maps also accommodate
learning by allowing novices to infer subject content about unknown course-subjects from proximity to
known course-subjects. Additionally, the higher level clustering categories identified and validated by
the research allow for additional cognitive scaffolding and sense-making as students develop their
knowledge schemas of the law school domain. Domain maps enhance the infrastructure for research and
education by allowing contextualization of the research and efficient overlay of thematic and statistical
information. Domain maps have the potential to be used in the classroom to illustrate the diverse areas
that frequently arise in the same legal case. Society in general will benefit from the research by having a
framework to explain legal information more effectively. This work has created for the first time, and in
an empirical manner, the “general map of the law” figuratively contemplated by Blackstone over two
hundred years ago (Blackstone, 1783).
The results of this research and the finished domain maps will be disseminated broadly to both the
law and information science domains. Publications stemming from this research will target the very
different and generally non-overlapping literatures of the two fields. Furthermore, the rich data collected
for this research will allow numerous additional studies. For instance, the data collected for this research
will allow for studies of the career trajectories of law school faculty and their mobility between
institutions. Perhaps the most significant contribution of this work is the analytic framework to compare
multiple different algorithms, tools, and techniques at each stage of domain map production. The
196

research demonstrates how multiple different treatments can be compared with each other at each stage of
domain map construction and how their cumulative effects may be compared across stages.

8. Glossary
Note: The following definitions best explain the meaning of the terms as used in this paper and do not
exhaustively convey all of the various meanings of the terms as used in the English language.
Bibliographic Coupling – when two works (articles, books, etc.) each cite a common third work
(Kessler, 1963).
Co-citation – when two works (articles, books, etc.) are both cited by a third article (Marshakova, 1973;
Small, 1973).
Cognitive Scaffolding – a “tool for learners as they construct knowledge” (Driscoll, 2005, p. 257).
Cognitive psychologists have coined the term “cognitive scaffolding” as a label for teacher behaviors that
help students “solve a problem, carry out a task, or achieve a goal which would be beyond [their]
unassisted efforts” (Flick, 2000, p. 109) citing (Wood et al., 1976).
Co-teaching – two or more professors teaching the same course (Cook & Friend, 1995).
Course – is the basic unit of academic study, usually lasting for one semester (or possibly a quarter),
comprised of one or more credit hours, and having its own entry on a student’s academic transcript.
Diachronic – “Of or concerned with phenomena … as they change through time” (Pickett, 2006, p. 499).
Distance-Similarity Metaphor – “elements closer together on information displays will be understood
by users to be more similar” (Montello et al., 2003, p. 317). In other words, distance is a proxy for
similarity.
Domain – “A sphere of activity, concern, or function; a[n academic] field: the domain of history (Pickett,
2006, p. 533).” In terms of domain mapping, the domain being mapped may be as small as a single
concept (volcanoes) or as large as all of science or all of knowledge.
Domain Map – the physical or online artifact produced through the process of domain mapping. See
also ‘Domain Map.’
Domain Mapping – “the graphic rendering of bibliometric [or other] data designed to provide a global
view of a particular domain, the structural details of a domain, the salient characteristics of a domain (its
dynamics, most cited authors or papers, bursting concepts, etc.) or all three” (Hook & Börner, 2005). See
also ‘Domain,’ and ‘Knowledge Domain Visualization (KDV).’
Information Science – “Information science is the study of the gathering, organizing, storing, retrieving,
and dissemination of information” (Bates, 1999, p. 1044). See also (Borko, 1968; Rubin, 1998).

198

Information Visualization (Info Viz) – (1). “[T]he use of computer-supported, interactive, visual
representations of abstract data to amplify cognition” (Card et al., 1999). (2). “[G]raphical representation
of data or concepts” (Ware, 2004, p. 2). to “accelerate human thinking with tools that amplify human
intelligence” (Shneiderman, 2006, p. vii).
Knowledge Domain Visualization (KDV) – synonym of ‘Domain Map.’
Longitudinal – “concerned with the development of persons or groups [or things or entities] over time”
(Pickett, 2006, p. 1031). See also diachronic.
Luminance – “[t]he intensity of light per unit of area at its source” (Pickett, 2006).
Map – a representation of relationships with consistent meaning in all of the available directions of either
a one, two, or three dimensional, spatial layout.
MDS – see Multi-Dimensional Scaling.
Meta-discipline. A discipline that “conduct[s] research and develop[s] theory around the documentary
products of other disciplines and activities” (Bates, 1999, p. 1043).
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) – is a structural modeling technique that takes a multitude of pairwise associations, conceptualized as a scaled unit of distance between the pairings of any two particular
concepts, and reduces all such pairings to a finite number of dimensions (Kruskal & Wish, 1978).
Multi-Teaching – the same professor teaching multiple, different courses over some period of time. As
used herein, the period of time is one academic year as reflected in the annual directories of the American
Association of Law Schools (AALS). Thus, multi-teaching does not necessarily mean that the courses
were taught the exact same semester.
Network – a representation of relationships using nodes and links.
Semantic Network Theory – “The semantic network theory of learning states that our memory is
organized into networks consisting of interlinked nodes. Nodes are basic pieces of information or
individual words. The interlinking of nodes forms knowledge structures or schemas. Learning is the
process of building new knowledge structures by acquiring new nodes. These new nodes are interrelated
with existing nodes and with each other. When learners form links between new and existing knowledge,
the new knowledge is integrated and comprehended” (Hook, 2002, pp. 248-249) citing (Jonassen et al.,
1993).
Spatial Substrate – A defined, numerically consistent, two or three dimensional organizational space for
all items placed on a map. It is the underlying layer that provides a reference system from which to make
visual evaluations of the similarity/dissimilarity of any two items. While any spatial layout allows for
199

nominal or ordinal data inferencing, a rigorous spatial substrate (or spatial reference system) allows for
interval and ratio data inferencing.
Spatialization – the use of spatial or geographic metaphors for non-spatial or non-geographic information
(Fabrikant & Skupin, 2005, p. 668; Slocum, 2005, p. 459).
Syndetic Structure – “Cross-reference links between descriptors or headings in an indexing system”
(Anderson & Pérez-Carballo, 2005) (e.g. ‘related to,’ ‘broader than,’ ‘narrow than,’ ‘use for,’ etc.).
Taxonomy – “division into ordered groups or categories” (Pickett, 2006). Used in this sense,
synonymous with categorization. Synonym of ‘Typology.’ See ‘Categorization Scheme.’
Topic Map – a spatial distribution of subjects in which the association between topics are expressed
using cartographic or network representation elements: the distance-similarity metaphor, links (edges)
(either labeled or not), bounded regions, color coding, symbols, etc.
