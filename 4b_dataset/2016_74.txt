ABSTRACT
This study examines public library districts across the state of Illinois to
determine the extent to which equitable access of library resources is achieved. Three
areas of interest are specifically considered: equity in the resources per capita available in
library districts, demographic characteristics correlated with any inequities, and the
distribution and demographic characteristics of Illinois residents that live in places
outside of a public library district (nonresidents).
Using 2013 data from the Public Libraries in the United States Survey, Illinois
public library district per capita expenditures, professional staff, books, and internetconnected computers were examined across the state statistically and spatially. Wide
variation was found in each of the four per capita variables across the state, with levels of
inequity highest in the staff per capita variable. Library expenditures and professional
staff per capita were positively correlated with library district median household income
and the percent of the population who is Hispanic, while the number of books and
computers per capita were positively correlated with the percent of the population who is
white and percent of the population over 65 years old. Regression models for each of the
library variables explained some of the variation across library districts, with better
explanation for expenditures per capita and staff per capita (r2 = 0.4322 and 0.2671) than
for books per capita and computers per capita (r2 = 0.1015 and 0.0715). Nonresident
library areas have statistically significantly lower household incomes and higher
percentages of the population over 65 years old than areas in library districts. These
results suggest several areas for improving public library equity across the state.

Many thanks to Sunita George, my thesis advisor, for her guidance through this
project, and to my committee members, Christopher Sutton and Jeffrey Hancks, for their
helpful feedback. Thank you also to Raymond Greene for helping me to shape this
research when it was still in its earliest phases.
Special thanks to Mark Shaffer at the Illinois State Library for allowing me to
have access to the Illinois Library Service Areas Interactive Map while it was still in the
beta testing stage; this was most helpful in preparing the library district boundaries for
my analysis. I am also very thankful for the assistance provided from the Illinois Public
Access Bureau in reviewing my Freedom of Information Act request and helping me
obtain the library tax boundary shapefiles needed for my study.
Thank you to my husband, Marcus, for his unwavering support through this entire
journey. He encouraged me to keep going when I became weary, reined me in when I
overthought the small stuff, and occasionally explained the finer points of a statistical
concept to my humanities mind. I could not have done this without him.
Finally, to Him who is my rock and my fortress—thank you for creating these
good works that I might walk in them (Ephesians 2:10).

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
Introduction
Equity of information access is a primary value in American public libraries. The
American Library Association highlights access as one of its major advocacy issues,
asserting that libraries “help ensure that Americans can access the information they
need—regardless of age, education, ethnicity, language, income, physical limitations or
geographic barriers—as the digital world continues to evolve” (American Library
Association 2016a). To what extent does the geographic distribution of resources in
Illinois public libraries approach this ideal of equal information access for all?
This study examines public library districts across the state of Illinois to
determine the extent to which equitable access of library resources is achieved. Three
areas of interest are specifically considered: equity in the resources per capita available in
library districts, demographic characteristics correlated with any inequities, and the
distribution and demographic characteristics of Illinois residents that live in places
outside of a public library district (nonresidents).

Equity of Resources
Library districts have inputs—the resources available to them to provide materials
and services to their communities—and outputs—the materials and services available to
their users. A library district’s inputs vary, but two major inputs are the financial
resources available for operation and the personnel employed by the district to coordinate
1

2

and carry out day-to-day operations. There are a wide variety of outputs that library
districts provide to their users, including materials that can be borrowed, materials that
can be used within a library building, and services such as educational programs. This
study examines two main outputs of public library districts: books available to be
borrowed, and internet-connected computers within library buildings for public use.
The annual expenditures, number of professional staff, number of books, and
number of internet-connected computers per capita in library districts across the state of
Illinois are examined to determine the extent of any inequities in these areas.

Demographic Correlations
If there are inequities identified in library expenditures, staff, books, or
computers, are these inequities randomly distributed across the state of Illinois, or are
they correlated with other factors? Previous studies have suggested lower levels of
library resources nationwide at rural libraries compared to urban libraries (Sin 2011;
Swan, Grimes, and Owens 2013). Others have found correlations between demographic
characteristics of an area and lower levels of information access. Low-income areas
(Neuman and Celano 2001; Sin 2011) and ethnically diverse areas (Alesina, Baqir, and
Easterly 1997) have been found to have lower levels of library funding and staffing.
While few studies have examined correlations between community age and library
resource levels, higher use by families with children (Miller et al. 2013) and higher levels
of library satisfaction by seniors (OCLC 2011) suggest that library districts with higher
numbers of residents below 18 and above 65 may have more community support for the
public library.

3

The data are examined to see whether there are any correlations between the
library district variables (expenditures, staff, books, and computers per capita) and
geographic or demographic characteristics of the library district (urban and rural areas,
income levels, ethnic makeup of the district, and age distributions), and a multiple
regression is performed to determine the extent to which these characteristics influence
inequity in library resources.

Library District Nonresident Areas
Public library districts in Illinois do not cover the entire area of the state. People
who live in the gaps between public library districts do not pay property taxes to support
any library; as “nonresidents,” they must pay a separate nonresident fee to their nearest
public library to gain library privileges.
This study examines the population affected by this state-mandated policy to
determine whether certain geographic areas or demographic groups are
disproportionately affected by nonresident areas. Nonresident populations are compared
to in-district residents and statewide averages demographically to understand the
population affected by this extra barrier to public library access.

Description of the Study Area
In examining the geographic distribution of public libraries across the state of
Illinois, this study seeks to measure equity in the distribution of service areas and equity
in the resources available to residents in the service area. We examine here the
population of Illinois and the characteristics of the public libraries in the state.

4

Illinois
The state of Illinois is located in the Midwestern United States. It is the fifth most
populous state in the country, with an estimated population in 2014 of 12,880,580
(United States Census Bureau 2015). The state is divided into 102 counties (Figure 1).
The Chicago metropolitan statistical area (MSA) accounts for almost two-thirds of the
population, with an estimated population in 2013 of 8,587,206. Other major MSAs in the
state of Illinois include Davenport-Moline-Rock Island, Rockford, Peoria, Springfield,
and St. Louis (Figure 2). About 80 percent of the state population live in Urbanized
Areas (UAs), or areas with 50,000 or more people; 8.5 percent live in Urban Clusters
(UCs), or areas of at least 2,500 but less than 50,000 people; and 11.5 percent live in rural
areas, or any areas outside UAs or UCs (United States Census Bureau 2014).
The race and ethnicity percentages of the population of Illinois are similar to the
percentages for the U.S. population. 62.3 percent of the Illinois population is white, nonHispanic alone, and the two largest ethnic minority populations, Hispanics and African
Americans, account for 16.5 percent and 14.7 percent of the state population respectively
(United States Census Bureau 2015). While these statistics describe the state as a whole,
the ethnic makeup of communities across the state varies. Among communities with a
public library, the African American population ranges from near 0 percent in many
small, rural towns to 99.3 percent in Centreville, Illinois (Figure 3), and the Hispanic
population similarly ranges from near 0 percent in many rural towns to 87.3 percent in
Cicero, Illinois (Figure 4).

9

The median household income in Illinois from 2009 to 2013 was $56,797, slightly
higher than the national median household income of $53,046. 14.1 percent of people in
Illinois were below the national poverty level from 2009 to 2013, compared to 15.4
percent nationally (United States Census Bureau 2015). Again, the median household
income varies across the state; among communities with a public library, the median
household income varies from $16,490 in Cairo, Illinois, to $211,250 in Winnetka,
Illinois (Figure 4).
In 2014, 23.2 percent of the state population was under the age of 18, and 13.9
percent was over the age of 65 (United States Census Bureau 2015). The percent of the
population under 18 in communities with a public library varies from 12 percent in
Urbana, Illinois to 37.5 percent in Dunlap, Illinois (Figure 6), while the percent of the
population over 65 varies from 2.9 percent in Cortland, Illinois to 32.7 percent in
Nauvoo, Illinois (Figure 7).

Public Libraries in Illinois
There are 626 public library districts in the state of Illinois. Public libraries in the
state of Illinois are funded primarily through local tax districts, either through a separate
tax district specifically for library district funding or as a municipal entity funded through
city, village, or township property taxes. 328 public libraries are funded through separate
library tax districts, 255 are funded through local city or village governments, and 43 are
funded through local township governments (Figure 8).
Illinois residents who live outside a library tax district or in a community with no
municipal library are considered library nonresidents. As none of their property taxes go
directly toward a library district or a municipality that funds a library district,

10

nonresidents are required by the Illinois Local Library Act to pay a fee to the nearest
public library to receive library card privileges (75 ILCS 5/4-7).

Statement of the Research Problem
This study examines the extent to which equitable access of library resources is
achieved throughout the state of Illinois. Three subproblems are identified to explore
possible inequities in library access. First, what is the extent of equity in per capita
resources in library districts across the state? Second, for any inequities that are
discovered, to what extent are geographic or demographic characteristics correlated with
those inequities? Third, what are the patterns of non-resident library areas in the state of
Illinois?

Equity of Resources
While public libraries strive toward an ideal of equitable access to information
and services for all, do they achieve this goal? What is the extent of equity in per capita
resources in library districts across the state? The per capita annual expenditures, number
of professional staff, number of books, and number of internet-connected computers
available to the public are determined for each Illinois library district. Descriptive
statistics and a Gini coefficient, a measure of inequity, are calculated for each of the four
variables.
Although libraries seek to provide equitable access to all users, nationwide
examinations of public library resources have found a wide variation in the levels of
funding and resources available to library users (Sin 2011). Sin specifically found higher
levels of variation among libraries in numbers of professional staff per capita. I
hypothesize that there will be inequities found for each of the four variables for Illinois
public libraries, with higher levels of inequity in the number of professional staff per
capita.

16

Demographic Correlations
If inequities are identified in the levels of funding, staffing, and resources per
capita at library districts across the state, to what extent are geographic or demographic
characteristics correlated with those inequities? The data are examined to see whether
there are any correlations between the library district variables (expenditures, staff,
books, and computers per capita) and geographic or demographic characteristics of the
library district (urban and rural areas, income levels, ethnic makeup of the district, and
age distributions), and a multiple regression is performed to determine the extent to
which these characteristics influence inequity in library resources.
Previous studies have shown lower levels of funding, staff, and resources to be
correlated with areas that are rural, lower-income, and more ethnically diverse (Swan,
Grimes, and Owens 2013; Sin 2011; Neuman and Celano 2001; Alesina, Baqir, and
Easterly 1997), and libraries are highly used by children under 18 (Miller et al. 2013) and
highly supported by adults over 65 (OCLC 2011). I therefore hypothesize that levels of
funding, staff, and library resources will be positively correlated with median household
income, percent of the population who is white, percent of the population under 18, and
percent of the population over 65.

Library District Nonresident Areas
The previous subproblems address equity in access for Illinois residents who live
in a public library tax district, but public library districts in Illinois do not cover the entire
area of the state. People who live in the gaps between public library districts do not pay
property taxes to support any library; as “nonresidents,” they must pay a separate

17

nonresident fee to their nearest public library to gain library privileges. What are the
patterns of non-resident library areas in the state of Illinois?
Public library tax district boundaries are used to identify which incorporated
places (IPs) and census designated places (CDPs) in the state have public library
nonresident status. The nonresident population will be then be compared to those IPs and
CDPs that are within library districts, specifically comparing median income; percent of
the population that is white, African American, or Hispanic; and percent of the
population that is under 18 or over 65.
Donnelly (2014) found 80.3 percent of the population of Illinois living in a library
service area and little difference demographically between populations living in and
populations outside of the geographic service areas established for the study. However,
Donnelly’s service areas were based on a travel radius from the library building itself,
rather than on political tax boundaries. Based on initial mapping of the public library
district boundaries in Illinois, the library district nonresident areas in the state appear to
be located more heavily in rural areas of the state rather than urban areas. Therefore I
hypothesize that, similar to Donnelly, a relatively low percentage of the state population
will be found outside public library tax districts. However, unlike Donnelly’s nationwide
study, I expect demographic differences between CDP populations inside and outside of
districts that reflect differences between rural and urban populations; the library district
nonresident areas will likely have a lower median household income, less ethnic
diversity, and a higher percentage of residents age 65 and older.

CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW

Introduction
Public libraries in the United States have traditionally sought equitable access for
all library users, and they continue to do so into the digital age. Library access can be
measured in multiple ways, including examining the levels of resources available at each
library and the resources available to the library itself to provide those services. Certain
socioeconomic groups have been found nationwide to be at a disadvantage in equitable
library access. At the state level, the funding structures of public libraries can cause
barriers to library use for some people.

Equity of Access in American Public Libraries
The idea of equal access to public libraries in the United States has been
important since the profession’s beginnings in the late 1800s. An early benefactor of
many public library buildings in the United States, Andrew Carnegie, contributed large
sums towards building free libraries across the country, in part, because of his belief that
“[t]he best means of benefitting the community is to place within its reach the ladder
upon which the aspiring can rise” (Thomas 1995, 52). As a self-made man himself,
Carnegie saw the benefit of providing all within a community the same resources for
education and advancement.

18

19

The country’s primary library professional organization, the American Library
Association, also advocated early on for equitable access to public libraries across the
country. In one of its early guiding documents, the Library Bill of Rights, the association
asserted that “[a] person’s right to use a library should not be denied or abridged because
of origin, age, background, or views”(American Library Association 2015).
While the formats of information at public libraries have changed over the years
from a print-dominant field to a greater emphasis on online information, the American
Library Association continues to advocate for equitable access to information for all
Americans. As information sources for the general public began in the 1990s to
increasingly move from traditional print materials to online resources, librarians became
concerned about the possibility of a “digital divide”—a divide between those who could
access these online resources and others who could not afford a computer or home
internet access. Public libraries overwhelmingly took on the role of providing public
access to the internet since the 1990s; the percentage of public libraries providing internet
access rose from 20.9 percent in 1994 to 99.7 percent in 2007 (McClure and Jaeger
2009). This service has become important for public access to electronic government
information and services. Libraries not only provide computer and internet access for
those who do not have it, but they also provide assistance with navigating these sources
of information (Jaeger and Bertot 2011). Thus the American Library Association
continues to tout libraries as centers in the community that “help ensure that Americans
can access the information they need—regardless of age, education, ethnicity, language,
income, physical limitations or geographic barriers—as the digital world continues to
evolve” (American Library Association 2016a).

20

Definitions of Equity
While libraries in the United States generally agree on the importance of equitable
access, it is important to consider what is meant by “equitable”. The Oxford English
Dictionary defines equity as “the quality of being equal or fair” (“Equity” 2016). The
American Library Association expands upon this idea of equality and fairness, defining
equity of library access as involving three aspects: all people have the information they
need, regardless of their background; they can obtain information in a variety of formats,
including print and electronic; and they can explore ideas without fear of censorship or
reprisal (American Library Association 2016b). While this study does not address the
third aspect of fear of censorship, it does seek to explore the level of equality in library
resources, regardless of the demographic characteristics of the library district, as well as
whether both print access (books) and electronic access (computers) are equal and fair
across the state. Libraries serving larger populations obviously will have larger
collections and resources, so per capita values are used to compare across districts for
levels of equality.
Addressing whether resources are equal requires comparison among the different
library districts. However, comparison to a standard assists in measuring whether the
resources are fair; a standard provides a measure of whether the resources are adequate
across the board or whether some are substandard while others excel. The Illinois
Library Association has established statewide standards for public libraries in the state
(Illinois Library Association 2014). While not binding upon libraries, these standards
establish a baseline for this study, to which existing staffing and collection levels can be
compared. This document does not include standards for all the variables included in this

21

study, but it does establish a minimum recommended staffing level (total number of fulltime equivalent staff) and a minimum recommended collection level (total number of
book volumes) for library districts, based on population of the district.

Measures of Library Access
Access to libraries has been measured in several ways as researchers seek to
determine whether public libraries are fulfilling the expressed goal of equitable access.
Accessibility of physical library locations is one measure; building locations can be
examined to measure travel distance to the library for specific subsections of the user
population (Park 2012). School and academic libraries commonly measure access to
library information by levels of information literacy, or users’ ability to sort through and
find the specific information for their information need (Association of College &
Research Libraries 1989).
While accessibility of physical locations and users’ ability to sort and access
information are both important aspects of library access, this study uses a third measure
of library access: examining the resources that are available to users at any given library
(Sin 2011). Once a library user is at the local library, how many books, computers, or
other resources does the user have access to at that library in comparison to another?
While many types of materials and services are offered by contemporary public libraries,
this study focuses on two main sources of information libraries provide to the public:
books and internet access.
Books are identified as a primary resource at public libraries, even in the digital
age. Public libraries are still associated first and foremost with books by the general
public in the United States (OCLC 2011, 38). Books are also the most used resource

22

among patrons; 59 percent of library users go to borrow books (OCLC 2011, 35).
Children are especially heavy users of the public library; about 70 percent of children
visit libraries at least annually, 87 percent to borrow books (Miller et al. 2013).
Internet access is also an important resource at public libraries as organizations
and governmental entities increasingly only provide information online, and as other
previously print-based interactions, such as receiving pay statements, filling out job
applications, or applying for unemployment, are also electronic. While internet access is
a standard fixture in many households, 1.1 million households in Illinois have a computer
but no internet access, while 1.4 million households have no computer at all (United
States Census Bureau 2013a). 59.6 percent of Illinois libraries are the only source for
free computer and internet access in their communities (American Library Association
2012), providing an important service to those who have no home access.

Library Inequities and Geographic or Demographic Groups
Previous studies nationwide and in other, smaller areas have found inequities in
the numbers of books and public, internet-connected computers across public libraries, as
well as inequities in the monetary and staffing resources libraries have to provide these
services. These inequities have not appeared to be random, but rather appear correlated
with geographic and demographic groups within the library service areas. In a study of
public libraries nationwide, Sin (2011) found levels of funding, staffing, and print library
materials to be positively correlated with library neighborhood income level. Similarly,
Neuman and Celano (2001) found more books per capita and more highly trained staff in
higher income Philadelphia neighborhood public and school libraries compared to lower
income neighborhoods. Rural libraries nationwide have lower levels of funding, staffing,

23

and print materials, and they generally have less internet-connected computers than their
urban counterparts (Sin 2011; Swan, Grimes, and Owens 2013). Ethnicity of a library
service population may also be correlated to library resource levels; Alesina, Baquir, and
Easterly (1997) found lower levels of librarians, books, and circulation per capita in more
ethnically diverse cities than ethnically homogenous cities, even after controlling for
income and education levels.
While previous studies have not examined possible correlations between levels of
library services and the age makeup of the library’s service area, there are variations in
public library use and satisfaction ratings among age groups, which may, in turn, affect
popular support for library funding in a community. 70 percent of children in the United
States visit libraries at least annually, and parents of children under 18 are more likely
than other adults to visit a library, have a library card, or borrow library books (Miller et
al. 2013). While adults 65 years and older are not as likely as children under 18 to visit
public libraries on a regular basis, 76 percent of this group consider themselves readers,
and they have the highest self-reported satisfaction ratings of public libraries of any age
group (OCLC 2011). Considering the high use and high satisfaction of the under 18 and
over 65 age groups, there is reason to explore whether library districts with higher
percentages of either group have higher levels of support, and therefore, more resources.
While many of the previously mentioned studies have examined correlations
between public library resources and geographic and demographic variables nationwide,
no studies have examined these issues at the smaller, state level within Illinois. This
study seeks to examine whether public libraries in Illinois follow the same patterns of
inequity seen throughout the country.

24

Nonresident Library Access
A study focusing only on Illinois also allows for examination of a library funding
structure specific to the state. Illinois residents who live outside the boundaries of any
public library district, known as nonresident library users, provide a unique challenge for
providing equitable public library access in the state. Before the 1980s, each public
library set their own policies on whether they would issue library cards to nonresidents,
whether they would charge a nonresident fee, and how much that fee would cost. This
resulted in some libraries, especially in suburban areas, seeing very large numbers of
nonresident users applying for cards as a result of nonresidents price shopping for the
lowest fee (Garrison 1962).
In an effort to simplify the process for all parties, the Illinois Legislature included
language in the Illinois Local Library Act (75 ILCS 5) that specifies that the library must
charge a nonresident fee “at least equal to the cost paid by residents of the city,
incorporated town, village or township, with the cost to be determined according to the
formula established by the Illinois State Library” (75 ILCS 5/4-7). The individual also
may not price shop, but is instead required to apply for a card at the library closest to his
or her residence. While these state statutes may have unified the policies across the state,
no studies have been done to examine whether there are pockets of low-income residents
in these nonresident areas that are priced out of library access by the state-required
nonresident fee.
Any findings on nonresident areas in Illinois may also be of interest to other states
where residents live in areas that require a nonresident fee for library access. Among
neighboring states, Wisconsin is the only one where residents outside a library district do

25

not have to pay a separate nonresident fee for library privileges. Instead, state statutes
require each county government to provide funding to libraries within the county that
have loaned materials to those in nonresident areas (Wis. Stat. 43.12). However, Iowa,
Missouri, and Indiana are similar to Illinois in that some areas of the state fall outside of
any library district, and residents living in these areas must pay a nonresident fee to gain
library privileges. Patterns that are discovered in this study regarding nonresident areas
in the state of Illinois may provide insight or prompt further studies in other states.

CHAPTER THREE
SUBPROBLEM ONE: EQUITY OF RESOURCES

Introduction
Public libraries strive toward an ideal of equitable access to information and
services regardless of location or characteristics of the population; this first subproblem
examines the extent to which they achieve this goal. Per capita values for four
variables—annual expenditures, number of professional staff, number of books, and
number of internet-connected computers—were calculated and compared across Illinois
public library districts to examine the levels of equity in the resources available to library
users. I hypothesize that there will be inequities found for each of the four variables for
Illinois public libraries, with higher levels of inequity in the number of professional staff
per capita.

Methods
Data are compiled each year about library districts across the country by the
Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) through the Public Libraries in the
United States Survey and made freely available through the IMLS website. Using 2013
data from the Public Libraries in the United States Survey (Institute of Museum and
Library Services 2013), each library district’s total annual expenditures (TOTOPEXP
variable in the dataset), number of full-time equivalent (FTE) professional staff
(MASTER), number of books (BKVOL), and number of internet computers available to

26

27

the general public (GPTERMS) were divided by the self-reported population of the legal
service area (POPU_LSA) to determine per-capita values for each variable. Descriptive
statistics, including minimum and maximum values, median values, and standard
deviations, were calculated for each variable to explore how resources vary across all the
library districts.
The Gini coefficient, a measure of inequity, was also calculated for each of the
four variables, using the following equation:
∑𝑛𝑖=1(2𝑖 − 𝑛 − 1)𝑥𝑖
𝐺=
𝑛2 𝜇
(Damgaard 2016)
where x is per capita value for each library district, n is the cardinality of the data set, μ is
the mean per capita value for all library districts, and G is the resulting Gini coefficient
for the variable. The Gini coefficient can range from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating perfect
equity across the set and 1 indicating total inequity. The Gini coefficients for each
variable can be used to compare the degree of inequity of one variable to that of another.
Comparing per capita values across library districts measures the variation in the
state; comparing these values to established standards gives a measure of whether these
values are at a professionally accepted level. While standards have not been set for all
four of the variables used in this study, library district data for two of the variables was
compared to statewide standards established by the Illinois Library Association (2014).
Using 2013 data from the Public Libraries in the United States Survey, the total number
of FTE employees (not just professional, degree-holding staff—TOTSTAFF variable in
the dataset) was compared to the minimum recommended total staffing level for Illinois
public libraries (Illinois Library Association 2014, 56), and the total number of book

28

volumes (BKVOL) was compared to the minimum recommended collection level for
Illinois public libraries (Illinois Library Association 2014, 62). As the standards are
population-based, these minimum levels were computed using the self-reported
population of each library district’s service area (POPU_LSA in the Public Libraries in
the United States Survey dataset).

Results
Per capita values for each of the four library variables (expenditures, professional
staff, books, and computers) vary widely across the state (Table 1).

Expenditures Per Capita
Total library expenditures in Illinois public library districts range from a
minimum of $4.96 to a maximum of $2,761.78 per capita. Graphing the per capita values
ordered from smallest to largest reveals two outliers in the data (Figure 9). Two library
districts had expenditures over $2,000 per capita in 2013, while the remaining 623 library
districts spent less than $250 per capita. These two outliers, Bedford Park Public Library
District and McCook Public Library District, differ from other library districts in that
both have very small populations (580 and 228, respectively) but are supported by a very

29

large industrial tax base. Ninety percent of the land area of Bedford Park is industrial
(Village of Bedford Park 2016), and McCook likewise is heavily industrial and is
especially noted for its large quarry (Vasile 2005). This unique tax situation results in
Bedford Park and McCook being outliers in this and other variables throughout this
subproblem.

Excluding the two extreme outliers, there is still a wide variation in expenditures
per capita across library districts (Table 2). While the range of values is smaller when
excluding Bedford Park and McCook from the data, the range of per capita expenditures
is still over $200. Similarly, while the graphed data are more evenly spread when
excluding the two extreme outliers, the data still show a sharp increase in the
expenditures per capita among the highest 100 library districts (Figure 10).

Library expenditures per capita vary geographically as well (Figure 11). Higher
expenditures per capita are noticeable around the Chicago metropolitan area, with higher
values also visible in other metropolitan areas, including Moline and the St. Louis
metropolitan area. Expenditures per capita are generally much lower in rural areas of the
state.
Using the Cluster and Outlier Analysis tool in ArcMap, the Local Moran’s I
indices were determined to identify statistically significant clusters of high and low
values and significant geographical outliers (Figure 12). The Chicago metropolitan area

31

has a large cluster of high expenditures per capita, with several districts on the south and
near west sides of the city appearing as low outliers. Statistically significant clusters of
low expenditures per capita are found exclusively in the southern part of the state,
particularly just east of St. Louis in St. Clair County, as well as in the south central
counties of Perry, Franklin, and Williamson.

Professional Staff Per Capita
The number of full-time equivalent (FTE) professional staff (with an accredited
master’s degree in library science) varies across Illinois library districts from 0 to 15.172
for every 10,000 residents. Despite the fact that Illinois Library Association standards
recommend that each library district strive to have at least one staff member with an
accredited degree (Illinois Library Association 2014, 9), 291 districts out of 625 total, or
46.56 percent, have no employees with such a degree. Graphing the per capita values
from smallest to largest again reveals a sharp increase in the highest one hundred library
districts (Figure 13).

The per capita values for FTE professional staff again show higher values around
the Chicago metropolitan area (Figure 14). There appear to be fewer high values around
other metropolitan areas in the state than with the expenditures per capita, and rural areas
of the state contain many of the districts with no FTE professional staff.

35

Figure 14: FTE professional library staff per 10,000 residents across Illinois

36

Mapping the Local Moran’s I indices (Figure 15), a cluster of high staff per capita
values is again seen in the Chicago metropolitan area, with a handful of low values again
seen on the south and near west sides of the city. Unlike expenditures per capita, there
are no significant clusters of low staff per capita values, but there are several high value
outliers scattered throughout the state.

Comparison to Minimum Staffing Level Standards
While there are no established standards specifically for the number of
professional staff employed by Illinois public library districts, the Illinois Library
Association has established standards for number of total full-time equivalent (FTE) staff
of all levels for public libraries in the state (Illinois Library Association 2014, 56). These
standards use a formula, based on the population of the library district service area, to
establish a minimum number of FTE staff for the district (Table 3). While the Illinois
Library Association also has three higher standards for “Growing”, “Established”, and
“Advanced” library districts, this study only compares actual values to the minimum
level.

Illinois public libraries vary in the degree to which they surpass or fail to meet
these minimum staffing level standards. 254 of the 625 library districts in the state, or
40.64 percent, fall below the minimum standard FTE staffing level for their population
size. Examining the percent difference of actual staffing levels compared to each library
district’s minimum standard, districts vary across the state from -100 percent (100
percent less staff than the minimum standard for the district size) to 3,554.24 percent
(3,554.24 percent higher than the minimum standard for the district size). Again,
graphing the data shows Bedford Park Library District and McCook Library District as
extreme outliers (Figure 16). These two library districts have 3,554.24 percent and
1,131.88 percent higher numbers of FTE library staff than the minimum standard for
population service areas of their size, respectively.

order, there is a sharp increase in the percent difference from the actual FTE staffing level
compared to the minimum standard established by the Illinois Library Association.
Geographically, a number of library districts below the minimum staffing
standard are located outside of St. Louis in the southwestern part of the state, as well as
the southern and far northern suburbs of the Chicago metropolitan area (Figure 18). The
Peoria metropolitan area in central Illinois also has a noticeable group of libraries under
the minimum staffing standard for their size. Examining the Local Moran’s I values for
the percent difference from the minimum staffing standard (Figure 19), four significant
high value clusters are found. The largest is in the Chicago metropolitan area,
particularly in DuPage County and northern Cook County. Smaller clusters are also
found in north central Illinois in Lee and Dekalb Counties, northwestern Illinois in Knox,
Stark, Henry, and Bureau Counties, and central Illinois in De Witt, Macon, and Piatt

41

Counties. Two significant clusters of low values are located east of St. Louis in St. Clair
County and in south central Illinois near Franklin and Williamson Counties.

Books Per Capita
The number of books in Illinois public library districts range from a minimum of
0.099 to a maximum of 135.860 per capita. Graphing the per capita values ordered from
smallest to largest again reveals two outliers in the data (Figure 20). Bedford Park and
McCook Public Library Districts, which were also extreme outliers in expenditures per
capita with their small populations and large industrial tax base, have over 80 books per
capita in their libraries, while all other districts in the state have less than 40 books per
capita.

Books per capita also follow a geographic pattern across the state; however, this
pattern is opposite of the pattern seen in expenditures and professional staff per capita.
Smaller numbers of books per capita are prevalent around the Chicago metropolitan area,
while larger per capita numbers are found in rural areas (Figure 22).

46

Figure 22: Library books per capita across Illinois

47

Looking at the Local Moran’s I indices, the statistically significant clusters of
high books per capita values are not in the Chicago metropolitan area, but rather in
several rural areas in the state (Figure 23). A particularly large cluster of high books per
capita values are in the northwest counties of Knox, Henry, Stark, and Bureau. Other
high value clusters are scattered throughout central and southern Illinois. Low per capita
clusters are located in the Chicago metropolitan area, particularly south and west of
Chicago, and east of St. Louis.

Comparison to Minimum Book Collection Standards
The Illinois Library Association has established standards for the number of book
volumes held by public library districts in the state (Illinois Library Association 2014,
62). As with the FTE staffing level standards, the book volume standards use a formula,
based on the population of the library district service area, to establish a minimum
number of books that should be held by the district (Table 5). Again, while the Illinois
Library Association also has three higher standards for “Growing”, “Established”, and
“Advanced” library districts, this study only compares actual values to the minimum
level.

Library districts vary in the degree to which their book collections surpass or fail

50

115 of the 625 public library districts in Illinois, or 18.4 percent, have book collections
smaller than the minimum standard for their population size. Libraries vary from 89,958
volumes less than the recommended minimum to 3,695,591 more than the recommended
minimum. Examining these differences as a percentage of the library’s minimum
standard, districts range from 97.38 percent fewer volumes than the minimum for their
population size, to 1508.14 percent more volumes than the minimum. Again, graphing
these percentages reveals Bedford Park and McCook library districts as outliers, with
1508.14 percent and 507.71 percent more books than the minimum for their size
populations, respectively (Figure 24).

Geographically, groups of libraries below the minimum standard for book

visible from simply mapping the data, so again the Local Moran’s I indices are calculated
(Figure 27). Significant low clusters of values are, as expected, found east of St. Louis in
St. Clair County, but a significant cluster of low values is also revealed south of Chicago,
in southern Cook and eastern Will and Kankakee Counties. Two main clusters of high
values are located north of Chicago in DuPage and northern Cook Counties, as well as in
northwestern Illinois in Knox and Henry Counties.

Computers Per Capita
The number of internet-connected computers available to the public in Illinois
public library districts range from a minimum of 0 (three districts reported having no
internet connected computers for the public) to a maximum of 13.453 per 1,000 residents.
Graphing the per capita values from smallest to largest again reveals a sharp increase in
the highest one hundred library districts (Figure 28).

The number of internet-connected computers per capita in library districts varies

capita numbers for computers are found around the Chicago metropolitan area, while
rural areas of the state have higher per capita numbers of computers in their library
districts.

Similar to the Local Moran’s I indices for books per capita values, high value
clusters are located in more rural areas of the state (Figure 30). A cluster of high
computer per capita values are again seen in the northwest counties of Knox, Stark, and
Bureau. A larger cluster of high values is also seen across the southernmost counties of
the state. The cluster of low values is smaller here than with books per capita, and a
cluster of low values is only seen in the Chicago metropolitan area. This cluster is mostly
to the west of Chicago, in DuPage, Will and eastern Kane Counties, with not as much
low clustering to the south of the city as with books per capita.

Gini Coefficient—Comparison of Variables
Each of the four library variables varies across the 625 Illinois public library
districts. The Gini coefficient for each variable provides a measure by which to compare
levels of inequity across these variables. Books per capita has the lowest Gini coefficient
at 0.3632, indicating that this variable is the least inequitably distributed of the four
library variables examined. Computers per capita has the next highest Gini coefficient at
0.3911, and expenditures per capita follows at 0.4455. Professional staff per capita has
the highest Gini coefficient at 0.6838, much higher than the other three variables.

Discussion
As hypothesized, the highest level of inequity across Illinois public library
districts is found in the number of professional library staff per capita, as this variable has
the highest Gini coefficient of the four library variables in the study. The degree to
which many public library districts across the state are understaffed, compared to the
standards set by the Illinois Library Association, is surprising. While the standards
recommend that all districts strive to employ at least one staff member with a master’s
degree in library science, 46.56 percent of library districts in the state do not have even a
part time employee with a library degree. Even beyond professional and nonprofessional
distinctions, 40.64 percent of public library districts in Illinois fall below the
recommended total staffing levels for their population size. On the other side, one area of
the state stands out as particularly above the standards in public library staffing.
Statistically significant clusters of high values are apparent in the north and northwest
Chicago suburbs (DuPage and northern Cook counties) for both professional staff per

59

capita and percentage above the total staffing standard (Figures 15 and 19). These areas
also have higher library expenditures per capita (Figure 12), so they are likely able to
afford more staff in general than library districts in lower per capita areas. They also are
likely to have better facilities, salaries, and benefits to attract applicants with master’s
degrees. Further, the place matters; library science graduates may choose to work in
public libraries in this area more often to live in a suburban location, with its housing
options, good school districts, and proximity to other work opportunities for other
household members. Efforts to address inequity in public library staffing across the state
must examine further the reasons why library districts are not employing more staff and
why graduates are choosing to work in districts in some areas of the state over others.
While the north and northwest suburbs of Chicago exhibit high values in staffing
and expenditures per capita, the Chicago metropolitan area is not uniform in its library
resource levels. A division is noticeable between the statistically significant high values
in the area of DuPage and northern Cook Counties and the statistically significant low
values in the near west and southern suburban areas of eastern Will and western and
southern Cook Counties. In contrast with the northern high per capita values in
expenditures and professional staff, the near west and southern suburban areas are the
location for low outliers in these values (Figures 12 and 15). While the northern suburbs
are generally above the minimum staffing levels for their population size, the near west
and southern suburban areas have several library districts below the minimum staffing
level recommended by the Illinois Library Association (Figure 18). The division is also
very apparent in levels of books at library districts; the near west and southern suburbs
have statistically significant low values of books per capita in their libraries (Figure 23),

60

while the north and northwest suburbs have statistically significant high values in the
percent of books above the state standard for their population (Figure 27). These
differences reflect socioeconomic differences in the Chicago metropolitan area; blue
collar and lower-income neighborhoods are more predominant in the near west and south
suburbs, while more affluent neighborhoods are more frequent in the northern suburbs
(Delmelle 2016). While this is a logical observation, in the context of providing
equitable access to information, library districts in less advantaged areas ideally would
have more resources, not less. Those in higher socioeconomic brackets presumably have
access to more information resources at home, school, or other settings; to provide
equitable access to information, libraries should provide at least the same amount of
resources, if not more, to those in lower economic brackets.
Two other clusters of low values are notable in the state across several values. St.
Clair County, east of St. Louis, exhibits significant clusters of low values in expenditures
per capita and books per capita (Figures 12 and 23), and a number of libraries in this
county fall below the recommended minimum standard for number of staff and number
of book volumes for their population size (Figures 18 and 26). Similar to the near west
and south suburbs of Chicago, St. Clair County contains a number of lower-income
suburbs in the St. Louis area; the lower resource levels of these library districts is likely a
reflection of this. In south central Illinois, another low value cluster is located around
Franklin, Perry, and Williamson Counties, with significantly low values in expenditures
per capita and percent difference from the minimum staff and book standards (Figures 12,
19, and 27). These are small rural counties that, again, have lower median household

61

incomes than the state median (about $36,000, $42,000, and $43,000 compared to the
state median of $56,000).
Franklin, Perry, and Williamson Counties provide an interesting contrast to
another group of three rural counties that, in contrast, showed significantly high values
across several variables: Bureau, Henry, and Stark Counties in north central Illinois.
Bureau, Henry, and Stark have significantly high clusters of values for percent above the
minimum staffing standard, number of books per capita, and number of computers per
capita (Figures 19, 23, and 30). Part of the difference between these three counties and
Franklin, Perry, and Williamson in the south may be socioeconomic; Bureau, Henry, and
Stark Counties, while also predominantly rural, have significantly higher median
household incomes (about $49,000, $53,000, and $54,000) than their southern
counterparts. These higher median household incomes are likely due, in part, to the north
central counties’ proximity to larger metropolitan areas. Henry County is included in the
Davenport-Moline-Rock Island metropolitan statistical area, and Stark County is part of
the Peoria metropolitan statistical area (Figure 2). In contrast, Franklin, Perry, and
Williamson Counties are farther away from the major metropolitan areas of the state.
Also, one of the main industries in the southern counties is coal mining, a resource which
experienced a sharp decline in Illinois in the 1990s and even since can be irregular in its
demand and consequent employment benefits to the community (Muir 2006). A more indepth qualitative study of these two sets of counties may be useful in identifying further
characteristics that help or hinder rural public library districts in providing resources to
their communities.

62

The number of computers per capita showed different patterns in high and low
value clustering across the state compared to the other library variables in the study
(Figure 30). While there are again high clusters in the north central counties of Bureau,
Henry and Stark and low clusters in west suburban Chicago, the low cluster near Chicago
is not as concentrated, and a significant high cluster is located in the southernmost
counties of the state, an area that did not display such a high cluster of values for any
other variable. This different pattern of clustering is likely due to a major Opportunity
Online Hardware Grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the Illinois State
Library in 2009 (Illinois Secretary of State 2009). The Opportunity Online Hardware
Grant enabled 128 public libraries in the state to upgrade and purchase new computers
with 25 to 50 percent matching funds from the library district. A multi-year comparison
of computers per capita data, including years before and after the 2009 grant, could
examine the effect of this grant on per capita computer access across the state.
A couple of other interesting high outliers, besides Bedford Park and McCook
Public Library Districts, were discovered in the process of mapping the per capita data.
Franklin Grove Public Library in Lee County and Cordova District Library in Rock
Island County are the only two high value outliers in the state in the expenditures per
capita cluster and outlier analysis (Figure 12). While each only has a reported population
service area of about 1,000 people, Franklin Grove spent $166.69 in expenditures per
capita in 2013, and Cordova spent $274.69 per capita—both well above the median
expenditures per capita statewide of $39.20. The two libraries consequently also both
also have high values for other per capita values, with both ranking highly in computers

63

per capita (Figure 30) and Franklin Grove as part of a high value cluster for books per
capita (Figure 23).
Like Bedford Park and McCook, Franklin Grove and Cordova have unique
funding situations that explain their higher than average per capita resources. Franklin
Grove Public Library reported receiving about $23,000 of their 2013 funding from local
and state government sources, while over $160,000 was reported from “other” sources.
The bulk of this is from a charitable trust established by Winifred Knox (“Winifred H
Knox Charitable Trust” 2016), a local benefactor for whom the Franklin Grove library
building is also named. Five percent of the monthly average of this multi-million-dollar
trust is divided between the Franklin Grove library and another local nonprofit
organization (Franklin Grove Public Library Board of Trustees 2015). Cordova District
Library benefits from a local facility that pays a large amount in taxes to Rock Island
County—the Cordova Exelon nuclear power plant. The Cordova District Library
received $232,500, or 80 percent of their annual budget, in local tax funding from Exelon
plant taxes in the 2013-14 fiscal year (Cordova District Library Board of Trustees 2015).
Further in-depth studies of the source of library district funding, examining not only total
expenditures but also breaking into the smaller categories of local, state, federal, and nongovernment funding, may be useful in the future to identify other similar factors that
affect local public library district resources.

Conclusion
Four library variables – expenditures, professional staff, books, and computers per
capita – were examined across the state to explore levels of equity in the resources
available to Illinois public library users. As hypothesized, there is wide variation in each

64

of the four per capita variables across the state. Notable high clusters of values are found
in the north and northwestern suburbs of Chicago, as well as in the north central counties
of Bureau, Henry, and Stark, while low clusters of values are noticeable in the near west
and south suburbs of Chicago, the eastern suburbs of St. Louis in St. Clair County, and
the south central counties of Franklin, Perry, and Williamson. Levels of inequity are
highest in the professional staff per capita variable, which had the highest Gini coefficient
of the four variables studied (0.6838, compared to 0.3632, 0.3911, and 0.4455). 46.56
percent of library districts in the state have no employee with a master’s degree in library
science, and 40.64 percent of public library districts in Illinois fall below the minimum
recommended total staffing levels for their population size. While the library profession
strives for equity in library service for all, this ideal of equity is not yet seen in the
expenditures, staff, books, and computers per capita across Illinois public libraries.

CHAPTER FOUR
SUBPROBLEM TWO: DEMOGRAPHIC CORRELATIONS

Introduction
In subproblem one, variations were identified in the per capita expenditures,
professional staff, books, and internet-connected computers in public library districts
across the state of Illinois. In this subproblem, the per capita values are compared to
demographic variables to examine the extent to which the variations in library resources
may be connected to geographic or demographic characteristics of the library districts. I
hypothesize that levels of funding, staff, and library resources will be positively
correlated with median household income, percent of the population who is white,
percent of the population under 18, and percent of the population over 65.

Methods
The data were first examined for correlations between variables by calculating the
Pearson’s correlation coefficient for each of the four library variables (per capita annual
expenditures, number of professional staff, number of books, and number of internetconnected computers available to the public) compared to the demographic variables of
the library district (median household income; percent of the population that is white,
African American, and Hispanic; and the percent of the population under the age of 18
and the percent over 65). For those demographic variables that demonstrate a statistically

65

66

significant correlation to the library variables, a multiple regression was then performed
to explore the degree to which the variables influence each other.

Data Preparation
To examine the geographic distribution of public libraries in Illinois and
determine what areas of the state are nonresident areas, the boundaries of the 626 Illinois
library districts were first determined. As many library districts in Illinois are property
tax districts, distinct from other political boundaries such as city or county boundaries,
library tax district boundary information was obtained from the Illinois Department of
Revenue. A Freedom of Information Act request for Illinois library district tax boundary
data was made to the Department of Revenue. While the initial request was denied, an
appeal made through the state’s Public Access Counselor overturned the Department of
Revenue’s denial and provided access to the boundaries as a shapefile.
While approximately half of the state’s public library districts have a separate tax
district, the other half are funded by local government entities, including cities, villages,
and townships. To identify the libraries funded by local governments, the Public
Libraries in the United States Survey data for 2013 was downloaded as a geocoded
shapefile (Institute of Museum and Library Services 2013). The data for each public
library district in this shapefile is associated with a geocoded point, indicating the
location of the main library in the district. Points that lie outside the library tax district
boundaries obtained from the Department of Revenue were marked as locally funded,
and these demarcations were cross-checked using the beta version of a Library Service
Areas Interactive Map, an online map created by the Illinois State Library in conjunction
with other state agencies (Illinois State Library 2015). Once verified, the boundaries for

67

the corresponding governmental entity were added as library service areas using
boundary shapefiles from the United States Census Bureau (United States Census Bureau
2013b). The geocoded points in the Public Libraries in the United States Survey data
were then joined with public library tax district boundaries from the Illinois Department
of Revenue to assign library district variables to each area.
Several library tax districts had no corresponding point in the Public Libraries in
the United States Survey shapefile. These districts were cross-checked in the L2 Member
Libraries directory, a site coordinated by the Illinois State Library presenting basic
information about all public libraries in the state of Illinois (“L2 [Library Learning]
Member Libraries” 2016). Fifteen districts were found to not have their own library
building; rather, they contract with a neighboring library district for their residents to
have library privileges (Table 6). For these fifteen cases, the borders of the tax district
were joined to the district providing those residents with library access.

The boundaries for three public library districts were corrected based on
information from the L2 library directory and individual library websites. The Robert R.
Jones Public Library District boundaries did not include the entire city of Coal Valley in
the original district shapefile from the Department of Revenue, but the library building is
located in Coal Valley, and the district does not report any areas in the vicinity unserved
by a library district (“Robert R. Jones Public Library District - L2 [Library Learning]”
2016). In the original boundary file, Grande Prairie Public Library District only included
the city of Country Club Hills, but the district also serves the village of Hazel Crest
(“Grande Prairie Public Library” 2016). The Carthage Public Library District boundaries
included the rural areas served by the library, but they omitted the city limits of Carthage
itself, where the library building is located (“Carthage Public Library District” 2016).
Four library district boundaries were eliminated from the study. The Flanagan
Public Library District was created in November of 2014 (Barichello 2015); since this
study uses library data from 2013, the village is considered here as a nonresident area.
No library data was available in the Public Libraries in the United States Survey for two
small library districts with tax district boundaries available in the Department of Revenue
shapefile, Albany and Seaton. No further information about either was available through
the L2 library directory, so the boundaries for these two districts were eliminated for this
study. The fourth district boundary eliminated from this study is the Ford Heights Public
Library District. Ford Heights no longer has a library building, and while the district
contracted with neighboring Glenwood-Lynwood Public Library District for a time,
Glenwood-Lynwood ended the contract in 2009 due to late payments (Grimm 2013). As
Ford Heights residents currently have no public library service, regardless of the fact that

69

they live in a library tax district, they are considered in this study as living in a library
district nonresident area.
Once the library district boundaries were cleaned up and matched with the
corresponding library data from the Public Libraries in the United States Survey, the
population characteristics were determined for each district. Ideally, this study would use
demographic variables that include the entire population of each library district, both
urban and rural. However, because library district boundaries vary widely across the
state, with some following city boundaries, some following township boundaries, and
some covering their own unique tax district boundaries, it is difficult to match Illinois
library districts to boundaries used for United States Census data. A sample test for
library districts in McDonough County, Illinois, revealed that census block boundaries
can be matched fairly closely with library district boundaries in the county (Figure 31).
However, median household income, an important variable for this study, is not available
at the block level; the smallest unit at which income data is available is the block group
level. Block groups did not match at all with library district boundaries in the test area of
McDonough County (Figure 32), with many block groups overlapping over multiple
library districts.
Due to the difficulties in finding accurate district-wide matches between library
district boundaries and census reporting areas, for demographic data this study used data
for the incorporated places (IPs) and census designated places (CDPs) within each library
district (boundaries defined by the US Census Bureau inclusively as “places”). While
using IP and CDP data introduces some error, in that rural residents of some library
districts are not included in the demographic data compared to the library variables, place

70

to census block divisions

71

to census block group divisions

72

data provides the best demographic information available with the least amount of
overlap into multiple library districts.
Demographic data for IPs and CDPs in each library district and in library district
nonresident areas were obtained from the 2013 American Community Survey 5-year
estimates from the United States Census Bureau. The percent of the population that is
white, African American, and Hispanic; the percent of the population under the age of 18
and the percent over 65; and the median household income for each IP and CDP were
obtained. Three CDPs, Darmstadt, Floraville, and Rentchler, were eliminated from the
correlation data, as the American Community Survey estimated the population of these
places to be zero in 2013.
While using IP and CDP data provides the least amount of overlap into multiple
library districts, some overlap still occurred in matching places with districts. Applying a
200 foot buffer on the inside of all place boundaries eliminated much of the overlap of
places into multiple districts due to border irregularities in the library tax district
shapefile compared to the US Census place boundary shapefile. For those remaining IPs
and CDPs that still overlapped into multiple library districts or in-district and nonresident
areas, each was visually examined compared to the ESRI World Imagery basemap in
ArcMap. Some areas were cross-checked with information from local library district
websites or municipal zoning maps as well.
If the portion of the IP or CDP that overlapped with another district or a
nonresident area was clearly not residential, such as a large farm field or highway
interchange, the entire population value was assigned to the main district in which the
place was located. For IPs and CDPs that have residential areas in multiple districts, the

73

Tabulate Intersection function in ArcMap was used to determine the proportion of the
entire place area (without the negative buffer zone applied) that lies in each district or
nonresident area, and the corresponding proportion of the population of the place was
assigned to each district, with the assumption that the population characteristics (median
income, age, and race) are the same for each of the place portions.
A number of library districts contained more than one IP or CDP. To determine
one set of population characteristics for each library district in the state, a weighted mean
(by population) was calculated for each variable (median household income; percent of
the population that is white, African American, and Hispanic; and the percent of the
population under the age of 18 and the percent over 65).

Results
Correlation
Correlation coefficients were calculated using data for all library districts (Table
7) and using all data except Bedford Park and McCook Public Library Districts, the two
extreme outliers (small population, exceptionally high industrial tax base) identified in
the first subproblem (Table 8). While many of the coefficients remained very similar,
marked differences are seen in coefficients related to expenditures per capita or books per
capita, the two variables in which Bedford Park and McCook had the most extreme
outlying values (Figures 9 and 20).

public library districts (positive in green, negative in yellow)

74

75

Using data from all districts, expenditures per capita appear to be strongly
positively correlated to books per capita, as the correlation coefficient is 0.695.
However, when excluding Bedford Park and McCook Public Library Districts from the
calculation, the correlation coefficient is -0.023 with a t-statistic of -0.581, which does
not indicate correlation at a statistically significant level (tcrit = 1.964). Using all districts,
the number of staff per capita appears to be the variable most strongly correlated with
median household income, with a correlation coefficient of 0.463. When excluding
Bedford Park and McCook, staff per capita still has a similar correlation coefficient, but
expenditures per capita is more strongly positively correlated with median household
income, with a correlation coefficient of 0.615. The correlation coefficient for staff per
capita and expenditures per capita also increases when excluding these two outliers, from
0.287 to 0.602. Given the large effect Bedford Park and McCook data have on the
expenditures per capita and books per capita values, this study will focus on the
correlation coefficients as calculated when omitting these two outliers.
Staff per capita and expenditures per capita are strongly correlated to each other
(t = 0.602), and books per capita and computers per capita are also strongly correlated
(t = 0.634). However, neither books nor computers per capita are significantly correlated
to staff or expenditures.
Staff and expenditures per capita are positively correlated to median household
income (t = 0.475 and 0.615 respectively) as well as percent of the population who is
Hispanic (t = 0.166 and 0.190). Staff and expenditures per capita are negatively
correlated to the percent of the population who is white (t = -0.140 and -0.150) and
slightly negatively correlated to the percent of the population over 65 years old

76

(t = -0.084 and -0.117). Books and computers per capita show the opposite pattern; they
are positively correlated to the percent of the population who is white and the percent
over 65 years old, and books and computers per capita are negatively correlated to
median household income and the percent of the population who is Hispanic.

Regression
For each of the four library variables, a multiple regression was performed with
three population variables found to be statistically correlated: median household income,
percent of the population who is white, and percent of the population over 65 years old
(Tables 9-12). All of the library variables were also found to be statistically correlated
with the percent of the population who is Hispanic, and books per capita were found to be
statistically correlated with the percent of the population who is black; however, since
these two values are also correlated with the percent of the population who is white, only
one ethnicity variable was included to eliminate any multicollinearity in the regression
model.

The median household income, the percent of the population who is white, and
the percent of the population over 65 years old explain the variation in each of the library
variables to differing degrees. These population variables best account for variation
across library districts in expenditures per capita, with an adjusted r2 of 0.4322. About
one-fourth of the variation in professional staff per capita is explained by the three
population variables (r2 = 0.2671), while the r2 values for the books per capita and
computers per capita regressions were much smaller (r2 = 0.1015 and 0.0715,
respectively). Median household income has the strongest effect of the three variables on
professional staff per capita and expenditures per capita, with standardized coefficients of
0.5326 and 0.6807; the percent of the population who is white has a much lower
influence, with standardized coefficients of -0.2149 and -0.2392; and the percent of the
population over 65 years old has the smallest, yet still statistically significant, influence,
with standardized coefficients of 0.1457 and 0.1661.
Note that the coefficients for percent of the population over 65 are positive in the
regression with professional staff per capita and expenditures per capita, while alone
population over 65 is negatively correlated with these library variables. Since the
population over 65 is correlated with the percent of the population who is white (t =
0.299) and also with the median household income (t = -0.312), this appears to be a case
of suppression (Cohen and Cohen 1983). While the variance inflation factor (VIF) scores
for all three variables are below 2, indicating that multicollinearity is not a significant
influence on the total r2 value, the relationship of the income and white population
variables suppresses the relatively weaker correlation effect of the senior population

79

variable, switching the sign from a slightly negative correlation to a slightly positive
correlation in the regression with staff per capita and expenditures per capita.
Median household income has a negative coefficient for books and computers per
capita. While income again shows the most influence of the three population variables
on computers per capita, the percent of the population who is white has a higher
standardized coefficient for books per capita (t = 0.2212, compared to -0.1407 for median
household income).

Discussion
It was hypothesized that levels of funding, staff, and library resources would be
positively correlated with median household income, percent of the population who is
white, percent of the population under 18, and percent of the population over 65 (Table
13).

Not surprisingly, median household income was positively correlated to library
expenditures per capita and number of professional staff per capita in public library
districts. It is rather surprising, though, that median household income is negatively
correlated with the number of books and internet-connected computers in library districts.
Part of the explanation for this may be that higher-income library districts can afford to
hire more staff and thus have less of their budget available for books and computers, but
as there is no significant correlation between staff per capita and books or computers per
capita, this cannot be a complete explanation. Library districts with higher median
household incomes may pay their staff higher salaries, which could decrease the money
available for books or computers; a future study of the portion of library budgets devoted
to salaries could explore this hypothesis further.
The negative correlation between median household income and books and
computers per capita may also be a further reflection of the urban and rural pattern of per
capita numbers seen in subproblem one; books per capita and computers per capita both
tend to be higher in rural areas compared to metropolitan areas, especially the Chicago

81

metropolitan area (Figures 22 and 29). The fact that the percent of the population who is
white and the percent of the population who is over 65 years old are both positively
correlated with per capita books and computers further supports that this may be a rural
and urban pattern.
The regression models, using the demographic variables of median household
income, percent of the population who is white, and percent of the population who is over
65 years old, explained some of the variation in the library variables across library
districts, but certainly not all of it. Expenditures per capita had the highest adjusted r2
value, at 0.4322, but adding other variables may help to explain expenditures per capita
even more. As the extreme outliers of Bedford Park and McCook Public Library
Districts made very clear, it is important to not only consider the income level of
individual tax payers in the library district, but also the level of the library district’s
industrial tax base. Districts with a larger industrial tax base will have more resources to
work with than those with little industry in their tax boundaries. It may also be beneficial
to separately examine library districts with their own tax district and library districts that
receive their funding from a local municipality. Those library districts receiving tax
funding directly from the tax payers would likely have expenditures per capita more
closely tied to median household income than districts funded by the municipality, where
library funding levels could vary more widely depending on the other needs of the
municipal government.
The demographic variables in the regression models explained very little of the
variation in the books per capita and computers per capita numbers across the library
districts (r2 = 0.1015 and 0.0715, respectively). There may be a number of possible

82

factors contributing to the unexplained variation in these models. Grant awards can
provide communities with sudden increases in library materials; the 2009 Opportunity
Online Hardware Grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation mentioned in
subproblem one is a good example of a sudden opportunity for many public library
districts to increase their number of computers per capita. Public libraries may also
experience variations in local support for the public library mission; some communities
may donate more materials than others to their local libraries or organize “Friends of the
Library” groups that support fundraising efforts. Local library staff approaches to library
service may also affect the levels of books or computers. While some in the library
profession focus on growing and maintaining traditional print book collections, others
have moved more attention and resources toward electronic resources (such as e-books or
subscription databases), library programming (such as speakers or events), or information
production equipment (such as 3D printers or audiovisual software labs). Library staff
across districts may also vary in their approaches to maintaining their print collections,
with some libraries consistently weeding out damaged or outdated books and others
keeping as many volumes on their shelves as possible. Many of these variations in
library support and staffing approaches are difficult to gauge quantitatively; for future
work, a qualitative sampling of library districts across the state would be the most
effective way to explore how these types of variations affect the resources available to
library users.

Conclusion
In this subproblem, the library expenditures, staff, books, and computers per
capita values were compared to library district demographic variables to examine the

83

extent to which the variations in library resources may be connected to geographic or
demographic characteristics of the library districts. While it was hypothesized that levels
of funding, staff, and library resources would all be positively correlated with median
household income, percent of the population who is white, percent of the population
under 18, and percent of the population over 65, the actual correlations were more varied.
The expenditures and professional staff per capita were positively correlated with median
household income and the percent of the population who is Hispanic and negatively
correlated with the percent of the population who is white and percent of the population
over 65 years old. The number of books and computers per capita showed the opposite
pattern; they were negatively correlated with median household income and the percent
of the population who is Hispanic and positively correlated with the percent of the
population who is white and percent of the population over 65 years old. Regression
models for each of the library variables using median household income, percent of the
population who is white, and percent of the population over 65 as independent variables
explained some of the variation across library districts, with better explanation for
expenditures per capita and staff per capita (r2 = 0.4322 and 0.2671) than for books per
capita and computers per capita (r2 = 0.1015 and 0.0715). While median household
income, ethnicity, and percent of the population over 65 years old do demonstrate
significant correlations with the library variables, explaining some of the inequity of
resources discovered in subproblem one, significant portions of the library variation are
still unexplained. Future quantitative studies examining budget details and revenue
sources in more detail may be useful, as well as qualitative studies exploring community
support for the library and library staff priorities for the services provided to their district.

CHAPTER FIVE
SUBPROBLEM THREE: LIBRARY DISTRICT NONRESIDENT AREAS

Introduction
The previous subproblems address equity in access for Illinois residents who live
in a public library tax district, but public library districts in Illinois do not cover the entire
area of the state. People who live in the gaps between public library districts do not pay
property taxes to support any library; as “nonresidents,” they must pay a separate
nonresident fee to their nearest public library to gain library privileges. This subproblem
examines the patterns of nonresident library areas in the state of Illinois. I hypothesize
that a relatively low percentage of the state population will be found outside public
library tax districts but that demographic differences between populations inside and
outside of districts that reflect differences between rural and urban populations; the
library district nonresident areas will likely have a lower median household income, less
ethnic diversity, and a higher percentage of residents age 65 and older.

Methods
Incorporated place (IP) and census designated place (CDP) boundaries were again
used, as in subproblem two, to compile the demographic data for people living in library
districts and outside of library districts (please refer to Chapter Four for a fuller
discussion of how US Census “place” boundaries provide the best match for public
library district boundaries). Public library district boundaries were used to identify what

84

85

IPs and CDPs of Illinois fall within public library districts and which ones fall outside
library districts, thus having public library nonresident status. Those IPs and CDPs
including both in-district and nonresident area within their borders were visually
examined compared to the ESRI World Imagery basemap in ArcMap. If the portion of
the IP or CDP that overlapped with the library district or nonresident area was clearly not
residential, such as a large farm field or highway interchange, the entire population value
was assigned to the main area (in-district or nonresident) in which the place was located.
939 IPs and CDPs were identified as in library districts, and 422 were identified as
outside any library district. Four IPs and CDPs were identified as having part of their
residential area within a library district and part in a nonresident area: Burr Ridge,
Goodfield, Inverness, and Knollwood. For these four, the Tabulate Intersection function
in ArcMap was used to determine the proportion of the entire place area that lies in each
district or nonresident area, and the corresponding proportion of the population of the
place was assigned to each in-district and nonresident category, with the assumption that
the population characteristics (median income, age, and race) are the same for each of the
place portions.
The statewide in-district and nonresident populations were compared to each
other using a two-sample difference in means test, comparing median income; percent of
the population that is white, African American, or Hispanic; and percent of the
population that is under 18 or over 65. This two-sample difference in means test was
used to determine any significant difference in the demographic variables between those
living in library district places and those living in nonresident places. The in-district and
nonresident populations were also each compared to the mean of all IPs and CDPs

86

statewide using a one-sample z-test of the mean to demonstrate whether in-district or
nonresident places are significantly different from the statewide averages.

Results
Population
943 whole or partial IPs and CDPs in Illinois are located within public library
districts (Figure 33), accounting for 10,967,000 residents, or 85.36 percent of the state
population. The population of in-district IPs and CDPs ranges from 19 to 2,706,101, with
a mean population of 11,630 and a median population of 2,178.
426 whole or partial IPs and CDPs in Illinois fall outside of any public library
district and thus have nonresident public library status (Figure 34). 323,798 people, or
2.52 percent of the Illinois population, live in these nonresident IPs and CDPs. The
population of these nonresident places ranges from 2 to 13,787, with a mean population
of 760 and a median population of 374.
The mean populations of in-district and nonresident IPs and CDPs are
significantly different, at a confidence level of over 95 percent when conducting a twosample difference in means test (Table 15).

The mean population of all Illinois IPs and CDPs is 8,247. Comparing this to the
in-district and nonresident population means via a one-sample z-test of the mean, the indistrict mean population is not found to be significantly different from the statewide
mean at a 95 percent confidence level (z = 1.1600, zcrit = 1.9625). However, the
nonresident IP and CDP population mean is found to be significantly lower than the
statewide IP and CDP population mean (z = -110.1011), with a confidence level well
over 99 percent (zcrit = 2.5875).

Median Household Income
The average median household income for Illinois IPs and CDPs in public library
districts is $55,479.38, while the average median household income for IPs and CDPs in
nonresident library areas is $47,738.15. These two are found to be significantly different
via a two-sample difference in means test (Table 16), at a confidence level of over 95
percent.

The average median household income for all IPs and CDPs in Illinois is
$52,907.94. This statewide average is compared to the in-district and nonresident
averages using a one-sample z-test of the mean. The in-district z-score is 3.199,

90

indicating that the in-district median household income is statistically significantly higher
than the statewide average; and the nonresident z-score is -5.185, indicating that the
nonresident median household income is statistically significantly lower than the
statewide average.

Race and Ethnicity
In IPs and CDPs located in library districts, the mean percent of the population
who is white is lower than nonresident places (88.6165 percent compared to 94.6704
percent), while the black and Hispanic populations are higher in IPs and CDPs that are indistrict (5.7195 percent to 2.5946 percent in nonresident places, and 6.7453 percent to
2.5845 percent in nonresident places, respectively). All of these differences are found to
be statistically significant through a two-sample difference in means test (Table 17), at a
confidence level of over 95 percent.

For all IPs and CDPs in Illinois, the average population is 90.5095 percent white,
4.7549 percent black, and 5.4503 percent Hispanic. Through one-sample z-tests of the
mean, the nonresident population is found to have a significantly higher percentage of the
population who is white (z = 6.9795) and a significantly lower percentage of black and
Hispanic residents (z = -4.0286 and z = -11.7972 respectively). The in-district population
has a significantly lower percentage of the population who is white (z = -3.2827) and a
significantly higher percentage of Hispanic residents (z = 3.6094). The difference
between the in-district black population and the statewide black population is not
statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence level (z = 1.9015).

Age Groups
In-district IPs and CDPs in the state of Illinois have an average of 23.9151 percent
of the population under 18 years old, while 23.2582 percent of those in nonresident IPs
and CDPs are under age 18 (Table 18). This is not a statistically significant difference at
the 95 percent confidence level (z = -1.6327). However, the percent of the population
over 65 years old is significantly different between the in-district and nonresident
populations, with 15.3405 percent in library districts and 16.7662 percent in nonresident
areas (z = -3.1454).

For all Illinois IPs and CDPs, the average percent of the population under the age
of 18 is 23.7135 percent. This is not significantly different from the in-district
population under 18 (z = 1.1234) or the nonresident population under 18 (z = -1.2644).
However, there is a significant difference in the percent of the population over 65 years
old. For all Illinois IPs and CDPs, the average percent of the population over 65 is
15.7815; the in-district percentage is significantly lower (z = -2.3150) and the nonresident
percentage is significantly higher (z = 2.3942).

Discussion
It was hypothesized that a relatively low percentage of the state population would
be found outside public library tax districts but that demographic differences between
populations inside and outside of districts that reflect differences between rural and urban
populations; the library district nonresident areas would have a lower median household
income, less ethnic diversity, and a higher percentage of residents age 65 and older.
These hypotheses are supported by the data results. Only 2.52 percent of the entire state
population was found to live in nonresident library IPs and CDPs, while 85.36 percent of

93

the population lives in IPs and CDPs within a public library district. Nonresident IPs and
CDPs have a lower median household income and lower percent of the population who is
black or Hispanic, and a higher percent of the population who is white or over 65 years
old, compared to in-district and statewide IP and CDP means.
It is important to note that these results are limited to the populations living within
the borders of incorporated places and census designated places. While these results
found only 2.52 percent of the population living in nonresident areas of the state, 12.12
percent of the population of Illinois (or 1,557,756 people) live outside the boundaries of
any IP or CDP. Many public library districts in Illinois cover some rural area in their
boundaries, so it is likely that some of these residents would live within in-district areas.
However, it is also likely that another portion of this population lives outside of any
library district and would add to the percentage of the population in nonresident library
areas. Future studies could interpolate population data more thoroughly in the rural areas
of the state to establish more precise estimates of Illinois residents who live in library
districts and in nonresident library areas. Even without considering these rural residents,
however, it is interesting to note that the demographics of the nonresident IPs and CDPs
are still reflective of what would be expected in rural areas of the state. Expanding the
study to more thoroughly include rural residents would likely only increase this
observation in the data.
The lower median household income in nonresident library areas compared to indistrict IPs and CDPs is expected, but it is concerning in terms of equitable access to
library resources. Those who live in nonresident library areas already must overcome a
distance barrier to travel to their nearest library district in order to use the resources; the

94

additional nonresident library fee that is charged for library privileges may prove to be
too much more of a barrier for those living in lower-income areas. This is especially true
in that library districts are required by state law to charge a nonresident fee at least equal
to what its own residents pay in library district taxes (75 ILCS 5/4-7); nonresident fees
may therefore be based on a higher tax base and income level than the income level of
those paying the fee.
The higher percentage of residents 65 years and older in nonresident library areas
compared to in-district areas is also concerning in terms of equitable access to library
resources. Travel to the closest library district can be even more of a barrier to library
access for seniors compared to other age groups. While an estimated 78 percent of adults
over 70 years old are licensed drivers, they drive on average 45 percent less miles than
drivers ages 35 to 54 (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 2015). As older drivers
notice changes in their driving abilities, they have been found to change their driving
habits accordingly. For example, seniors with reduced visual contrast sensitivity, as
experienced with cataracts, drive less miles and make less trips each week compared to
other seniors (Sandlin, McGwin, and Owsley 2014). Also, slower reaction times in
divided attention tests have been found to be significant predictors of seniors deciding to
no longer drive at all (Edwards et al. 2010). As seniors drive less or rely instead on
family or public transportation for getting around, only essential trips will be made.
Doctor appointments, paying bills, and getting groceries will have higher priority than
trips for leisure to the local library or bookstore. If seniors overcome the travel barrier to
their nearest library district, the extra nonresident fee for library privileges may prove to
be too much for those seniors on fixed incomes.

Conclusion
This subproblem examined the patterns of nonresident library areas in the state of
Illinois, comparing the populations of incorporated places (IPs) and census designated
places (CNPs) within library district boundaries to those outside of district boundaries.
As hypothesized, a relatively small percentage of the state population lives in nonresident
IPs and CDPs (2.52 percent) compared to those living within library districts (85.36
percent). Also as expected, nonresident IPs and CDPs have a lower median household
income and lower percent of the population who is black or Hispanic, and a higher
percent of the population who is white or over 65 years old, compared to in-district and
statewide IP and CDP means. The fact that nonresident library areas have statistically
significantly lower household incomes and higher percentages of the population over 65
years old are of particular importance in discussions of equity of library access, as the
required nonresident fees for library privileges may be more of a barrier to access to these
groups than for others.

CHAPTER SIX
CONCLUSIONS

This study examines the extent to which equitable access of library resources is
achieved throughout the state of Illinois. Three subproblems were identified to explore
possible inequities in library access. First, what is the extent of equity in per capita
resources in library districts across the state? Second, for any inequities that are
discovered, to what extent are geographic or demographic characteristics correlated with
those inequities? Third, what are the patterns of non-resident library areas in the state of
Illinois?
To first explore the extent of equity in the resources available to Illinois public
library users, four library variables – expenditures, professional staff, books, and
computers per capita – were examined across the state. As hypothesized, there is wide
variation in each of the four per capita variables across the state. Notable high clusters of
values are found in the north and northwestern suburbs of Chicago, as well as in the north
central counties of Bureau, Henry, and Stark, while low clusters of values are noticeable
in the near west and south suburbs of Chicago, the eastern suburbs of St. Louis in St.
Clair County, and the south central counties of Franklin, Perry, and Williamson. Levels
of inequity are highest in the professional staff per capita variable, which had the highest
Gini coefficient of the four variables studied (0.6838, compared to 0.3632, 0.3911, and
0.4455). 46.56 percent of library districts in the state have no employee with a master’s

96

97

degree in library science, and 40.64 percent of public library districts in Illinois fall below
the minimum recommended total staffing levels for their population size.
Once variations in per capita values were identified, the library expenditures,
staff, books, and computers per capita values were compared to library district
demographic variables to examine the extent to which these variations in library
resources may be connected to geographic or demographic characteristics of the library
districts. While it was hypothesized that levels of funding, staff, and library resources
would all be positively correlated with median household income, percent of the
population who is white, percent of the population under 18, and percent of the
population over 65, the actual correlations were more varied. The expenditures and
professional staff per capita were positively correlated with median household income
and the percent of the population who is Hispanic and negatively correlated with the
percent of the population who is white and percent of the population over 65 years old.
The number of books and computers per capita showed the opposite pattern; they were
negatively correlated with median household income and the percent of the population
who is Hispanic and positively correlated with the percent of the population who is white
and percent of the population over 65 years old. Regression models for each of the
library variables using median household income, percent of the population who is white,
and percent of the population over 65 as independent variables explained some of the
variation across library districts, with better explanation for expenditures per capita and
staff per capita (r2 = 0.4322 and 0.2671) than for books per capita and computers per
capita (r2 = 0.1015 and 0.0715). While median household income, ethnicity, and percent
of the population over 65 years old do demonstrate significant correlations with the

98

library variables, explaining some of the inequity of resources discovered in subproblem
one, significant portions of the library variation are still unexplained by this simple
model, suggesting area for further research.
The patterns of nonresident library areas in the state of Illinois were then
examined, comparing the populations of incorporated places (IPs) and census designated
places (CNPs) within library district boundaries to those outside of district boundaries.
As hypothesized, a relatively small percentage of the state population lives in nonresident
IPs and CDPs (2.52 percent) compared to those living within library districts (85.36
percent). Also as expected, nonresident IPs and CDPs have a lower median household
income and lower percent of the population who is black or Hispanic, and a higher
percent of the population who is white or over 65 years old, compared to in-district and
statewide IP and CDP means. The fact that nonresident library areas have statistically
significantly lower household incomes and higher percentages of the population over 65
years old are of particular importance in discussions of equity of library access, as the
required nonresident fees for library privileges may be more of a barrier to access to these
groups than for others.
A number of directions for future research based on these findings are possible.
Several areas were identified as locations of particularly high or low per capita library
values in Chapter Three. A more in-depth study of the high per capita value library
districts and areas of the state may provide valuable information as to what factors
contribute toward successful public library districts, and study of the low per capita value
districts could identify ways in which specific areas of the state could be best supported.
To further explore factors influencing variation across the state in library resources, a

99

more detailed quantitative study of library funding and expenditures may be helpful,
considering differences between separate library tax districts and municipally funded
libraries, levels of industry contributing toward the library tax base, and expenditures
allocated toward various categories, including salaries, traditional print materials, and
newer electronic information sources. Interpolation of demographic data across the state
would allow future research to address the public library access of rural Illinois residents,
as this study was limited to those residents living in incorporated places or census
designated places. It is also important to recognize that while the current study provides
a quantitative view of the resources available to public library users across the state, it
does not address the quality of those resources. Per capita numbers do not capture
whether the library computers are up-to-date, how friendly and innovative the library
staff are, whether library expenditures are used wisely, or if the book collection is
appropriate for the community’s information needs. Qualitative studies of public
libraries would be needed to assess these other factors that affect library resources and
information access.
Several areas of inequity in library resources and access are identified in this
study. It is hoped that these results are not a discouragement to stakeholders in public
libraries, but rather a map toward specific areas in which to focus energies in improving
Illinois libraries. Whether in directing future research, library grants, or regional
assistance, it is expected that the results of this study can assist those who, like library
professionals, strive toward an ideal of equitable access to information for all in this state.
