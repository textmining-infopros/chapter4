ABSTRACT
Human motivation is a widely debated construct in psychology and many
disciplines in social science as well as education and health sciences have adopted
various psychological theories in an effort to understand motivational forces behind
many human activities from dieting (e.g., Schelling, Munsch and Margraf, 2011),
psychotherapy (e.g., Martens, 2010) and academic achievement (e.g., Artino, Holmboe
and Durning, 2012) to political participation (e.g., Hersh, 2012). Case (2012) devotes an
entire chapter in his seminal text on information behavior to an overview of what he
calls a “motivational puzzle” tying it to information need as the predominantly discussed
dimension of motivation in information science literature.
Similarly to information science, where the subjectivist tradition researchers
such as Dervin recognized goal achievement only partially accounts for information
need as a motivational force in the information seeking process, recent psychological
motivational theories moved toward differentiating between goals and increasingly
focus on their behavioral and affective consequences (Deci and Ryan, 2000). By
examining goal content and the regulatory processes through which goals are pursued,
self-determination theory (SDT) used in the current study accounts for a spectrum of
motivational force

v

Consistent with the subjectivist orientation in information science which aims to
account for cognitive and affective forces behind information need, SDT recognizes the
role of psychological development and well-being in goal attainment. Using structural
equation modeling, the current study examines information seeking motivation in
undergraduate students and its relationship with basic human needs satisfaction, as
defined in SDT literature, as well as its effect on information seeking effort and
enjoyment.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND:
Human motivation is a widely debated construct in psychology. Social sciences
as well as education and health sciences have adopted numerous psychological theories
in an effort to understand motivational forces behind many human activities from
dieting (e.g., Schelling, Munsch and Margraf, 2011), psychotherapy (e.g., Martens,
2010), academic achievement (e.g., Artino, Holmboe and Durning, 2012) to political
participation (e.g., Hersh, 2012). Given the ongoing struggle to define information,
undeniably the most central concept in the information sciences, it is hardly surprising
information seeking motivation has received relatively little attention. Case (2012)
devotes a chapter in his seminal text on information behavior to an overview of what he
terms a “motivational puzzle” tying it to information need as the predominantly
discussed dimension of motivation in information science literature. Although they
often disagree about the nature of those needs and the term itself (Savolainen, 2011),
Robert Taylor, Nicholas Belkin, Carol Kuhlthau and Brenda Dervin are considered the
most cited authors in information needs literature

1

Robert Taylor is widely known for his question negotiation framework focusing
on communication between information seekers (i.e. library users) and information
professionals (i.e. librarians, knowledge brokers). Through this framework, Taylor was
the first to discuss the discrepancy between visceral and expressed information needs
as a function of communication (Taylor, 1968).
Belkin (1980) adopted the visceral need concept including it in his information
seeking framework he termed “anomalous state of knowledge” (ASK). According to
Belkin, the primary motivator for research is the uncertainty or anomaly accompanying
research. When information seekers perceive their knowledge to be deficient or
incomplete they will initiate the process which will continue until the appropriate
information is found or the seeker abandons search. Kuhlthau (1991) retains the
concept of uncertainty as the primary motivator for research but also focuses on affect
accompanying each stage of the research process. Finally, Dervin (1998) acknowledges
humans are inherently curious and defines information need as a continuous search for
meaning.
The evolution of concept of motivation in psychology mirrors that of information
need in information sciences. Similarly to information sciences, where the subjectivist
tradition researchers such as Dervin recognized goal achievement only partially
accounts for information need as a motivational force in the information seeking
process, recent psychological motivational theories moved toward differentiating
between goals and increasingly focus on their behavioral and affective consequences

2

(Deci and Ryan, 2000). By examining goal content and the regulatory processes through
which goals are pursued, self-determination theory (SDT), used in research design of the
current study, accounts for a spectrum of motivational forces. Consistent with the
subjectivist orientation in information sciences which aims to account for cognitive and
affective forces behind information need, SDT recognizes the role of psychological
development and well-being in goal attainment.
Information seeking motivation in information science has most frequently been
discussed in connection with information need, uncertainty, gap and anomalous state of
knowledge (Savolainen, 2011). Among those, information need emerges as the most
enduring. Fidel (2006) indicates that the decades of conceptualizations of information
need failed to significantly impact empirical research because of its focus on its
situational aspects. She writes:
“Whether an information need is defined as an incomplete cognitive state or as a
trigger for a search, it delineates an individual situational state under local
conditions. Using these approaches, information need researchers may be able
to uncover the needs that the people they studied had at the time they studied
them, but no information needs common to members of a community of actors.
(Fidell p. 94)”
Indeed, most current research concerning information need focuses on task based
information needs, where need is typically understood as a need for a specific kind of
information from specific sources. It is hardly surprising the central question in human
information behavior studies (i.e., why do people search for information?) remains
unanswered beyond the situation level even though reviews of literature dating back to
1980’s indicate researchers were aware of this gap in literature (Wilson, 1981). In order
3

to begin to address this question, research in information behavior needs to embrace
the growing body of research in psychology on underlying psychological needs that
motivate behavior.
Current research in psychology clearly demonstrates motivation is a complex,
multidimensional construct where extrinsic (i.e., external) and intrinsic (i.e., internal)
motivations exist on a continuum (Vallerand et al., 1992). Furthermore, these
motivations are hierarchical and operate on a global (personality), contextual (domain)
and situation (state) levels (Vallerand, 1997). However, current research on information
seeking motivation has largely focused on studies at the situation level resulting in lack
of studies at the global and domain levels.
Similarly, current research in information sciences largely disregards information
seeking amotivation. Researchers acknowledge people actively avoid information to
increase uncertainty or cope with information overload (e.g., Manheim, 2014).
Additionally, researchers address human inclination to seek risk information (i.e.,
information that is perceived threatening because it challenges one’s world view, or
points to unpleasant outcomes) (e.g., Kahlor, 2010; Griffin, et al., 2004). However,
amotivation is characterized by lack of action accompanied by feelings of incompetence
and lack of control (Deci & Ryan, 1985) and its role in information seeking process
remains unexplored.
Zipf’s (1949) principle of least effort (PLE), indicating humans will invest the
least amount of effort in order to obtain a desirable result, is arguably the most
4

influential theory addressing effort in information behavior research. However, PLE
applies to all humans regardless of their motivational orientation and as such fails to
differentiate between their internal and external motivational orientations. This is an
important distinction since research in educational settings repeatedly demonstrates
internally motivated students expend more effort and persist in an activity for longer
periods of time than externally motivated students (e.g., Ryan & Connell, 1989; Connell
& Wellborn, 1991). Focused on specific tasks, PLE also fails to account for information
seeking effort at global and domain levels.
Additionally, most influential models of information seeking behavior ignore or
only indirectly address effort as part of the information seeking process. Even when
information seeking effort is implicit in the model, it functions at a situational level or
else receives little to no empirical testing. For example, in his model of information
seeking, Krikelas’ (1983) addresses information source preference in connection with
information seeking effort. Specifically, echoing PLE, he hypothesizes information
seekers will prefer convenient (i.e., easy to contact or locate) as opposed to accurate
sources of information. Consequently, links between intrinsic and extrinsic
motivational orientations in terms of information seeking motivation and effort remain
unexplored.
Similarly, although Nahl (2007) points out affective information use is conative
and motivational while planning purposeful tasks, research on information seeking
motivational orientations and enjoyment are largely absent in current information

5

behavior literature. Indeed, only few information seeking models consider emotions
during information seeking process. Kuhlthau’s (1993), information seeking process
model provides, perhaps, the earliest and most detailed account of affective dimension
of human information seeking from the initial stages to the presentation stage and
beyond to assessment. However, her focus is on information seeking process initiated
as a result of perceived gap in knowledge and as such is not intended to differentiate
between students driven by curiosity and thirst for knowledge (i.e., internally
motivated) and those focused on external rewards and punishments (i.e., externally
motivated) students.
Hints of link between enjoyment and information seeking motivation appear in
Parker and Berryman (2007) study on postgraduate student thoughts and feelings once
they have found enough information on a task. Affective elements of their
“understanding and engagement” category of enough, as described in the study, seem
to mirror intrinsic information seeking motivation as defined by SDT. Passion for
research and flow appear to be intrinsic drivers of information seeking motivation but
the study concerns an assessed research task and is, therefore, conducted at a
situational level.
Finally, previous research in psychology on research motivational orientations at
the contextual level focuses on graduate students and faculty researchers (Deemer,
Mahoney & Ball, 2012). It is widely accepted, intrinsic academic motivation in certain
academic areas decreases with age (Gottfried, Fleming & Gottfried, 2001) and distinct

6

information seeking motivational scales and measurements are needed to accurately
capture undergraduate students’ motivational orientations.
1.2 RESEARCH PROBLEM
The purpose of the current study is threefold. First, in order to measure the
extent to which undergraduate students are amotivated or extrinsically versus
intrinsically motivated to seek information, the academic motivation scale (Vallerand,
1992) will be adapted and validated in information seeking context. Second, the study
will examine how basic human needs, as defined by SDT, affect students’ information
seeking motivational orientation. Finally, the relationship between students’
autonomous information seeking motivation and the amount of effort invested and
enjoyment derived from the activity will be examined.
1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
The first goal of the current study is to examine undergraduate students’ entire
motivational spectrum from amotivation to intrinsic motivation as hypothesized by selfdetermination theory. The second goal is to confirm the hypothesized relationship
between basic psychological need satisfaction and autonomous (i.e., self-determined)
motivation. The third goal is to examine the effect autonomous motivation has on
undergraduate students’ information seeking effort and enjoyment while researching in
their chosen field of study.

7

1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1. What is the nature of information seeking motivation of undergraduate
students at the contextual level?
2. What is the relationship between relevant basic psychological needs as
defined by SDT (i.e., perceived competence and autonomy support) and
intrinsic motivation?
3. What is the relationship between autonomous motivation and effort
invested in information seeking?
4. What is the relationship between autonomous motivation and enjoyment
experienced during information seeking?
The first question aims to validate SDT theory in the context of information
seeking at the domain (contextual) level. The second question examines the
consequences of basic psychological need thwarting or fulfillment relevant to the
context of the study. The third and fourth questions examine the consequences of
internal motivational information seeking orientation.
1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
Understanding situational information seeking needs in students is important.
Findings can inform systems’ interface design and librarians’ strategies to aid students in
searching for a specific task. However, situational motivation is contingent on
contextual or domain motivational orientation which is in turn contingent on global or
personality motivational orientation (Vallerand, 1997). Therefore, understanding
8

information seeking motivational orientation at the domain level is necessary in order to
fully appreciate students’ more mercurial information need at the situational level.
Through application of SDT to information seeking motivation, subjectivist
information seeking motivational perspective will be validated by providing empirical
evidence for motivational antecedents beyond mere goal attainment. Understanding
the interplay of students’ basic need satisfaction (i.e., autonomy support, relatedness
and competence) with their motivational orientation to seek information will also
provide valuable insights that would pave way for further research. For instance,
current research demonstrates students prefer to receive their information from their
peers (Gross & Latham, 2009). If basic needs satisfaction relationship with information
seeking motivation is understood, research could also address the role complex social
interactions play in students’ motivation to seek information from their peers.
SDT posits internally motivated individuals experience joy and exhibit more
persistence while engaged in pursuit of intrinsic goals. In contrast, individuals who feel
controlled experience pressure and stress and are far less likely to continue with their
efforts (Deci and Ryan, 2000). Evidence supporting these hypotheses in information
seeking context would enable librarians and teaching faculty to plan interventions
promoting healthy life-long learning habits in students.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 INFORMATION NEEDS IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE (LIS) LITERATURE
LIS Researchers widely acknowledge information seeking motivation is
inextricably tied to information needs. Yet, most agree this relationship remains
unexplored (Naumer and Fisher, 2010; Case 2012). The difficulty stems, in part, from
researchers’ inability to agree on a definition of the nature of information needs. In
response to Ikoja-Odongo & Mostert’s definition of information need as a “requirement
that drives people into information seeking” (as cited in Case, 2012), Case observes the
circular nature of this definition is symptomatic of a larger issue. Specifically, few
researchers deeply question the nature of “information needs” relying instead on
research conducted by Robert Taylor, Nicholas Belkin, Carol Kuhlthau and Brenda
Dervin. Fidel (2012) echoes this conclusion pointing out the difficulty in defining
information need, in part, stems from its origins in three distinct theoretical traditions
Tuominen, Talja and Savolainen (2002) identify as: information transfer, the
constructivist, and constructionist traditions.
Information transfer parallels Ellis’ physical (i.e., system oriented) paradigm and
is firmly rooted in the Shannon and Weaver’s information theory. Information itself is
seen as “an abstract, disembodied entity originally existing in the mind of the sender of
10

the message” (Tuominen, Talja and Savolainen 2002). The message is understood as an
objective representation of reality that can be transferred to the receiver who is a
passive recipient. The information as a concept would then reflect the positivist view of
information as a “real entity that exists without human interaction with it” and
information need as a “reality that exists in the actor’s mind” (Fidel, 2012).
Constructivist view represents the shift toward the user center paradigm in LIS.
Taylor, Kuhlthau, Dervin, and Belkin all point out users are not merely passive recipients
of information because they actively engage in interpreting and assigning meaning to
the message. Reflective of cognitive perspective, information is seen as an artifact of
individual’s thinking and memory processes that are reflected in the affect of that
individual and influenced by society and culture. Taylor’s model is one of the earliest
examples of this tradition. His “visceral need” reflects the cognitive perspective by
acknowledging meaning is constructed within user’s mind and the resulting expressed
“compromised need” represents the portion that can be understood by the receiver
(i.e., librarian or a search engine). Currently, researchers recognize that, although
Taylor’s, Belkin’s, Kuhlthau’s and Dervin’s conception of information need accounts for
larger context outside the individual, it is not truly external in the sense that it
disregards the conditions that motivate information seeking beyond information
uncertainty (Naumer & Fisher, 2010).
Constructionism represents a reaction to constructivist focus on individuals.
Language is considered a social construction that is used to communicate ideas and has
little meaning beyond the social context. Motives are, then, “context dependent
11

discursive constructions” (Tuominen, Talja and Savolainen, 2002) existing only when
expressed. Although, the debate continues, the notion of language as an almost
entirely social construction as outlined in Vygotsky is currently considered outdated in
linguistics. Chomsky’s Universal Grammar where, in addition to input, language
acquisition is contingent on innate, biological grammatical categories (Chomsky, 1965) is
generally considered more current with plenty of evidence suggesting children need
more than imitation to learn language (e.g., Yang, 2004). However, given the contextual
nature of knowledge, constructionist argument that relevance and information need are
also heavily dependent on context might be helpful as a framing device as it encourages
investigation of information seeking within a specific discourse, theoretical framework
or paradigm (Hjørland, 2002).
In addition to differing theoretical traditions, LIS researchers are also engaged in
an ongoing debate about differentiation between information need, want and demand.
In one of the earliest attempts to define information needs, Line (1974) describes
information needs as that which one “ought to have” for research or recreational
purposes, versus a want which he defines as what users would like to have. Demands
are defined as “what an individual asks for”, use as “what one actually uses, and
requirement as a catchall category that can be used interchangeably. In his response to
Line, Roberts (1975), suggest a single term (i.e., potential demand) should be used to
encompass all terms prior to demand and considers them to be manifestations of
demand. While these early attempts at defining information needs represent a
significant step forward in defining basic terminology in a young field, by focusing on
12

demands, Line and Roberts disregard information needs users might not even be aware
of. However, in his first major attempt to continue the debate, Wilson (1981) notes that
the disagreement over definition of information needs is secondary to issue of
appropriateness when the term is applied during the course of a specific investigation.
Consequently, Wilson called for more user centered, task based studies in line with Line
and Roberts’ focus on user demands or information need satisfaction.
The task based approach has been instrumental in furthering understanding of
various facets of information needs that can be used to improve users’ interaction with
information. For instance, a number of recent studies examine how students articulate
information needs. Some of the more interesting findings in this area suggest students
rarely reformulate queries and when they do, they tend to make a query more specific
or more general, or iterate in different ways (Zhang, 2014); when faced with researcher
imposed tasks, students with lower level of experience with web resources will use
search strategies requiring less cognitive effort (Thatcher, 2008); complex topics tend to
be broken down into several simpler and solvable research questions (Du & Evans,
2011).
User relevance studies (e.g., Yunjie & Zhiwei, 2006; Mu-hsuan & Hui-yu, 2004)
point to topicality and novelty, as well as time, document presentation order and
document numbers as essential components of relevance judgement among students.
Studies about types of information preferred by users to satisfy their information needs
suggest users base their decisions in part on volume and whether the information is

13

negative or positive (e.g., Stefl-Mabry, 2003); in everyday context, content of
information, and availability and accessibility were more important to users than
usability (e.g., Savolainen, 2008). However, as originally predicted by Wilson (1981),
because task replaced information need, this perspective failed to address the
information seeking motivation.
Perhaps the closest current LIS research comes to examining the why in
connection with information seeking behavior is while investigating information
avoidance. For instance, various studies in health context found people will avoid
information if seeking it will cause them anxiety or dissonance (e.g., Johnson, 2014).
Others found similar behaviors associated with impersonal risks such as environmental
issues (e.g., Kahlor, et al., 2006) were also mediated by peer pressure.
Given the difficulties involved in determining just what motivates an individual to
look for information by observing them during a specific task, Wilson (1981) suggested
that the research in information science focus on information seeking toward
satisfaction of needs. Recent research in psychology suggests that those same needs
play a vital role in energizing behavior and motivating humans at specific task level and
beyond (Ryan & Deci, 2008). Therefore, in order to begin to unpack students’
information needs and understand why they seek information it is necessary to consider
the nature of those needs.

2.2 NEEDS BASED MOTIVATION THEORIES IN PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE
Human need research in psychology is arguably very much a work in progress.
Therefore, no single theory is currently accepted as the dominant theory in the field.
However, Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT), one of the integral theories of the
SDT metatheory, is unique in that it not only explains how needs translate into
motivations but also how they relate to psychological wellbeing and wellness which in
turn influence individuals’ effort and enjoyment experienced during the activity. In
order to explore roots of BPNT and underscore its importance in human information
seeking motivation studies, the following section outlines the historical development of
needs based motivation theories in psychology.
2.2.1 MURRAY’S PRINCIPLE NEEDS
Strongly influenced by Carl Jung, Henry Murray (1938) is one of the first
psychologists to propose human needs were reflected in human behavior. Physiological
needs (e.g., food, water, shelter) were classed as primary and psychological needs (e.g.,
independence, achievement, approval) as secondary needs. Combination of both
primary and secondary needs were seen as present in an individual at varying levels. Full
list of needs is presented in table 2.1. Murray believed the needs were hierarchical in
nature (i.e., when primary and secondary needs conflicted primary needs would be
satisfied first). Additionally, if two secondary needs were in conflict, the need with
higher prepotency to the individual would be meet.

Based on Murray (1938)

16

Murray also believed need satisfaction was contingent on environment as much as on
the individual developing a concept of press (i.e., environmental force that acts in
concert with personality to develop behavior). As one of the first psychologists to
attempt systematic categorization of needs and devise tests (e.g., Thematic
Apperception Test) to empirically explore his proposed constructs, his work strongly
influenced Abram Maslow and John William Atkinson among others.
2.2.2 MASLOW’S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS
In his Hierarchy of Needs, Maslow (1943) departs from Murray by imposing a
more strict hierarchical order on human needs, today most frequently graphically
represented in the shape of a pyramid. Seen in figure 2.1 placed at the bottom of the
pyramid, as the widest and most basic of needs, physiological needs (e.g., food, water,
oxygen etc.) represent necessities of life ensuring continued survival. According to
Maslow, only after physiological needs are met, it is possible to move up the ladder
toward the next, pre-potent (i.e., predominant) level of need. Consequently, once
physiological needs are met, safety needs (e.g., shelter, consistency or routine in home
life, freedom from threat etc.) operate as the dominant needs and other higher needs
remain hidden. Maslow believed both physiological and safety needs were largely
satisfied in contemporary American society where most people are free of hunger and
enjoy a society that successfully promotes safety. Therefore, most well-adjusted
individuals are dominated by safety needs only in emergency situations such as war,
natural disasters or during crime waves leaving only neurotics at this stage of need.

17

Social needs (i.e., love, affection and belongingness) emerge as dominant after
physiological and safety needs are met and giving love and affection is considered as
important as receiving them. Maslow considered thwarting of social needs as the
predominant cause of maladjustment and psychopathology. Esteem needs (i.e., need
for self-respect or self-esteem) based on achievement, self-evaluation and respect from
others are separated into need for freedom based on confidence stemming from
evaluation of others, foreshadowing BPNT’s autonomy support and need for recognition
by others reminiscent of BPNT’s competence. Finally, once all lower needs are met, selfactualization (i.e., desire for self-fulfillment) propels individuals to fulfil their potential
according to their talents and aspirations.

Figure 2.1 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs
Maslow noted only few exceptions to the order in which needs are satisfied,
most caused by unusual circumstances and difficulties encountered during
development. However, even then those apparent shifts were considered exceptions
confirming the rule. For instance, individuals who value self-esteem over affection he

18

described as “self-esteem seekers for the sake of love.” It should, however, be noted
that Maslow acknowledged, most needs can never be completely satisfied and most
individuals can and do proceed to the next level in the hierarchy even if the preceding
need is only partially satisfied.
Although intuitively satisfying, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs was often criticized
for its lack of empirical support and various scales developed to measure components of
the Theory were called into question for their lack of validity and reliability (e.g., Wahba
& Bridwell, 1976). Additionally, newer theories such as Alderfer’s Existence,
Relatedness and Growth (ERG) Theory proved to be more successful in explaining
individual’s progression toward self-actualization by distinguishing between need
satisfaction at the maintenance (i.e., physiological and safety needs) and growth (i.e.,
social, esteem and self-actualization needs) levels.
2.2.3 ALDERFER’S ERG NEEDS THEORY
In an effort to address various deficiencies in Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs,
Clayton Alderfer (1969) introduced a number of modifications such as organization of
needs into fewer, more flexible categories reflective of the individual and abandoned
Maslow’s hierarchy allowing for all needs to be pursued simultaneously. Seen in table
2.2, Alderfer’s needs map to Maslow’s Hierarchy and in order of presentation include:
existence (formerly physiological and safety) needs, relatedness (social and esteem)
needs, and growth (self-actualization) needs. Although Alderfer maintains needs are
met simultaneously and not necessarily in any particular order, his approach to need

19

satisfaction remains somewhat hierarchical. For instance, movement through needs is
most optimal when progressing from existence to growth needs creating a sense of
satisfaction in an individual. When the direction changes and the movement is, instead,
directed downward (i.e., from growth to existence) individuals experience frustration.

Relatedness

Social (love, belongingness)

Self-actualization

Additionally, Alderfer (1972) later also suggested increases in satisfaction of lower needs
such as existence will result in increases in the desire to satisfy higher order needs such
as relatedness leading to an “enrichment cycle.” However, decreases in the higher level
needs satisfaction will lead to increases in the desire to satisfy lower needs (e.g., if the
atmosphere at work is hostile individuals may attempt to compensate by pursuing
higher pay). Finally, the less each level of need is satisfied the more it will be desired
(e.g., in a hostile work environment an individual might attempt to stick to a daily
routine to maximize safety).
20

Need satisfaction is also differentiated in terms of goals pursued and actions
necessary for goal attainment. Specifically, existence needs are characterized by pursuit
of physical objects (e.g., food, water and oxygen) that can be in limited or abundant
supply. Therefore, they are instrumental in creating competition when resources are
scarce. Relatedness needs, however, are satisfied through interaction with others (in
groups or individually) and the process is characterized by mutuality (e.g., receiving
affection is preceded and/or followed by giving affection). Therefore, a component of
safety needs growing out of affection and the non-material is also included in the
category. Esteem as a function of interaction with the environment is also included.
Growth, in turn, proceeds in cycles as individuals strive to positively affect their
environment and develop new abilities, in process, contributing to feeling of selfactualization. Since Alderfer maintains that the environment plays a greater role in
esteem development, his growth category also includes portion of esteem resulting
from positive self-evaluation.
Alderfer and Guzzo (1979) also differentiate needs according to their endurance.
The more enduring needs tend to change slowly over time and are reflective of the way
humans experience events stretching over longer periods of time (e.g., pursuing a
degree or contributing in a workplace). Episodic needs, in turn, are affected by day to
day events such as a taking a test or participating in a meeting at work. This is an
important distinction given the scarcity of longitudinal studies conducted in connection
with needs as it suggests most studies conducted up to that point dealt with episodic
rather than more elusive enduring needs. While Alderfer makes no effort to connect the
21

enduring needs to episodic needs, his idea represents the first such hierarchy of needs
which will be later developed by Vallerand (1997) to include intrinsic and extrinsic
motivations as hierarchical constructs operating at the personality, domain and
situational levels.
Overall, ERG theory received mixed support but it held up to empirical testing
somewhat better than Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Using cluster and factor analysis,
Wanous and Zwany (1977) established the three needs categories which they then used
to test the relationship between need satisfaction and their importance. Additionally,
to confirm the existence of the “satisfaction progression” and the “frustration
regression” cycles, they also tested the upward and downward causal relationships.
Unlike most studies testing the validity of Maslow’s Hierarchy, results supported the
validity of the ERG hierarchical structure in the organizational setting.
More recently, Arnolds & Boshoff (2000) examined the relationship between
need satisfaction progression as defined by ERG and job performance. Their results
contradicted earlier studies (e.g., Wilcove 1978; Alderfer & Guzzo 1979) finding that
blue-collar workers’ performance failed to improve when their growth needs (i.e.,
respect and personal development) were satisfied indicating there was a gap between
behavioral intention and actual performance. In their follow up study (Arnolds &
Boshoff, 2002), the mediating relationship of personality construct self-esteem between
ERG needs and job performance among managers was examined. The results indicated
self-esteem was significantly related to job performance and the growth need

22

satisfaction was significantly related to self-esteem while existence and relatedness
needs had no relation to self-esteem. The authors suggested while their results
provided limited support for Alderfer’s ERG theory, they were more in line with
Herzberger’s Motivator-Hygiene Theory.
2.2.4 HERZBERGER’S MOTIVATOR-HYGIENE THEORY (MHT)
Like Alderfer, Herzberg was also influenced by Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.
However, unlike Alderfer and Maslow who believed satisfaction of all needs contributed
to motivation, Herzberg’s theory (Herzberg, 1968) separates needs into motivators and
hygiene factors. The proposition stems from his early recognition while studying
engineers that the lack of job dissatisfaction did not equal job satisfaction any more
than lack of job satisfaction equaled lack of job dissatisfaction. Therefore, it made sense
to develop two distinct continua for job satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Maslow’s
primary needs (i.e., existence and relatedness) were considered “hygiene” (i.e.,
contributing to job dissatisfaction) factors and growth factors were, in turn, considered
motivators (i.e., contributing to job satisfaction). Specifically, achievement, recognition
for achievement, the work itself, responsibility, and growth or advancement were
considered motivators, while company policy and administration, supervision,
interpersonal relationships, working conditions, salary, status, and security were
considered hygiene factors.
While certainly a very distant cousin to BPNT, by organizing (and explicitly
recognizing them as such) his two factors around intrinsic (i.e., motivator) and extrinsic
23

(i.e., hygiene) factors, Herzberg’s Motivator Hygiene theory is one of the first to propose
and test the link between satisfaction and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Namely, in
the aforementioned study, he found motivators were capable of increasing job
satisfaction while hygiene factors only decreased dissatisfaction and had no effect on
job satisfaction. The theory, therefore, allows for employees to simultaneously
experience job satisfaction and dissatisfaction. However, hygiene factors were
considered distractors which needed to be addressed before motivators were
introduced to improve employee performance.
The two proposed continua for satisfaction and dissatisfaction have since been
empirically tested and disproved (Lindsay, Marks & Gorlow, 1967) when significant
correlations between satisfaction and dissatisfaction factors were found, paving the way
for future theories such as BPNT. An additional study (Gordon, Pryor & Harris, 1974)
also found Herzberg’s data gathering techniques prevented responders from voicing
their dissatisfaction with motivators thereby calling into question his assertion that the
absence of motivators caused no job dissatisfaction and that the hygiene factors caused
no job satisfaction.
Additionally, unlike Maslow’s Hierarchy on which it was based, HGT was not
intended as a general theory. Even though it was tested in various cultures, Herzberg’s
theory was developed with the specific intent to aid managers in work performance
improvement and is, therefore, not applicable to other contexts. Unlike BPNT it also

24

fails to take into account individual differences relying instead on broad divisions of
workers into managers and blue-collar workers.
Herzberg was hardly the only psychologist to consider expectations in
connection with motivation and, although out of scope in the current section of this
document as it is based on beliefs rather than needs, it is important to note, Victor
Vroom’s Value Expectation Theory has largely replaced Motivation Hygiene theory in
the current psychology literature.
2.2.5 MCCLELLAND’S ACHIEVEMENT MOTIVATION THEORY (AMT)
In his seminal work on achievement, McClelland’s (1961) proposed yet another
version of the need based motivation theory. He groups needs into three categories
(i.e., Achievement Motivation, Authority/Power Motivation and Affiliation Motivation).
While other need based theories consider needs to be universal (i.e., present to a
certain degree in all humans), McClelland uses his need categories to group individuals
according to what he considers their primary motivation to succeed. Descriptions of
motivators are presented in table 2.3.

Defers to others

However, in contrast with previously discussed theories where needs were
innate and their satisfaction or frustration dictated through various mechanisms (e.g.,
hierarchy), McClelland (1965) believed needs and the resulting motivations based on
those needs could be learned and developed. Motives were defined as “affectively
toned associative networks arranged in a hierarchy of strength or importance within a
given individual”. He reasoned, even biological needs are learned as awareness of
hunger or thirst requires a cue that must be processed in some way in order to be
converted from a drive into a motive. Consequently, individual motivational
orientations could change and could be subject to manipulation to help them better fit
within an environment. For instance, individuals driven by need to achieve would find
work in an organizational setting challenging because they might be perceived as
domineering and those driven by need for affiliation might be seen as too weak due to
their desire to be liked. In order to change motivational orientations McClelland
proposes the following:
(a) setting up the network—discovering what associations, for example, exist
in the achievement area and then extending, strengthening, or otherwise
"improving" the network they form; (b) conceptualizing the network —
forming a clear and conscious construct that labels the network; (c) tying the
network to as many cues as possible in everyday life, especially those
preceding and following action, to insure that the network will be regularly
rearoused once formed; and (d) working out the relation of the network to
superordinate associative clusters, like the self-concept, so that these
dominant schemata do not block the train of achievement thoughts— for
example, through a chain of interfering associations (e.g., "I am not really the
achieving type"). (McClelland, 1965)

26

McClelland’s AMT has proved to be more empirically robust than either
Maslow’s Hierarchy or Alderfer’s ERG and the existence of the three motives was
empirically confirmed (Burdick, 1961). AMT received most wide acceptance in business
settings as a way to improve performance by linking motivation types with performance
measures (e.g., McClelland, 1998) and satisfaction (e.g., Harrell & Stahl, 1984). In his
later studies examining the difference between the self-attributed motives (i.e.,
revealed through self-reports) and implicit motives (i.e., revealed through stories
describing pictures) (McClelland, Koestner and Weinberger, 1989 ), McClelland agreed
with Ryan and Deci that intrinsic motivation reflected in implicit motives was better at
sustaining motivation over time because it was driven by enjoyment of the activity itself.
2.2.6 BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS THEORY (BPNT)
BPNT is one of the six mini theories comprising the Self-determination
metatheory (SDT) used to explore students’ information seeking motivation in the
current study. Five of those are described in the remaining sections of this chapter.
One of the major distinguishing characteristics of BPNT, separating it from previous
motivation need theories, is the notion that only those human needs which when acting
in concert with the environment contribute to growth and wellbeing can be considered
basic needs. Consequently, physiological needs as descried by Murray and later by
Maslow and Alderfer, are considered motives that energize action (Deci and Ryan, 2000)
rather than true needs as the loose definition provided to describe needs produced
endless lists rendering the concept meaningless. Furthermore, according to BPNT since

27

those needs are responsible for optimal psychological functioning they are innate rather
than learned as was previously hypothesized by Murray.
The three BPNT needs are: relatedness (i.e.., need to feel connected with others
in a meaningful way), competence (i.e., need to be considered skilled and successful
when interacting with the environment) and autonomy (i.e., need to feel a sense of
choice and freedom). Deci and Ryan’s view of relatedness and competence is consistent
with most psychology literature while autonomy also accounts for social nature of the
individual. Specifically, autonomy needs to be supported by significant others (e.g.,
when a teenager chooses a college major the parents show support and respect for the
choice). When satisfied, the three needs contribute to continued wellbeing, however,
when thwarted they produce significant negative consequences. Since the needs are
innate, individuals are often not consciously aware of their presence and can, indeed,
engage in pursuit of other, often compensatory, actions (e.g., Murray’s abasement).
However, since those actions usually fail to produce the lasting sense of wellbeing at
best, and harm the individual at worst, they are not considered basic psychological
needs.
This view of basic psychologic needs stems from SDT’s organismic dialectic
orientation. Namely, Deci and Ryan (2000) maintain humans are naturally inquisitive,
growth oriented organisms that use their capacity to adapt to the environment in such a
way as to promote connections with others in an environment that is supportive of the
three basic needs (i.e., competence, autonomy and relatedness). Deci and Ryan

28

acknowledge the existence of drives and physiological needs but, unlike most other
motivation theorists to date, they consider them subordinate to basic psychological
needs, maintaining physiological needs are regulated by psychological needs. Since
most drive theories aim to explain how individuals deal with disturbances in their
equilibrium, they argue, the goal is to return to that same equilibrium. However,
according to SDT, humans are growth oriented organisms, and only the basic
psychological need satisfaction or thwarting would account for their motivations.
Deci and Ryan (2000) acknowledge since basic psychological needs are innate,
need satisfaction is not often pursued as a goal in itself (e.g., we read for pleasure of
reading rather than to satisfy our need for autonomy). According to SDT, direct need
satisfaction pursuit is often a result of prolonged thwarting of that need (e.g., individuals
feeling controlled will seek to free themselves). However, individuals might instead
pursue compensatory activities which will satisfy the need in short term. For example,
need for competence might be temporarily masked by attainment of material wealth or
status. Worse still, since the relief from original need thwarting in this way is
temporary, individuals might lock themselves in perpetual struggle to attain wealth and
be left with little energy to engage in activities satisfying the need for competence
which would promote true psychological wellbeing in turn also affecting their physical
health.

29

2.2.7 COGNITIVE EVALUATION THEORY (CET)
In addition to the differing views of basic needs as learned and varying in
strength (e.g., McClelland, 1965) to innate basic needs, Deci and Ryan also point out
that since those needs must be satisfied in order for an individual to function optimally,
research concerning their strength in an individual is of little consequence and the focus
shifts, instead, in favor of research exploring motivational orientations and goal
contents, reflecting need satisfaction (or thwarting). Indeed, empirical research on basic
psychological needs is mostly based on research on intrinsic motivation as a growth
function and internalization as an “essential aspect of psychological integrity and social
cohesion” (Ryan, Connell, & Deci, 1985 as cited in Deci & Ryan, 2000). As a part of SDT
metatheory, CET was especially formulated to address the effects of basic need
satisfaction and thwarting and the interaction with the social environment on
development and maintenance of intrinsic motivation.
The evolution of intrinsic motivation definition is well documented in literature
(e.g., Deci & Ryan, 1985). In the realm of SDT, researchers generally see it as a drive to
engage in activities for their own sake. Intrinsic motivation consists of three distinct
types and is, therefore, multidimensional. However, unlike extrinsic motivation the
three types are not continuous (i.e. individuals are either intrinsically motivated or not)
and, depending on the activity, individuals can simultaneously exhibit one or more
intrinsic motivations. Empirical research shows, the three types of intrinsic motivation
generally exhibit a simplex pattern and are more closely intercorrelated than they would

30

be with amotivation or the extrinsic motivation types (e.g., Pelletier et al., 1995;
Vallerand et al., 1993; Mullan, Markland & Ingledew, 1997).
Intrinsic motivation toward accomplishment is centered on activity that
promotes satisfaction and contentment as individuals strive toward accomplishment
(Deci and Ryan, 2000). Student information seekers might, for instance, experience
contentment when they research to discover increasingly relevant information on their
assignments. Consistent with all types of intrinsic motivation, the feeling of
contentment will, however, center on the activity itself rather than the end goal of a
more thoroughly researched assignment. Intrinsic motivation to experience stimulation,
in turn, is tied to sensory and aesthetic pleasures derived from the activity. For
instance, students might select more visually appealing databases or printed materials
to experience pleasure while researching. Finally, intrinsic motivation to know refers to
activities individuals engage in in order to experience and learn something new. For
instance, students might consistently seek out new sources of information while
researching for assignments.
SDT proposes individuals can simultaneously sustain many different intrinsic and
extrinsic motivational orientations. Further research also confirms, it is possible for
intrinsic motivation to morph into extrinsic (i.e., externally driven) motivation and vice
versa (e.g., Deci, Koestner, Ryan, 1999). For instance, when rewards are offered for
activities originally engaged in for internal reasons, participants’ motivational
orientation becomes driven by the reward. Research shows, task contingent rewards

31

consistently induced decrease in intrinsic motivation (Ryan, Mims & Koestner, 1983) but
the reduction depended on context (e.g., if the feedback was perceived as controlling
versus informational).
2.2.8 ORGANISMIC INTEGRATION THEORY (OIT)
OIT addresses the extrinsic motivational orientation in its various incarnations
and its antecedents and consequences. External motivation is, generally, differentiated
from intrinsic motivation by locus of rewards sought (Vallerand, 2012). For extrinsically
motivated individuals, locus of reward is external to the process which is seen as a
means to an end. In contrast, intrinsically motivated individuals find the process itself
enjoyable and are not as focused on a specific goal. It, then, follows that the emotions
accompanying these motivational orientations would differ and the intrinsically
motivated individuals would feel pleasure while extrinsically motivated individuals
would feel pressured and stressed during the activity.
Although it was initially thought of as a unidimensional construct, according to
SDT, extrinsic motivation consists of four distinct types of motivation existing on a
continuum (Deci and Ryan, 2000). The validity and reliability of external motivation
scales in various contexts has since been confirmed in a variety of settings such as sports
(e.g., Vallerand & Losier, 1999) and therapy (e.g., Pelletier, Tuson & Haddad, 1997).
External regulation is on the farthest end of the spectrum of controlled motivation and
the behavior is entirely ruled by externalities such as rewards and punishment. For
instance, a student might conduct research because they fear censure or are excited
32

about a possibility of a higher grade. Introjected regulation is slightly more internalized,
but it is not autonomous and is ruled by past contingencies. For instance, a student
might research because they want to avoid feelings of guilt and shame they felt in the
past when they submitted a substandard paper as a result on insufficient research.
Identified regulation is autonomous and the behavior is self-determined (i.e. done by
choice) but the activity is still seen as a means to an end. For instance, a student might
research outside the assigned material because they expect their argument in the
assignment will be stronger if supported by more relevant information. Finally,
integrated regulation is closest to the intrinsic motivation and is fully self-determined
because the activity is not only done out of choice but it is also integrated into self along
with other activities. For instance, in addition to searching for more information to
strengthen their argument, students might also allow more time for research by
planning ahead to eliminate possible conflicts with other activities or choose to conduct
research at certain times of day when they feel most refreshed.
2.2.9 CAUSALITY ORIENTATION THEORY (COT)
COT is another mini-theory within SDT addressing the individual differences in
causality orientations of individuals while engaged in activities and the value they place
on those activities. Autonomously oriented individuals pursue activities out of interest
and are intrinsically motivated. Controlled oriented individuals, in contrast, are focused
on rewards and punishment resulting from the activity and are extrinsically motivated.
Finally, amotivated individuals are impersonally oriented and display lack of sense of

33

control over their environment. The General Causality Orientations Scale is used to
measure individual orientations and has been tested for reliability and validity (Deci &
Ryan, 1985). Figure 2.2 illustrates the relationship between motivations types and
individual causality orientations.
Research shows, autonomously oriented individuals consistently engage in
prosocial behavior (Gagné, 2003), persist in activities (Ratelle, Guay, Vallerand, Larose &
Senécal, 2007), have higher self-esteem (Deci, Nezlek, & Sheinman, 1981), tend to be
less self-serving (Knee & M. Zuckerman, 1996) and self-handicapping (Knee &
Zuckerman, 1998).

Figure 2.2 Motivation and personal orientation

34

Control oriented individuals were more likely to suffer low self-esteem especially when
comparing themselves to those they perceived as better performers (Neighbors & Knee,
2003), engage in self-presentation (i.e., impression management) and suffer from lower
self-esteem (Lewis & Neighbors, 2005).
2.2.10 GOAL CONTENTS THEORY (GCT)
Like motivations, goal content can also be viewed as intrinsic and extrinsic.
Research shows goal contents are just as crucial in securing psychological wellbeing as
strategies to pursue them (i.e., what is desired is as important as how it is attained)
(Sheldon, Ryan, Deci, & Kasser, 2004). For instance, when goals are intrinsically
formulated (e.g., teachers assign papers emphasizing learning objectives over grading
procedures) individuals tend to respond by being more engaged, put in more effort and
engage in more conceptual learning (Vansteenkiste, Lens & Deci, 2006). Although goal
framing can be effective in enhancing wellbeing during a task performance, research
also shows that the effect seems to be mediated by self-determined motivation. For
instance, in their research on adolescents’ weight perceptions and exercise goals,
Gillison, Standage & Skevington (2006) found while intrinsic goals positively predicted
self-determined motivation, which in turn positively predicted quality of life and
exercise behavior, intrinsic motivation partially mediated the effects of exercise goals on
exercise behavior and quality of life.

35

2.3 SUMMARY
Current LIS literature is in need of empirical studies capable of addressing the
why of information seeking. While situation based studies answered important
questions aimed at much needed improvements in negotiating reference transactions
as well as systems’ enhancements, deeper understanding of information seeking
motivation is impossible without a deeper understanding of information seeking needs.
Recent research in motivational psychology shows distinct promise in addressing
this research gap. By linking basic human needs to motivation, SDT metatheory can
address both information needs and their influence on information seeking motivation
and offer valuable insights currently lacking in LIS literature. In contrast with earlier
theories, SDT has grown out of applied research and has been extensively tested in
various contexts from sports (e.g., Briere, Vallerand, Blais & Pelletier, 2013), physical
and mental health (e.g., Moran, Russinova, Yim & Sprague, 2014; Hartmann, Dohle &
Siegrist, 2015; Bernard, Martin & Kulik, 2014) to organizational management (e.g.,
Robson, Schlegelmilch & Bojkowszky, 2012; Oostlander, Guntert, van Schie & Wehner,
2014). The theory has also been validated across cultures (Deci, Ryan, Gagné, Leone,
Usunov & Kornazheva, 2001; Chirkov, Ryan, Kim & Kaplan, 2003) with no significant
differences found in basic needs and their influence on motivational orientations
between collectivist and individualist societies.
Additionally, current LIS literature lacks research focusing on information seeking
motivations beyond situational level. In addition to being multidimensional constructs,
36

intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, as understood in SDT, operate at different levels of
generality (i.e., global, contextual and situational). The three levels of generality are
also hierarchical in nature (Vallerand, 1997). Since global motivational orientation is a
reflection of success of process of integrating activities into the self, this personality
dimension will affect how individuals integrate motivations at the contextual and
situational levels. Similarly, contextual level will affect the situational level of generality
reflective of current activities.
The global level refers to personality (i.e., individuals’ general tendencies to
interact with the environment in autonomous or controlled way). According to Deci and
Ryan (2000) humans have an innate need to engage in stimulating activities and through
this engagement constantly redefine themselves. If one’s basic psychological needs are
met, the autonomous, intrinsically motivated activities will be a reflection of their
nascent selves, and even some of the extrinsically motivated acts will be gradually
integrated into the self. If these needs are thwarted individuals will behave in
controlled ways, which in addition to being less likely to be integrated into the self will
also contribute to engagement in compensatory activities which will in turn, make
meeting those needs even less likely.
The contextual level of generality refers to domains of activity which change over
time but are much more stable in terms of response to environmental stimuli than
those at the situation level. The current study, for instance, examines motivational
forces of students engaged in college level research in students’ major. By examining

37

basic psychological needs in connection to intrinsic and extrinsic motivation at
contextual level, the study accounts for the academic environment, interactions with
significant others (e.g., parents, teachers and other students) and the culture within
which these interactions occur.
In contrast, studies at the situational level focus on tasks and are strongly
influenced by in- the-moment feedback and consequences of actions. For instance,
research conducted for a specific research assignment would be influenced by the
instructions as well as professor’s feedback. Current LIS research draws useful
inferences from situational level studies sometimes conducted over decades as
demonstrated by numerous information behavior models used for system’s
development (e.g., Belkin’s ASK is used for query refinement in search engines).
However, because of their lack of focus on higher level, contextual elements influencing
research behavior at domain level, these studies have been unsuccessful in solving the
motivational puzzle at that level. Current study aims to fill this gap in research using
measurement scales based on SDT to measure motivation at the domain level.

38

CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY
The purpose of the current study is to empirically examine information seeking
motivation in undergraduate students at the contextual level (i.e., while researching in
their major area of study). Additionally, in line with SDT, the role basic psychological
needs play in furthering intrinsic information seeking motivation in undergraduates is
examined. Finally, correlation between intrinsic information seeking motivation and
enjoyment and effort invested are explored. The following chapter is organized into
three sections describing data collection, measurement instruments, and analytical
procedures.
3.1 DATA COLLECTION
Since the aim of the study is to examine academic information seeking
motivation, all undergraduate students engaged in research in their major field of study,
regardless of age and sex, were included in the study. To ensure a wide distribution of
majors, undergraduate students at a large metropolitan university enrolled in courses
required of all undergraduate students were surveyed. Survey instrument was
distributed electronically to the selected sample through Qualtrics data collection
service during the regularly scheduled class time to ensure maximum response rate.
Students’ consent was obtained through an online form preceding the survey. In
accordance with the IRB requirements, the text of the informed consent form clearly
39

indicated participation was voluntary and there will be no negative consequences for
choosing not to participate. Instructors offered no incentives for participation.
There is no clear consensus in literature about the exact sample size required for
confirmatory factor analysis or other structural equation modeling procedures with
estimates running from one hundred to five thousand subjects (Schumacker & Lomax,
2012). For normally distributed data relying on maximum likelihood estimator, it is
generally accepted that sample size of at least 200 is sufficient (Gorsuch, 1983).
However, in order to minimize the effects of sampling error, prior to conducting
confirmatory factor analysis two random samples of over 200 participants were
collected. Demographic questions pertinent to motivation in context of selfdetermination theory (see appendix A) were also included in the study.
3.2 MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS
Academic Motivation Scale – College Version (AMS-C-28) (Vallerand et al., 1992),
was adapted to create Information Seeking Motivation Scale (ISMS) presented in Table
3.1. AMS subscales were confirmed to have high level of internal consistency with
Chronbach alpha levels above 0.8 for all subscales except for identified regulation with
levels above 0.6 (Vallerand et al., 1992). Like AMS, ISMS measures motivation at the
contextual level in the same life domain (i.e., education) and includes 28 items
representing 7 motivational subscales posited by SDT from amotivation to intrinsic
motivation (Table 3.1). Integrated regulation is not included and has not been
confirmed in education domain to date. Responses are recorded on a 7 point Likert
scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Stem question “Why do you search for
40

information in your major?” precedes all answer choices. Like AMS, ISMS is scored by
summing and computing averages for each subscale where lower scores indicate higher
levels of self-determined motivation.

To measure basic psychological needs, 2 scales were adapted for use measuring
perceived autonomy support and perceived competence. Relatedness has not been
confirmed in solitary activities such as information seeking and was not included in the
present study. Learning Climate Questionnaire (LCQ) short form (Williams and Deci,
1996) was adapted to construct Perceived Information Seeking Autonomy Support Scale
(PISASS) (Table 3.2). LCQ short form consists of 6 items and boasts a high level of
internal consistency with Cronbach Alpha levels typically over 0.9 (Black and Deci, 2000).
LCQ has been tested across cultures and contexts and translated into numerous
languages (e.g., Granero-Gallegos et al, 2014, Hetland et al., 2011 and Ntalianis, 2010).
Since the current study focuses on contextual motivational level, the answer choices
focusing on a specific instructor during a specific task were changed to ”Most professors
in my major are…” to include all instructors in a students’ major area of study.
Consistent with the ISMS, answer choices range from “strongly agree” to “strongly
disagree” on a 7 point Likert scale. PISASS is scored by averaging students’ responses on
the 6 items.
To measure perceived information seeking competence, perceived information
seeking competence scale (PISCS) was constructed. Self-efficacy for information seeking
scale (SISS) (Van der Vord, 2010) and Perceived Competence for Learning Scale (PCLS)
(Williams and Deci, 1996) were adapted for this purpose. Both scales measure
competence at contextual level and exhibit high level of internal consistency with SISS
Chronbach alpha levels at 0.91 and PCLS levels above 0.8. PISCS responses are recorded
on a 7 point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Similarly to
44

PCLS, PISCS is scored by averaging students’ responses on the 4 items where lower
scores indicate higher levels of perceived competence.

Information seeking effort scale (ISES) was adapted from 2 item Effort Scale (ES)
and 4 item Persistence Scale (PS) (Elliot, McGregor and Gable, 1999). Both ES and PS
internal consistency levels are high with ES at 0.93 and PS at 0.78 on Chronbach alpha
scale. Information seeking enjoyment scale (ISENS) was constructed for the present
study. Similarly to other scales in the current study, ISES and ISENS (Table 3.3)
responses are recorded on a 7 point Likert scale and follow the same scoring scheme.

3.3 ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
Data will be analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)
version 19.0 and Linear Structural Relations software (LISREL) version 9.2. SPSS will be
used to conduct data screening prior to analysis as well as to create composite variables
and conduct internal consistency reliability analysis. Data screening involves checking
for univariate and multivariate normality. Univariate normality refers to a single
variable, while multivariate normality refers to data distribution for multiple variables.
Normally, distributed data follow bell curve distribution with most data points within 2
standard deviations from the mean (Lockhart, 1998). Kurtosis (i.e., data distribution
around the mean) and skewness (i.e., deviation from distribution symmetry) levels in a
perfectly normally distributed data should be close to 0.
Multivariate normality is especially crucial in structural equation modeling and
analysis of data violating this assumption can result in unreliable standard errors and
coefficients. Skewness in particular can cause lower estimates for factor correlations
and loadings, as well as lower error variance and standard error estimates (Byrne, 1998).
To address these issues, prior to analysis non normal data are either transformed or an
estimator appropriate for the specific violation of normality is used (e.g., Generalized

47

Least Squares, Weighted Least Squares etc.) instead of the Maximum Likelihood
estimator commonly used in analysis of normally distributed data.
Internal consistency reliability for all scales in the current study was assessed
using Cronbach Alpha measure for each construct. Cronbach Alpha measures how well
a set of measured (i.e., observed) variables measures a single latent construct. Levels
range between 0 and 1. Generally, highly correlated indicator variables as well as a
higher number of indicator variables tend to produce higher Cronbach Alpha levels and
levels too close to 1 are not always desirable. In social sciences, levels above 0.7 are
considered acceptable (Nunally and Bernstein, 1994).
After the tests of reliability are conducted, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
was conducted to establish the factorial validity of ISMS college version. CFA was
developed to measure how well as set of items represents a latent construct. The
method was chosen over the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) because the hypothesized
relationships can be specified a priori in accordance with SDT, while EFA seeks to find a
model that best fits the data. To reduce sampling error, the sample was split into 2
random samples and CFA analysis conducted on both samples.
In addition to exhibiting acceptable levels across all global fit indices, a wellfitting model should contain feasible parameter estimates (e.g., correlations <1, positive
definite correlation matrices, no negative variances etc.) and standard errors (i.e., not
extremely large or small) (Byrne, 1998). Additionally, measurement model should
indicate the observed variables adequately represent their latent construct as
48

determined by the squared multiple correlations (R2) levels ranging from 0 to 1. For
instance, SMC of 0.3 would indicate 30% of variance on that latent construct is
accounted for by the indicator variables.
Currently, there is no consensus on which specific global fit indices indicate
satisfactory CFA fit. Most researchers recommend relying on indices with different
measurement properties including measures of absolute fit, incremental fit and
parsimony based fit indices. Measures of absolute indicate how well the model fits
data without relying on comparison to other models (Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1993). As a
measure of absolute fit, Chi square value with the corresponding degrees of freedom
indicates the overall model fit. Contrary to most statistical analyses, CFA requires a
nonsignificant Chi square value as this indicates there is little difference between the
sample variance/covariance matrix and the theory implied reproduced covariance
matrix. However, for large samples (i.e., over 200) Chi square statistic is nearly always
significant in CFA analyses. This is generally considered acceptable provided the other
indices are satisfactory.
Other frequently reported absolute fit indices (i.e., based on the implied
covariance matrix) include Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), Expected Cross-validation Index
(ECVI), the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) and Root Mean Error of
Approximation (RMSEA). GFI measures the amount of covariance explained by the
implied covariance matrix. GFI levels range between 0 and 1 although studies with just
identified and overidentified models with low Chi square values have reported GFI levels

49

larger than 1 (Kline, 2011). Acceptable levels need to be over 0.9 (Byrne, 1998) although
some researchers consider this too low recommending levels of at least 0.95 and above.
ECVI measures the difference between the sample covariance matrix and the expected
covariance matrix of the equivalent sized sample (Browne and Cudeck, 1998).
Satisfactory ECVI levels should be somewhere between the ECVI value for the saturated
model (i.e., model where all parameters are estimated) and the ECVI value for the
independence model (i.e., where all variables are independent). SRMR is used to
measure the difference between the sample correlation matrix and the expected
correlation matrix. Values range from 0 to 1 with the acceptable levels below 0.8
(Browne and Cudeck, 1993). Finally, RMSEA shows how well a perfect model, (i.e., with
unknown but optimally chosen parameter estimates) would fit the populations
covariance matrix (Byrne, 1998). Historically, RMSEA values below 0.8 were considered
acceptable (MacCallum et al., 1996) but more recent studies recommend values lower
than 0.5 (Hu and Bentler, 1999) for well-fitting models.
Incremental fit indices are based on comparison between the independence
model (i.e., zero correlations among variables) and the hypothesized model. Frequently
reported incremental fit indices include: Normed Fit Index (NFI), Non-normed Fit Index
(NNFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the Incremental Fit Index (IFI). Values for this
class of indices range between 0 and 1 with recommended acceptable fit values
generally expected to be at 0.95 or higher (Kline, 2011). Both NFI and CFI compare the
hypothesized model with the null model but the CFI takes into account sample size and
has shown to perform better in models using smaller sample sizes (Bentler, 1990). NNFI
50

was originally intended to rectify NFI issues with small size samples also taking into
account model complexity. However, since it is non-normed, it can be difficult to
interpret in relation to other indices. Consequently, CFI is currently considered the most
accurate of the available incremental fit indices (Bentler, 1990).
Finally, parsimony fit indices examine the overall model fit in relation to its
complexity. Generally, more complex nearly saturated models tend to exhibit better
overall fit. Parsimony fit indices introduce penalties for model complexity and result in
lower fit values as the model complexity increases. Frequently reported values include:
the Parsimony Goodness-of-Fit Index (PGFI) and the Parsimonious Normed Fit Index
(PNFI). PGFI is based on GFI and PNFI is based on NFI adjusted for loss of degrees of
freedom. However, while these indices can be instructive, recommended values vary
widely with no consensus in literature as to levels indicating acceptable fit (Mulaik, et
al., 1989).
Finally, the full structural model, presented in Figure 3, tested the hypothesized
relationships between the basic psychological needs (i.e., perceived competence and
perceived autonomy support), intrinsic motivation and information seeking effort and
enjoyment. According to SDT (see Figure 3.1), basic psychological need satisfaction
should positively influence intrinsic motivation which will in turn positively affect
information seeking effort and enjoyment. While CFA includes a measurement model,
structural equation model (SEM) involves only paths between latent constructs. To

51

ensure validity of latent constructs, multidimensional scales were subjected to CFA prior
to their inclusion into the full SEM.
SEM in current study is composed of 3 dependent and 2 independent variables.
In addition to global fit indices used in CFA reporting, SEM also requires inspection of
structural paths. In LISREL, regression coefficients linking independent and dependent
latent constructs are listed in the gamma matrix, while those linking dependent latent
constructs reside in the beta matrix. Additionally, disturbance terms (Zetas) associated
with each construct need to be examined to determine model fit.

Figure 3.1 Hypothesized full model
In summary, procedures detailed in this chapter will lead to the development
and validation of a new tool, LIS researchers and educators can use to measure and
score undergraduates’ information seeking motivation at the contextual level.
Additionally, five scales measuring information seeking effort, information seeking
enjoyment, and the two basic psychological needs associated with research (i.e..,
52

perceived competence and perceived autonomy support) will be adapted and validated
in the information seeking context at the undergraduate level. Finally, the relationship
between basic psychological needs and autonomous motivation and effort and
enjoyment will be modeled to confirm the hypothesized relationships.

CHAPTER 4
RESULTS
4.1 PARTICIPANTS
As seen in table 4.1, slightly over half of participants were male. Close to 60%
were freshmen. Since this number is high, analysis using only freshmen sample and all
other students as a separate sample to construct the ISMS scale was performed and
showed there was no significant difference between the two samples. Most students
reported high GPAs with over half of the population reporting GPAs over 3.5.
Somewhat heavier concentration of business students is reflected in the University of
South Carolina enrollment numbers with business students representing one of the
most numerous groups second only to College of Arts and Sciences student numbers.
While normality of data is assessed looking at kurtosis and skewness, there is little
consensus as to how far those values can be from zero before the data are considered
non normal. However, Curran (1996) conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study,
establishing that the skewness scores between 2 and 3 and kurtosis scores between 7
and 21 point to moderately non normal data while skewness values above 3 and
kurtosis levels above 21 point to extremely skewed data. As seen in Table 4.1, all
demographic variables in the current study exhibited univariate normality with
skewness and kurtosis values within acceptable ranges.

4.2 ISMS SCALE VALIDATION
Prior to scale construction, data were screened for normality. As seen in Table
4.2, only a single item representing External Regulation (ExtReg3) had a skewness score

55

slightly above the 2.0 threshold. However, since all other External Regulation items
were normal and the item in question was only slightly higher in skew than the
recommended level the item was retained in the final analysis. All items exhibited
normal kurtosis levels with only a few approaching the 7 threshold. However, in
contrast with other items, amotivation items exhibited consistent high levels of negative
skew and kurtosis and the construct was removed from further analysis.

Following the univariate normality tests, the data were randomly split into two
samples (N=294) and all motivation subscales were tested for reliability using
Cronbach’s alpha test. All subscales consisted of 4 items each and as seen in Table 4.3,
exhibited acceptable levels of reliability ranging from .705 (External Regulation in
sample 2) to .884 (Intrinsic Motivation – Stimulation in sample 1). Additionally, the 2
samples exhibited similar levels of reliability and were consistent with the results for the
full sample. Consequently, all subscales were retained in confirmatory factor analysis.

To further minimize the sampling error, confirmatory factor analysis was
conducted on the 2 random samples from the previous analysis and the full sample
(N=588). Results of analysis for the 2 split samples, available in appendix B, produced
similar results with all loadings within acceptable range and the lowest loading at 0.425
which is well above the recommended lowest level of 0.3. Additionally, as seen in Table
4.4 model fit was acceptable and the model was invariant across samples.

Consequently, only the results of the CFA analysis of the full sample are presented in
Figure 4.1. Item loadings on latent variables were significant and ranged from 0.55 to
0.85 suggesting that the items represent the latent constructs well. Although Chisquare for the model was significant, all other global fit indices presented in Table 4.4
are all within established acceptable ranges indicating excellent fit. This final acceptable
solution was arrived at by using selected modification indices suggestions and
58

correlating errors between 8 items. As seen in Figure 4.1, errors were correlated only
between conceptually similar items (i.e., autonomous motivation items) consistent with
the SDT. Additionally, correlated errors were used by Vallerand (1992) in the original
version of the Academic Motivation Scale used to construct ISMS.

59

Finally, results of the subscale correlations presented in table 4.5 indicate the
hypothesized SDT simplex pattern was confirmed. Namely, all adjacent subscales were
more highly correlated and the correlation levels decreased along the continuum with
minor deviations from the pattern. For instance, external regulation correlations with
identified regulation (r=.525) was slightly higher than its correlation with the adjacent
introjected regulation (r=.510). However, these correlation levels are much higher than
correlations between introjected regulation and subscales representing intrinsic
motivation ranging from .227 (intrinsic stimulation) to .360 (intrinsic toward
accomplishment). Similarly, correlations between the three intrinsic motivation
subscales were much higher than their correlations with the 3 extrinsic motivation
subscales.

Following data screening, reliability testing was conducted. As seen in Table 4.6, all
scales exhibited high alpha levels ranging from .839 to .914, which is well above the
recommended .7 cutoff. Consequently, all scales were included in the full model.

4.4 AUTONOMOUS MOTIVATION SCALE VALIDATION
In order to determine if autonomous motivation scale was appropriate for the
sample in the current study, second order confirmatory factor analysis was conducted.

Figure 4.2 Autonomous motivation second order CFA model
As seen in Figure 4.2, all second order loadings were high, with lowest at .86. for

62

identified regulation. Given that the identified regulation represents the selfdetermined form of extrinsic motivation while the other latent constructs in this model
represent intrinsic motivation, the somewhat lower loading was expected. Modification
indices were used to add correlated errors also included in the first order CFA analysis
for the full ISMS. Despite the significant Chi-square (Chi-square = 249.919, df = 96,
p<0.000), other global fit indices showed acceptable fit (RMSEA = 0.0520, CFI = 0.975,
NNFI = 0.969, GFI = 0.948, SRMR = 0.0296) and the autonomous motivation construct
was included in the final model.
4.5 FULL MODEL RESULTS
In order to create autonomous motivation construct, composite variables
representing each of the constructs included in the second order CFA analysis were
constructed. The procedure was further justified by high Cronbach’s Alpha levels for
each of the subscales as seen in Table 4.3. Following the construction of autonomous
motivation indicator variables, structural equation model was run to assess the
relationships between the two basic human needs, autonomous motivation, enjoyment
and effort. Autonomy support and perceived competence explained 34.7% variance on
autonomous motivation while autonomous motivation, in turn, explained 13.1% of
variance of effort and 25.8% variance on enjoyment. Chi-square for the overall model
was significant (χ2= 687.482 df = 196), but other global fit indices support a well-fitting
model (NNF I= 0.942, CFI = 0.951, GFI = 0.901, SRMR = 0.066, RMSEA = 0.065).
As seen in Figure 4.3, all structural and measurement coefficients using the
completely standardized solution are fairly high indicating a good fit. All coefficients
63

were significant and all paths were retained in the final model. In line with SDT, the
model indicates there is a positive relationship between basic human needs and
autonomous motivation. Higher students’ autonomy support (β = 0.17, p<0.05) and
perceived competence (β = 0.46, p<0.05) levels lead to increase in autonomous
motivation to research. Higher autonomous motivation levels, similarly, lead to higher
levels of effort (β = 0.62, p<0.05) and enjoyment (β = 0.86, p<0.05). Additionally,
indirect interaction effects were also found to be significant. Regarding these effects,
perceived competence was found to statically significantly affect effort and enjoyment
via the autonomous motivation. Similarly, autonomy support was found to, to a lesser
extent, statistically significantly affect both effort and enjoyment.

The model was also separately tested for fit for male (N=333) and female (N=255)
samples. Both models fit the data well and were similar across groups (female χ2=
415.340 df = 192, NNFI = 0.942, CFI = 0.952, GFI = 0.868, SRMR = 0.072, RMSEA = 0.067;
male χ2 = 557.396 df = 193; NNFI = 0.922, CFI = 0.933, GFI = 0.868, SRMR = 0.073,
RMSEA = 0.075). Both structural and measurement coefficient were similar to the
overall sample model indicating the model is invariant across gender.

CHAPTER 5
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The current study examined information seeking motivation in undergraduate
students at the contextual level through the lens of SDT, one of the most supported
motivation theories in psychology. SDT framework also allowed for investigation of the
role basic psychological needs play in furthering intrinsic information seeking motivation
in undergraduates. Finally, the role autonomous motivation plays in information
seeking effort and enjoyment were explored. The following chapter is presented in
sections organized around research questions with each section describing conclusions
based on analyses’ results and research implications.
5.1 RESEARCH QUESTION 1
Research question 1 was “What is the nature of information seeking motivation
of undergraduate students at the contextual level?” As discussed in the literature
review section, SDT is currently, one of the most accepted need based motivational
theories in psychology, which has also been extensively applied in educational setting
(e.g., Vallerand et al., 1992; Deci et al., 1991; Fortier et al., 1995) and received extensive
cross-cultural support (e.g., Deci et al, 2001). Undergraduate students’ information
seeking motivation was, therefore, investigated through validation of SDT hypothesized
motivational continuum by adapting and validating the Information Seeking Motivation
Scale (ISMS). The CFA analysis results suggest ISMS successfully captured
66

undergraduate students’ motivational spectrum, and has proven successful in capturing
all hypothesized forms of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation undergraduate students
exhibit while engaged in information seeking.
In the context of information seeking, the results imply that undergraduate
students approach research tasks for both controlled and autonomous reasons.
Students at the far end of the controlled motivational spectrum (i.e., external
regulation) engage in their research tasks as a way of avoiding negative consequences or
else to satisfy course requirements while those who are extrinsically motivated but
closer to autonomous motivation (i.e., identified regulation) understand the benefit of
acquiring research skills beyond the immediate project at hand and engage in research
in order to acquire skills necessary to be successful as students and in their future
careers.
Perhaps more encouragingly, students also displayed all forms of autonomous
motivation. The results suggest undergraduate students can and do experience
stimulation while researching which in turn motivates them to engage in research for
purely internal reasons. Similarly, students are also capable of experiencing a sense of
accomplishment and curiosity motivating them to engage in information seeking as its
own reward.
Moreover, these motivational orientations in undergraduate researchers
seemed to follow the SDT hypothesized continuum. Overall, all forms of intrinsic
motivation were more closely related to each other than to any form of extrinsic
67

motivation and all forms of extrinsic motivation appeared to be more closely related to
each other than to any form of intrinsic motivation. This finding not only provides
further validation for the scale but also underscores the division between engaging in a
research for the sake of successfully completing the research tasks such as finding
sources for required course papers (i.e. for controlled reasons) versus experiencing
research as an enjoyable activity driven by curiosity, sense of accomplishment it
engenders, and the intellectual stimulation it can provide.
These results are consistent with the findings of the AMS (Vallerand et al., 1992)
in most respects. Most notable difference was that the amotivation proved difficult to
assess with the ISMS, consistently negative skew and kurtosis excluding it from further
analysis. It should be noted that the students in the current sample had consistently
high grades therefore exhibiting high level of achievement which is inconsistent with
amotivation and this could account for the failure to successfully capture the construct.
In contrast with the AMS, the ISMS also found no statistically significant
difference in means in intrinsic motivational orientations (i.e., to know, toward
accomplishment and stimulation) between genders while the AMS reported slightly
higher intrinsically motivated females (Vallerand et al., 1992). External motivational
constructs introjected and identified regulation were also significantly higher for
females in the AMS study while the ISMS results indicated external, introjected and
identified regulation were significantly higher for males. While these results could be
impacted by culture, social constraints and demographics and varied slightly even

68

between French Canadian and English speaking samples across AMS validation studies,
it appears that male students might be slightly less intrinsically motivated in their desire
to attend college, and also might be more extrinsically motivated to engage in
information seeking once in college.
Practical implications of these findings are fairly significant. As discussed in this
study, previous research in other contexts (e.g., therapy and sports) not only
demonstrated the superiority of autonomous over controlled motivational orientations
in terms of wellbeing but also suggested that even though more stable than at
situational level, at the contextual level, they tend toward less stability than at the
global or personality level. Consequently, autonomous information seeking
motivational orientation needs to be cultivated and continually encouraged among
undergraduate students at academic institutions. In contrast, activities proven to
increase and induce information seeking controlled motivational orientations should be
avoided at all times. The ISMS, therefore, represents and invaluable diagnostic tool that
can be used to indicate when an intervention is necessary. Specific mechanisms
influencing students toward extrinsic and intrinsic motivation are addressed by the
second research question discussed in the following section.
5.2 RESEARCH QUESTION 2
Research question 2 was “What is the relationship between relevant basic
psychological needs as defined by the SDT (i.e., perceived competence and autonomy
support) and intrinsic information seeking motivation?” As discussed in chapter 2, Ryan

69

and Deci suggest and research confirms (e.g., White 1952 as cited in Ryan and Deci,
2000) that people engage in activities because they enjoy them rather than to increase
their sense of autonomy and once controlling elements are introduced their intrinsic
motivation is undermined and they tend to abandon the activity for a more enjoyable
task. Similarly, when the activity is perceived to be too challenging and the competence
felt during the activity is diminished, the intrinsic motivation is reduced and the activity
is abandoned for a task that more accurately matches the persons’ skillset.
Consistent with previous research, the results of the current study clearly
demonstrate there is a positive relationship between autonomous information seeking
motivational orientation and both information seeking perceived competence and
information seeking autonomy support. This relationship was particularly strong for
perceived information seeking competence. Clearly, students who feel more competent
in their research skills are more likely to engage in research for autonomous reasons.
This finding underscores the importance of bibliographic instruction for undergraduate
students as soon as possible. If the students are introduced to relevant research
sources and taught how to conduct successful searches their skills are more likely to
match their research needs and they will be much more likely to conduct research for
autonomous reasons.
However, it should be noted that the bibliographic instruction as currently
conceived at most institutions (i.e., as the so called “one shot” sessions) may not be the
best way to achieve the desired result. Autonomous motivation promotes feelings of

70

stimulation, curiosity and accomplishment and if the students learn more than enough
research skills to accomplish their research tasks, they will be much more likely to feel
less challenged and bored and abandon the task despite feeling competent. Therefore,
sustained information literacy efforts accompanied by strategic students’ skill
assessment are much more likely to aid students in being engaged by their research.
Perceived information seeking autonomy support also proved to significantly
positively impact autonomous information seeking motivational orientation. As
previously discussed, numerous studies in various settings and particularly in education
(e.g., Noel et al., 1999; Assor et al., 2005) demonstrate controlling teachers and other
authority figures significantly decreased students’ academic motivation. In the
information seeking context, this finding indicates group and individual bibliographic
instruction session should be designed in such a way as to promote critical thinking in
students. Namely, while it is certainly necessary to familiarize students (and this is
especially true of novice researchers such as undergraduates) with research databases
and other research resources, when it comes to exploring them to further students’
research goals less can be more. For instance, once databases are introduced and basic
research skills covered, instead of assigning specific research tasks as an in class activity
and focusing on research skills as a goal in itself, students should be encouraged to form
their own research queries with minimal intervention from their professors and
librarians. They should, however, be constantly encouraged to seek help if and when
they need it thereby gaining the necessary support.

71

5.3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS 3 AND 4
Research question 3 was “What is the relationship between autonomous
motivation and effort invested in information seeking?” and research question 4 was
“What is the relationship between autonomous motivation and enjoyment experienced
during information seeking?” One of the most striking and supported ideas introduced
by the SDT is that the autonomous motivational orientation can help sustain effort
invested in an activity. This is consistent with the organismic-dialectic perspective SDT is
anchored in. Humans are seen as growth oriented organisms moving toward mastery of
their environment while nurtured by support (i.e. basic need satisfaction) from it.
As discussed in the previous section, controlling environments result in
significant decreases in autonomous motivation which in term lead individuals to
abandon the activity or reduce effort invested in it. Extensive research in this area
confirms this finding in numerous settings from healthcare (e.g., Vallerand and
Bissonette, 1992) and environmentalism (e.g., Green-Demers, et al., 1997) to sports
(e.g., Chatzisarantis et al., 1997) and politics (e.g., Koestner et al., 1996). In education
setting, Ryan and Connell (1989) found that school children, when externally motivated,
not only expended less effort on their school tasks but also tended to show less
ownership over their results frequently blaming teachers for their failures to accomplish
tasks. The exception was introjected regulation which promoted effort but resulted in
considerable anxiety and reduction in wellbeing of students.
Current study, not surprisingly, demonstrates a similar link between the information
seeking autonomous orientation and effort invested in the information seeking. The
72

link was much stronger than the link between the basic need satisfaction and
autonomous motivation. In the environment where universities are struggling to reduce
dropout rates and increase the ranks of graduate students the implications of this
finding are clear. Fostering lifetime learning and producing scholars requires an
approach that encourages the development of autonomous motivation. According to
SDT, humans tend toward growth and are naturally curious and it would appear that the
institutions of higher learning need only encourage this natural tendency in order to
successfully guide students through their academic endeavors. Funding research
collections capable of exposing students to new and fresh ideas, and increasing the
ranks of librarians who can provide support for research are, therefore, crucial in
increasing student engagement in research.
Similarly, the link between enjoyment and autonomous motivation is inherent in
the concept of autonomous motivation (i.e., individuals engage in the activity because
they find it enjoyable rather than to pursue a goal or engage in it as a means to an end).
Moreover, autonomous motivation has proven to be instrumental in cognitive and
social development which, in turn, represent an essential source of enjoyment and
vitality throughout life (Ryan, 1995 as cited in Ryan and Deci, 2000). Therefore, the very
strong relationship between information seeking enjoyment and autonomous
motivation was unsurprising.
Fostering wellbeing and enjoyment in the information seeking activities is clearly
as important as information seeking effort. Indeed, research demonstrates there is a

73

clear link between wellbeing and enjoyment of the activity and the amount of energy
invested in the task (Nix et al., 1999). Since the link between the autonomous
motivational orientation and enjoyment has now been confirmed in the information
seeking context, and while this hypothesis was out of the scope of the current study, it
is likely that a link exists between information seeking enjoyment and effort. Currently,
libraries are experimenting with numerous initiatives in order to make research more
interesting to students. Library spaces are designed with extensive input from student
communities, bibliographic instruction activities are assessed in order to involve
students in the instructional design and reference services are approached in more
flexible ways intended to engage students on their own terms and away from
information desks. These efforts are commendable and need to be sustained in order to
foster the environment that supports students’ research activities in a way that is
enjoyable and likely to contribute to their lifelong engagement in research.
5.4 SUMMARY OF RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS
Current study represents a first step in the quest to understand undergraduate
students’ information seeking motivation at the contextual level. As previously noted,
information seeking literature in library and information science field, to date, focused
primarily on information seeking at the task level and while these studies provided
numerous information seeking models and provided rich understanding of students’
information seeking while engaged in a specific research task, the more stable and
general contextual motivational orientation operating at the domain level (i.e.,

74

education) was not addressed nor did any previous study differentiate between extrinsic
and intrinsic information seeking motivational orientations.
Additionally, although the focus of most motivational studies at the task level
centered on information seeking needs, the link between higher level basic
psychological needs and motivation went unexplored. Since, those needs play a large
role in students’ motivational orientation the current study represents a significant step
forward in understanding the antecedents of information seeking motivational
orientation in undergraduate students. Finally, while few studies in library and
information science explored affect in connection with information seeking during
research (e.g., Kuhlthau’s ISP Model), none were able to make empirical connections
between information seeking motivational orientations and information seeking effort
and enjoyment. Consequently, the current study is the first to provide a comprehensive
picture of students’ information seeking motivation from basic need satisfaction
through motivational orientations to effort and enjoyment.
The ISMS should prove an invaluable diagnostic tool for teachers and librarians
in evaluating students’ motivational orientation. Additionally, the causes of high scores
on extrinsic motivation continuum can be further investigated using information seeking
basic psychological need scales validated in the current study in order to plan successful
interventions. For instance, if students’ scores on information seeking autonomy
support are found to be low, research assignments could be reevaluated and revised to
include more positive language focusing on the research experience rather than grading

75

rubrics and points for specific tasks. Alternatively, if the information seeking
competence scores were found to be low, students could be encouraged to seek
research help from librarians or peers.
The information seeking enjoyment and effort scores in conjunction with the
ISMS scores demonstrating the link between intrinsic motivational orientation and
effort and enjoyment could be used by teachers, librarians and administrators as a tool
to encourage more institutional support for classroom environments that encourage
free thinking and mentoring.
The importance of encouraging intrinsic motivational orientation in students is
difficult to overestimate as study after study demonstrates detrimental effects of
extrinsic motivational orientation in various contexts. The current study confirmed SDT
applies in information seeking context. Therefore, by extension, extrinsically motivated
students are likely to feel alienated and passive and will be far less likely to take
advantage of any but most basic research sources offered by their institution. They will
be also less likely to explore new, ever evolving search features. Intrinsically motivated
students, in contrast, will be far more likely to experience the information seeking
process as a playful journey as they continue on the way to becoming lifelong
researchers. In the current social climate, where every professional needs to continue
perfecting skills in order to keep up with the changes introduced by evolving
technologies, cultivating internal (i.e. intrinsic) motivational orientation represents the
best way to ensure those research habits are lasting and eudemonic.

76

5.5 SELECTED PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
Given its focus on undergraduate students, the results of the current study are
very much applicable to a number of educational settings. Indeed, it would seem many
new classroom initiatives are compatible with the SDT framework and could benefit
from the findings of the current study. For instance, to address science teaching and
learning in large classroom environments, Student-Centered Active Learning
Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP) was developed at North
Carolina State University. The instruction in a SCALE-UP classroom centers on a
problem-based format in which students work collaboratively to make observations and
to analyze experimental results mirroring the scientific process. The process has since
spread to many other disciplines outside science and proved equally valuable.
While studies show students taught in SCALE-UP classrooms are better problem
solvers and demonstrate much higher success rates in additional science courses as well
as better understanding of underlying scientific concepts than students taught in
traditional lecture classrooms, in order to reap maximum benefit from this teaching
format, teachers would need to investigate the specific mechanisms that facilitate the
improvements. SDT based measurement tools developed in the current study can
provide the tools to accomplish that.
For instance, one of the most significant differences between SCALE-UP and the
traditional lecture environment is the collaborative nature of learning. If research on
assignments becomes collaborative in nature, it is likely that the stronger sense of
77

relatedness among students as well as increases in perceived research competence are
driving increases in intrinsic research motivations thereby producing increases in effort
and enjoyment.
Equally likely, teachers as facilitators of learning in a SCALE-UP classroom are
more likely to support students’ autonomy inside the classroom than would be possible
in the traditional lecture environment. However, until students are tested and baselines
established, the exact mechanisms and their consequences are difficult to pinpoint and
further improvements in students’ research skills are likely very possible. For instance, if
some students were shown to score lower on perceived competence, the assignments
could be modified to induce increases in those scores (e.g., research groups could be
assigned leaders and students with lower perceived competence scores could be
assigned leader/facilitator roles).
Distance education programs as currently conducted in most institutions of
higher learning could potentially reap even greater rewards from the application of SDT
measurement tools. While distance programs offer unprecedented access to education
for nontraditional students who can now attend classes on their own time schedule, or
students in remote geographic regions, unlike SCALE-UP classrooms, students attending
online classes have only limited interactions with their peers and instructors, especially
if the classes taught are asynchronous. Such learning environments are likely to induce
drops in relatedness scores but could also potentially affect students’ perceived

78

competence if the research guidance and feedback they receive as part of the course is
infrequent or seen as impersonal.
However, some students may thrive in such environments buoyed by the
increases in perceived autonomy support. Without conducting tests and administering
measurement instruments, it would be difficult to diagnose potential issues before the
end of the term when students’ lack of engagement would manifest in low quality
research assignments resulting in lower grades. To prevent potential issues, students
could be tested during the first month of the semester and interventions could be
implemented.
For instance, if the relatedness scores were found to be low, students could be
asked to participate in chatroom discussions sharing their research successes and ideas
for improvement with their peers thereby developing closer bonds with other students
in the course. If the perceived competence scores were found to be low in some
students, those students would be good candidates for extra attention and guidance
through the research process. Students with lower autonomy support scores could be
encouraged to find additional sources of their own choosing or assignments for the
course could be modified in such a way as to encourage students to tailor research
assignments according to their interests.
Gains in scores on any basic psychological need would be established by
conducting posttests at the end of the term. Lessons learned could then be applied to
future courses where additional improvements could be introduced and tested. The
79

iterative nature of the process would benefit the instructional design in number of
additional ways. For instance, new technologies promoting basic need satisfaction
during research could be identified and best ways of interacting with students in an
online environment inducing gains in intrinsic research motivational orientation could
be discovered.
5.6 FURTHER RESERCH RECOMMENDATIONS
The current study is the first study in information science to explore information
seeking using SDT framework and the area remains rife for exploration. The possibilities
are endless and the suggestions presented in this section are limited to most pressing
questions building on the current study followed by suggestions for additional
applications of SDT in the information seeking context.
Building on the current study, the ISMS should be tested on additional samples
to determine if the consistently negative kurtosis and skew of the amotivation construct
would improve or if subscale modifications are needed. Current study also found ISMS
to be invariant across gender but since nearly half of the sample consisted of freshmen,
invariance across academic status could only be tested between freshmen and upper
classmen. Further study needs to be done do determine if ISMS invariance for
sophomores, juniors and seniors.
In regards to next steps, research has shown that the effects of basic
psychological need thwarting result in significant reduction in autonomous motivation
and this remains to be explored in the information seeking context. Similarly, while the
80

current study clearly demonstrates the positive effect of autonomous motivational
orientation on information seeking effort and enjoyment, the effects of controlled
motivation remain unexplored. In contrast with autonomous motivation, controlled
motivation is hierarchical (i.e., appears on a continuum) and some forms (e.g.,
introjected regulation) have proven to have positive effect on effort invested in the
activity in the education context even if the enjoyment in the activity was compromised.
As discussed in the current study, goal content in SDT realm can be considered
extrinsic and intrinsic and what is pursued is as important as motives. In the
information seeking context, an important line of research would be to study the effects
of information seeking in pursuit of acquiring knowledge (i.e., intrinsic goals) versus
achieving success as a student or professional success (i.e., extrinsic goals) on students’
wellbeing. Finally, since the current study focuses on information seeking at the
contextual or domain level, situational information seeking motivation remains
unexplored. Scales exploring it need to be adapted and validated. This research would,
in turn, allow for connections between contextual and situational information seeking to
be empirically tested.
