The library and natural light have a unique relationship. The quantity and quality of
light within a space is an essential component to one's overall experience. When
libraries were initially established, they were directly dependent upon daylight to
operate. Because of this dependency, the design of libraries relied heavily on providing
adequate, but strategically placed openings for daylight to penetrate the space.
Contemporary libraries should not abandon the idea of designing with daylight in mind.
Furthermore, it can be used as an architectural medium to create a unique sense of
place. The experience of the user is enhanced when natural light is used to manipulate
the spatial quality of architecture. This thesis will explore how architecture can create
a sense of place by using natural light to inform design.

Preface
As a young child, I vividly recall being enraptured in storytelling time and always
wanting to sit on the mat closest to the window. It not only felt nice to be embraced by
the sunlight, but it allowed me to gaze to the beyond as my imagination roamed. Often,
the mood of the environment shaped my perception of what I read. The emotion of the
environment and the literature became a codependent entity.

The older I became the more I began to frequent public libraries. I often found myself
longing for an environment that had an undeniable sense of place. Somewhere that
enhanced my conscience state of being and became analogous to the emotions of
literature itself. Growing up in Baltimore, Maryland there was not a shortage of
libraries. However, the libraries that were close in proximity to me were very standard,
providing the necessities for a library but not necessarily pushing its architecture to
limits beyond the expected. Presently, there is a surge of contemporary libraries
currently being built; Baltimore City is a place that could greatly benefit from this
movement.

The library is a building type that serves as a beneficial aspect to a community,
providing a place to gather, explore, socialize, imagine, and learn. Depending on its
collection and program, it also serves as a place that attracts individuals from an array
of backgrounds that may normally not be in the same vicinity. The public library is a

ii

building type that is capable of creating place within a community—a place that
encourages exploration, imagination, and learning.

This thesis will explore how architecture can create a sense of place by using natural
light to inform design. The idea of place making and what it entails is objective. This
thesis will explore how a sense of place can be created in a public space by providing
an environment that promotes well-being, inspiration, and exploration. I will explore
how various qualities of light can be used to not only create mood, but also to be a
guide in telling the story of the building, making the building itself metaphorical
literature.

Chapter 1: Introduction
The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove, is
instead repelled by the darkness, creating a world of confusion where dark and light are
indistinguishable. Have not you yourself sensed a difference in the light that suffuses such a
room, a rare tranquility not found in ordinary light? Have you never felt a sort of fear in the
face of the ageless, a fear that in that room you might lose all consciousness of the passage of
time, that untold years might pass and upon emerging you should find you had grown old and
gray?1 Jun'ichirō Tanizaki In Praise of Shadows

The beauty of literature is that it has the ability to create moments of mental escape or
keen awareness. One's surroundings play a significant role in the perception of what is
being read and how information is digested. A significant element that aids in creating
perception is light, particularly natural light. Since the existence of libraries, an
interdependent relationship has existed between natural light and the library.

Before the invention of electricity, libraries' operational hours were directly dependent
upon the hours of sunlight in a day. Open flame and gas lighting methods were too
precarious to use around library material.2 Natural light has a connection to humans
physiologically as well, allowing it to create a sense of place that is unique to individual
spaces within a building, as well as a whole. Henry Plummer, an architecture professor,
published writer, and photographer, studies the relationship of natural light and
architecture. He stated, "Natural light carries the very inspiring energy—the vital
spark—which is the mainstay of all life on earth...The sun's rays produce an
illuminating earth into consciousness, opening flowers and setting birds to sing...".3
Plummer's statement alludes to the importance that daylight plays on the stability and
health of the mind and body. Daylight instinctively gives the cue to awaken. When
intentionally incorporated in architecture, it communicates a place of importance or a
desirable space for the user. The same space communicates something different just by
changing the way in which the main source of light is incorporated. Natural light has
the ability to create place and to define spaces within an enclosed environment that are
unique, giving the space its own language and mood.
A main purpose of the library should be to create an optimal level of consciousness and
connection to the medium that one is engaged with. The library should encompass an
atmosphere that one cannot readily access at home—it should have a purpose that it
can only fulfill, thus, sustaining its reason for being. There needs to be a well-defined
sense of place and an atmosphere that draws people to it. By using natural light as form

to define space, architecture has the ability to create a sense of place and redefine the
contemporary library.

When one thinks of form, often it is understood as something tangible or solid. In the
case of using light as form, form becomes something that is experienced beyond
physical touch. Form becomes something that is experienced or produced beyond the
physical structure of a material. Rays from natural light change throughout the day. Its
form has unique dynamics that require a preliminary level of understanding before it
can be designed with intention. An investigation of precedent studies that use light as
form, as well as theories by select architects will be dissected in order to understand its
psychological effects and design implications. Conclusions from these investigations
will be used to create architecture that uses light as a medium to captivate, stimulate
thought and imagination, and create a haven for the public to escape to, creating a new
outlook for what a contemporary library can be.

Chapter 2: Using Light to Create Place
Daylight and the Library
The public library is essentially a community center with various programmatic
functions including allowing access to books and reading material, storing and
protecting resources, and providing digital resources which all require different light
conditions. Book stacks need adequate but not direct light to prevent accelerated
deterioration. Reading areas require substantial light on horizontal planes, while

3

computer usage requires low, glare free light.4 At the fundamental level, library spaces
require unique light conditions that vary throughout the building. The light essentially
aids in defining the function of the space. Due to the distinctive role of natural light
within a library, special attention should be given to its design and how it penetrates
interior spaces.
Daylight Design Techniques
Various methods of daylight design techniques will be explored to determine the
methods that work best for the desired programmatic spaces. Ultimately, daylight
should be expressed purposefully and aid in telling the story of the building and
program.

In order to understand how light can create place, one must understand the basic
methods in which natural light can be introduced into a building. Aspects that become
critical are window placement, angles, and transparency. Some basic design
configurations will be discussed: light from above, light from vertical surfaces, surface
reflectance, and varying degrees of transparency and opacity. The research concerning
methods to control and manipulate daylight heavily rely on theory written by Nick
Baker and Koen Steemers. Baker is the Joint Director of the Martin Centre for
Architectural and Urban Studies at the University of Cambridge, and Director of
Cambridge Architectural Research Ltd. Steemers is a professor of Sustainable Design
at the University of Cambridge, an architect and environmental design specialist. Baker
and Steemers collaborated to write Daylight Design of Buildings, a book that

incorporates data gathered from an investigation of sixty buildings which functions as
a design manual to provide a more systematic approach to the principles behind
successful daylight design.

Light from Above
Light from above is widely known to come from sources such as skylights. One has
seen skylights since antiquity in buildings such as the Pantheon (known as an oculus
during that time) which incorporated an uncovered opening that allowed in rain and
sunlight. Skylights were important for large open spaces because it allowed natural
light to illuminate the space during a time when artificial light did not exist. Prior to
artificial light, the skylight was a prominent feature for library reading room design,
and is still being used in practice today due to its ability to bring in an abundance of
light into central spaces.

Roof-lighting can be configured in various way to distribute daylight in a specific
manner.

Figure 3 Summer Solstice Study of Sawtooth, digital render by author, 9 April 2016

Some common variations are flat, shed, dome, north light, sawtooth and monitor. Aside
from flat and dome, these configurations are orientation-sensitive. Flat and dome
shaped skylights emit direct daylight from above, thus, additional shading is needed to
minimize direct solar radiation.5

Light from Vertical Surfaces
Vertical window openings are also commonly used to bring in light. The shape,
position, and size of windows have a direct influence on the level of intensity and
distribution of daylight. One type of window layout used often is side lighting. The
most significant issue with this layout is daylighting is not distributed uniformly.

5

Baker 70.

6

Rooms with this configuration must place tasks that require a greater amount of light
closer to the window, such as reading, while other program features that require a lower
level of light may be placed further away, such as storage or circulation.6

Positioning windows higher provides a more even distribution of daylight. Thus,
building plans that have more depth benefit from window openings that are placed
higher on a vertical surface. This also leads to the idea of utilizing higher ceilings.
According to Baker, a simple rule of thumb is “the depth of useful levels of daylight
penetration is approximately twice the distance from the floor to the top of the window
opening, unless special daylighting devices are used.”7 For this reason, clerestory
windows are used for spaces that require deep daylight penetration because they are
placed at the highest level on a wall.8

The size of window openings introduces another element of control to consider.
Appropriate window size should relate to the internal illuminance required and typical
sky conditions for the area. It is also important to take into account the building’s
surroundings and the overall environment. The larger the window opening, the more
that heat loss, solar gain, and views outward become primary factors. It is important to
note that verticality is preferred over horizontality. Ribbon windows, for example, will
produce a poorer quality of light distribution than tall windows.9

Light from Reflectance
Reflecting surfaces are beneficial in spaces where limited window openings are
available. Vertical walls that are light in color are a good source for reflecting light.
Ceiling surfaces mainly reflect light that comes from below the horizon or indirect
reflectance from the ground, which branches into landscape design working cohesively
with the building’s surfaces and window openings.10 Internal surfaces also play a role
in light reflectance. Depending on the materiality of table tops and floors, sufficient
light reflectance from these surfaces bouncing to vertical wall surfaces can occur within
a room to illuminate the space. It is important to ensure that reflectance on interior
furniture and surfaces are not from direct sunlight because this will cause significant
glare.11

When roof-lighting is taken into account, the angle of the skylight opening has a direct
correlation to how light is reflected internally. For flat, shed and dome skylights the
thickness of the roof structure plays a direct role in bouncing the otherwise
predominately downward direction of daylight. The length of the reflective surface or
reflective reveal can be extended below or above the ceiling/roof surface for a higher
distribution of angled light reflectance. Furthermore, when a reflective reveal
incorporates a surface with intermediate luminance between the sky and the ceiling
soffit, it reduces contrast and glare.12

Shading Design of Light Sources
Window openings allow for daylight to penetrate the interior of a building and
naturally light the space. However, there are control issues that should be taken into
account for proper daylight design. The more windows within a structure, the more
opportunities arise for solar heat gain in the summer and heat loss in the winter.
Furthermore, shading devices should be incorporated in a way that does not sufficiently
impair daylighting conditions, thus relying primarily on artificial light. Too often
standard blinds are used to block sun rays and reduce heat gain, consequently causing
a heavy reliance on artificial light. Shading a space is achieved in numerous ways such
as tinted and reflective glass, fixed overhangs and light shelves, or retractable and
adjustable louvres, for example. Each system having a wide variety of physical forms
thus a wide variety in their visual impact.13

Tinted and Opaque Windows
In temperate climates, opaque screens and glazing is not very beneficial for optimum
daylight design performance. It reduces useful daylight just as much as it reduces
unwanted radiation. The benefits are equal to the obstructions, causing its use for
daylight design to be ineffective.14

Figure 5 Summer Solstice Study of Window with Light Shelf, digital render by author, 9 April 2016

Overhangs and Light shelves
Primary suitable and sufficient solely for south-facing or near south-facing windows
(in the northern hemisphere), the overhang obstructs the direct sunlight from the high
angle of the sun. When utilizing overhangs, it is important to remember in order to
illuminate the area of a room furthest away from the window, there must be a strong

10

ground-reflected component to bounce light to the ceiling and underside of the
overhang.15

Light shelves offer an additional reflective surface in conjunction with an overhang.
They effectively eliminate direct sun and reduce the daylight factor near the window
without reducing it towards the back of the room.16

2016.

This effect allows the room in its entirety to appear well lit due the decreased contrast
of daylight near the window compared to the remaining space. In other words,
lightshelves create a sense of daylight uniformity within the room. Light shelves should
not be considered as an efficient shading device on its own, and work best in
conjunction with other techniques.17

blinds,

shutters and louvres, color, size and
material play a significant role. If
using fabric blinds and curtains, light
colors have a better performance
because they reflect a large portion
of light and do not absorb as much
heat as darker colors. The issue arises
with the absorption of nonvisible radiation,

http://mcgrawimages.buildingmedia.com/CE/CE_images/2
010/Dec_ARedit_7.jpg

which will result in heat being
conveyed internally. Despite this

setback, light colors are still preferable to dark.18

Louvred shutters effectively block direct sunlight and allow ground-reflected light as
well as light reflected from the louver surfaces to penetrate within. The issue with glare
from the louver surface is solved by using darker colors on the shutters. Also, most of
the ground-reflected light bounces from the ceiling surface prior to illuminating the
work surface, further reducing glare.19

Light as Form
Natural light can be used as a medium to help define a space and create place. "For
centuries, architects have tried to grasp—and better control—the elusive ability of
natural light to create its own spirit of place when imbuing a building with mood,"20
according to Plummer. When this quality of light is achieved, it creates an atmosphere
that is unique to the space.

Materiality is an important aspect in creating mood and atmosphere with light. Light
and materials have a mutual dependency. Directly affecting the quantity and quality of
light through reflection and absorption, materials are a key component to understanding
light in architecture.21 Materials such as glossy finishes reflect light similarly to a
mirror. Surfaces such as wood, stone and plaster, or matte surfaces, reflect light
equally.22 The texture and color of a surface becomes important because certain
materials and tones reflect light differently and emit different moods. Simplistic
architectural forms and muted tones tend to give a uniform reflectance, thus, allowing
the light to clarify form and not the actual materials.23 Architects such as Louis Kahn
and Tadao Ando are known for using limited palettes of unadorned materials. This
technique allows the light and shadow to be the focus of the space.

Along the same lines of materiality and daylight mechanisms, various types of screens
or patterns may be used to reflect and cast light in a particular manner. The Seattle
Public Library by Rem Koolhaus, for example, uses a diagonal hatch pattern for its
structural glazing support to cast natural light in a way that gives the open space
character and a unique identity. An abundance of natural light is emitted, but the use of
the pattern allows the light to be muted in a distinctive way to make the space bright
yet comfortable.

The Nembro Library in Nembro Bergamo, Italy designed by the firm Archea, uses a

The exterior and interior of a building must work cohesively when designing with
daylight. A close study of proper shading mechanisms and materiality (interior and
exterior) is necessary because the characteristics of these features depend on factors
such as solar orientation, building height, and the desired amount of illumination for
each interior space.

Psychological Implications
Light plays a large role in creating the mood of a space. Exposure to natural light also
has positive effects on one's health and mental well-being. The mood of a public library
is important—it dictates the comfort of the user. There should be a sense of place that
is inviting, calming, and thought provoking which promotes the user's well-being.

Lack of exposure to natural light has a direct correlation to Seasonal Affective Disorder
(SAD). According to Dr. Mohamed Boubekri, a published author and professor at The
Illinois School of Architecture, "Daylight suppresses the production of melatonin and
fosters an alert state of mind by secreting serotonin...The less serotonin available in the
brain, the more severe is the depression and related symptoms."25 When individuals
work in environments that are deprived of natural light and rely largely on artificial
light, they are more likely to feel stressed and tired. The issue of providing adequate
natural light into a space go beyond including large windows—the effectiveness of
light from a window reduces the further you move away from the light source. Dr.
Boubekri goes further to state:
The high levels of daylight that people require are confined to the peripheral
area that is barely a few feet deep, normally not exceeding one and half times
height of the window. Daylight levels drop precipitously as one moves

the

away from

the window. Other more innovative solutions are needed to bring high levels of
daylight to the central areas of the building and to the area where the majority of
workers are located most of the day...[the solution] falls, therefore, on

to design buildings where daylight is plentiful throughout the building

interior, not

just the periphery.26

Techniques for reflecting daylight to incorporate deeper penetration, strategically
placed skylights, and placement of furniture become important when attempting to
provide users with adequate interior sunlight exposure, without providing light that is
too intense.

A series of studies incorporating each method of providing daylight, as well as various
combinations of these methods will be explored. Depending on the function of the
space and the quality of light that are required within it, proper shading mechanisms
become important. The goal is to provide thoughtful, strategic light into a library, while
maintaining proper quality control as well as incorporating poetic elements of light as
a catalyst to creating a sense of place.

Chapter 3: Precedent Analysis
A series of precedent analyses will be examined that support the fundamental aspects
of this project. Libraries that utilized the daylighting design techniques mentioned prior
will be discussed. The Seattle Public Library will be analyzed for its unique use of
exterior vertical and angular surfaces, the Mariners Harbor Branch Library for its rooflighting and clerestory technique, and the Tenley-Friendship Library for its use of fixed
louvres/fins.

The Seattle Public library is used as an example of how a patterned form of light is
used to give a space character and place. The comprehensive angular curtain wall
system is supported with a steel lattice structure while the vertical curtain wall system
uses deep aluminum mullions. The depth of these mullions aid in creating a more
prominent pattern of light and shadow.

The way in which the light penetrates the interior allows the users to
simultaneously be in light and shadow. This technique allows the large living room area
to be visually read as a single, large space. The absence of the patterned light acts of a
threshold to adjacent spaces. The curtain wall that encloses the space and other heavily
19

trafficked public areas is a triple-layer glazing system by OMA/LMN. It was given the
name of "metal glass" by OMA's partner Joshua Ramus because it is embedded with a
curved aluminum mesh in the outer air cavity and filled with krypton gas in the inner.
Custom-manufactured by the German firm Okalux, it covers approximately 50 percent
of the building, while the other half uses a standard double-layer glazing system. This
glazing minimizes glare and diffuses direct wavelengths of light into the reading
spaces.27

The structural support of the building is
integrated with the curtain wall system. It is
composed of load-bearing and seismic
systems. The lattice system that encompasses
the library connects the platforms of the
interior providing bracing. Both systems
create different means of support for the
curtain wall. Because the glass within the
glazing panels are comprised of vision glass,

solar heat gain during the summer was
combated by the use of an aluminum metal
mesh interlayer for areas that received a lot

of sun. the mesh contained mini-louvers that worked to shield direct sunlight while still
providing views to the outside. To maintain the appearance of bright glass on the
exterior, clear low-iron glass was used in front of the mesh with a 2mm airspace.28
The overall composition of the building’s envelope is to maximize daylighting
opportunities in communal areas like the 'living room' and the reading room. Heavily
used spaces such as meeting rooms, book stacks, and area with computers are more
shaded, eliminating glare and direct sunlight. The library also includes a sky lit atrium
to channel more daylight into the interior.29

Located in an area with rich maritime and oystering, the residents of Mariners Harbor
have strived for a library for decades. They had a desperate need to a space that invited
after-school support, job searching, computer and multimedia access and training, and
a communal gathering space, as well as the traditional function of a library—to gain
knowledge through read material. With the shell of the building referencing a cracked
oyster, the library is surrounded by dense foliage and residential and industrial blocks.
As another ode to the history of the area, the roof’s exterior is said to conceal “the
bright pearls of knowledge within.”30

The large use of glass within a small library were not met without skepticism, however.
Issues of too much daylight exposure and glare in the summer months were addressed
by the architects through strategic daylighting design. The glass on the east and west
elevations were patterned with frit and utilized Okalux’s Okasolar S
functional glass for the skylight glazing.31 Okasolar glass modules incorporate fixed
louvres in the cavity to direct daylight and protect against immediate solar radiation.32
The louvres’ function is to direct diffuse daylight well into the interior. The skylights
are used to trace the central circulation of the building, illuminating the open space
without producing glare and solar gain. The interior walls and floors are light in color,
providing an additional daylighting source via reflective surfaces.

The Surry Hills Library by FJMT is located in an inner-city suburb of Sydney,
Australia. It is situated in a community with various ages, income and cultural
backgrounds. Similar to inner cities of Maryland, the architectural context varies in
scale, types of housing, shops and commercial/retail spaces.33 The library is enclosed
by three roads to the south, east, and west. Transparency became a primary architectural
theme to invite and welcome the public—accessibility, openness and sustainability
were key values as well.34 The transparency and openness were achieved through
specific daylighting design methods: an open space and platform, a prismatic glass

The timber form is made from automated louvre systems that filter and control sunlight
but still allow views to the outside. It is lifted above the ground plane to create
transparency and accessibility below.36 The louvres are responsive to the daylight and
adjust accordingly in order to keep the interior daylight level comfortable.

Located in the environmental atrium is prismatic glass. Smooth on one side and ridged
on the other, this type of glass reflects the light that passes through and allows sunlight
to be directed towards the interior.37 Because it is located on the south façade, the

Chapter 4: Site and Program
Site
When selecting a site, the main factors of consideration were the surrounding urban
fabric, neighborhood density, demographics concerning race, age, and gender
(variables that dictate type of library usage), surrounding exposure to sunlight, and
public accessibility. My initial investigation into the location of site started globally,
however, because the library is a building type that relies on its immediate surrounding
demographics for program, a decision to stay local became ideal. Sites that currently

27

have existing libraries were investigated, as well as empty sites within underserved
communities. Two sites within Baltimore, Maryland were explored.

Baltimore has a rich history with libraries, particularly the Enoch Pratt Library system
that dates back to the late 1800s. Being one of the oldest free public library systems in
the United States, the first Enoch Pratt Library was erected on January 5, 1886.38
Currently, there are twenty-one branches open throughout Baltimore. Site one is an
existing Enoch Pratt branch that was established in 1916 within the South Clifton Park
neighborhood of East Baltimore.

Site Option A
Clifton Branch Library | 2001 N. Wolfe Street | Baltimore, MD 21213

The Clifton Branch library is currently open, and serving the community. However, it
has not been updated since the early 20th century; thus, its interior does not offer the
community the best light quality due to its old brick construction with limited windows.
The library is located on a residential block, with a church located across the street of
the south elevation. According to City Data statistics, the community has a relatively
low income with the median being $36,447 and 43.2% of residents below the poverty
level.39 There is no question that having a free public library is beneficial to this
community. Having up-to-date technology and constructing a contemporary library to

28

give the neighborhood a new outlook would reinforce the importance of the
community.

The current atmosphere of the Clifton Library's main reading space delivers a subpar
quality of natural light. The existing windows do not offer an abundance of daylight
into the space, causing the facility to rely heavily on artificial light. If this site were
chosen, new construction would be proposed—demolishing the existing structure.
Demolishing a building that is part of a historical branch system of libraries is an issue
of concern. This branch in particular was also funded and able to be constructed due to
Andrew Carnegie, further adding to its historical background.

Figure 20 Figure Ground with Quarter Mile and Half Mile Radius, by author, 23 April 2016

The Clifton Branch Library is immersed within a dense urban fabric, with a residential
neighborhood in its immediate surroundings. There is also a middle school and
elementary school nearby. Another observation of the site's surroundings is the
common building heights. The library, the adjacent church, and the apartment building
29

westward of the library are the tallest buildings and relatively the same height at
approximately twenty feet floor to ceiling. When a solar study was completed, it was
noticed that the library did not receive any casted shadow from the surrounding
buildings, which was seen as a positive attribute towards designing to maximize
daylight exposure within the building.

Figure 21 Clifton Branch Library exterior, photograph by author, 8 May 2016

Figure 22 Clifton Branch Library exterior, photograph by author, 8 May 2016

Upon initial investigation, the west facade of the building was the most beneficial area
for daylight exposure. Upon further solar studies of the interior using digital modeling,
bringing light from the roof structure above seemed to be the most plausible method.
The window configurations within the study models were taken from a precedent study
of the Ingleside Branch Library's reading room. Located in San Francisco and built in

location, were two factors which
contributed greatly to the outcome of

the different qualities of light produced by similar window apertures. For study b, the
skylight configuration was completely changed in size, orientation, and window type.
The new configuration runs longitudinal with the glass portion of the window, which
is fritted to create a subtle pattern. The southern facing window configuration remained
the same. By changing these simple elements alone, the overall quality of daylight
within the space improved from the existing. However, due to the history of the current
Clifton Park Branch Library, and the lack of neighborhood building type diversity, this
site was ultimately not chosen.

Figure 24 Map outline of Baltimore, Md, image by author, February 2017

Figure 25 Map outline of West Baltimore, Md, image by author, February 2017

32

The area chosen in west Baltimore is a multifaceted site with recent development from
the University of Maryland Baltimore as well as dense urban fabric comprised of
townhomes, rowhomes, churches and small retail spaces. Directly north of the site are
open plots of land void of development. Directly south of the site lies an elementary
school, while a high school is located north-west, just three blocks up.

Figure 26 Half Mile and Quarter Mile Site Radius, image by author, February 2017

Figure 27 Half Mile and Quarter Mile Site Radius with important context, image by author, February 2017

33

The site is also in close proximity to downtown Baltimore as well as historical
buildings and museum attractions. The surrounding context has potential to bring
visitors of the city to the library, become a meeting grounds for locals and tourists.
The site itself is relatively flat with no existing structure. It is adjacent to the recently
developed Maryland Forensic Medical Center which is part of the University of
Maryland BioPark. Although at the intersection on West Baltimore St and North
Schroeder St, traffic is not overwhelming or problematic. On weekdays from late
afternoon to early evening are the heaviest moments of traffic. The site is on the brink
of bustling downtown as well as a quieter residential area. It has the potential to
symbolically link the residential community of Poppleton and the surrounding
neighborhoods to the newly developed west Baltimore downtown region.

North of the site previously had townhome development. The current green spaces were
never as densely developed as the surrounding urban fabric, however. Over the years,
it appears that the buildings were progressively demolished along the east side of
Schroeder St, while the underdeveloped areas along West Baltimore St were developed
by the University of Maryland. Thus, the new development in this area has not been for
the community. The children of the elementary and high school do not have a library to
go to after school or the weekends that is in walkable distance. The elderly do not have
a pleasant place outside of their home to enjoy their favorite literature. The struggling
resident who has no computer has to find other means of searching for employment.
The neighborhood could greatly benefit from a public library.

34

Site option B does not seem to have a preferred architectural aesthetic, other than the
use of red brick. The commercial and retail buildings did not follow specific geometric

rules concerning the façade, nor did there seem to be a regulated height. The only
uniform attribute amongst the non-residential buildings were a clearly defined building
base. The context of this sites allows one to either follow the traditional red brick
aesthetic with a well-defined base or to create a unique aesthetic to the neighborhood
that adds additional character. Due to its dense urban surroundings, utilizing the open
green space south of the site to create pleasing landscape will be investigated as well.
The overall site allows various building forms and outdoor spaces that work cohesively
with the interior.

Program
The program of this branch library will combine the programmatic features of a typical
branch library with community spaces on the lower level. According to Planning the
Modern Public Library Building by McCabe and Kennedy, a five-step approach may
be taken to determine community needs as well as the time span in which the program
should be planned. An initial step would be to determine if the new library space is an
interim solution or a more long-term one.41 Space requirements have a crucial reliance
on that factor. Since this library is envisioned to have longevity, there will need to be
room for collection growth. Also, a way to accommodate changes in technology
(computers, multimedia stations) will be taken into account. It is also possible that the
book collection may shrink overtime to accommodate more digital references.

41

Gerard B. McCabe, and James R. Kennedy. "Early Planning for a New Library." Planning the
Modern Public Library Building. Westport, CT: Libraries Unlimited, 2003. 9-10. Print.

37

Another step is determining the library's plan of service and the supporting spaces.42
How large will the meeting room be? How many meeting rooms will be included? Will
they need additional storage? These are examples of supporting service spaces within
the program that need to be taken into account. Although this thesis will not delve into

Figure 34 Axon diagram highlighting library program, image by author, April 2017

the minor technical spaces of program, these questions still need to be taken into
account when appropriating the most logical total square footage of program.

42

McCabe 10.

38

Relationships of adjacencies is another aspect to note. After the above programmatic
issues were considered, the final building resulted in two levels. Level one consists of
the following programmatic spaces: a public café, multi-purpose community room,
computer lab, a small class/meeting room, a makerspace, the children’s collection, and
administrative services. The second level consists of: storage/archive space, the adult
collection, and the young adult collection. All program areas as well as the core
circulation comprise 35,010 square feet.

Design Conclusions
Each collection and major circulation corridor within the library will contain unique
qualities and typologies of light that will give each space a unique identity, while
creating the overall story of the building. Based on how each space will be used, and
the primary users of them, the typologies selected will aid in creating a sense of place
within the library as a whole.

Entry Sequence
As previously mentioned, the quality of light within each space is viewed as parts of
the building’s story. Because the entry sequence is the beginning and end, a dynamic
quality of light was chosen. Patterned light is a focal accent that is not only dynamic,
but has the ability to enhance spatial perception and awareness. This library has a main
entrance at the south façade, and a secondary entrance at the north façade. Both entries
utilize diffuse patterned light. This is achieved through a two-part building

envelope. The west façade is composed of a curtain wall system with diffuse panels of
varying degrees. There are also panels with shades of blue (color tinted glazing is used

43

sparingly and strategically in select areas of the library). The second layer to this system
is a series of Corten steel panels that have two functions: to block much of the harsh,
glaring western sun, and to create a second pattern layer. The Corten steel consists of
strategic cut outs to let sunlight in, as well as quotes and names of authors who were
either born in Baltimore or practiced literature in Baltimore. At the day progresses,
these quotes and patterns of light dance up walls and floors, spilling into the café area
as well as the second level corridor.

Children’s Collection
The children’s collection utilizes partially direct and indirect diffuse daylighting. This
combination allows the space to get adequate light without the producing too much
contrast which could become too stimulating or distracting for the users of the space.

Figure 43 Level One plan view highlighting children's area, rendered by author, May 2017

44

Figure 44 Perspective of children's collection, Jan 8am, rendered by author, May 2017

During the morning hours, the story-time area is spatially defined by the yellow and
blue tinted light reflecting from the east. As the day goes on, the indirect diffuse light

Figure 45 Perspective of children's collection, Jan 830am, rendered by author, May 2017

45

gives the overall space an atmospheric glow. The quality of light in the children’s
collection was meant to mimic the spirit of a child. Playful and active in the morning,

Figure 46 Perspective of children's collection, Jan 930am and 1030am, rendered by author, May 2017

and as the day goes on, and high levels of energy become exhaustive, the calm happens
before rest.

The quality of light is achieved in this space through large, floor to ceiling windows,
with varying degrees of diffusion and color. Some window panels are translucent to
allow the afternoon light from the north to become atmospheric. The windows located
on the north façade also cant outward to invite intimate slithers of light from the east
and west within the reading nooks.

Adult Collection
The adult collection takes a different approach. Catering to the needs of adult,
particularly in a place meant for reading, special attention must be paid to the quantity
of light in task related spaces. This space uses partially direct and spatially direct light.
The partially direct light is used to highlight circulation spaces. Within the reading
46

Figure 48 Perspective of adult carrel area, 12pm, rendered by author, May 2017

47

carrels, the light is controlled through repetitive façade elements that allow light to
reflect onto the floor, but not directly onto the reading surface. This ensures that the
users of the space do not experience unpleasant glare or become uncomfortable due to
heat gain. Users also have a personal view to the outside from lower windows, while
higher windows are used to daylight the entire area.

Figure 52 Perspective of adult reading area, June 3pm and 5pm, rendered by author, May 2017

The spatially direct light comes into place within the open reading area. A large skylight
is located above this zone, letting in diffuse shades of soft blue and white light. To
alleviate discomfort during and after noon, the skylight includes a double diffusion
system. The panels within the skylight are diffused. This diffused northern light reflects
off the interior surface within the depth of the roof, which then reflects through an
additional diffused panel, before entering into the space. The light from this skylight
remained contained with the circulation corridor and the reading space. Essentially, the
light acts of a threshold and spatial definer.

Young Adult Collection

The young adult space also utilizes spatially indirect light. This light is introduced into
the space through a primary skylight placed along the entry corridor, as well as a
smaller, hidden skylight located above the visible brick wall. The main skylight
functions to highlight the main circulation space as well as function as a clock.
Depending on the time of day, the light will highlight specific areas of the corridor.
This skylight also uses a double diffing system and color tinted panels.
50

The hidden skylight above the brick one is realized only due to the yellow hue of light
that splashes down the wall. The more intimate spaces are daylit from side windows,
which, similar to the children’s collection, have varying degrees of diffused panels and
tinted glass. The windows along the north façade always cant outwards and are a
continuation of the windows on the lower level within the children’s area.

Conclusion
Together, the library works in harmony to create its own unique story and sense of
place. It becomes a beacon to the community, and an amenity that currently does not
exist. On a typical spring afternoon, upon arriving, one would be greeted by the
welcoming entrance that speaks to the user with light, reminding them that they are
entering a place of creativity, knowledge, and exploration. The patterned light from the
entry way will seep into the open café where one can read and enjoy a bite to eat, before
exploring the upper level. Once upstairs, the space pulls the user in before opening
them back out into the space. The spatial light from above acts as a pathfinder to the
reading space, the stacks, or the carrels. The light guides one’s experience, creating a
place that encourages reflection. Through the use of natural light, this public library
gives this community the sense of place it once lost.
