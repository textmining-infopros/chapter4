Abstract
Academic libraries in the 21st century are in the midst of constant and tumultuous change caused
by advances in technology, shifting demands of faculty and students, declining budgets, and
transformations in publishing and in other methods of acquiring scholarly research. Librarians
working in this environment must cope with continuous change while still providing research
support to their primary clientele - faculty and students. The objective of this dissertation was to
determine which competencies library directors and senior managers should possess to guide
their organizations through the current turbulent climate of constant change, and to lead their
organizations into the future. An evidence-based systematic review of the literature revealed that
competencies associated with transformational leadership were highly valued by academic
librarians in an environment of rapid change. Similarly competencies associated with emotional
intelligence were highly valued attributes in library directors and senior managers. The research
found that leadership and management competencies had universal application regardless of
profession. Only knowledge-based competencies associated with a profession were not of value
in other fields. Strategies for dealing with radical change such as organizational development,
systems thinking, appreciative inquiry, creating a learning organization, re-organization of staff,
and the frequency and use of library services assessment were found to be tools used by library
directors and senior managers to lead academic librarians through a change initiative. Finally,
organizational climate and changing the climate were often the focus of library directors as they
sought to diminish resistance to change among academic librarians.
Keywords: leadership, competencies, leadership competencies, academic libraries, library

Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. G. David Andersen, Dr. Eric B. Dent,
and Dr. Deborah M. Wharff for their assistance with this dissertation. Dr. Dent, your research on
resistance to change helped me to focus my approach to this dissertation. Special thanks to Dr.
Andersen who was my primary adviser through the entire dissertation process. He was always
positive - encouraging me through the roadblocks, assisting with his incredible skill in APA
formatting, and goading me on to my best writing efforts. His herculean labors in reading,
commenting on, and rereading all the various versions of this dissertation will always be
appreciated. I would also like to thank Dr. John Sherlock for his invaluable research methods
course. Before taking your class I really had no idea about how to do a systematic review or what
was involved in evidence-based research. What I learned in your course helped me
immeasurably as I proceeded with the last four chapters of my dissertation. Also thanks to Dr.
Diana Watts and Dr. Thomas Mierzwa for their guidance in writing two journal quality articles
in my final two content courses.
I am especially indebted to my expert panel members, the subject matter and practitioner
experts, who served as panelists to provide feedback on my dissertation: Dr. Ronald Riggio, the
Henry R. Kravis Professor of Leadership and Organizational Psychology at Claremont McKenna
College, for his expertise on leadership competencies and his suggestions on creating a library
leadership competency model; Dr. Lynn Baird, the Dean of Library Services at the University of
Idaho, for her suggestion to add a new section on current and future library challenges to the
Introduction of this dissertation; and Dr. Anne Marie Casey, the Director of the Hunt Library at
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, for pointing out several areas which needed revision and
also suggesting a dissertation that was relevant to the topic. Finally, Dr. Jon Cawthorne, the Dean

of Libraries at West Virginia University, for his encouragement and for suggesting the
importance of discovery systems to the library of the future, and his suggestions as to revising
the research propositions.
Last but certainly not least, I would like to thank the members of my cohort, my
classmates and now friends, who went through this journey every step of the way with me. There
is no way I could have gotten through this process without their support and encouragement. I
looked forward to every residency so we could gather for dinner and late night conviviality
where we would discuss our trials, tribulations, and successes. I would especially like to thank
Holly Cicconi-Eggleston, Steve Fritts, Wanda Wagner, and Cheryl De Vose for their collegiality
and support. Although there will be no more residencies I hope we will remain friends well into
the future. I especially look forward to seeing you all at graduation!

Dedication
I dedicate this dissertation to my parents John and Elizabeth Lewis. Although my father
did not live to see this dissertation completed it is thanks to his financial support over many years
of schooling that I was able to complete this work. I am also grateful to my father for the many
years of life lessons he provided. His work ethic, perseverance, and fortitude are the model I
have tried to live my life by. I would especially like to thank my mother as the person who
instilled a life-long love of learning in me. Although she was unable to attend college she was
intelligent, curious, and a lover of libraries. From the time I was two years old and she taught me
to read using flash cards with words and pictures she hand drew she has always espoused the
value of education and learning. Without her support and constant encouragement I would never
have been able to complete this dissertation.
I would also like to express my profound gratitude to my life partner, Arlene, for her
unqualified support of my doctoral studies and her invaluable assistance with proofreading,
Table of Contents construction, and APA formatting. Mostly I would like to thank her for putting
up with my short-temperedness, frustration, inattention, distraction, and overall crankiness for
the past three and a half years as I tried to complete my classwork and dissertation. I hope these
traits will disappear now that I am less busy, but I will probably still be, at least occasionally,
cranky. Lastly, I would like to thank, Chloe the Wonder dog, for all her companionship during
the long evenings I spent studying, researching, and writing. Without fail she would squeeze up
next to me in the recliner long into the night, keeping me company, snoozing, or occasionally
poking me with her nose, or putting her paw on my keyboard to let me know it was time to go
for a walk. Chloe, there will be plenty of time for walks and ball playing now!

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE RELATED LITERATURE
Introduction and Background

Academic libraries have been involved in a process of continuous change over the past
thirty years due to the impact of technology on all aspects of librarianship. From the automated
card catalog, CD-ROM databases, web based database searching, remote off-campus access,
streaming video, downloadable e-books, and patron driven acquisition (PDA), advances in
technology have continually affected and changed the way librarians perform their jobs. These
technological advances have created numerous pressures on librarians ranging from constantly
shifting job responsibilities and job descriptions to frequent library reorganizations. Another shift
has been the move toward the hiring of non-professional staff with technological expertise to
replace Master of Library Science (MLS) and Master of Library and Information Science
(MLIS) degreed librarians. This replacement of competent, highly trained librarians with
inexperienced, lower cost technology workers is a cost-saving measure for the library budget, but
may result in less effective service to faculty and student library patrons (Murfin & Bunge,
1988). While skilled in technology, these workers do not have expertise in database searching
and lack the ability to provide library instruction to inexperienced library users such as
undergraduate students (Dinkins & Ryan, 2010).
Other issues facing academic libraries include declining budgets and rising costs due to
information proliferation. Academic library budgets have remained flat or decreased while
expenses for journals, books, and online databases have continued on an upward trend. Research
sponsored by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) found the percentage of universities’

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

2|Page

funds devoted to academic library budgets shrank for the fourteenth straight year in 2009
(Kolowich, 2012). Library budgets are now less than 2 percent of overall university budgets
compared with 3.83 percent in 1974 (Kolowich, 2012). The fiscal crisis of 2007 -2009 dealt a
blow to many library budgets as universities slashed spending in response to the crash of their
endowments (Casey, 2011). At the same time these challenges are being experienced, academic
libraries also face increased demand for their services as they offer a diverse array of services,
attracting more and more users (Reed, 2012).
The pace of change in academic libraries will not moderate but only accelerate in the
future. If librarians are unable to cope with these issues it is not inconceivable that academic
libraries, once the center of the university, could be threatened with extinction (Lewis, 2004).
While it is important for libraries and librarians to change in order to remain relevant in the new
millennium, leading such a change successfully is a complicated and difficult process. The
challenge is to determine which competencies the next generation of library leaders must possess
to successfully lead and implement these changes.
The Disruptive Innovation Era
The OPAC. Libraries remained hierarchical organizations well into the 1960’s. The
major shift in academic library management organization was the direct result of technological
advances. The introduction of the computer to the library workplace was the type of “disruptive
innovation” discussed by Christensen (2003) in his seminal work “The Innovator’s Solution.”
The catalyst for change was the introduction of computer based research and work processes.
Academic libraries adopted two new technologies which changed the workplace for librarians:
first the online public access catalog (OPAC), followed by the CD-ROM database. The OPAC
changed the way patrons located print materials, primarily books, in the library. However, it also

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

changed the way librarians performed their duties. Technical services librarians, primarily
catalogers, had to adapt to changing standards and methods of cataloging. Computerization of
cataloging led to the eventual creation of the Ohio College Library Center which eventually
became the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC). While this was a boon for both patrons
(standardized cataloging procedures and computerized searching capabilities) and academic
library budgets (decreased cost of cataloging), it was also the death knell for the position of
professional library cataloger. As far back as 1971, the effects of this shift were felt when the
Alden Library of Ohio University was the first academic library to adopt shared cataloging. The
OCLC website states “the first year it used the shared cataloging system, Ohio University
increased the number of books it cataloged by 33% while reducing its staff by 17 positions
through attrition” (OCLC Annual Report, 2011, p.18).
Effect of the OPAC on technical services departments. In the subsequent forty years
since this event, academic libraries have decreased their technical services departments
substantially usually through early retirements and library reorganizations or with position
description revisions (Peak, 2008; Reed, 2011). Technical services departments in large
academic libraries that once employed twenty to thirty professional catalogers now have one or
two. Many smaller academic libraries do not employ a professional cataloger at all, instead
relying on copy cataloging by non-professionals. This has resulted in a cost savings for the
library budget but a decrease in the level of detailed and standardized cataloging provided to
assist the library patron. As Ostrow (1998) stated “formerly strong functional units either no
longer exist or have been so depleted of staff members and influence as to no longer really count
as units at all; if they do qualify as units, they have been de-professionalized to the extent that
they are excluded from serious consideration” (p. 192-193).

Along with this shift in library work flow came a shift in the library work environment.
Academic libraries, especially those of larger size, began to move away from a hierarchical
model of organization to more fluid models. The team based model of organization became
increasingly popular in the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties (Shaughnessy, 1996). This
change resulted in several innovations including: the creation of specialist positions such as
systems librarian which were of higher status and pay grade; and the removal of the middle level
of management such as department heads and assistant directors (Bloss & Lanier, 1997;
Feldmann, Level & Shu Liu, 2013). Such changes occurred at a slower pace in smaller academic
libraries where the team based model of organization was slower to be integrated.
Although the team based model of organization resulted in a democratization of the
library work environment, it also created a situation where there was no buffer (middle
management) between the rank and file librarian and the library director. This resulted in several
issues especially when initiatives, such as changes to library work flow and processes and library
reorganizations, took place. Poor communication and weak leadership behaviors practiced by
some library directors created an environment of fear where librarians were unaware of changes
being planned except though vague and unsettling rumors. Ostrow (1998) described the typical
environment such a change initiative created in an academic library in her qualitative dissertation
which utilized in-depth interviewing and participant observation. “The individuals so affected,
shunted to the outskirts of the organization, react with confusion and sorrow. They feel alienated
from their colleagues in other divisions” and don’t feel a part of the team (Ostrow, 1998, p. 192193). Library reorganizations often resulted in job descriptions and job titles that made no sense
even to those who held them.

CD-ROMs and online databases. The second disruptive innovation that affected
academic libraries was the introduction of the CD-ROM database. The effect of this technology
was slower to be felt. Although CD-ROM databases were an improvement over the old print
indexes they also had several issues. CD-ROMs had to be run over a network which was often
unreliable; they also could not be updated very easily. The real innovation was the introduction
of online databases. By the late 1990’s the majority of academic libraries had switched over to
online access of databases (Kenan, 2012). This solved the two issues associated with CD-ROMs
– unreliable networks and updating of information. The only issues associated with online
databases were the speed of Internet connection and the user friendliness of the database
interface. In the last decade both of these issues have been solved – most libraries access the
Web through an Internet 2 connection and online databases have become increasingly more
Google-like (Hicks, 2007; Peak, 2008).
Effect of online databases on public services departments. While online databases are
a boon to library users – allowing twenty-four hour off-campus access to information and
making research much easier - they have also been the cause of the second wave of deprofessionalization in the library field. Like catalogers, those involved in the public services side
of the academic library are now undergoing a similar wave of deprofessionalization. The
removal of Reference Desks and the replacement of well-trained, professional Reference
librarians with support staff are well underway in the 21st century academic library (Kenan,
2012; Peak 2008). “Due to budgetary constraints, paraprofessionals now staff the reference desk
in many academic libraries” (Osa, 2003, p. 38). Given the past history of library change, it is not
unreasonable to expect that the academic library of the 21st century will mostly employ college
graduates with some level of technological expertise (Kenan, 2012).

As Day (1998) pointed out the benefits of this replacement of professional librarians with
paraprofessionals are mainly touted by academic library administrators “for their own discourse
communities and reflects managerial control ideologies” (p. 654). There is no discussion of the
effect this replacement has on service to faculty and students who frequent the library for
research assistance. Since these paraprofessionals have no formal training in either instruction or
proper methods of database searching, it logically follows that research assistance will be less
effective. The placement of paraprofessionals on the Reference Desk was once controversial.
McKinzie (2002), a social science librarian, authored an article in which he claimed the use of
paraprofessionals to provide reference service was unethical under the Code of Ethics of the
American Library Association. The code “specifically mandates providing the highest level of
service to all library users and that certain responsibilities of the profession should only be
carried out by certified members of that profession” (p. 42). McKinzie’s article was followed by
several articles authored by library directors which claimed his position was elitist. However,
McKenzie (2002) pointed out that paraprofessionals providing reference service was part of a
“national trend toward cost-cutting, reprehensible to those in our ranks who value the needs of
our users more than economy” (p. 42).
There have been few studies that compared the quality of service provided by
paraprofessionals in comparison to that of trained reference librarians. Murfin and Bunge (1988)
investigated the level of patron satisfaction with reference service and found that professional
reference librarians scored significantly higher both in information provided and quality of
service given than did paraprofessionals. This research was the most in-depth look at reference
services ever attempted and included thirty-three academic libraries. They found that “more
patrons of paraprofessionals indicated that they did not get enough help and explanation, that the

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

explanations were not clear, that the staff did not appear to be knowledgeable about the question,
and that staff did not give them enough time” (p. 12). Dinkins and Ryan (2010) looked at the
types of questions asked at the Reference Desk and found that not only did trained reference
librarians spend a significantly longer amount of time answering each question; they were also
approached with questions at a much higher rate than paraprofessionals.
Current and future issues for academic libraries. New issues for academic libraries
were created by the global economic collapse which occurred early in the 21st Century. Many
college and universities suffered severe downturns in their enrollments and reacted by slashing
their library budgets. The effect of these cuts plus the continuing increase in technology related
expenses put many academic libraries in an untenable position. Either material or personnel costs
had to be slashed or in some cases both areas suffered cuts (Nicholas, Rowlands, Jubb & Jamali,
2010). Other issues also exist which will effect academic libraries well into the future.
Knowledge revolution. The knowledge revolution occurring throughout the entire
developed world is also impacting academic libraries in a significant way. As Cohen (2014)
points out, “a process is well underway in which centuries old intellectual hierarchies are being
overturned, and considerable amounts of academic de-skilling is taking place” (p. 1). While the
library was traditionally considered to be the “heart of the university” that is no longer true,
today, the Internet and Google reigns supreme (Cohen, 2014). Students and faculty don’t need
the library to perform research they can access the Internet from their offices, homes, and dorm
rooms. Academic libraries spend thousands of dollars on databases to support scholarly research,
but many students don't use them or use them without realizing the library budget and their
tuition is paying for them. “People no longer use libraries shaped and curated by librarians, the
generation entering universities today is more comfortable with digital than traditional sources of

information” (p. 1). The knowledge revolution has created an overabundance of readily and
easily available information. Students can now perform research in minutes that would have
taken a scholar many days to perform just a few decades ago. However, providing access to
reliable digital information is expensive. The digital revolution and the accompanying high costs
of innovation have negatively impacted library budgets and will continue to do so well into the
distant future.
Attitude of college/university administration toward the library. In the past university
administrators took great pride in their libraries. The quality of a research institution was often
judged on the size of its collection. The change to digital information has de-emphasized the
importance of collections to a university. This de-emphasis of print collection importance has
caused a shift in the attitudes of presidents and provosts toward their libraries. The library is no
longer immune to budget cuts and must compete with other academic units for scarce resources.
“Although leaders recognize the symbolic value of the university library, it is the functional role
of the library in service to the university’s mission that ultimately garners budgetary support”
(Lynch, Murray-Rust, Parker, Turner, Walker, Wilkinson & Zimmerman, 2007, p. 213-14).
Library directors need to utilize new strategies and present evidence of support of the research
and teaching mission of the university in order to keep or increase their library budgets.
Librarians need to promote “contributions to the academic environment and student life such as
reliable, ubiquitous access to virtual resources, and inspirational spaces for study and reflection,”
(Lynch et al., 2007, p. 222). Debates between administrators and library directors as to the role
and importance of the library to the university are not uncommon. On occasion library directors
have ended up on the losing side of the argument and have been terminated (Straumsheim,
2014).

Leadership crisis. The library profession is aging and many librarians will be retiring in
the next decade. As of 2005 more than 56% of credentialed librarians were over the age of 50
(Davis, 2009). It is estimated that 40% of the librarians working in the profession in 2007 will
retire by the end of 2014 (Sheardown & Woroniak, 2007). Estimates using an average age of 65
for librarian retirements finds that over 45% of librarians will retire between 2010 and 2020
(Davis, 2005). This could result in a shortage of qualified librarians as accredited library science
schools will be unable to graduate enough students to fill those positions (Davis, 2005). Of
course, this assumes that retiring librarians will be replaced with MLIS qualified librarians which
may not occur. Frequently when librarians retire they are replaced with paraprofessional staff
with IT expertise. The situation is even more acute in the management area. There already exists
a shortage of qualified candidates for open library director positions. At the 2009 Taiga Forum,
an annual meeting of assistant library directors, it was projected that 20% of ARL library
directors would retire by 2014 (Galbraith, Smith & Walker, 2012). Many librarians prefer not to
become involved with administration preferring to work on the front lines. Also many younger
librarians have left the profession dissatisfied with the low pay and stressful work environment
(Rathbun-Grubb, 2009). In addition to their other effects, library budget cuts also impact the
ability of academic libraries to create leaders from within the library – professional development
opportunities dry up when funding for travel to conferences and for training is curtailed (Camille
& Westbrook, 2013).
In this atmosphere of rapid change, determining which competencies are most important
for success as an academic library director can provide a roadmap for institutions of higher
education as they seek to replace the current generation of library directors. The competencies
necessary to lead academic libraries into the future may not be possessed by librarians but rather

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

10 | P a g e

by those in another field. In order to determine this, it is necessary to discover which
competencies are most important now and which are likely to be most important in the future in
this ever changing environment.
Statement of the Problem
Possession of important leader competencies can be a vital component of change
management. Librarians are highly educated, skilled knowledge workers who are dedicated to
their profession. Richard Florida, a well-known urban planner, considers librarians to be part of a
“super-creative core” along with those engaged in the arts, architecture, education, engineering,
computer, and mathematical occupations (Florida, 2003, p. 8). Florida believes these occupations
share a common ethos through their economic function of creating new ideas, technology, and
content; this super-creative core values creativity, individuality, difference, and merit (Florida,
2003, p. 328). Future library leaders must possess and use the proper competencies which can
engage and motivate this unique group of knowledge workers. Leader competencies will be a
vital factor in determining whether current and future change initiatives are successful at keeping
academic libraries relevant in the higher education landscape.
Significance of the Problem
The issues facing academic libraries in the 21st century are unprecedented and
momentous. Without the proper direction and leadership, it is conceivable that both the academic
library as place and the position of professional librarian could disappear. Will the library as
place become nothing more than a large building with many computers used as a twenty-four
hour study hall? Will professional librarians with their training in promoting access to
information (cataloging), assisting users with finding relevant information (reference), and
teaching users the best methods of finding relevant resources (instruction), be replaced with

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

11 | P a g e

lower paid, technological workers who are familiar with Microsoft Office, tweeting, Facebook,
and Google? The academic library and librarians are at a crossroads; changes are needed to keep
the academic library relevant in the 21st century, but there is little agreement over which changes
are necessary.
Today’s students are in need of the assistance of skilled librarians more than ever before.
The information explosion of the last few decades has created mountains of data, but few of the
current undergraduate and even graduate student population have the skills necessary to wade
through this mountain of information. Most students are content to plug a few keywords into
Google and pick out a few hits from the top ten results. While Google is a useful tool there are
many more valuable resources available to students. Numerous full-text databases, scholarly
repositories, and e-book collections exist that offer much more scholarly content than that
available freely on the Internet. Yet many students ignore or are unaware of this treasure trove of
information available at their fingertips.
The job of the academic librarian is to assist students and faculty in locating and using all
the information available in the 21st century library. Unfortunately, in many academic libraries,
this assistance is disappearing. Trained librarians who sat at the Reference Desk and assisted
users with their information needs are replaced with nonprofessional workers who have an
information technology degree. In order to maintain its importance in the future the academic
library must be more than a study hall that has coffee, snacks, and computers with Microsoft
Office; the campus library must be integrated into the teaching and learning mission of the
university as a whole. This dissertation is about finding the appropriate leader competencies that
will enable libraries to survive, and assist librarians to remain relevant and more productive not
just in the next year, or decade, but into the 22nd century.

Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this dissertation is to determine through scholarship and research which
leadership competencies are most important for future library directors as they guide academic
libraries into an uncertain future. These competencies are also vital in assisting librarians to cope
with the constant change initiatives often mandated by rapid technological change and other
outside factors affecting the academic library environment. Academic library directors and
project leaders often focus on the short-term issues: what is the latest managerial fad; what is the
newest technological buzz; what is hot with the millennial student today? What is needed is a
long term approach: how to solve the issues and problems facing the academic library in the
foreseeable future. What are the best services that the academic library can offer to assist faculty
and students with their information needs? What are the best resources to assist these users: are
they print or electronic, downloadable or stream-able, in-person or remote, free or
entrepreneurial, physical or virtual? How do libraries remain vital to the educational process, and
how do library director’s best tap into the expertise, knowledge and skill of the librarians whom
they direct? How can library staff be most effectively managed? What is the effect of differing
leadership competencies in the academic library environment? The objective of this dissertation
is to assist library directors, librarians, and university administrators in discovering best practices
for leading the academic library through this period of tumultuous change into the future.
Importance to Management
This dissertation deals with two areas that are of great importance to management:
competencies that lead to successful supervision; and the impact of those competencies on
employees in an environment of continuous change. In the last few decades, as technology has
increasingly impacted the workplace, best practices for leading employees through change

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

13 | P a g e

initiatives have become increasingly common. As a new millennium is entered and the pace of
change accelerates and becomes more continuous, the importance of determining the best
competencies for assisting followers in these transitions is even more vital.
Although change is a heavily studied area in management, definitive answers to change
management questions at times seem to be elusive. Despite many studies having been conducted,
the research in this area can at times appear to be muddled and contradictory. This dissertation is
one systematic effort to un-muddy the waters by applying the tenets of evidence-based research
to these questions. A systematic review of the literature will be utilized to bring more clarity to
these issues. Although this dissertation will focus on the competencies necessary to lead
librarians dealing with the impact of continuous change, the findings should be of value to many
scholars and practitioners in the field of management.
These issues are also of great import to the field and profession of librarianship. A
systematic review of the library literature will serve two purposes: well-researched areas can be
synthesized to assist library practitioners in their efforts to guide academic libraries through
continuous change, and areas devoid or lacking in research can be highlighted to assist authors in
identifying topics that are still unexplored. It is also a goal of this dissertation to bridge the gap
between library practitioners and scholars. A “communication gap” between the two groups
exists and this dissertation is an attempt to bridge the divide by providing both “practical
outcomes of the research process, and to expose practitioners to the theoretical aspects” of
research (Booth & Brice, 2004, p. 57).

Research Question
Which leadership and management competencies are most vital for library directors and
senior managers to possess as they lead their organizations through the current uncertain climate
into the future?
Definition of Terms
Academic Librarians: Academic librarians are those library employees who have obtained a
Masters in Library Science or a Masters in Information Science and quite often a second
Master’s degree in a subject discipline. Occasionally some academic librarians also possess a
doctoral degree in a subject discipline as well.
Academic Library: An academic library is a library associated with a college or university which
supports the mission of the institution and the research needs of its faculty, staff and students.
Most academic libraries consist of a physical space (usually quite large but on occasion as small
as one room) and a staff of librarians and other employees that manage the building and its
collections. Bookless academic libraries are beginning to emerge. Florida Polytechnic University
and the University of Texas, San Antonio have both recently migrated to completely digital
libraries (Rise of the Bookless Library, 2014).
Academic Library Director: An academic library director is the person designated by an
institution of higher education to manage a library building and its staff. Depending on the size
of the institution and library this person may be designated a director, dean, provost or vicepresident.
Appreciative Inquiry: An approach in which the leader identifies the unique strengths and
qualities of an organization rather than identifying the problems. “The spotlight is on isolating
what is good about the organization and making it better, rather than on laying blame with the

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

15 | P a g e

resultant defensiveness for various problems that may have surfaced” (McKenna, 2012, p. 591).
Appreciative Inquiry is often used to promote change by highlighting the organizations strong
points rather than emphasizing the weaknesses.
Assistant/Associate Director: A library staff member ranking next to the library director in a
library who has broad administrative authority over a particular part or parts of the library’s
activities and operations (Bailey, 1992).
Competency: “Competencies are the combination of knowledge, skills, and abilities which are
relevant in a particular job position and which, when acquired, allow a person to perform a task
or function at a high level of proficiency” (Osa, 2003, p. 37). “To be useful, the competencies
must relate to the organizational goals, objectives, and strategies; they are the knowledge and
skills that make the organization a success and help the organization change to meet a changing
environment” (Giesecke & McNeil, 1999, p. 159). Wallick (2002) defined competencies as “an
area of knowledge or skill that is critical for producing key outputs; the internal capabilities that
people bring to their jobs or capabilities which may be expressed in a broad, even infinite array
of on-the-job behaviors” (p. 392).
Emotional Intelligence: Emotional intelligence “can be defined as the ability to perceive and
express emotions, to use emotions to facilitate thinking, to understand and reason with emotions,
and to effectively manage emotions within oneself and in relationships with others” (Northouse,
2013, pp. 28-29). It is a leadership attribute often associated with transformational leadership.
Learning Commons: More than a static computer lab a learning commons incorporates “wireless
communication, flexible work-space clusters that promote interaction and collaboration, and
comfortable furnishings, art, and design to make users feel relaxed, encourage creativity, and
support peer-learning” (Sinclair, 2009, p. 505). It may also include “self-help graphics services,

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

16 | P a g e

color imaging, audio and video editing, and other production and presentation software so that it
becomes one-stop shopping for out-of-class assignments, writing, research, and group projects”
(p. 505). Most of these spaces employ designs that focus on and accentuate students’ propensities
for social learning. “Workspaces are modular, flexible, and comfortable, allowing for different
group sizes and configurations, from individuals working with a mentor to larger groups” (p.
505).
Learning Organizations: In order for an organization to grow and prosper “it has to develop a
capacity to respond well to changes in its environment,” this can be accomplished by
“facilitating the learning of all its employees, and by being alert to the need for continuous
transformation” (McKenna, 2012, p. 216). The goal of a learning organization is to “create a
culture of continuous learning for all employees” (p. 216).
Organizational Development: Organizational development is “aimed at helping to facilitate
change through a better understanding of how complex, adaptive systems operate and
interconnect remembering that change in group behavior is always social and major changes are
inevitably cultural” (Stevenson, 2012, p. 87). Organizational development encourages true
change through changes in the culture of the organization.
Paraprofessionals: Library employees who are not professional librarians. They usually possess
an undergraduate degree which is often related to technology. These workers are also referred to
as support staff.

CHAPTER 2
METHODOLOGY
Introduction

The research methodology utilized in this dissertation was an evidence based approach.
Through a systematic review of the literature evidence was uncovered in a sufficient quantity to
satisfactorily answer the research question. The chapter begins with a discussion of evidencebased research in general, and in the fields of management, library, and information science in
particular. A discussion of systematic review and its linkage to the research question follows. In
the discussion of scholarly research evidence tools the research process, search strategy, data
location, inclusion/exclusion criteria, relevance/rigor appraisal, and data synthesis approach are
detailed. A discussion of meta-ethnography follows. The chapter concludes with the discussion
of the use of an expert panel as evidence of support and a summary.
Discussion of Evidence-Based Research and Methodology
Evidence-Based Research
Increasingly, policymakers and practitioners have called for both policy and practice to
be based on evidence rather than prior experience or guess work. Especially in Great Britain
there has been a growing emphasis on utilizing facts or evidence when making policy decisions.
That trend is starting to make its way across the Atlantic to the United States as well. Diverse
fields such as medicine, education, psychology, management, social work, and library science
have all seen an increase in evidence based research. “The arguments for basing professional
practice on the evidence are compelling – the concept of professionalism requires that a
practitioner remains in constant contact with the knowledge base that determines the content,
nature and impact of their day-to-day activities” (Booth & Brice, 2004, p. 3).

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

19 | P a g e

Evidence-Based Management
Although evidence-based management is a relatively new phenomenon, its roots can “be
traced back to the logical positivists who stated that it was essential to develop understanding by
answering the two questions: “what is it that you think you know” and “how do you know it””
(Armstrong, Brown & Reilly, 2010, p. 1). Traditionally, managers have made decisions based on
four factors: prior experience, common beliefs, current fads, and gut instinct. Evidence-based
management (EBM) is founded on the idea that decision making can be improved by applying
logic, facts, and available information to the problem at hand. Evidence-based management “is
based on the belief that facing the hard facts about what works and what doesn't, understanding
the dangerous half-truths that constitute so much conventional wisdom about management, and
rejecting the total nonsense that too often passes for sound advice will help organizations
perform better” (Pfeffer & Sutton, 2006, p. 13). Rousseau (2012) defined evidence-based
management as “the systematic, evidence-informed practice of management, incorporating
scientific knowledge in the content and process of making decisions” (p. 3). EBM involves a
four step process: “use of the best available scientific findings; gathering and attending to
organizational facts, indicators and metrics in a systematic fashion to increase their reliability
and usefulness; on-going use of critical, reflective judgment and decision aids in order to reduce
bias and improve decision quality; and consideration of ethical issues including the short and
long term impact of decisions on stakeholders” (Rousseau, 2012, pp. 4-5).
Evidence-Based Librarianship
Much like evidence-based management, evidence-based librarianship (EBL) is a
relatively recent phenomenon. The movement began in health libraries as the evidence-based
medicine trend quickly affected the libraries associated with hospitals and

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

20 | P a g e

medical/nursing/public health schools. The majority of evidence-based information science is
still authored by health librarians. The two major figures in the area are Jonathan Eldredge, in the
United States, and Andrew Booth, in Great Britain. Eldredge (2006) defined evidence-based
librarianship as “a process for integrating the best available scientifically-generated evidence into
making important decisions, it seeks to combine the use of the best available research evidence
with a pragmatic perspective developed from working experiences in librarianship” (p. 342).
Booth and Brice (2004) defined EBL as “an approach to information science that promotes the
collection, interpretation, and integration of valid, important and applicable user-reported,
librarian-observed, and research-derived evidence; the best available evidence, moderated by
user needs and preferences, is applied to improve the quality of professional judgments” (p. 7).
Unlike some other disciplines, EBL, because it has grown out of the social sciences,
makes use of both quantitative and qualitative research in its systematic review. “Librarianship is
in the unique position of being able to conduct and use the different types of studies available”
(Crumley & Koufogiannakis, 2002, p. 65).
Systematic Review
Systematic reviews are not new and did not arise from evidence-based medicine. The first
systematic reviews were produced in the fields of psychology and education (Littell & Corcoran,
2010). Later, systematic reviews became part of the evidence-based medicine phenomenon and
grew greatly in popularity. The creation of the Cochrane Collaboration in 1993 to gather data on
health care interventions greatly assisted with the acceptance of systematic review (Littell &
Corcoran, 2010). Systematic reviews can be defined as “carefully organized, comprehensive and
transparent studies of previous research on a particular topic that follow written protocols that
specify their central objectives, concepts, and methods in advance” (p. 313).

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

21 | P a g e

There are many different methodologies for conducting systematic reviews. However, all
systematic reviews “include procedures for identifying, critically appraising, synthesizing, and
presenting results of previous studies” (Littell & Corcoran, 2010, p. 313). One of the strengths
of systematic review is that bias and error can be minimized through following proper
procedures. Another advantage is that the well documented stages of a systematic review create
transparency and allow for readers to evaluate or reproduce the research conducted. The key
features of systematic reviews, then, are: “an explicit research question to be addressed;
transparency of methods used for searching for studies; exhaustive searches which look for
unpublished as well as published studies; clear criteria for assessing the quality of studies; clear
criteria for including or excluding studies based on the scope of the review and quality
assessment; joint reviewing to reduce bias; and a clear statement of the findings of the review”
(Evans & Benefield, 2001, p. 529).
Need for Systematic Reviews
In today’s age of information overload, the problem is not lack of information but one of
too much information. Practitioners are confused by both the quantity of evidence available to
them and its often conflicting nature. Few practitioners have the expertise or the time to do the
in-depth research necessary to make sense of this barrage of information. Properly conducted
systematic reviews can provide practitioners with the evidence needed to make well-informed
decisions. “Systematic reviews are a method of making sense of large bodies of information, and
a means of contributing to the answers to questions about what works and what does not – and
many other types of questions too” (Petticrew & Roberts, 2006, p. 2).
Systematic reviews are particularly valuable when the evidence in an area is uncertain.
After all, what is the purpose of researching an area that has been settled, and in which all

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

22 | P a g e

authorities are in agreement? Petticrew and Roberts (2006) point to five situations that call for
use of a systematic review: “when there is uncertainty and there has been some previous research
on the issue; in the early stages of development of a policy; where key questions remain
unanswered; when a general overall picture of the evidence in a topic area is needed to direct
future research efforts; and when an accurate picture of past research is required to promote the
development of new methodologies” (p. 21).
Systematic Review - Linkage to Research Question
Formulating the research question is the first and probably the most important step in
conducting a systematic review. The research question is the foundation of the entire systematic
review process. Much like a house with a weak foundation a systematic review with a poorly
crafted research question is doomed to collapse. Depending on the type of research being
conducted a research question may evolve over the course of a systematic review. This is
especially so when a scholar is seeking to generate, explore, or create a new theory. As Eldredge
(2000) pointed out, “because so many initial questions lead to other questions, the question
formulation process needs to be viewed as an iterative activity” (p. 292). The research question
also drives the choice of synthesis methodology as all methodologies have strengths and
weaknesses.
In this systematic review, the research questions have gone through several iterations.
After numerous revisions one research question emerged as the focus of this dissertation: Which
leadership and management competencies are most vital for library directors and senior
managers to possess as they lead their organizations through the current uncertain climate into
the future? Having a well-structured question or questions is a difficult task – one which can be
assisted by assigning the question to a specific domain. Crumley and Koufogiannakis (2002)

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

23 | P a g e

divided EBL research questions into six domains: reference, education, collections, management,
information access and retrieval, and marketing/promotion. “Matching librarianship questions
with one of the domains can help librarians decide where to search and the appropriate search
terms they should use to answer the question, it also allows librarians to focus on what they are
asking, rather than permitting the question to snowball in many directions” (p. 63). This is an
important consideration because, just as in EBM, the evidence base of EBL is highly scattered in
many databases. Depending on the research question, EBL researchers may need to use
information science, management, education, psychology, or medical databases as sources of
evidence. For this systematic review the domain was management in academic libraries. This
narrowed the evidence base somewhat since medical libraries were not as relevant to the
research.
Discussion of the Scholarly Research Evidence Tools
Research Process
The research process involves steps used to conduct a systematic review on a particular
topic area. The steps utilized were those outlined in the Cochrane Collaboration’s Reviewer’s
Handbook and expanded upon by Booker (2010) as she was the first scholar to combine
qualitative and quantitative studies in a meta-ethnographic review. These steps are:
1.

Identify the topic of interest

2.

Select studies relevant to the topic

3.

Read the studies

4.

Determine how the studies are related

5.

Translate the studies into one another

6.

Synthesize translations

Search Strategy
When executing a search strategy for a systematic review, most researchers will try to
perform an exhaustive search continuing until they reach a point of saturation – nothing new is
being found. However, the goal is to find every article that is relevant to the research question. A
search strategy that is too broad will retrieve too many irrelevant articles. “When carrying out the
process of identifying relevant terms with which to search electronic databases, it is necessary to
strike a balance between sensitivity (finding all articles in a topic area) and specificity (finding
only relevant articles)” (EPPI-Centre, 2010, p. 7).
Keyword searching was the primary search strategy used during the literature search
because of the numerous databases that had to be queried and the lack of standardized indexing
terminology across disciplines. The primary search string was “leadership”, “competencies”, and
“academic libraries.” Truncation symbols were used to find the variations of “library” such as
“libraries”, “librarians”, and “librarianship.” “Academic”, although the most commonly used
term, was also searched under the synonyms “research”, “college”, and “university.” In some
databases, such as Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts (LISTA), the terms
“management” and “administration” were used in addition to leadership. Library research often
does not differentiate between these related concepts. Subject term searching was used in those
databases such as ERIC which allows the use of controlled vocabulary through a thesaurus
feature. As Harris (2005) pointed out, “the expert searcher uses a combination of subject terms,
publication types, and text words to spread the widest possible net that will still yield valid
results” (p. 84). For the complete list of search strings refer to Appendix A.
Data Location
Library research is published in many different databases depending on its domain and

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

25 | P a g e

the type of library studied. Narrowing the research question to a domain such as management
and to academic libraries was helpful but, due to the highly scattered nature of the evidence, a
multitude of databases in many different disciplines had to be searched. The research question
for this systematic review crossed over into the information science, management, psychology,
and education disciplines. “Searches for systematic reviews need to be constructed to maximize
recall and deal effectively with a number of potentially biasing factors” (McGowan, 2005, p. 75).
Potentially biasing factors include publication and database bias. Publication bias “means that
even exhaustive searches are less likely to find negative and non-statistically significant findings,
and that systematic reviews affected by publication bias are likely to overestimate positive
results” (Brunton, Stansfield & Thomas, 2012, p. 112). This is the so-called “file drawer”
phenomenon in which researchers are less likely to publish negative results but instead place
them in their desk and move onto the next project.
In order to conduct an exhaustive search of the literature thirty-three databases were
searched. Because some vendors provide multiple databases, each database did not have to be
searched individually. Fifteen databases were searched through access provided by the Salve
Regina University McKillop Library and fourteen databases were accessed through the
University of Maryland University College Library. In addition to commercial databases, freely
available databases such as ArXiv, Google Scholar, Sage Open, and the Social Sciences Research
Network were also utilized to locate sources of grey literature. Appendix B contains a complete
list of databases searched during the systematic review.
The reason for the use of open source material for research is due to a cultural factor in
library scholarship. As advocates of the Open Access movement, many librarians prefer to make
their research freely available over the Internet through submission to an institutional repository

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

26 | P a g e

or through self-archiving. In addition, much of the library literature appears in conference
proceedings and committee reports. As Eldredge (2006) stated, “professional incentives that
enable librarians to receive funding to present papers and display posters at conferences, do not
exist sufficiently to publish in peer-reviewed literature” (p. 345). The majority of peer-reviewed
library literature is produced by librarians at large research libraries that are part of the tenure
system and thus receive both time and financial incentives to publish their findings. Most
librarians, especially those at small to medium sized academic libraries, do not have tenure and
do not receive such support from their institution. Therefore, they are much more likely to selfpublish their findings.
Computerized hand searching of important library publications also was conducted in the
following journals: College & Research Libraries, Evidence-based Library & Information
Practice, Library Administration & Management, Library Leadership & Management, and
Library Quarterly. As an additional check against publication bias, a search was conducted of the
web pages of library organizations such as the American Library Association (ALA), the
Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL) and the Association of Research Libraries
(ARL). The final method of data location utilized “pearling” in which the bibliographies of
included studies were examined to find additional relevant research (Harris, 2005).

The inclusion criteria for the systematic review stated that all studies must evaluate either
a library environment or an environment undergoing a rapid change process. Further all included
studies must measure leadership competencies as an independent variable. The exclusion criteria
eliminated studies of libraries outside the United States, the United Kingdom, and the
Commonwealth countries of Canada and Australia. Studies that pre-dated 1993 were also
excluded since the technological changes that have impacted academic libraries began to become

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

27 | P a g e

more pronounced around this time period. The 1993 exclusion was also applied to included
studies from other fields. Finally, studies written in a language other than English were excluded.
Relevance/Rigor Appraisal
Systematic reviews often utilize a hierarchy of evidence model to determine the quality of
included studies. However, due to the nature of library literature and of the other included
competency studies (mostly qualitative), use of such a hierarchy was considered impractical.
Eldredge’s EBL Levels of Evidence Hierarchy (Eldredge, 2002) which was created for purposes
of ranking the evidence value of library literature was used to assess the articles included in the
systematic review. The hierarchy presented in Table 1 consists of a table with three columns
which break down levels of evidence based on the type of research questions asked: prediction,
intervention, or exploration.

and historical analyses.
This table assumes that neither any publication bias1 nor what Rosenthal refers to as the “File Drawer Problem”2
has occurred when assembling relevant evidence.

To assist with evaluation of quality/rigor, a checklist was used which was designed for
evaluating library research. The EBL critical appraisal checklist by Glynn (2006) which can be
found in Appendix C. “This tool is intended to provide a thorough, generic list of questions that
one would ask when attempting to determine the validity, applicability and appropriateness of a
study” (p. 388). Therefore, while the EBL Levels of Evidence was used as a guide, the final
determination of evidence quality was made during the synthesis process. As Booth (2007)
pointed out, critical appraisal is a flawed process in which one must learn to deal with the
limitations of the research and avoid “critical appraisal nihilism” – the belief that no paper is ever
good enough to be included in a systematic review (p. 75).
Included studies were evaluated on both relevance and rigor. The studies were ranked as
high, medium, or low on relevance based on their relation to the research question. Studies which
directly addressed the research question were ranked as highly relevant, while those that only
partially addressed the research question were rated as low. Using the EBL critical appraisal

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

29 | P a g e

checklist, the articles were also ranked by quality. Those articles that passed all four sections of
the checklist with a grade of 75 or higher were ranked as highly rigorous. Those articles that
failed one section of the checklist were ranked as medium quality, while articles that failed two
or more sections of the checklist were deemed to be of low rigor. Although all articles were
ranked according to relevance and rigor no articles were excluded from the systematic review on
this basis. All articles were deemed to be fit for the purpose of the dissertation. The rankings
were created to assist in weighing the evidence presented during the synthesis process.
Administrative Systems
One of the more mundane but important tasks while conducting a systematic review is
keeping track of included and excluded articles and creating a reference list. “Since systematic
reviews aim to be a comprehensive syntheses of research literature, it is vital that reviewers keep
track of the reports they find and are able to present a full account of how each report is dealt
with as the review progresses” (EPPI-Centre, 2010, p. 5). Systematic reviewers may be dealing
with hundreds if not thousands of references over the course of a review. Creating a proper audit
trail is vital for updating the review and for future researchers who may wish to recreate the
review process.
Retrieved articles were first saved into folders in the various vendor databases. After a
preliminary screening process, relevant articles were uploaded to the Qiqqa PDF management
software tool. Reasons for exclusion were noted, most articles eliminated at this stage failed to
meet one or more aspects of the dissertation’s inclusion/exclusion criteria. Qiqqa was initially
used to de-duplicate articles. Because many databases were searched duplication of results was a
strong possibility. As Harris (2005) pointed out, the amount of duplication depends on “the scope
and dates the database covers, the journals it indexes, and the indexing terms it employs” (p. 84).
Qiqqa was next used to create a list of references in APA style. Studies were imported from

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

30 | P a g e

Qiqqa to the ATLAS.ti qualitative data analysis software for first, second and third stage analysis
which led to the creation of final themes and concepts.
The use of software for coding encouraged a cyclical and iterative approach to data
analysis that would have been difficult to accomplish through note cards, word processing, or
spreadsheet applications. The structure and functionality of ATLAS-ti does not promote a linear
progression of tasks but rather a dynamic and emergent approach to qualitative research (Silver
& Lewins, 2014). The ATLAS-ti coding process is not hierarchical but rather inductive. The
software provides the “ability to express relationships between codes, concepts, and themes in a
range of different ways, and often these cannot be represented in a hierarchical list” (Silver &
Lewins, 2014, p. 210). Key to this approach is the creation of network diagrams which were used
extensively in Chapter 4 of this dissertation.
Data Synthesis Approach
The data synthesis approach to the systematic review was interpretive. An integrative
approach was impossible because heterogeneity of articles made such an approach very difficult
if not impossible. A Cochrane type review of quantitative studies of high methodological rigor
was also not supported by the lack of such studies in the library and management literature. The
interpretive approach was first suggested by Noblit and Hare (1988). As explained by DixonWoods, Agarwal, Jones, Young and Sutton (2005) interpretive reviews “achieve synthesis
through subsuming the concepts identified in primary studies into a higher-order theoretical
structure” (p. 46). Articles are read and re-read to find similar terms and concepts. Most
importantly, “the defining characteristic of an interpretive synthesis is its concern with the
development of concepts, and with the development and specification of theories that integrate
those concepts” (p. 46). The main product of this process is not data but theory. While Noblit and
Hare (1988) proposed interpretive synthesis for qualitative research Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

31 | P a g e

believe that it could also be used to synthesize quantitative research. The added value of such a
framework “lies in its ability to examine systematically a much wider literature than is usually
included in systematic reviews to draw conclusions and suggest recommendations for policy and
practice” (Oliver, Harden, Rees, Shepherd, Brunton, Garcia & Oakley, 2005, p. 440).
Meta-ethnography
Meta-ethnography was first proposed by Noblit and Hare (1988) as a means of
synthesizing qualitative research. It was an off-shoot of ethnography which was popular with
anthropological researchers. Meta-ethnography involves three major strategies: reciprocal
translation analysis (RTA), refutational synthesis, and lines of argument synthesis (LOA). In RTA
“the key metaphors, themes, or concepts are identified, and an attempt is made to translate these
into each other” (Dixon-Woods et al., 2005, p. 48). In refutational synthesis, the “contradictions
between the reports are characterized, and possible refutations are examined and an attempt
made to explain them” (p. 48). LOA “involves building a general interpretation grounded in the
findings of the separate studies” (p. 48). Meta-ethnography has many advantages - the primary
one being that it preserves the interpretive properties of primary qualitative data. Although it was
created for synthesizing qualitative research, meta-ethnography has also been used to synthesize
quantitative data as well. Booker (2010) used meta-ethnography to synthesize both qualitative
and quantitative data on racial or ethnic matching of clients with clinicians.
Meta-ethnography involves a three step process. In the first step, studies are analyzed
“for common and recurring concepts” (Britten, Campbell, Pope, Donovan, Morgan & Pill, 2002,
p. 211). This step was accomplished through original first stage coding using the qualitative data
analysis software ATLAS-ti. Although ATLAS-ti provides a text search tool for counting the
number of instances a term appears in an article, it was not used in this research. Using such a

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

32 | P a g e

tool merely results in quantitative counting of qualitative research. As Silver and Lewins (2014)
pointed out “the work of much qualitative research is about unpacking the meaning of texts in
terms of respondents’ experiences, attitudes, and beliefs rather than concentrating explicitly on
the language used; the overuse of text search tools in an interpretive approach may be a red
herring, perhaps over-simplifying or skirting over complex undercurrents and nuance” (p. 150).
Using a simple text search tool will also miss alternate uses of a term. Instead all 51 articles were
painstakingly coded on a line by line basis.
Open or in vivo coding was used in the first stage of analysis as it allowed small segments
of data to be considered in detail and compared with one another (Silver & Lewins, 2014). First
stage codes could represent theoretical concepts, or be completely practical and descriptive, or
merely represent ideas that were interesting or needed to be considered at a later stage of
analysis. Any line of data which could be important or relevant was coded in this first stage of
analysis. First stage coding results in mere indexing – a “first attempt at systematically gathering
together segments that are instances of the aspects of interest to the research” (Silver & Lewins,
2014, p. 189). The result were over two hundred in vivo codes which are listed along with
number of occurrences in Appendix D.
Axial coding was utilized to conduct the second stage of analysis. During this stage
similar codes are grouped together, merged into higher order categories, and continually
compared and revisited (Silver & Lewins, 2014). Britten et al. (2002) suggest that Schutz’s
theory of first and second order constructs be utilized in this stage. “Schutz used the term first
order construct to refer to the everyday understandings of ordinary people and the term second
order construct to refer to the constructs of the social sciences” (p. 211). Printing out the list of
first stage codes assisted with the second stage coding process. Terms of ordinary usage were

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

33 | P a g e

converted to more usable terms that were prevalent in the evidence base. Codes which were
similar or related were merged. Little used codes which were dead ends or irrelevant were also
eliminated during second stage coding.
Selective coding was used during the third stage of analysis. During this stage the data
and the codes were revisited, searching for themes, concepts, and relationships (Silver & Lewins,
2014). ATLAS-ti provided the ability to make chains of multiple codes and linking of quotations
to create networks which was vital to third stage coding. These network diagrams were
qualitative visual representations of the data and greatly assisted with third stage coding.
Concepts, themes, and patterns emerged from the network diagrams. Also useful at this stage for
identifying patterns in the data was mapping of co-occurring codes. ATLAS-ti allows cooccurring codes to be retrieved and visualized through network and mapping tools. Finally,
ATLAS-ti was used to create hyperlinked maps of quotations which assisted with the analysis of
proposition three of this dissertation. Once third stage coding was complete line of arguments
could be expressed for these overarching themes and patterns. The results of third stage coding
were the basis for the findings and analysis presented in Chapter 4 of this dissertation and for the
conclusions and implications presented in Chapter 6.
Discussion of the Use of an Expert Panel
The Expert Panel Rationale and Process
Getting input from outside experts and practitioners can be a vital part of the dissertation
process, and represents a significant professional content advisory group. The University of
Maryland, University College Doctor of Management program requires feedback from both
subject matter and practitioner experts as part of the dissertation process. Panel members were
given the introduction, methodology, conceptual framework, and systematic review of the
literature chapters for the purpose of providing feedback on dissertation structure and content

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

34 | P a g e

from their scholarly and professional perspective. “Advisory groups can include methodological
and subject area expertise, and include potential review users. In addition to methodological
support advisory groups can also help review teams make necessary but difficult decisions in
relation to the review topic” (EPPI-Centre, 2010). Use of an expert panel helped to assure that
the purpose of this dissertation and systematic review was both relevant to the needs of
practitioners and had sufficient content rigor.
As required by the University of Maryland, University College Dissertation Manual
(2013), outside advisors were invited to be part of the expert panel. Their purpose was to
comment on the ideas and theories presented in the review, and also to offer unique expert
practitioner or academic insight. Use of such experts “helps to strengthen the connections that the
dissertation will ultimately make between existing scholarly and practitioner approaches to the
research question(s), it also serves to bolster the production of knowledge-through-discourse that
occurs in the dissertation” (UMUC, 2013, p. 15). One advisor was chosen on the basis of his

subject matter expertise (leadership theory), the others because they were leading practitioners
and researchers in the area of library leadership and change initiatives.
The Panel Members
Panel members were identified and invited to participate based on their backgrounds and
areas of expertise in relation to this dissertation. After advisor approval, an invitation to
participate was sent to each expert along with a letter from the Executive Director of the
University of Maryland, University College Doctor of Management Program, Dr. Bryan Booth.
A sample invitation is presented in Appendix E. From an original potential group of nine
candidates four agreed to participate in the dissertation panel. The distinguished members of the
panel and their qualifications are described here.

Panel Members’ Comments
The expert panel provided feedback using the University of Maryland University College
Subject Matter Expert Evaluation and Feedback form. This instrument consisted of nine openended questions which addressed: clarity of the study problem, significance of the study, scope
of the study, literature review, conceptual framework, overall writing quality, overall practical
value, and strengths and weaknesses of the study. For the most part panel member comments
were positive. Panel members confirmed that the dissertation focus was both relevant and
important to the fields of management and library science. Each panel member pointed out
weaknesses in the study. These were thoughtfully taken into consideration as changes were
made during the dissertation revision process. Appendix F contains a complete summary of panel
member comments and feedback.

Impact on the Dissertation
In response to expert panel member feedback several areas of the dissertation were
revised (positively affected). Several panel members expressed concern about the strength of the
systematic review of the literature. Following a new search of the literature additional articles
relevant to the dissertation were uncovered. Most of the articles were focused on leadership
competencies in academic libraries, but a new section on nursing leadership competencies was
also added to the literature review. In addition several relevant studies on leadership
competencies in public libraries were also added to Chapter 3. As a result of these additions the
total number of studies included in the systematic review of the literature rose to 51.
This dissertation’s enhancement occurred in response to suggestions made by individual
panel members. On the suggestion of Dr. Lynn Baird a new section on current and future library
challenges was added to Chapter 1, the dissertation Introduction. Dr. Anne Marie Casey pointed
out an error regarding ARL libraries which was corrected and also suggested a dissertation that
was relevant to the topic. Dr. Jon Cawthorne suggested the importance of discovery systems to
the library future and made several suggestions as to revising the research propositions. Dr.
Ronald Riggio’s suggestion to create a conceptual model of library leadership competencies was
a vital contribution as it led to the Academic Library Leadership Mega-competencies Model
presented in Chapter 6.

CHAPTER 3
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
Introduction
The environment in today’s academic library is one of continuous change. Numerous
forces contribute to this fluid situation including but not limited to the ever decreasing share of
the overall university budget allotted to the library, the constant impact of technological
progress, changing paradigms in publishing and in other methods of acquiring scholarly research,
and the shifting demands and preferences of academic library clientele - the university faculty
and students (Germano, 2011; Gilstrap, 2007). Library directors and senior managers are
engaged in planning or managing change initiatives in an effort to keep academic libraries
relevant, and to prove their value to university administrators, faculty, and students. Each of
these external influencers has their own preferences: administrators want to save money yet meet
accreditation requirements; faculty want their research interests met and their classes instructed;
and students want twenty-four hour, seven days a week access along with services on-demand
and easy to use Google-like interfaces.
The academic library and academic library directors are at a critical point in the
transformation process. Decisions that are currently being made by library directors and
university administrators will directly affect whether academic libraries remain a part of the
higher education environment. Will academic libraries remain the center of the university, or will
they become a backwater, or even cease to exist? Will the academic librarian be able to adapt
and cope with the constant changes currently affecting their work environment: frequent
alterations in technology and work processes; introduction of the Library Commons model;
removal of the traditional Reference Desk; and devaluation of traditional print resources?

Purpose of the Study
The issues facing academic libraries in the 21st century are unprecedented and
momentous. Without the proper direction and leadership, it is conceivable that both the academic
library as place and the position of professional librarian could disappear. The academic library
and librarians are at a crossroads: changes are needed to keep the academic library relevant in the
21st century, but there is little agreement over which changes are necessary. This dissertation
examined the evidence available in library and management literature to determine which
competencies library directors and senior managers need to possess to lead their institutions not
just into the next year, or decade, but well into the next century.
This systematic review examined through analysis and synthesis of the available research
the competencies that library managers need to possess to best lead academic libraries into the
future. Library directors and project leaders often focus on the short-term issues: what is the
latest managerial fad, what is the newest technological buzz, what is hot with the millennial
student today? What is needed is a long term approach utilizing evidence-based research (EBR)
to solve the issues and problems facing the academic library in the foreseeable future. Evidencebased management (EBM) rather than experience, gut instinct or fad chasing is the best method
of solving the problems that library director practitioners face. How do libraries remain vital to
the educational process, and how do library director’s best tap into the expertise, knowledge and
skill of the librarians whom they direct? How can library staff be most effectively managed?
What is the effect of various leadership competencies in the academic library environment?
Evidence-based management utilizing systematic reviews can help library practitioners to find
the best available evidence to assist in answering these questions.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

41 | P a g e

Research Question
Which leadership and management competencies are most vital for library directors and
senior managers to possess as they lead their organizations through the current uncertain climate
into the future?
Structure of the Systematic Review
Chapter 3 begins with an identification and discussion of the theoretical lenses that were
applied to the research question. A critical review and analysis of the literature using evidencebased research follows. Next the research propositions are discussed. A summary of the
systematic review follows. Chapter 3 concludes with a brief preview of the content of Chapter 4.
Identification and Discussion of the Theoretical Lenses
Management research often investigates phenomena through examination at the
individual level of analysis such as at an individual, group/team, organization, industry, country,
or geographic region level. However, more recently management researchers are developing
more complex understandings of phenomena by using multilevel theoretical lenses. “Using a
multilevel lens reveals the richness of social behavior; it draws our attention to the context in
which behavior occurs and illuminates the multiple consequences of behavior traversing levels of
social organization” (Hitt, Beamish, Jackson & Mathieu, 2007, p. 1385). Scholars increasingly
employ a theoretical lens or perspective which provides an overall orientating framework for
shaping the types of questions asked, how data is collected and analyzed, how recommendations
are made, and how changes are implemented (Creswell, 2013). There were two theoretical lenses
identified in the dissertation. They were leadership competencies and change management.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

42 | P a g e

Theoretical Lens 1: Leader Competencies
One of the lenses in this dissertation was leader competences. Leader competencies are a
frequent subject of study in both library and management literature. They are often associated
with change initiatives at various stages of the change process. Some competencies are related to
inspiration and encouraging followers to accept change. Other competencies are related to the
implementation of change. Some academics break down competencies based on whether they are
person or task oriented characteristics (Battilana, Gilmartin, Sengul, Pache, & Alexander, 2010).
Other studies associate competencies with a certain leadership behavior such as transactional or
transformational leadership. The transactional style utilizes delegation and reward.
Transformational/participatory leadership features collaboration, consensus building, and
communication. Many of the constructs are characteristic of transformational leadership:
creativity, empowering staff, motivating staff, innovation, risk-taking, and creating a vision.
Emotional intelligence is another leadership competency that has been studied in both library and
management literature.
Some studies have differentiated competencies by whether the behaviors are related to
change leadership or change management (Caldwell, 2003). Others differentiate competencies by
position such as project manager, program manager and change agent (Crawford & Nahmias,
2010). Higgs and Rowland (2000) divided change competencies into eight clusters – initiation,
impact, facilitation, leadership, learning, execution, presence, and technology. No matter how the
competencies of change leaders are broken down most studies that have looked at leadership
competencies have found that there is a great deal of overlap between the various categories of
characteristics (Caldwell, 2003). Although change is often initiated by an individual at the top

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

43 | P a g e

level of an organization (President or CEO), the actual task of carrying out change is usually
performed at the team level.
There is also a great deal of overlap between leadership competencies and management
competencies. The distinction between the two competencies is frequently blurred. Leadership
competency and management competency are frequently used as interchangeable terms in the
literature. This is especially true in library literature. Competencies listed as leadership
competencies in one article are often called management competencies by a different article. The
reverse is also true. It has been suggested by some researchers that the distinction between the
two is artificial. Jennings, Scalzi, Rogers and Keane (2007) concluded that the borders between
leadership and management competencies have become distorted in the 21st century work
environment and that previous distinctions between the two areas may no longer be applicable.
Theoretical Lens 2: Change Management
Another theoretical lens for this dissertation is change management. Because academic
libraries are being affected by many different forces and constantly trying to adapt to
technological advances, change management is a frequent area of research. In particular,
methods of dealing with change such as organizational development, systems thinking,
appreciative inquiry, creating a learning organization, team building, re-organization of staff, and
the frequency and use of assessment are often the topic of library research. Organizational
climate, changing the climate, and resistance to change are often addressed in the literature as
well.
Critical Review and Evaluation of the Literature
Introduction
When conducting a systematic review, it is necessary to consider two factors: quality of

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

44 | P a g e

the studies to be included in the review and their relevance to the topic. Relevance is examined
first, for if an article is not relevant, it should not be included in the systematic review. Relevance
is assessed based on the research question. Studies that address leadership competencies in a
turbulent environment of change were considered relevant. While quality of studies is important,
relevance was the driving force in weighing the evidence. As Pawson (2006) stated, “appraisal
on the grounds of relevance has to proceed case by case; it is likely that there will be a large and
auditable wastage of primary investigations that have nothing pertinent to say about the review
hypothesis” (p. 89). Evidence-based librarianship (EBL) adopts a similar view as it emphasizes
using articles with the greatest relevance to the research question while giving more weight to
those of higher quality.
Much of the literature on leadership competencies is qualitative in nature consisting of
case studies, interviews, and sometimes surveys. Quantitative research is the exception rather
than the rule in this area. Hierarchies of evidence from other fields are not appropriate for library
science literature for, as Eldredge (2000) pointed out: “library research relies primarily upon
three levels of evidence: descriptive surveys, case studies and qualitative methods” (p. 294).
Library literature is also replete with best practices/expert opinion articles. Pawson (2006) took a
similar view about hierarchies “judgments about rigor are not made on the basis of preformulated checklists, but in relation to the precise usage of each fragment of evidence within the
review” (p. 89). The included studies all researched leadership competencies; most articles were
from library literature while some were from the management literature and addressed similar
issues in fields also undergoing frequent and radical change. A complete list of the 51 articles
included in the systematic review of the literature and the critical appraisal process can be found
in Appendix G.

The systematic review of the literature begins with a review of leader competencies in
academic libraries including those inside and outside the United States followed by their
importance in the public and other library environments. Addressed next are leader competencies
in other fields undergoing rapid change such as management, military/paramilitary organizations,
the health care industry, nursing, and use by project managers. Cross-cultural competencies
follow while change management techniques such as organizational development, systems
thinking, appreciative inquiry, organizational culture, assessment, strategic planning and learning
organizations conclude the systematic review of the literature.
Leader Competencies in Academic Libraries inside the United States
In this section, leader competencies in academic libraries, the primary focus of this
dissertation are discussed. First, studies that measure overall leadership competencies in
academic libraries are addressed. Emotional intelligence, an important area of leadership
competence, is the focus of the next group of studies. Studies that focus on other single
competencies such as assessment of library services, peer mentoring, fundraising, and
transformational leadership follow.
Overall competencies. Buttlar and Dumont (1996) examined the role of Library and
Information Science programs in educating librarians with competencies useful to their jobs.
Alumni of the MLIS program at Kent State University were surveyed about how useful the
competencies they had learned in school were to their job performance. Alumni were asked to
rate a list of fifty-nine competencies on a scale of 1 to 4 with one being essential and four
equaling not very useful. 736 questionnaires were returned a response rate of 41.04 percent.
Public (41%), School (22%), Academic (22%), and Special Librarians (13%) were the bulk of
the respondents.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

46 | P a g e

The most highly valued competencies overall were knowledge of sources (78%),
collection management skills (74.7%), conducting reference interviews (72.5%), communicating
effectively in writing (65.7%), applying critical thinking skills (63.9%), and applying effective
human relations skills (62.7%). Academic librarians rated these skills differently with knowledge
of sources (78.5%), applying critical thinking skills (66%), conducting reference interviews
(64.5%), communicating effectively in writing (64.5%), and utilizing oral presentation skills
(60.2%) ranked highest.
Buttlar and Dumont’s (1996) article was valuable because it examined whether library
schools are providing their students with the proper competencies to be successful in the work
environment. The usefulness of the article was increased through the inclusion of the list of
competencies in an appendix. However, there are fifty-five competencies in the list not fifty-nine
as cited in the article. Also, generalizability is an issue because only the graduates of one library
program are surveyed. It cannot be assumed that all library schools are preparing their students in
a similar manner. Finally, although the highest scoring competencies are included in tabular
form, there is no complete reportage on the scores of all the competencies. The article lists only
highly rated competencies not those of moderate or little utility. The inclusion of all competency
results would have strengthened the articles utility from an evidence-based standpoint.
Hernon, Powell and Young (2001, 2002) conducted a two part study of current
Association of Research Libraries (ARL) directors to create a list of ideal leadership attributes
considered to be crucial for the next generation of ARL library leaders. The ARL is an
association of the largest academic research libraries in the United States and Canada with
members such as Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. Their research was published in two separate
journal articles a year apart, and sought to determine which characteristics would best enable

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

47 | P a g e

someone to become a future ARL library director. In part one, they reviewed the library
literature (ARL director job advertisements and journal articles on leadership) to create a list of
traits desired by ARL libraries in a director (Hernon, Powell & Young, 2001). Based on this list
they interviewed nineteen current ARL directors to discover which of these traits they believed
would be most important for future directors. Fifteen in-person interviews and four phone
interviews were conducted. Library directors within close proximity to a researcher were
interviewed in-person, while four ARL directors at more remote locations were interviewed by
phone. The open-ended questions covered areas such as desirable backgrounds/experiences,
credentials, and knowledge and skills necessary to be a successful ARL director. As a result of
these interviews they compiled a list of 121 desirable attributes that could be classified as skills,
abilities, knowledge, and individual traits.
The interviews seemed methodologically sound as two pretests were conducted at two
ARL libraries, and based on this pretest some questions were deleted and some were modified
(Hernon, Powell & Young, 2001). A list of attributes compiled from ARL library director job
advertisements and published articles on library leadership was included in a table. Another table
listed the key attributes identified by the ARL directors during the interviews. However, in order
to contain costs interviews were conducted with ARL directors who worked in close proximity to
a researcher. They did not believe that the lack of a random sample or geographical diversity
would affect the results. Most importantly, the authors did not ask the ARL directors whether
they had mastered the attributes and traits they regarded as important for being a successful
library director.
In part two of the study, the authors contacted twenty six current ARL university library
directors to participate in a Delphi study, and twenty ARL directors agreed to participate for a

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

48 | P a g e

response rate of 76.9% (Hernon, Powell & Young, 2002). A Delphi study “requires successive
rounds or iterations involving lists which subjects add to, subtract from, and rank” (p.490). The
twenty directors were sent a questionnaire created from the 121 attributes’ list divided into three
categories: managerial attributes, personal attributes, and general knowledge. The questionnaire
asked the directors to prioritize which traits they considered to be most important to be
successful as a library director. A 1 through 10 point scale was used with 10 being most
important and 1 being least important. For each attribute a mean score and rank were calculated.
The top valued managerial traits included: able to function in a political environment (9.5), sets
priorities (9.5), maintains a productive work environment (9.4), shapes change (9.4), builds a
shared vision (9.4), thinks outside the box (9.4), builds relationships (9.4), is an advocate for the
library (9.3), and is results oriented (9.2). The top valued personal traits included: has credibility
with faculty and administration (9.7), is comfortable with ambiguity (9.7), is committed to the
job/profession (9.7), is able to handle stress (9.6), is innovative (9.4) is honest (9.4), has good
judgment (9.4) and articulates direction (9.4). Only two general knowledge traits were
considered important: scholarly communication and trends in higher education, both were rated
at 9.1.
A key component of this article was that the authors included all 121 attributes and their
mean score making it easy for the reader to discover which traits were highly valued and which
were of less importance. However, there were some limitations to the research. Only ARL
libraries were included, meaning that only a small percentage of U.S. library directors and
academic library job advertisements were studied. Most libraries do not fall into the ARL
classification since ARL libraries are the elite, created to support major research universities.
There are only one hundred and twenty six ARL libraries in North America while there are

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

49 | P a g e

several thousand academic libraries (ARL members, 2012). Results may have differed if library
directors were surveyed in other classifications such as in small or medium academic libraries, or
community college libraries. For a survey the sample size was relatively small, however, it was a
Delphi study which requires several iterations of a survey to be sent to the same subjects making
cooperation with large numbers of participants more problematic. The other major drawback of
the research was that it is a self-perceived list of important traits based on the opinions of library
directors. A list of desirable traits created by interviewing faculty, administrators, or library staff
could be completely different (Hernon, Powell & Young, 2002).
Fitsimmons (2005) compared the competencies desired by chief academic officers when
hiring library directors with those recommended by academic library directors. Hernon, Powell
and Young’s (2002) list of competencies considered important by library directors was used for
the comparison with academic library hiring administrators. Data was gathered by questionnaire
from an overall population of 4,364 academic institutions identified through the Higher
Education Directory. An electronic survey was mounted on surveymonkey.com and a link to the
survey and an invitation to participate was sent to all 4,364 institutions. The response rate was
8.2% as 320 usable responses were received.
The most important managerial competencies according to the hiring administrators were
ability to work in a collegial networked environment (9.29), a firm commitment to quality (9.29),
personnel/fiscal/budget management (9.25), commitment to institutional mission (9.18), and
supervisory experience (9.11) (Fitsimmons, 2005). The most important personal competencies
were integrity (9.82), working collaboratively (9.36), respect for scholarship (9.18), enthusiasm
for work (9.14), and articulating a vision (9.11). The most important areas of knowledge were
library operations (9.0), library technology (8.96), information technology (8.54), collection

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

50 | P a g e

development (8.00), and information literacy (7.50). Library director’s highest ranked
managerial competencies were supervisory experience (9.00), personnel/fiscal/budget
management (8.90), plan/implement strategic goals (8.70), ability to work in a collegial
networked environment (8.70), and commitment to institutional mission (8.70). The most
important personal competencies were integrity (9.80), strong interpersonal skills (9.50),
advocacy for the library (9.50), excellent written and oral communication (9.50), and working
collaboratively (9.30). The most important areas of knowledge were library operations (8.90),
experience with change management (8.20), library technology (8.10), program assessment
(7.90) and information technology (7.80).
Fitsimmons’ (2005) research was strong evidence of the usefulness of competencies not
just to library directors but also to those who hire them academic administrators such as provosts
and deans. The major difference between the two groups was in ranking order. Competencies
tended to be slightly higher or slightly lower ranked depending on the group. One limitation was
the use of Hernon, Powell, and Young’s (2003) competency list. This list was created for library
directors of ARL libraries. Fitsimmons included all academic libraries in his sample. It is
possible that the competencies relevant to a very large ARL library may not be comparable to
smaller college libraries.
Young, Hernon, and Powell (2006) followed up their ARL library director journal article
by surveying Gen-X librarians for their perceptions of the most important leadership attributes
for library directors. They then compared their results to their previous research. Members of
Generation- X are individuals born between 1965 and 1979. Twenty Gen-X librarians were
contacted to take part in a Delphi study and ten agreed to take part for a response rate of 50%.
Most participants were mid-level managers at ARL or small to medium sized academic libraries.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

51 | P a g e

After several iterations a final list of eighty leadership attributes was created and ranked. The top
ten leadership attributes as ranked by Gen-X librarians were: is successful in securing resources
and funds; has good interpersonal skills; is honest; inspires with a vision; builds partnerships
across the campus; has a passion for libraries/librarianship; builds working relationships; is
comfortable with change; has strong communication skills; and is personally approachable. Fifty
one or 63.8% of the total leadership attributes listed by Gen-X librarians also appeared on the
total list of attributes created by the ARL directors in the previous article. There were twentyeight new attributes listed by the Gen-X librarians and most “reflected the perspective of nondirectors, and emphasized the importance of acknowledging and rewarding the work of others,
and addressing workplace issues” (p. 496). They concluded that there was a large difference in
opinion between the Gen-X librarians and ARL directors earlier queried about which leadership
attributes were important for success as a director. Gen-X librarians “appear to place more value
on maintaining a balance between ones job and personal life, and they frequently stress the
importance of a person or employee oriented workplace that values teamwork, fairness, and
loyalty” (p.501).
The article has many helpful tables that list all the leadership attributes created by both
ARL directors and Gen-X librarians. There are also cross-tabulations between Gen-X librarian
attributes and between ARL and non-ARL librarians. Although extremely interesting the study
suffers from a small sample size and a small number of participants. The response rate was also
low although the researchers attributed this to the complex and time consuming nature of
conducting a Delphi study (Young, Hernon & Powell, 2006). Many subjects were not willing to
be involved in such a time consuming endeavor. The Delphi study method has also been
criticized as being unscientific and not statistically rigorous. “The lack of sampling, the

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

52 | P a g e

impossibility of accounting for unseen future events, and the absence of clearly defined
procedures and processes for conducting Delphi studies are just a few of the features that
differentiate it from controlled scientific methodologies” (Ludwig & Starr, 2005, p. 316).
Ammons-Stephens, Cole, Jenkins-Gibbs, Riehle, and Weare (2009) developed a core list
of leadership competencies for library leaders regardless of type of library. To create the list of
competencies current library leaders were interviewed. After the interviews the competencies
uncovered were used to create a competency model, and related competencies were grouped
under five meta-competencies. The five meta-competencies were cognitive ability, vision,
interpersonal effectiveness, and managerial effectiveness, and personal attributes. Cognitive
ability included problem-solving, decision making, and reflective thinking which was divided
into nine individual competencies. Vision included global thinking, creativity/innovation, and
forward thinking distributed into eight competencies. Interpersonal effectiveness included
cultural competence, accountability, team building, development, inspiration/motivation, and
communication skills broken up into twenty one competencies. Managerial effectiveness
included managing change, resource management, strategic planning, collaboration, and
flexibility/adaptability distributed among fifteen competencies. Personal attributes included
principles/ethics, honesty, humility, graciousness, and teach-ability divided among sixteen
competencies. The total number of competencies was sixty nine.
Ammons-Stephens, Cole, Jenkins-Gibbs, Riehle, and Weare (2009) provided a valuable
look at the core competencies of leadership in the library environment. All individual
competencies are listed to assist practitioners and could easily be used for self-assessment or job
evaluation purposes. There are issues with the methodology in that the article does not indicate
how “library leaders” were selected or how many were interviewed. It appears that purposive

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

53 | P a g e

sampling was used for diversity purposes and to select a variety of types of libraries. The article
also does not include a list of interview questions which would be useful for purposes of
replication. Although a competency model was described there is no graphical depiction to aid
the reader included in the article. Despite these flaws the authors provided a valuable list of
competencies applicable across all varieties of libraries.
Emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence constitutes a specific set of competencies
not related to a skill or knowledge but rather the ability to control and identify emotions in
oneself and others. For a manager these competencies can be an important tool in leadership and
change management. Although one is born with certain emotional intelligence competencies,
they can also be improved through practice and training. Goleman (1998) has done much work in
this area and created a model which centers on five main emotional intelligence competencies:
self-awareness, self-regulation, social skill, empathy, and motivation. Several studies of
competencies in academic libraries have focused on emotional intelligence competencies.
Hopper (2005) was the first to apply emotional intelligence (EI) to library leadership. The
methodology used was a content analysis of the writings of leading library scholars on leadership
to discover which EI traits were most prized. Sixty-eight articles by 63 separate authors were
analyzed. She was in possession of the list of EI traits Hernon and Rossiter (2006) used in their
research and used this list to analyze the articles. The most commonly mentioned competencies
associated with the trait of self-awareness were cognitive ability to deal with complex scenarios,
self-confidence, and realistic understanding of oneself. Self-awareness was the least valued of
the EI competencies. The competencies most associated with the trait of self-regulation were
comfortable with change, realistic organizational awareness, and comfort with ambiguity. Selfregulation was the most highly regarded EI trait. The competencies most associated with

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

54 | P a g e

motivation were building a shared vision, motivating people through shared vision, and
articulating direction. Motivation was the third most important EI trait. The competencies most
associated with empathy were treating people with dignity/respect, good interpersonal skills, and
good listener. Empathy was the second most important EI trait. The competencies most
associated with social skill were building a rapport, collaboration, and being an advocate for the
library. Social skill was the fourth most valued EI trait.
Hopper’s (2005) article was interesting and provided a valuable look at EI leadership
competencies as suggested by leading library scholars and practitioners. Using Goleman’s EI
constructs suggests high content validity considering the broad range of leadership competencies
covered. In addition to the highest ranked competencies she also provided the lowest ranked
competencies for each EI domain in easily understood tables. The limitations are that the articles
were selected through a sample of convenience and are the opinion of scholars not empirically
based findings. Also a complete list of all EI competency rankings would have made the research
more valuable. However, as the first to apply Goleman’s competencies to the field of
librarianship, Hopper (2005) made a valuable contribution to the literature on emotional
intelligence.
Hernon and Rossiter (2006) investigated which emotional intelligence (EI) competencies
were most important for library leaders. They utilized Goleman’s five categories of EI which are:
self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skill. The study consisted of two
parts: first job advertisements for library directors were analyzed; second, library directors were
interviewed. The authors performed a content analysis of library director advertisements that
appeared in College & Research Library News from 2000 through 2004 to discover which
emotional intelligence competencies were most commonly mentioned. For self-awareness, five

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

55 | P a g e

EI competencies were mentioned, with the most common being a record of proven innovative
and effective leadership (45 times/19.9% of ads). For self-regulation, four EI competencies were
mentioned, with the most common being broad knowledge of issues (10 times). For motivation,
eight EI competencies were mentioned, with the most common being visionary-able to build a
shared vision (46 times). For empathy, only two EI competencies were mentioned, with the most
common being good interpersonal/people skills (27 times). For social skill, ten EI competencies
were mentioned, with the most common being collaborative (35 times) (Hernon & Rossiter,
2006).
For the survey, ARL directors served as the population. Due to open positions the
population was 102 individuals. Seventy directors responded to the survey for a response rate of
68.6%. In the survey the directors were asked to identify the most important EI competencies in
the five categories. For self-awareness, cognitive ability to deal with complex situations was
rated as most important. For self-regulation, stable temperament and ability to maintain an
emotional balance under constant tensions was rated as most important. For motivation,
visionary-able to build a shared vision was rated as most important. For empathy, treat people
with dignity/respect was rated as most important. For social skill, effective in leading change was
rated as most important (Hernon & Rossiter, 2006).
Hernon and Rossiter (2006) provided a valuable look at EI competencies and contrasted
those competencies that administrators believed to be important when hiring a library director
with those that library directors felt were important to perform the job successfully. Surprisingly
the lists are not very similar. There were limitations to this research. Limiting the directors to
only the five most important competencies may have eliminated others that the directors felt
were important. Surveying only ARL directors limits the generalizability of the study. Had small

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

56 | P a g e

and medium sized library directors been included in the survey the results may have substantially
differed. However, as one of the first articles to look at EI competencies in the library
environment the study made a valuable contribution to the literature.
Promis (2008) expanded upon the Hernon and Rossiter (2006) research on emotional
intelligence competencies by including directors, assistant directors, department heads, and
experienced and entry level librarian positions in her analysis of job advertisements posted in
College & Research Libraries News between November 16th, 2005 and February 15th, 2006. The
sample consisted of 260 individual job advertisements. “Terminology associated with soft skills
encountered in the job ads was matched with a suitable emotional competency in Goleman’s
framework and translated using a conversion table” (p. 26). While most of the job ads did not
specifically mention EI competencies, many qualifications were able to be linked to specific EI
traits using her conversion table (p. 28). The leadership competency of shared vision and mission
was the most mentioned competency, followed by collaboration and co-operation, and good
communication skills.
No job description included more than fourteen of the possible twenty five EI
competencies. Interestingly director advertisements had the lowest number of average EI
competencies at 3.9 while assistant directors had the highest average number with 5.3 (Promis,
2008). The top competencies for directors and assistant directors were leadership, collaboration
and cooperation, innovation, and communication. The top competencies for Department Heads
were leadership, collaboration and cooperation, initiative, innovation, and service orientation.
She concluded that most advertisements were not geared toward recruiting emotionally
intelligent individuals but instead toward selecting workers with particular hard skills.
Promis (2008) made a valuable contribution to library leadership competency research.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

57 | P a g e

Most leadership scholars suggest that leadership is carried out all levels of an organization not
just by high level managers. By focusing on all levels of librarianship she shed new light on
which competencies are most important. While hard skills are important research has
consistently shown that soft skills such as EI are what make great leaders. Her research may
explain why so many library directors struggle with leadership. They are not selected for that
quality. She strengthened her research by providing the conversion table she used for associating
EI competencies with job advertisement terminology. She also provided several sample job ads.
The six tables provided in the article provide the reader with all the information necessary to
reproduce this research. The only flaw in the research is whether job advertisements necessarily
correspond with success in a position. There are many qualified individuals who fail as leaders.
Kreitz (2009) also examined emotional intelligence (EI) in her investigation of library
directors and their senior staff. She surveyed these respondents in an effort to create a list of ideal
EI traits that should be possessed by library leaders. Kreitz proposed two hypotheses: that “there
will be no statistically significant difference (p =.05) between the traits that library directors
(LDs) choose for a director and the traits they choose for a senior management team member
(SMT), and that there will be no statistically significant difference (p =.05) between the traits
that senior management team members choose for a director and the traits they choose for a
senior management team member” (p. 534). The study population was staff from nineteen ARL
libraries in the western United States. Because the director’s position was vacant in six of those
libraries the study group was reduced to thirteen. Eight of thirteen libraries contacted agreed to
participate. There was a 60% response rate for the final survey. The instrument was based on a
Hernon and Rossiter (2006) survey and pre-tested using five volunteers from libraries not
involved in the research. As a result of this feedback the survey was modified. In the final survey

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

58 | P a g e

the respondents were asked to rank the top ten traits of the ideal library director and of the ideal
SMT member in four domains: self-awareness; self-management, social awareness, and
relationship management. Six LDs and twenty two SMTs ranked traits on a scale of 1 – 10 with
1 being low and 10 high. The survey listed 17 traits in self-awareness, 21 traits in selfmanagement, 14 traits in social awareness, and 17 traits in relationship management.
Frequencies were generated for all traits and they were ranked on their means (Kreitz,
2009). The mean ranks for all top ten traits in the four domains as perceived by the LDs and
SMTs were compared using the Mann Whitney U test and the Z statistic was used to assess the
statistical significance of the difference in ranks. Many of the traits listed in the top ten of all four
domains as important corresponded to qualities associated with transformational leadership. All
respondents identified “being able to create a vision for change, communicating that vision, and
motivating staff to support that change” as vital EI leadership qualities (p. 544-545). Hypothesis
1 was supported except for one trait, and Hypothesis 2 was supported except for eight traits.
“The findings suggested that different competencies are needed by individuals in each role,
reflecting the primary tasks of that role; the top leader’s primary role is to create change while
the director’s management team focuses on running the organization and implementing change”
(p. 544).
Kreitz’s (2009) quantitative study was very strong evidence especially by the standards of
library literature. Her quantitative analysis utilized the Mann Whitney U test and the Z statistic to
verify her findings. There are numerous excellent tables throughout the article that not only
present the rankings of the four domains by both LDs and SMTs, but also the most important LD
traits and most important SMT traits overall regardless of domain by mean, standard deviation
and mean rank. Her research did have several limitations; the sample size was small and the

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

59 | P a g e

importance of traits is contextual or dependent on the particular situation or organization. As one
director stated, “it was very difficult to rate these, I don’t have a lot of confidence that my
answers would be the same if I took this survey again in two weeks” (p. 547). It also is a
limitation that the author only looked at library directors and senior management staff since it is
accepted that leadership behaviors are practiced at all levels of an organization not just at the top.
The study was also limited geographically to one region of the United States which affects its
generalizability. Finally, some traits included several components, it was impossible to determine
if the subjects ranked the trait because of one or all of the aspects listed.
Wilkinson (2012) examined the relationship between emotional intelligence
competencies and the personal attributes of library disaster response assistance teams (DRAT),
in particular which EI competencies were most common and which were of greatest importance
to DRAT team members. Case studies of two academic libraries that had suffered disasters
(flood and fire) were conducted. Three data collection methods were utilized – open-ended
interviews, focus groups, and reviewing secondary data such as reports. All available DRAT
team members were interviewed (several had retired or moved to other jobs). In total there were
twenty seven participants. Data was analyzed using emergent thematic coding and mapping
emotional competencies.
Wilkinson (2012) found that two of the EI domains predominated in the DRAT teams –
relationship management and self-management. In the relationship management domain the
important competencies were teamwork/collaboration and communication. The important
competencies in the self-management domain were trust/trustworthiness, adaptability/flexibility,
and initiative. These five major themes were found over 239 times in the research results. In total
401 EI competencies were mentioned by research participants. Every emotional intelligence

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

60 | P a g e

competency was mentioned from a high of 75 for teamwork/collaboration to a low of 5 for
influence.
Wilkinson’s (2012) dissertation was strong evidence of the importance of EI
competencies in library leadership. Since the research utilized the case study method the results
are not generalizable beyond the two libraries studied. Because the author was employed at one
of the institutions studied, the possibility of bias does exist. Also the use of appreciative inquiry,
which utilizes positively framed questions, could have caused participants to report more
positively on their experiences than they otherwise would have done. Despite these limitations,
she provided strong evidence of the importance of EI competencies to library leadership
especially in times of turmoil such as a disaster.
Other competencies. Several studies of leadership competencies in academic libraries
have focused on measuring the impact of a single competency. Competencies such as
fundraising, assessment of library services, transformational leadership, and peer mentoring have
been singled out for investigation by researchers.
Winston and Dunkley (2002) investigated two competencies that are increasingly
important to academic library leaders – development and fundraising. These competencies were
studied through an analysis of job advertisements for academic development positions in the
Chronicle of Higher Education for a six month period running from January through June of
2000. Library director job advertisements were not used because the competencies of
development and fundraising make up only a small portion of these ads. Data collection was
restricted to ads for development positions in four year colleges and universities within the
United States. The total number of job advertisements included in the analysis was 432.
Over 67% of the advertisements were for Director or Assistant/Associate Director

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

61 | P a g e

positions. The largest category of school represented was research universities (44%), with four
year colleges (27%) and comprehensive universities (23%) also heavily represented in the
sample. Private institutions (55%) slightly outnumbered public institutions (45%). The most
commonly mentioned responsibilities were identification, cultivation, and solicitation of donors
(55.6%) and planning/strategizing (Winston & Dunkley, 2002). Other frequently cited functions
included managing staff (26.2%), acting as an external liaison (25.2%), and acting as an internal
liaison (17.8%). The most commonly mentioned competencies were written communication
skills (59.3%) and oral communication skills (53.2%), interpersonal skills (28.8%),
organizational skills (16.9%), and being a team player (15.5%).
While interesting the Winston and Dunkley (2002) article is of limited value to the body
of work on library director leadership competencies. The focus of the article is narrow and it is
dubious that examining development position job advertisements truly corresponds to the
fundraising/development responsibilities of a library director position. However, there is no
doubt that fundraising has become a competency area that library directors need to practice, as
many university administrators now expect the library to contribute to their own development
campaigns. Because this article is the only one to date that has looked at the area of development
activities by library leaders, it needs to be included in any review of library director leadership
competencies.
Dole, Hurych and Liebst (2005) investigated whether assessment of library services was
a core competency possessed and used by library directors. This was a replication of Beck’s
(2003) study of assessment use by Association of Research Libraries (ARL) directors. They
wanted to determine if the findings could be replicated in smaller academic libraries. A mixed
methodology was employed through the use of interview questions and a validated survey. They

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

62 | P a g e

utilized Beck’s survey and interview questions. Library deans and senior administrators at three
large university libraries in Kansas and Missouri were interviewed. A total of 15 administrators
were interviewed about issues such as “planning, decision-making processes, service
evaluations, and assessment tools” (p. 127). They found that “some decisions were made from
the top-down and others were made in consultation with a group or groups of library staff” (p.
127). All the directors believed that the organizational structure of their libraries could either
hinder or assist with change initiatives.
While most directors stated that services were evaluated by various measures such as
usage statistics and user surveys none could estimate the amount of time or money their libraries
spent on assessment (Dole, Hurych & Liebst, 2005). Directors stated that most decisions were
based on available data; in other circumstances decisions were “based on best judgment,
observation, policy, procedures, philosophy and informed discussion relying especially on those
who are expert in the particular area” (p. 128). One administrator stated, “We are spending 10 to
15 percent of our time collecting the data. But how much time are we spending to look at it and
use it? I’d say less than 5 percent” (p. 129).
As a result of their interviews and the survey, the authors concluded that there was a
culture of assessment in the libraries they studied (Dole, Hurych & Liebst, 2005). The
researchers also concluded that “the degree to which a library administrator uses assessment data
for decision making is related to the administrator’s philosophy of leadership, need for
information, personal interest in assessment, local organizational culture and pressures from the
parent institution” (p. 131). The strength of the research was that the authors used a validated
survey instrument – Beck’s Culture of Assessment survey. Triangulation between survey and
interview questions also increased the credibility and validity of the results. Unfortunately charts

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

63 | P a g e

provided to detail survey responses were confusing and difficult to interpret. No copy of the
survey was provided. The small sample size was a limitation as it could affect internal and
external validity. The use of only three libraries in a limited geographic area also affected
generalizability.
Mavrinac (2005) authored a significant article on transformational leadership and peer
mentoring in academic libraries. One of the important aspects of transformational leadership is
creating a learning environment. As part of that environment mentoring is vital. However,
traditional mentoring may not be sufficient in organizations undergoing rapid change. As she
pointed out:
It is important that the type of mentoring program chosen be integrated and congruent
with the organizational structure, processes, norms, and rewards of a learning culture.
Today’s learning organizations require a mentoring program that is open to all
employees, allows for a variety of short-term, developmental relationships both within
and without the organization, emphasizes self-directed learning in which individuals
actively plan and initiate their learning opportunities, allows for a process of continuous
learning, treats the mentor and mentee as equals, recognizes that someone could be a
mentee in one situation and a mentor in another, and accentuates how one learns. (p. 397)
She explained that peer mentoring is inclusive, authentic, and “congruent with the
democratic nature of learning cultures” and transformational leadership (p. 399). Although this
article is at the lower end of the hierarchy of evidence since it is an opinion piece or a report on
best practices, it still made a valuable contribution to the literature on transformational leadership
and academic libraries. Peer mentoring can be a valuable tool for libraries involved in constant
change as younger librarians may be more up to speed on new technologies, and older librarians
may be more experienced in the library and university culture. Peer mentoring allows both
parties to assist the other with their learning.
Hicks and Given (2013) used discourse analysis to analyze why transformational

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

64 | P a g e

leadership was included as a core competence for library and information science professionals
by the American Library Association Council and Executive Board (ALA). The inclusion of
transformational leadership as a competence was unusual in that transformational leadership is
not really a competence but rather a specific type of leadership behavior. The research involved
two phases: “a discourse analysis of key documents related to developing the competences, and
interviews with individuals involved in the process” (p. 10). The discourse analysis was based on
Potter’s (1996) definition of rhetoric and how it should be used to analyze discourse content
(Hicks & Given, 2013). The documents examined included publicly available reports and
minutes from the ALA Executive Board and Council, publicly available ALA presidential
documents, mission statements of library leadership development institutes, and online archives
of listservs. The time period for the documents examined was from January 1999 through
December 2010. For the interview process a list of twenty five insiders involved in the creation
of the core competences was created; ten were contacted and five agreed to be interviewed.
Hicks and Given (2013) found that the inclusion of transformational leadership in the
core competences was mainly due to the influence of the Library Leadership and Management
Association (LLAMA). LLAMA is a division of ALA which focuses on management and
leadership. “The mission of the Library Leadership and Management Association is to encourage
and nurture current and future library leaders, and to develop and promote outstanding leadership
and management practices” (LLAMA, 2013, p. 1). Task force interviewees recalled little
discussion of leadership before an amendment was made at the 2009 ALA midwinter annual
meeting by two Council members who were also members of LLAMA (Hicks & Given, 2013).
The amendment was passed with little discussion or debate. “The lack of debate around the
amendment to the core competences and the fact that any proposed changes were not sent back

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

65 | P a g e

to the task force for discussion indicates the strength of the leadership discourse in library and
information science (LIS)” (p. 14). Transformational leadership was being discussed in the
library literature but separately from management. “Writers often made clear that, while
managers are bound hierarchically to particular positions with an organization, leaders can be
found at any organizational level” (p. 14). The most dominant discourse in library literature over
the past twenty years has been on change and change management. “Change brought about by
technological innovation, changes in organizational structure, and service expectations of library
users have been constant topics of discussion with the LIS literature for decades” (p. 15). Change
is seen as having a transforming effect on libraries. Therefore, “transformational leaders are
needed to lead the profession into an unknown future” (p. 16).
Hicks and Given (2013) used discourse analysis as their primary methodology for
examining transformational leadership. This was the first time that the methodology had been
applied to library literature. However, the authors also confirmed their interpretation of the
discourse by conducting interviews with the key players in the adoption of the core competences.
Because of their use of mixed methodology to confirm their findings the evidence-based value of
this article is very high. One of the strengths of mixed methods is the concept of triangulation.
Triangulation increases the credibility and validity of the article because the data was crossverified by two methodologies. Had the findings clashed, then validity could be questioned. The
use of discourse analysis was also strengthened by using Potter’s accepted method of conducting
discourse analysis. The only major issue with the research was that the number of interviews
conducted was small. However, when the population sample was twenty five interviewing five
subjects was a reasonable sample size of the overall population. One further issue is that the
researchers did not disclose how the original population of twenty five was reduced to ten. No

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

66 | P a g e

mention of random sampling was made.
Passonneau and Erickson (2014) also studied assessment as a core competency. They
examined six library job sites periodically from summer 2012 through winter 2013 to discover
how often assessment was included in the job title or as the main focus of a position. Similar
terms such as evaluation, metrics, and strategic were also searched. After uncovering job
advertisements related to assessment, the authors used ATLAS.ti software to perform content
analysis utilizing a grounded theory approach. Excel was also used to create tables and pivot
tables which assisted with counting terms and creating graphs. Over 50 codes were created using
ATLAS.ti which eventually grew into code families, super codes, and networks. “Networks
show the relationship of different terms and ideas to each other” (p. 6).
There were 44 job postings which had assessment as part of the job title or as a main
focus. In these ads the most commonly mentioned management competencies by frequency were
assessment of data (34), project management (22), and assessing university programs (15)
(Passonneau & Erickson, 2014). The most commonly occurring individual competencies were
use of assessment tools (51), analyzing data (46), and presenting data (43). The most commonly
mentioned skills in the job advertisements were knowledge of qualitative methods (27),
knowledge of quantitative methods (24), and usability testing (12). Other commonly mentioned
competencies were program improvement (33), strategic planning (25), and developing a culture
of assessment (18).
There were 187 job advertisements that included assessment in the job description but
had other responsibilities as the main focus of the position. Instruction librarian jobs mentioned
assessment most often at seven times, user behavior positions four times, and cataloging, public
services, and reference three times (Passonneau & Erickson, 2014). The vast majority of

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

67 | P a g e

positions with assessment in the title were within academic libraries (87%). Through this focus
the journal article provided an important look at the competencies of assessment valued in
academic libraries today.
There were several limitations to the research. The research could have been strengthened
by providing percentages rather than frequencies. The sample of assessment librarian positions
was rather small, but this is not surprising since it is not a common job title in libraries. As most
of the positions are in academic libraries it would be difficult to generalize results outside this
environment. The biggest issue with the research was that complete results were only provided
for the 44 jobs with assessment in the job title or as a main focus. The vast majority of the
sample only included assessment in the job description and results for these types of job are not
completely described.
Leader Competencies in Academic Libraries outside the United States

Leader competencies in academic libraries outside the U.S. have also been studied by
researchers. Competencies in countries as diverse as Kuwait and Singapore have been examined.
Due to differences in culture such studies were outside the scope of this dissertation. However,
studies of competencies in the United Kingdom and associated Commonwealth countries such as
Canada and Australia were relevant.
Jantti and Greenhalgh (2012) conducted a case study at the University of Wollongong
Library (UWL) to investigate leadership competency development and how it affects succession
planning. The UWL was facing a problem in that its workforce was aging but there seemed to be
a lack of interest from internal staff in engaging in leadership and moving into supervisory
positions. To investigate this phenomenon the UWL utilized the Lominger Leadership Architect
(LLA), a validated instrument made up of 67 leadership competencies that measures

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

68 | P a g e

characteristics possessed by successful leaders. A consultant was hired to direct the initiative.
Through workshops held with the Library Executive Committee (LEC) and the Coordinators
Action Team (CAT), the list of competencies was collapsed into nine competencies considered
to be vital to success as a leader at the UWL. Competencies for LEC and CAT membership
differed; the only overlapping competency between the two groups was managing vision and
mission.
Career interviews between the consultant and middle managers were held to discuss
career goals and obstacles to those goals (Jantti & Greenhalgh, 2012). As pointed out by the
authors the use of a consultant to conduct these interviews provided objectivity and lack of bias,
as well as allowing for candid responses. The interviews conducted by the article authors
revealed that many internal staff were interested in moving into supervisory positions but felt
that “higher levels of leadership just meant more work, more hours and a loss of conditions that
fostered work/life balance, such as flexible work hours” (p. 424). Others felt the gap between
middle and senior management was too wide – they lacked the skills and knowledge to
successfully perform at that level. This issue was addressed through self and peer assessment
exercises designed to evaluate an individual’s performance against the competencies. This
allowed individuals to find their strengths and locate weaknesses in competencies which could
be improved through training and practice. In addition to these exercises, VOICES, a 360 degree
evaluation and feedback system, was deployed as part of the Lominger suite of tools. Finally,
the competencies were integrated into staff policies, procedures and performance plans.
In order to measure the success of the initiative, Jantti and Greenhalgh (2012) used an
employee climate survey which was administered at two points in the process. Performance
ratings for senior managers improved significantly over a three year period. The only problem

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

69 | P a g e

with the initiative was disaffection by staff members not included in the first round of leadership
training. This was remedied by opening up the process to all individual staff members who
evidenced interest. Although a case study, Jantti and Greenhalgh (2012) provided a valuable
service by detailing a successful leadership competencies initiative in an academic library. Also
they assessed the effects of the initiative through qualitative (interviews) and quantitative
(surveys) measures, a step that is often missing in library literature. The only limitations were
that as a case study the results are not generalizable, and since it was performed at an Australian
library the results may not be applicable in U.S. libraries due to the differences in culture.
Crawley-Low (2013) studied the impact of leadership development on organizational
culture in a Canadian academic library. Unstructured interviews were conducted with staff
members and grounded theory was the methodology used to analyze the responses. Forty four
librarians were invited to participate in the research and twenty one took part. NVivo software
was used for data analysis purposes. Most participants (15/21) believed that their leadership
competencies had increased as a result of the training. The most often cited competencies were
increased self-awareness (14/21) and increased self-confidence (10/21). Other leadership
competencies that were enhanced included understanding and respecting others, increased
collaboration and teambuilding skills, more openness, and increased knowledge sharing.
Training participants found that their change management skills also improved. Improved
competencies for change management included enhanced communication skills, embracing
change, desiring change, and enhanced transparency in decision making (Crawley-Low, 2013).
Shared understanding of the university’s vision and values also increased, a stronger sense of
community was created, and each individual’s mental image of their place within the
organization was heightened.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

70 | P a g e

Crawley-Low (2013) provided a valuable look at how leadership development training
can improve leadership competencies. Most researchers agree that competencies are not innate
and can be improved through training. As a case study of one organization the results are not
generalizable. However, grounded theory is a systematic method to analyze responses and
improves the rigor of the research as does the use of qualitative analysis software.
Leader Competencies in Public and Other Libraries

Although there are differences between academic libraries and public libraries, there are
also many similarities. For this reason studies which examine leader competencies in public
libraries were also relevant to this dissertation.
Mahmoodi and King (1991) created a competency list for associate directors in public
libraries. In 1987 a draft list was created by four associate directors in the Minneapolis-St. Paul
area of Minnesota. After agreement this list was sent to public library directors around the
country who were “selected for their reputations as leaders in the area of participatory
management” (p. 26). The resulting list of competencies was used for four years as a selfassessment and performance appraisal tool. It was then updated in 1991 through suggestions
from readers in an article in Library Personnel News, and through input from the Public Library
Association/Library Administration and Management Association Professional Certification
Task Force.
The competencies list was broken down into six main areas – leadership abilities (18
subcompetencies), administrative abilities (30 subcompetencies), public library knowledge and
skills (37 subcompetencies), cognitive skills (10 subcompetencies), interpersonal abilities (16
subcompetencies), and personal traits (17 subcompetencies) (Mahmoodi & King, 1991). This
article was one of the earliest attempts to create competencies in the area of library leadership. It

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

71 | P a g e

is somewhat remarkable that most of the competencies remain relevant over twenty years later.
The authors created a valuable list of both leadership and managerial competencies in a
somewhat unique way. Unfortunately the lack of details about the methodology used to create
the list limit the value of the article. There was no information about how the library directors
were selected to be included in the sample and very limited information about the revision that
occurred four years later. It appears that a Delphi method was used to create the list of
competencies but details are sketchy in the article. Despite the methodological flaws the list of
competencies created is still valuable especially in the area of public librarianship.
Squires (1993) used the Learning Skills Competency Model (Boyatzis & Kolb, 1991) to
identify the competencies that differentiated average performing public library managers from
those who exhibited superior performance. The research utilized the Learning Skills Profile
(LSP) a card sort instrument which was designed to measure a manager’s performance and
competency in critical areas. From a sample population of 117 libraries twenty four libraries
were selected (nine academic/fifteen public) of these eleven public and three academic agreed to
participate. Later three public and the three academic libraries were dropped from the enquiry for
failing to provide the data in a timely manner. The final participants were eight public libraries.
A total of 45 mid-level managers completed self-assessments along with 135 subordinate
assessments and 45 supervisory assessments. Thirteen senior level supervisors also completed
the LSP as a self-assessment.
Squires (1993) found that the LSP did identify competencies that distinguished between
average and superior performing managers. Superior performing managers rated themselves and
were rated higher by their supervisors on behavioral skills and goal setting. Most importantly
interpersonal skills such as ability to motivate, to establish relationships, and give honest

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

72 | P a g e

feedback were ranked higher among superior managers. Sense making scores were also higher
for the superior performers. Superior managers also possessed higher levels of action skills than
average managers. Action skills included being persistent, meeting deadlines, committing to
goals, and making timely decisions.
Squires (1993) evidence was strong because she utilized a validated and reliable
instrument (LSP) to measure competencies. Because the author gathered responses from all three
levels of employees – senior supervisors, managers, and subordinates the results are triangulated.
The major weakness was the sample size in the end only eight libraries participated. Also
because all participating libraries were public libraries the results were not generalizable to
academic libraries. Despite this flaw Squires (1993) dissertation was a valuable look at
competencies that make a manager successful in a library environment.
Jordan (2012) attempted to refine a set of leadership competencies necessary to be a
successful public library director. She based her article on previous research in which she had
conducted a content analysis of library literature to create a list of competencies important to
success as a library leader or manager. There were 34 competencies in her list. She used a Delphi
study to refine and rank the competencies. Respondents were experts in the field (highly
experienced public library directors) and ran successful public libraries. Jordan (2012) used
Hennen’s Annual Public Library Ratings to select the 100 most highly ranked public libraries in
the U.S. The directors of these top 100 libraries were chosen as subjects, thus the sample size of
the study was 100. The research was conducted entirely online. In the first round of the Delphi
process, the respondents were given the entire list of competencies and their definitions and
asked to identify those most important to the profession for the next decade. Thirty one directors
responded to the first round of the Delphi process and 18 of the competencies were selected by

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

73 | P a g e

60% or more of the directors. The top selections were vision (93.5%), communication skills
(87.1%), customer service (87.1%), credibility (83.9%), interpersonal skills (80.6%), and
creativity (80.6%).
In round two of the Delphi process, the list of competencies was reduced to the 18
highest ranked competencies and five new competencies suggested by directors in round one
(Jordan, 2012). In this round a Likert scale of 1 through 7 was included and respondents were
asked to rate the competencies. A ranking of 1 corresponded to not important and 7 corresponded
to absolutely necessary. Twenty three directors responded to this round of the survey. The mean
and standard deviation was calculated for each competency. Any competency with a mean below
6.0 was removed for the third round of the Delphi. For the third round the list was reduced to 19
competencies. The list had the same Likert scale response categories and once again twenty three
directors responded. The highest ranked competencies were integrity (6.57), customer service
(6.57), accountability (6.52), credibility (6.52), and communication skills (6.48). The lowest
ranked competencies were enthusiasm, risk taking, resource management, and creativity, all with
means of 6.0. ANOVA tests were done to see if responses differed by years of service, years of
experience as a director, gender, and size of library; no significant differences were found based
on these factors.
Jordan (2012) created a comprehensive list of leadership competencies for public library
directors. There were few limitations to the research. The response rate was somewhat small
especially for rounds two and three of the study (23%), but this is typical of Delphi studies. The
major issue was that since the research was conducted in public libraries the results may not be
generalizable to academic libraries due to the differences in the two environments.

Chow and Rich (2013) examined the core traits or qualities that were important to
success as a library administrator in various types of libraries. They also wanted to investigate
the main tasks that were performed by these administrators to see if they differed by type of
library. Their qualitative research was conducted by interviewing 114 administrators of
academic, public, school, and special libraries. Interviews were conducted by graduate students
in a library administration course. Academic library directors were the predominant type of
administrator interviewed (n=36). Interview results were analyzed using content analysis.
“Empathy was the most consistently cited quality mentioned by all participants in all libraries”
(p. 7). Traits did differ by type of library. Academic library directors listed empathy, vision, and
communication as the three most important traits that led to success as a leader. Tasks also
differed by type of library as academic library directors listed budgeting, building issues, service
to users, and staff supervision as their most important tasks.
Empathy was the most important trait mentioned by all library directors. Empathy has
two aspects – empathy toward employees and empathy toward users. Chow and Rich (2013) also
found that the type of library affected the primary tasks of the administrators. “Academic library
leaders typically focus on the functioning of the library as a whole; they work to ensure that staff
has the resources he or she needs, make sure the building meets their needs, and meet with staff
to stay engaged in the library” (p. 19). Inclusion of data tables based on the type of library were a
strength of this article. Helpful charts and graphs were provided to assist the reader in
understanding the data. The reader can clearly determine which traits and tasks were most
important in each type of library. The research questions were clearly stated and the protocol for
data analysis was provided. While the qualitative interviews conducted by the authors allowed
them to gather in-depth information on the qualities and tasks of library directors it was also a

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

75 | P a g e

limitation of the research. The use of student interviewers is suspect. How the students collected
the data and asked the questions could have affected the overall internal and external validity of
the findings. All library administrators were located in North Carolina which affected the
generalizability of the results. Finally, although 114 subjects is a large sample for in-depth
interviewing it is a small overall proportion of the population of library administrators in the
United States.
Leader Competencies in Other Fields Undergoing Rapid Change
In this section, leader competencies in other fields undergoing rapid change were
examined. Management studies in the corporate world were the initial focus. Academic libraries
are not the only field undergoing constant change; professions such as military/paramilitary
organizations, nursing, and the health care industry are also undergoing similar transformations.
The occupations of project manager and change manager deal with change on a daily basis.
Studies that examine leader competencies across cultures were the final group of studies
explored in this portion of the dissertation.
Management studies. Higgs and Rowland (2000) sought to identify the competencies
related to effective leadership of change. They conducted a case study of a major multinational
corporation (unidentified) which was in the midst of a major change initiative. They were
requested by the corporation to develop a change competence framework, a training program to
cultivate change leaders, and assist with problems that arose during the process (p. 119). The
company was doing poorly and realized that in order to survive major changes were necessary.
They conducted a literature review and performed a content analysis on their findings. The result
was the identification of 14 clusters of behaviors related to successful change. After meeting

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

76 | P a g e

with the client these were revised into eight clusters consisting of 90 behavioral statements
(Higgs & Rowland, 2000).
Based on these statements three behaviorally anchored scales of 30 statements each were
developed (Higgs & Rowland, 2000). A 360 degree feedback instrument called the Competency
Assessment Questionnaire (CAQ) was developed to assess each employee’s level of
competency. Twenty seven individuals volunteered to participate in the research. They judged
their framework to be a success based on qualitative feedback collected from the participants.
The corporation was also pleased with the results of the process and adopted the framework to
manage their change initiative.
Higgs and Rowland (2000) presented their eight clusters of change management
competencies and their change competency framework which could be used as a blueprint by
other organizations considering major change initiatives. There were limitations to their journal
article. The research was in its early phases and it is impossible to know whether the change
competencies and framework were successful in the long term. Since the corporation was
anonymous there was no way to determine if the changes led to survival or whether the company
thrived. As a case study, the results are not generalizable. The use of a non-validated
questionnaire leads to questions of validity. The sample size was small but acceptable for an
exploratory study of this nature. Finally, there could be an issue with bias. The authors were paid
consultants and it was in their best interest to declare their work successful. Research conducted
by an uninterested third party would not suffer from this defect. Despite these issues, this was a
notable examination of a change initiative in a corporation undergoing radical change.
Caldwell (2003) conducted a Delphi survey of ten change agent experts to identify and
rank the most important characteristics for managing and leading change. He began by

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

77 | P a g e

selectively reviewing management literature and 147 job advertisements in two major U.K.
newspapers over a six month period to create a list of attributes associated with leaders and
managers acting as change agents. The result was a list of 67 attributes. An expert panel
consisting of 3 human resource directors, 3 management consultants, and 4 senior managers all
with 6 to 15 years of experience in change management then ranked the attributes in importance.
The panel then used a four step process to synthesize and rank the attributes, with a resulting list
of the top ten most important attributes for change agents to possess on a scale of 1 through 100.
The top ten traits for change leaders according to the expert panel were inspiring vision
(92), entrepreneurship (87), integrity and honesty (76), learning from others (72), openness to
new ideas (66), risk-taking (56), adaptability and flexibility (49), creativity (42), experimentation
(38), and using power (29). The top ten traits for change managers were empowering others
(88), team building (82), learning from others (79), adaptability and flexibility (69), openness to
new ideas (64), managing resistance (58), conflict resolution (53), networking (52), knowledge
of the business (37), and problem solving (29). Caldwell (2003) concluded that the overlapping
nature of the traits suggested that leading and managing change are complementary processes.
He did note that change leaders were usually executives or top senior managers who “envision,
initiate or sponsor change” while change managers were middle level managers who “carry
forward and build support” for change (p. 291).
Caldwell’s research was interesting but does suffer from a few limitations. The issue of
overlapping roles does not allow for a rigorous statistical analysis of the data. Since there was no
sampling of the experts selected for the panel, generalizability is limited. Caldwell (2003) admits
that a Delphi type survey can only be used as a clarification of issues not as empirical evidence.
In order to validate the findings a larger empirically based survey would need to be conducted.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

78 | P a g e

However despite these limitations his research was a useful compilation of the attributes change
leaders and managers need to possess in order to successfully initiate and move forward change
initiatives.
O’Brien and Robertson (2009) used a futures methodology to identify leadership skills
which would be vital for success in future business environments. The methodology involved
three phases. The result was a list of 15 leadership competencies. Finally, a diverse group of
leadership and human resource experts ranked the competencies based on relevance and
importance (O’Brien & Robertson, 2009). This resulted in a final total of nine competencies –
authenticity, agility, resilience, foresight, self-mastery, g-localism (ability to work effectively in
both the local and global environment), intuition, presence, and creativity. Based on these
conceptualizations a 75 item questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire was piloted and
validated on 18 subjects, and Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was calculated for each item. Factor
loadings also indicated acceptable validity. The questionnaire was distributed to 150 subjects
and 117 useable surveys were returned (O’Brien & Robertson, 2009).
A correlational analysis was performed to determine the relationship between age,
culture, and future leadership competencies (O’Brien & Robertson, 2009). “Correlation analysis
indicated significantly positive relationships between age and authenticity (r=0.32, p<0.01), selfmastery (r=0.51, p<0.01), and presence (r=0.30, p<0.01)” (p. 377). Significant negative
relationships were also found between age and resilience, creativity, and g-localism. Younger
subjects scored significantly higher on the competencies of resilience, creativity, and g-localism,
while older subjects scored higher on authenticity, self-mastery and presence. They determined
that both age groups were “significantly underprepared for the challenges ahead” (p. 377). The
other important finding was that with the exception of resilience there were no cultural

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

79 | P a g e

differences between countries in the competencies.
O’Brien and Robertson (2009) made several important contributions to a discussion of
leadership competencies. First, they investigated future, not current, competencies. Second, they
looked at competencies in many countries. One limitation of the research was that the authors did
not identify the experts who ranked the competencies, nor their qualifications. Without this
information it is difficult to judge the value of their rankings. They also did not identify which
literature was used to create the initial competencies. They also failed to detail how their 150
subject sample was created. Finally, the 75 item questionnaire was not provided. Despite these
issues, this article was an important investigation of leadership competencies for the future
business environment.
Military and paramilitary studies. Mumford, Zaccaro, Johnson, Diana, Gilbert, and
Threlfall (2000) investigated leader characteristics in the U.S. military. In particular, they
focused on person-centered competencies related to leader development and performance
(Mumford et al., 2000). The sample was U.S. Army officers. They were divided into two
subsamples – junior officers (second lieutenants to junior captains) and senior officers (senior
captains to colonels) (Mumford et al., 2000). The junior officer sample consisted of 821
subjects. The senior officer sample had 426 subjects. The subjects were given a battery of tests
including the Jackson Personality Research Form, the California Psychological Inventory, the
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the NEO Inventory, and ability tests which measured verbal
reasoning and writing skills. The subjects were also given a second set of measures designed to
measure leader performance and these included a self-reported career history, self-reported
descriptions of critical incidents of leadership performance, and open-ended military problems.
The last two measures were scored by three judges (trained management doctoral candidates)

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

80 | P a g e

and resulted in interrater agreement coefficients in the .70s. In a final group of measures the
subjects were given tests designed to assess their knowledge, problem solving skills, and solution
characteristics. The first measure was a complex military leadership problem, the second
assessed social judgment, the third examined solution construction to two ill-defined military
problems, and the fourth assessed leader knowledge through a sorting and categorizing test of
Army leadership tasks. These measures were also scored by three judges (trained doctoral
candidates) and also resulted of interrater agreement coefficients in the .70s.
Based on these tests, the authors began by identifying leadership types within the junior
officer sample. Seven leadership types were identified in the sample: concrete achievers (20%),
motivated communicators (17%), limited defensives (15%), disengaged introverts (10%), social
adaptors (12%), struggling misfits (13%), and thoughtful innovators (11%) (Mumford, Zaccaro,
Johnson, Diana, Gilbert, & Threlfall, 2000). Next they investigated whether certain leadership
types were more likely to exist in the senior leadership positions. In the senior officer sample the
leadership types were: concrete achievers (11%), motivated communicators (40%), limited
defensives (04%), disengaged introverts (06%), social adaptors (10%), struggling misfits (01%),
and thoughtful innovators (26%) (Mumford et al., 2000). The authors found that “certain types of
people tend to hold more senior leadership roles, and that different types of people can be found
in these roles” concrete achievers (20%), motivated communicators (17%), limited defensives
(15%), disengaged introverts (10%), social adaptors (12%), struggling misfits (13%), and
thoughtful innovators (11%) (p. 124). They also found that “leader types entering more senior
leadership roles were those that had evidenced better performance in junior-level positions, and
indicated enhanced performance in the senior positions as well” (p. 125).
The two types of leaders primarily found in the senior positions evidenced large skill

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

81 | P a g e

increases. The motivated communicators showed their largest skill increase when moving from
junior to mid-level positions then plateaued, while the thoughtful innovators continued to show
skill increases as they progressed through mid-level to senior leadership positions. (Mumford,
Zaccaro, Johnson, Diana, Gilbert, & Threlfall, 2000). They hypothesized that the “progressive
skill development observed for the thoughtful innovators suggests that in the long run, they may
prove to be more successful than the motivated communicators in functioning within the high
level demands commonly associated with executive leadership positions” (p. 128).
Mumford, Zaccaro, Johnson, Diana, Gilbert, and Threlfall, (2000) contributed a valuable
look at leadership types and their success as their careers progress. The use of validated measures
known to have reliabilities in the .80s strengthened the research. There were a few limitations to
the article. Since the research was cross sectional rather than longitudinal the conclusions about
career progression are limited in their applicability. Also because extremely senior leaders (high
level colonels and generals) were not included in the sample a complete picture of leadership
types and performance was not possible. Also because the research was limited to one
organization with a strong culture and values as well as an out or up policy (the U.S. Army) the
findings cannot be generalized into the workplace at large. Despite these limitations, the research
made a valuable contribution because it identified not only those leadership types likely to be
successful in leadership roles in the military, but also identified those types which lack the
requisite ability to fill such roles.
Wren and Dulewicz (2005) investigated leadership competencies associated with
successful change in the U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF). A combination of the Leadership
Dimensions Questionnaire (LDQ) and a self-developed feedback questionnaire (FQ) that
measured leader activities and the success of change programs provided a basis upon which to

82 | P a g e

examine the leadership of change within the RAF. Change leaders in the RAF were identified at
the Group Captain (GP Capt.) rank. “They completed the LDQ and also distributed a short
360FQ to three colleagues, superiors and/or subordinates involved in the same change program;
this method provided a 360 degree appraisal of the success or otherwise of the selected change
program as well as data on leader activities” (p. 297). 120 LDQs were sent-out and 36 usable
LDQs were returned, for a response-rate of 30%. The 36 returned LDQs represented 10.6% of
the overall population. 90 usable FQs were returned for a response rate of 25% of the 360
questionnaires sent-out.
All LDQ respondents were male and of UK nationality with a mean age of 48.3 years,
with a 14-year age range from 42 to 56 (Wren & Dulewicz, 2005). Of the 90 FQs returned, 74
were from male respondents (82.2%) and 16 from females (17.8%), the mean age was 44.2
years, with a 35-year age range from 26 to 61. Respondents to the FQ felt that the GP Captains
were successful at leading change (71.4% strongly agree/agree) and were positive about the
success of the change programs (79.3% strongly agree/agree). In addition, 52.2% of the
respondents considered that the change had met 80% of its objectives and 16.7% considered it
100% successful. Four primary factors were found to lead to successful change leadership:
delegation and involvement, communicating and motivating, strategic leadership, and external
constraints vs. generated early successes. The leadership competencies that were found important
to successful change were: “critical analysis, vision, perspective, managing resources, selfawareness, engaging communication, developing and achieving (each significant at the 0.01
level); and emotional resilience, influencing and empowering (each at the 0.05 level)” (p. 305).
Wren and Dulewicz (2005) provided a valuable look at leadership competencies in a
rapidly changing environment – the RAF. The results of the research were quite credible as the

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

83 | P a g e

authors used a validated survey to gather their data. “The LDQ is a reliable instrument with each
dimension reaching acceptable levels of Cronbach’s Alpha (0.7) with vision and imagination,
engaging communication, managing resources and developing being particularly highly reliable
(0.8)” (p. 298). One issue with the research was that the results of the feedback questionnaire
(FQ) were the only results presented. The LDQ results were presented in a different article. This
obviates the strength of the research – triangulation of findings. It is also unclear why group
captains were chosen as change leaders, since the authors do not explain this choice of subjects.
The other limitation was the response rate which was rather low for a survey of this type. It is
possible that the complicated nature of the research, two questionnaires and multiple
respondents, discouraged a higher level of participation.
Hawkins and Dulewicz (2007) investigated the relationship between leader performance
and emotional intelligence, intellectual and managerial competencies in the Scottish Police
Service (SPS). The instrument used was the Leadership Dimensions Questionnaire (LDQ). The
LDQ measures leadership competencies across 15 dimensions. The fifteen competencies were
grouped into three categories: intellectual competence (IQ), managerial competence (MQ), and
emotional competence (EQ). The population size was 16,000 which is the size of the SPS. To
make data collection possible the respondents were obtained at the Scottish Police College (SPC)
which all SPS officers attend periodically for training. Data was collected from April 2005
through January 2006. During this period all officers who attended the SPC were invited to take
part in the research. At the end of data collection 120 individuals had participated in the research.
The LDQ was used as a 360 degree measure of performance with self-report, supervisor,
peer and follower assessment. For each respondent the average of questionnaires returned per
target officer was 4.64 (Hawkins & Dulewicz, 2007). For data analysis t-tests were used to

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

84 | P a g e

compare means, correlations were conducted using Pearson’s product moment correlation
technique, and multiple correlations were done using multiple regression analysis. The LDQ
dimensions with the highest mean scores were emotional resilience (7.31), influencing (6.45),
and motivation (6.15). The dimensions with the lowest mean scores were intuitiveness (5.04),
critical analysis (5.71), and perspective (5.76). The authors had hypothesized that EQ would
predict a positive relationship with performance as a leader and such was the case. Correlations
were conducted with the seven EQ dimensions against the LDQ results and six of the seven
possible relationships with performance as a leader and five of the seven possible relationships
with appraisal were found to be significant in the self-report data. Six of the seven possible
relationships with performance as a leader were found to be significant in the colleague reported
data (Hawkins & Dulewicz, 2007).
One interesting aspect of the research was that self-rated assessments of LDQ
competence were lower than those made by colleagues in 10 of the 15 dimensions. This is in
contrast to most studies which tend to show that self-ratings are inflated and often biased. These
results were unexpected by the researchers and no possible explanation was provided. The
Hawkins and Dulewicz (2007) article was quite impressive. It used a well validated instrument
and provided all statistical analyses such as means, standard deviations, correlations, t-tests, and
hierarchical regressions in the article via tables. The only limitations were sample size which was
small and generalizability which could be affected by the culture present in police forces.
Health care studies. Similar to academic libraries the health care industry has also
undergone a great deal of change in the past few decades due to the impact of new technologies,
consolidation of hospitals and hospital systems, and budget problems related to the rising costs
of providing health care to the public. For this reason, studies which examined leader

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

85 | P a g e

competencies in the health care industry were considered relevant to this dissertation.
Wallick (2002) studied U.S. healthcare managers’ competencies and their role in
organizational performance improvement in multihospital healthcare systems. He investigated
workplace learning and performance (WLP) competencies. He also sought to determine which
WLP competencies were performed by managers and which were performed by trainers. He
determined that there were seven WLP roles which were associated with 51 competencies that
fell under six major headings: analytical, business, interpersonal, leadership, technical, and
technological. The methodology for the research was qualitative structured tape recorded
telephone interviews. The study population consisted of 248 not-for-profit healthcare systems
that were found in the American Hospital Association’s Guide to United States Hospitals, Health
Care Systems, Networks, Alliances, Health Organizations, Agencies and Providers. Included in
the population were systems in 43 different states as well as Puerto Rico and the District of
Columbia. Sixteen high level executives (CEOs, Presidents or Executive Directors) agreed to
participate in the research for a response rate of 6.4%.
After conducting the interviews and using thematic analysis to analyze them, Wallick
(2002) found that two themes predominated: WLP roles and their associated competencies were
mostly performed by managers not trainers and that managers “are now expected to become
leaders who are responsible not only for operational and routine responsibilities but also for
strategic leadership responsibilities, often without the benefit of well-planned career
development initiatives” (p. 399). He concluded that in the changing environment of the U.S.
healthcare industry, managers need to be competent in WLP roles and to possess competencies
associated with these roles in order to achieve improved organizational performance.
Wallick’s (2002) article, while interesting, did have limitations. His list of competencies

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

86 | P a g e

was taken from the ASTD Models for Workplace Learning and Performance: Roles,
Competencies and Outputs. This is a list of general roles and competencies created by the
American Society for Training and Development and it was not designed for the healthcare
industry. A more specific list of roles and competencies may have led to different results. The
results are also not generalizable beyond the not-for-profit multihospital healthcare industry. The
sample size was also small although not exceedingly so for a study of this type. A quantitative
study which used a 1-5 point Likert scale measurement would have been able to rank the
importance of the roles and competencies providing the reader with more in-depth information.
Still Wallick (2002) did provide valuable information about roles, competencies, and sample
outputs associated with change in the U.S. healthcare industry.
Battilana, Gilmartin, Sengul, Pache, and Alexander (2010) studied the relationship
between managers' leadership competencies and the likelihood that they will emphasize the
different activities involved in planned organizational change implementation using data from 89
clinical managers at the United Kingdom National Health Service (UKNHS) that implemented
change projects between 2003 and 2004. They proposed six hypotheses dealing with the
differences between managers who used person oriented behaviors and those who used task
oriented behaviors and their effectiveness in communicating the need for change, mobilizing
their employees to enact change and evaluating change project implementation . A validated
instrument the Global Leadership Life Inventory (GLLI) was used to measure whether managers
used more person-oriented or more task-oriented behaviors. The UKNHS was chosen as the
topic of analysis because it was undergoing a ten year modernization effort focused on
improving the quality of health care delivered to patients. Data was collected on change projects
conducted by middle or top managers in the NHS between January 2003 and December 2004.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

87 | P a g e

Ninety five managers working in 81 different organizations within the NHS who attended a twoweek strategic leadership executive education program in 2003 participated in the research.
Participation was voluntary and “data for six participants were incomplete, leaving a final sample
of 89 change projects implemented by 89 managers in 77 different organizations” (p. 425). The
sample included 67 women and 22 men, ranging in age from 34 to 56 years (average age 43); 21
were physicians, 41 were nurses, and the remaining 27 were allied health professionals, all had
managerial responsibilities, 44% worked in outpatient clinics, 45% in hospitals or other
secondary care organizations, and the remaining 11% worked in NHS administrative bodies .
Data were gathered through a telephone survey. Data on the three dependent variables
(communicating, mobilizing and evaluating) was collected using a self-developed 5-point Likert
scale questionnaire which measured from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree. (Battilana,
Gilmartin, Sengul, Pache, & Alexander, 2010). Data on the independent variables associated with
leadership competencies was collected using a validated instrument, the Global Leadership Life
Inventory (GLLI). Data was reported by calculating the mean and standard deviation as well as
through bivariate correlations. They found that “leaders who are more effective at personoriented behaviors are more likely than other leaders to focus on the activities associated with
communicating the need for change” (p. 430). “Leaders who are more effective at task-oriented
behaviors are more likely than other leaders to focus on the activities associated with mobilizing
organization members and more likely to focus on the activities associated with evaluating
planned organizational change implementation” (p. 430-431).
The authors concluded that “leadership competencies might differentially influence
emphasis on the three key activities involved in planned organizational change, suggesting that
when dealing with the role of leadership in change implementation, change should be considered

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

88 | P a g e

as a complex multi-dimensional task composed of different activities” (Battilana, Gilmartin,
Sengul, Pache, & Alexander, 2010, p. 434). In general, this research used a strong methodology
and the data analysis was well conducted and included regressions of competencies to account
for interaction between them. One possible limitation of the research was biased answers due to
self-reporting. Managers could be over-confident in their abilities. “Over-confident managers are
likely to experience a self enhancement bias; as a result, they are more likely to develop a falsely
positive sense of accomplishment and thereby to give biased answers” (p. 433). The authors
attempted to control for this self-report bias by the inclusion of this variable in the regressions.
Also the “analysis must be considered exploratory given the small, non-random sample of
managers in the NHS which poses challenges to the generalizability of the results” (p. 434).
Sampling bias could also be an issue as subject selection was nonrandom.
Nursing studies. Like librarianship the nursing profession is also undergoing rapid
change due to the impact of technology, the rising cost of providing care, privatization, and
stressful working conditions. Jordan (2012) pointed out that, like librarians, nurses are concerned
with providing assistance to their clientele and that there is no direct profit motive to encourage
leaders to develop their skills. However, competent leadership is just as important in this type of
environment.
Misener, Alexander, Blaha, Clarke, Cover, Felton, Fuller, Herman, Rodes and Sharp
(1997) conducted a national Delphi study to determine the competencies important in nursing
leadership. They claimed that the public health system was in disarray and good leadership by its
largest group, nurses, was necessary to meet the challenges ahead. They distilled the 16 Public
Health Professions’ Competencies into seven domains – provide leadership in public health
nursing, provide leadership in policy making, participate in decision making as a member of

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

89 | P a g e

management teams, manage agency resources, use information systems, develop coalitions with
community organizations, and design programs that affect public health .
A multi-round Delphi study was used to gather data. In Round 1 surveys were distributed
to a convenience sample of 140 public health nurses. There was a 57% response rate. The
competencies were accepted unanimously. In Round 2 a convenience sample of 107 public
health leaders was sent the survey and snowball sampling increased the participants to more than
400 respondents. Responses from this round were categorized into sixty-two competencies.
Round 3 was conducted in a state public health department in the South. The competencies were
measured on a 5 point Likert scale for importance. Participants were given the chance to add
more competencies – none were added. In Round 4 2,973 surveys were distributed and 860
returned for a 31% response rate. The Round 5 survey was identical to Round 4 except that
participants were provided the mean scores from Round 4. In Round 5 twenty five surveys were
sent to the Directors of Nursing for each state. Three hundred and twenty four usable surveys
from 31 states were returned in Round 5 – a 63% response rate (Misener et al., 1997).
The top ranked nursing leadership competencies were apply epidemiology and research
principles (4.57), develop/plan/implement health promotion programs (4.55), identify steps to
effect policy change (4.51), apply problem-solving techniques (4.47), provide leadership (4.47),
and communicate public health issues (4.42). The lowest ranked competencies were motivating
(3.51), marketing (3.49), defending need for external consultants (3.37), developing business
plans (3.24), and developing equal employment opportunity plans (3.10) Misener et al. (1997)
found that the highest rated competencies clustered around four domains – political
competencies, business acumen, program leadership, and management capabilities.
Misener, Alexander, Blaha, Clarke, Cover, Felton, Fuller, Herman, Rodes and Sharp

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

90 | P a g e

(1997) provided strong evidence of which competencies were important to nursing leadership.
All 62 competencies were provided in a useful table along with mean scores and standard
deviations. The only limitation was the use of convenience samples for data gathering. However,
the large sample sizes and nationwide scope of the research are unusual for a Delphi study and
helped to minimize the issues with convenience sampling.
Jennings, Scalzi, Rogers and Keane (2007) examined leadership and management
competencies in the nursing profession. They used MEDLINE and CINAHL to search nursing
literature from 2000 through 2004. They uncovered 316 articles of which 263 were unique.
Works from outside the U.S. were eliminated and other non-relevant articles were excluded
which resulted in a final total of 140 articles. These articles were examined to uncover the
competencies addressed and which competencies were identified with leadership and which with
management (Jennings et al., 2007). Most of the articles were from nursing literature and 56
different journals were represented. Most of the articles were opinion based (57%) the remaining
articles (43%) used some method of data collection.
The literature review yielded a total of 894 competencies. There were 581 leadership
competencies and 313 management competencies. However, only 26 competencies were unique
to leadership and six were unique to management (Jennings et al., 2007). They found that the
literature lacked discrimination between leadership and management competencies. Content
analysis was used to divide the competencies into categories. The analysis revealed 36 categories
of competencies, of which 23 were joint to both leadership and management. The top leadership
competencies by frequency were personal qualities (147), interpersonal skills (100), thinking
skills (55), setting a vision (36), communicating (33), and initiating change (32). The top
management skills by frequency were interpersonal skills (55), personal qualities (54), thinking

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

91 | P a g e

skills (29), management skills (28), communicating (24), and business skills (23). They
concluded that the boundaries between leadership and management competencies have blurred in
the 21st century work environment and that previous distinctions between the two areas may no
longer be relevant.
Their research was strong evidence of the competencies important in nursing leadership.
The blurring of the line between leadership and management competencies they found in the
nursing profession may also be applicable to other fields such as librarianship. The literature
review conducted in this research is quite similar to systematic review although that terminology
was not used. This similarity made the findings very relevant to this dissertation.
Sherman, Bishop, Eggenberger and Karden (2007) developed a leadership competency
model for the nursing profession. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 120 nursing
leaders from 23 healthcare agencies in Florida. The interviews consisted of twenty-six openended questions. Each interview took approximately one hour. Eighty eight percent of the
respondents were female and the average age was 46. The authors used grounded theory to
analyze the interviews. This resulted in themes and concepts that were coded into competency
categories that formed a framework for the development of the competency model (Sherman et
al., 2007).
Six competency constructs emerged from the research to form the competency model –
personal mastery, interpersonal effectiveness, financial management, human resource
management, caring, and systems thinking. Personal mastery deals with understanding oneself.
Other characteristics are self-confidence, trust, and empowering others. Interpersonal
effectiveness includes the ability to communicate, listen, and facilitate conflict. Human resource
management includes retention, motivation, scheduling and rewarding. Financial management

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

92 | P a g e

includes budgeting and staffing ratios. Caring is a traditional nurse function that includes patient
care, caring for staff, self-care, optimism, and resiliency. Systems thinking is the ability to
understand the complex healthcare system and its interactions.
Sherman et al. (2007) provided a valuable look at nursing leadership competencies and a
possible model. Limitations included a model which has not been empirically tested and a
narrow geographic focus. There is no proof the model is accurate and nurses outside Florida may
need or exhibit differing leadership competencies. This list of competency is valuable because
like librarians most nurses receive little leadership or management training – they must learn on
the job. Any list of competencies which can assist with selection or training of leaders in these
fields is extremely beneficial.
Palarca, Johnson, Mangelsdorff and Finstuen (2008) looked at leadership competencies
needed by Navy nurse executives in the next 10 years. They used a Delphi survey to gather their
data. Wave 1 used an electronic questionnaire to survey 200 senior Navy nurses of the rank of
Captain. Thirty-eight nurses responded for a response rate of 19%. These responses generated a
list of 178 competencies which after combining like competencies was reduced to 108 unique
competencies. An expert panel grouped the competencies into 15 domains. Further analysis by
the expert panel reduced the list to 6 domains and 92 unique competencies. Wave 2 sent the
revised survey to the same 200 senior nurses resulting in a 47% response rate. A 7 point rating
scale was used for each competency.
The highest ranked competencies were integrity (6.78), communication skills (6.71),
ability to lead (6.70), ability to listen (6.70), accountability (6.68), and ability to communicate
across all levels of the healthcare continuum (6.68). The lowest ranked competencies were
knowledge of facilities management (5.24), knowledge of payment systems (5.38), and

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

93 | P a g e

knowledge of referral management (5.40). More than half of the competencies came from the
domains of business management and executive leadership. Other important competencies
included ethical values, communication skills, mentorship, and flexibility/adaptability.
Palarca et al. (2008) provided a valuable look at not only nursing but military leadership
competencies. The main limitation was the low response rate of the first wave of the research.
This low response could have biased the second wave if these respondents were unique or
different from the majority of the sample. Also having only two data gathering rounds is rather
low for a Delphi study. Most Delphi studies continue for 3 to 5 rounds until a point of saturation
is reached. Another limitation is that not all competencies were described in the article. Only the
top 16 and the bottom 10 competencies were provided. Despite these flaws the article was
another well-researched look at nursing leadership competencies.
Galuska (2012) conducted a metasynthesis of nursing leadership competencies using the
seven phase approach described by Noblit and Hare (1988). A metasynthesis of qualitative
studies “is more than a summary of findings from all the studies but a way of translating the
findings into a new integrated whole” (p. 334). The focus of the research was to uncover all
articles dealing with leadership competencies in nursing. The search process resulted in 165
articles which after analysis for relevancy was reduced to 40 articles. After multiple readings of
the articles the focus was narrowed to 21 studies. All articles were published between 2002 and
2011. The studies were conducted in various countries and the final sample included 786 nurses
in various roles.
The studies revealed three essential themes – opportunity structure, relationship factors
with three subthemes, and organizational culture (Galuska, 2012). Opportunity structure means
that nurse leaders must be allowed the opportunity to grow. Nurses must be given the opportunity

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

94 | P a g e

to experience situations which require leadership and fosters their development as a leader. The
relationship area deals with the role of the manager, the role of peers, and the role of mentors.
Managers can either enable leadership growth or block it. Supportive managers were secure in
their own knowledge and position and encouraged leadership growth. Blocking managers
practiced intimidating and discouraging behaviors. Managers with higher levels of education
were found to be more supportive. Peers also could either bolster or undermine leadership
behaviors. A lack of collegiality by colleagues often discouraged nurses from practicing
leadership behaviors. The most important factor in developing leadership competencies was the
guidance of a mentor. Finally a supportive and positive work environment encouraged the
development of leadership competencies among nurse leaders.
Galuska (2012) essentially conducted a systematic review of nursing leadership
competencies. Although 21 articles is a bit low for a systematic review it is strong evidence of
the necessary environment needed for developing leadership competencies. It is not unreasonable
to conclude given the similarities between the two professions that the environmental conditions
which foster nursing competencies would also foster library competencies.
Studies of project manager competencies. As this dissertation studies leadership
competencies not just among academic library directors but also in senior staff, studies which
examine such competencies in project managers and change managers were considered relevant
to this dissertation. Many senior staff placed in charge of change initiatives in academic libraries
are team leaders or department heads essentially at the same level as project managers or change
managers in a corporate organization.
Geoghegan and Dulewicz (2008) investigated whether the leadership competencies of
project managers contributed to the success of a project. The hypothesis of the analysis was that

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

95 | P a g e

“there is a statistically significant relationship between a project manager’s leadership
competencies and project success” (p. 60). The research was conducted at a major financial
services corporation in the United Kingdom. The target population was employees involved in
business transformation and the sample was a subset of that population’s project managers and
project sponsors. Approximately 80 project managers were employed at the company. Change
initiatives ranged from new products to new technologies to manpower changes. The authors
decided to conduct a quantitative study utilizing questionnaires. Data was collected from two
groups – project managers and project sponsors. In this way project success could be determined
from two perspectives. Sixty five project managers were issued questionnaires. Fifty two
responded to the instruments.
Respondents were asked to fill out two questionnaires: the Leadership Dimensions
Questionnaire (LDQ) and the Project Success Questionnaire (PSQ). Only if respondents filled
out both instruments were they included in the research. Both instruments are proven and
validated measurements with a Cronbach’s alpha of over 0.7 (Geoghegan & Dulewicz, 2008).
The LDQ measures leadership competencies on 15 dimensions. The PSQ is a generalized
measure of project management success from both the client and manager perspective. Of the
fifty two respondents 73% were male. The average age was 39.5 years with a range from 25
through 57. Most of the respondents were in an IT related position (75%). All but one respondent
was a UK citizen. The fifty two respondents constituted 81% of the project managers in the
corporation. The mean and standard deviation for al1 15 leadership competencies were
calculated on a 10 point scale.
The highest rated leadership competency was conscientiousness (5.98), followed by selfawareness (5.92), sensitivity (5.92), managing resources (5.88), and critical analysis and

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

96 | P a g e

judgment (5.75) (Geoghegan & Dulewicz, 2008). The lowest ranked competencies were vision
and imagination (4.37), achieving (5.06), strategic perspective (5.15), and engaging
communication (5.15). Factor analysis was conducted on the 12 project success factors measured
by the PSQ. Three factors were identified as important – usability, value of project outcome to
users, and project delivery. A bivariate correlation between the 15 leadership competencies and
the factors of usability and project delivery was conducted. There was no significant correlation
between any of the leadership competencies and project delivery. However, the factor of
usability showed several significant and in some cases highly significant correlations with many
of the leadership competencies (managing resources 0.422, empowerment 0.421, developing
0.388, motivation 0.357, and critical analysis 0.323).
Geoghegan and Dulewicz (2008) made a valuable contribution to the management
literature with their analysis of project managers and project success. Their methodology was
very strong and they utilized two proven instruments in their research. They provided very
detailed tables listing all 15 leadership competencies and all 12 projects success factors which
should be very useful to practitioners. The limitations were that the sample size was a bit small,
and because they only investigated one company, findings were non-generalizable. Also they did
not investigate the role of followers in project success, which could be an important variable.
Still, their linking of leadership competencies with project success variables was an important
contribution which other researchers can build on in later research efforts.
Crawford and Nahmias (2010) wanted to determine who is best suited to lead change –
project managers, program managers, or change managers. The big difference besides titles is
that project and program managers come from a technical background while change managers
come from a behavioral science background, such as human resources, organizational

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

97 | P a g e

development, or psychology. They conducted a two part study. The first part was a review of the
appropriate literature to “provide a comparative analysis of the competencies expected of project,
program and change managers” (p. 406). The second part consisted of three case studies of
companies undergoing organizational change projects. An analysis of 13 studies and five
standards resulted in “the emergence of 24 competency aspects encompassing knowledge, skills
and personal attributes identified as important to effective project management performance
across the three roles” (p. 407).
Three case studies were conducted of organizational change projects – a large
telecommunications company of over 9,000 employees, a financial institution with over 12,000
employees, and a public university with over 10,000 employees (Crawford & Nahmias, 2010).
The case studies were chosen based on certain criteria – an implementation of an organization
wide IT project, a large number of staff affected (1,000-3,000 employees), and an expense of
over $5 million to $20 million. One project was managed by a change manager, one by a project
manager, and one jointly by a project and change manager. Semi-structured interviews were
conducted with the change leaders; they were transcribed and then analyzed using grounded
theory with the assistance of NVivo qualitative data analysis software.
The authors found that although there were similarities between the roles, the processes
differed. Project managers concentrated on activities and the focus of their communications was
on meetings and reporting to sponsors (Crawford & Nahmias, 2010). Change managers focused
on engagement, and effecting and embedding change. They determined that the culture of the
organization played a large part in determining which leader was best suited for the task of
leading change.
This research was important not for the difference noted between change managers and

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

98 | P a g e

project managers but for the competencies which were examined in the article. As Crawford and
Nahmias (2010) suggested “to successfully implement change in organizations one should
possess all the competencies found to cross between the roles” (p. 410). One of the limitations of
the research was that it only investigated IT implementations in organizations limiting
generalizability to other types of change. The other issue was in the terminology. They began by
discussing three roles – project, program and change managers. By the end of the enquiry they
had combined project and program managers into one role. The definition of the roles was never
clearly stated in the article. It would seem project and program managers are similar, but without
explicit definitions one can only speculate. However, despite these issues the research made an
important contribution in providing competencies related to change initiatives.
Muller and Turner (2010) utilized the LDQ to examine the leadership competency
profiles of successful project managers in different types of projects. Four hundred responses to
the LDQ were used to profile the intellectual (IQ), managerial (MQ) and emotional competences
(EQ) of successful project managers. The research question investigated was: “What leadership
competency profiles are exhibited by the project managers of successful projects of different
type” (p.439)? Two questionnaires were used: the LDQ and a self-developed questionnaire
(SDQ) which asked the respondents to judge their last project’s success and to identify the
project’s type. Respondents judged the success of their project on a five point Likert scale from
disagree to agree. The questionnaires were distributed globally to professionals in project
management worldwide; members of professional organizations in particular were targeted. A
web link to the questionnaire was sent to presidents of various project management organizations
and associations with a request to forward the LDQ to all of their members; it was also sent to
masters students in project management programs at universities in six English speaking

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

99 | P a g e

countries. Due to the unsolicited aspect of the questionnaire, no response rate calculation was
possible.
The sample demographics showed: 65% of respondents were male and 34% female; 21%
were from Europe; 56% from North America; 12% from Australia/New Zealand; and 12% from
other parts of the world (Muller & Turner, 2010). Sixty-seven percent of respondents worked in
the private sector, 28% in the public sector, and 5% in not for-profit organizations. Several
advanced statistical tests were used to analyze the data, and differences in competencies by
performance level were tested using ANOVA. “The results support the hypothesis that project
manager leadership competency profiles differ in some project types in order to be successful”
(p. 446). Results also indicated that high expressions of one IQ sub-dimension (critical thinking)
and three EQ sub-dimensions (influence, motivation and conscientiousness) are of importance to
all project managers in all types of projects. The authors suggest their results indicate that leader
competencies should be taken into account when assigning projects to particular managers
(Muller & Turner, 2010).
Muller and Turner (2010) provided a valuable look at leadership competencies for
successful project management on a global basis. The validity and reliability of the LDQ made
their findings quite credible. Their list of leadership competencies studied was included in a
helpful Appendix. This article is one of the few multicultural views of leader competencies
among project managers. However, one limitation of the research was the lack of a response rate.
The authors did not reveal how many surveys were distributed and claimed a response rate could
not be calculated because they requested that it be forwarded by recipients to any suitable party.

Cross-Cultural Studies
In today’s globalized business environment the importance of leader competencies which
cross cultures cannot be over emphasized. Even in academic libraries in the United States the
workforce is continually growing more diverse. Academic librarianship has long sought to create
a more multi-cultural workforce. Many library and information science schools offer
scholarships to encourage under-represented groups to enter the profession. Such factors make
cross-cultural competencies of great importance. The next group of studies addresses which
competencies are universal across all cultures.
Kowske and Anthony (2007) investigated leadership competencies in mid-level managers
in twelve countries including the United States from 561 companies in various industries. The
authors wished to determine if competencies differed across countries. Secondary data analysis
was conducted on data collected by the Personnel Decisions International (PDI) PROFILOR
multi-rater development tool (Kowske & Anthony, 2007). Countries were included in the
enquiry if more than 100 individuals had information in the database. The result was the
inclusion of twelve countries and a sample size of 18,425. Participants in the study were 65.1%
male and 48.4% had at least a college degree. The largest group of respondents (40%) worked in
an organization with over 10,000 employees, with 81.1% categorized as first line managers. The
PROFILOR data covers 24 leadership competency areas and 130 leadership behaviors.
Supervisors rated their employees on a 1 through 7 Likert scale where 1 was considered
important and 7 was considered critically important. Since this was an exploratory study only
descriptive statistics were compiled. For each competency means were ranked by country and
ANOVA was performed to distinguish similar competencies.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

101 | P a g e

The competency with the highest ranked mean was act with integrity at 5.99 (Mexico),
while the lowest ranked competency was develop oneself at 2.93 (Japan) (Kowske & Anthony,
2007). Across countries the highest ranked competencies on average were drive for results
(5.60), act with integrity (5.43), sound judgment (5.25), manage execution (5.24), and analyze
issues (5.10). The lowest ranked competencies on average were develop oneself (3.26), manage
disagreement (3.44), use technology (3.61), display organizational savvy (3.66), and speak
effectively (3.65). They found that while there were differences in leadership competencies
across countries there were also many similarities. In particular, the competencies of analyze
issues and foster teamwork were highly ranked in all twelve countries. Similarly, the competency
of develop oneself received a low ranking in all countries.
Kowske and Anthony (2007) contributed a valuable look at leadership competencies in
twelve different countries. They included their list of twenty four competencies in a helpful table
which should be useful to practitioners interested in leadership competencies across cultures.
More importantly competencies were listed and ranked for all twelve countries which should be
incredibly useful for any practitioner considering doing business in one of the twelve studied
countries. There were some limitations to the research. The sample was collected using
convenience sampling and was limited to PDI clients. Respondents were limited to the mid-level
manager position as well. Lastly, there were considerable differences in sample size by country.
For instance, the U.S. portion of the sample was 15,117 while for Italy it was only 100. Despite
these limitations, the authors made a valuable contribution to the study of leadership
competencies across cultures.
Gentry and Sparks (2011) studied leadership competencies at a cross-cultural level that
managers considered most important for success in organizations. They conducted a multi-level

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

102 | P a g e

analysis of 9,942 respondents from 40 countries in various industries. They focused on four
leadership competencies: resourcefulness, change management, building and mending
relationships, and work/life balance. They wanted to measure whether the competencies were
universally supported across cultures (convergence), or whether their importance varied across
cultures (divergence). Data was gathered from 9,942 practicing managers from more than 1,550
companies in 40 countries. To be included in the enquiry at least 20 managers from a country
must have responded. Mean age of the managers was 40.88 years and 73.2% were male. They
had worked an average of 3.80 years in their current position and 9.43 years for their current
organization. Executive level managers made up 29.6% of the sample, upper-middle level were
47.3%, 21.5% were middle level, and 1.6% were first level.
Data was collected using BENCHMARKS a validated instrument (Gentry & Sparks,
2012). As part of the survey managers were given sixteen competencies and asked to choose the
eight most important. Choices were binary so each competency could be either chosen or not
chosen as one of eight selections. Resourcefulness was chosen at an average rate of 77.68%.
Change management was chosen at an average rate of 72.64%. Building and mending
relationships was chosen at an average rate of 66.91%. Work/life balance was chosen at an
average rate of 38.30%. The first three competencies were regarded as important in all cultures
thus supporting the theory of convergence. Work/life balance also supported the convergence
theory as it was almost universally considered unimportant in most countries. Only Indonesia
63.64%, Malaysia 49.44%, and the Philippines 57.50% ranked work/life balance highly.
Gentry and Sparks (2011) made a very important contribution with this research to the
study of leadership competencies. Not only did they show the importance of three leadership
competencies across cultures but they also supported the theory of convergence. This has been in

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

103 | P a g e

dispute for some time as some researchers have argued that globalization has led to
homogenization of culture while others have argued that countries are still culturally distinct. At
a minimum Gentry and Sparks (2011) demonstrated that at least some competencies cross
cultures. They also provided a highly informative table which lists the importance of each
competency in all 40 countries. This table could be very useful to a practitioner doing business in
one of these countries. There were several limitations to the research. First because a Likert type
scale was not used it was impossible to test the magnitude of importance each manager gave to
each competency. The other major issue with the research was the sample. The authors did not
disclose how the respondents were obtained. The possibility of a biased sample exists.
Bueno and Tubbs (2012) conducted an exploratory study to identify global leadership
competencies. They utilized the Global Leadership Competencies (GLC) Model created by Chin,
Gu and Tubbs. The model is a pyramidal hierarchy similar to Maslow’s need hierarchy, the
phases from lowest to highest are: ignorance, awareness, understanding, appreciation,
acceptance/internalization, and transformation (Bueno & Tubbs, 2012). At the lowest level the
individual is deficient in global leadership competencies; at the highest level the individual is
extremely proficient at such competencies. Forty experienced business leaders from various
industries were contacted to participate in structured interviews with sixteen questions that lasted
approximately one hour. Twenty-six agreed to participate in the research. Interviewees discussed
their progression through the competency model from ignorance (first overseas experiences)
through transformation (complete comfort in dealing with other cultures).
Through the interviews the authors identified six competencies that were most commonly
mentioned by the business leaders: communication skills, motivation to learn, flexibility, openmindedness, respect for others, and sensitivity (Bueno & Tubbs, 2012). In addition, they found

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

104 | P a g e

the Global Leadership Competencies Model to be supported. While interesting, there were
several limitations to the enquiry. The sample size was quite small, as only 26 subjects
participated in the research. Also although the research was investigating global leadership
competencies, 76% of the respondents were from South America. The other diversity issue with
the sample was the competency level of the respondents. All the subjects were on the higher end
of the GLC model. A truly representative sample would have subjects from all aspects of the
GLC hierarchy. Despite these deficiencies, the Bueno and Tubbs (2012) article was a good first
step toward the creation of global leadership competencies which is an area that can only
increase in importance as globalization and cross-cultural interaction become more prevalent.
Change Management
Along with leader competencies change management techniques are a vital component of
successful change initiatives in academic libraries. This section of the dissertation examined
techniques such as organizational development, systems thinking, appreciative inquiry, culture,
assessment, strategic planning, and creating a learning organization, and their role in change
management in academic libraries. The successful implementation of such change management
techniques is often a deciding factor in whether a change initiative is successful.
Soehner (2014) examined change management as a library leadership competency in a
case study of organizational change at the J. Willard Marriott Library at the University of Utah.
Two separate library IT units were being combined into a single unit. There was quite a bit of
resistance among both managers and staff to the reorganization. Soehner (2014) documented the
change process that was utilized by the change leaders.
Change management competencies addressed include frank and open communication
with resistors, lack of leadership skills by those tasked with implementing changes, the

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

105 | P a g e

importance of listening skills and providing feedback to employee concerns, and establishing a
sense of urgency about the importance of change (Soehner, 2014).
Soehner’s (2014) research is useful from a practitioner perspective as it documents the
change process in a frank manner including both successful strategies and mistakes that were
made. The inclusion of competencies such as establishing a vision and keeping open lines of
communication is also useful. Utility is limited because it is a case study of change in one
particular academic library limiting generalizability. Change processes in other libraries could
differ considerable depending on culture, size and other unique factors.
Organizational development. Holloway (2004) conducted interviews with library
directors and senior managers to determine the current state of organizational development (OD)
in academic libraries. Holloway (2004) found three different approaches to organizational
development being used in U.S. academic libraries: Galbraith’s Star Model; the Balanced
Scorecard; and Hoshin Planning. Galbraith’s Star is a “systems approach to reorganization with
five points of the star interrelated: strategic planning; span of control, work processes, human
resource policies; and training/development” (p. 11). The Balanced Scorecard is a “framework
for tracking organizational performance through a set of quantifiable measures derived from an
organization’s strategy” (p. 11). Hoshin Planning is a “strategic planning process to help an
organization achieve breakthrough services and products for customers” (p. 11). Whether these
approaches are successful in libraries remains to be seen. Holloway admits “one of the more
difficult areas of instituting any new management system is to assess and measure its success in
both the short and long term” (p. 12). She also found issues with assessment of the impact of
change. “Libraries appear to compile data willingly and frequently but not always in support of
analyzing progress toward change and impacts of change” (p. 13).

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

106 | P a g e

Holloway (2004) identified as her sample 31 U.S. academic libraries as having instituted
some form of organizational change between 1993 and 2003. These libraries were identified
through journal articles, books, participation in an online discussion group on OD, and
presentations at conferences on organizational change in libraries. Nine libraries agreed to cooperate and twelve individuals who were either library directors or responsible for OD in their
library were interviewed. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted. One of the issues with
the research is that although it appears Holloway (2004) gathered quite a bit of data she did not
list her interview questions nor give any concrete indication of how much data she collected or
how it was synthesized. The response rate was low and she had few participants. She also
admitted that her sample was not scientific as she had no way of knowing how many academic
libraries had initiated OD and she did not conduct random sampling. Although it is not explicitly
stated in the article it appears her sample was either one of convenience or perhaps a snowball
sample. She also did not identify the libraries or their size which makes the research unreplicable. Despite these issues Holloway’s article was quite useful as it identified the current
state, drivers, and impact of OD in some U.S. academic libraries.
Phipps (2004) used the University of Arizona’s (UA) experience with OD as both a case
study and to create a resource of best practices. She applied a systems design approach to
organizational development. “The key driver for the University of Arizona’s Library’s 1993
restructuring was the continuing need to respond to present and future budget reductions” (p. 72).
The goal of the restructuring was to create a team based, shared leadership organization. Staff
were assigned to teams based on their completion of a Knowledge, Skills, Abilities and Interest
Inventory (KSAI). Team leaders were selected through consensus. Hoshin planning, a system
that includes Total Quality Management (TQM) principles, was used to create an environment

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

107 | P a g e

focused on customer service through continuous improvement. One of the strategic goals as a
result of the change process was to become a digital library with 80% of all resources and
services available electronically by 2008.
While Phipps’ article (2004) was an extremely detailed look at the change process at one
academic library it was still a case study and suffers from the defects of that methodology. The
results are not generalizable, and because Phipps was the Assistant Dean of UA and heavily
involved in the change process the possibility of bias exists. There was no evidence presented
from any other stakeholders in the process – other librarians, faculty, staff or students. The end
result was basically one person’s view as to whether a change initiative was successful.
Parsch and Baughman (2010) looked at the use of OD in ARL libraries. Organizational
development was defined as “a long term effort to increase the effectiveness and health of an
organization through planned interventions” (p. 5). OD usage was assessed through two separate
surveys. One survey was sent to ARL library directors and a second survey was sent to human
resources professionals (HR) and staff development officers of ARL libraries. The total number
of institutions to receive surveys was one hundred and twenty three. The director survey
consisted of seventeen questions; the HR survey was twenty six questions. Both surveys
consisted of yes/no, Likert type rankings, lists of choices, select all that apply and open-ended
questions. The response rate for the director survey was 30.9%, the response rate for the HR
survey was 30.1%.
Thirty seven of the 38 responding directors stated that their libraries were fully engaged
to partially engaged in OD which included such activities as “strategic planning, problem solving
tools, surveys and feedback tools, work redesign, managing change, team building, coaching,
succession planning, and staff development” (Parsch & Baughman, 2010, p. 6). In contrast only

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

108 | P a g e

twenty nine of thirty seven HR staff stated their university library was fully engaged to partially
engaged in OD activities. Eight HR staff stated their institution was not engaged in OD, only one
director stated his or her library was not engaged in OD. HR staff was asked about the types of
assessment tools used to measure change or improvement as a result of their OD efforts. Fifteen
(75%) stated their library used in-house assessment tools, twelve (60%) used commercial
products, and six (30%) used tools produced by another campus department. Outside assessment
tools included 13 institutions using LibQUAL (ARL service satisfaction survey), 5 using
ClimateQual (ARL organizational climate survey), 3 using the Leadership Practices Inventory
(Kouzes and Posner), 1 using Myers - Briggs Type Inventory, and 1 using the High Performing
Organization tool (Ken Blanchard). Other assessment practices included internal surveys (8),
general surveys (7), production statistics analysis (5), focus groups (5), performance reviews (3),
and observation (2) (Parsch & Baughman, 2010).
Parsch and Baughman (2010) concluded that “OD practices are being used informally
and in formal programs throughout academic libraries, to greater and lesser degrees” (p. 18).
“Deans considered their libraries as OD libraries more than HR professionals” (p. 18). The
authors hypothesized that deans used this term more loosely than HR professionals who may
look at OD from a purist’s perspective (p. 18). The authors made three additional observations:
“that developing the organization was emphasized over the development of the individual, that
organizational health also depends on the health of the individual, and that the highest ranked
response for the goals for OD was creating a flexible and agile organization” (p. 18).
This was well performed research which was informative about the current state of OD
use in ARL libraries. There were twelve tables that graphically depicted the survey findings and
the OD activities that were being performed. The surveys were not included but many of the

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

109 | P a g e

questions were referred to in the text. Supplementary data was also available online at the journal
web site. The only criticisms that can be made are that the response rates were somewhat low,
but not inordinately for an unsolicited survey, and that because only ARL libraries were
surveyed, the results cannot be generalized to smaller academic libraries.
Systems thinking. Systems thinking has been adopted by many library directors as a
tool for use in change management. Systems thinking involves looking at the organization as a
whole and understanding how things, regarded as systems, influence one another within that
whole. In an organization, such as an academic library, a system is the employees, structure, and
processes that work together to create the academic library environment. Systems thinking can
also be used as an approach to problem solving - problems are not seen as individual occurrences
but as parts of the overall system itself.
Somerville, Schader and Huston (2005) looked at systems thinking and its relationship to
library leadership. Utilizing a case study methodology they looked at how systems thinking had
been successfully utilized during a change initiative at California Polytechnic State University.
Systems thinking was defined as “organizational change informed and furthered, iteratively,
through identifying and framing questions, gathering and evaluating information, organizing and
synthesizing it, and, finally, presenting insights to inform and advise” (p. 214). The change
process was accomplished by using the Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) developed by Peter
Checkland. SSM “offers an excellent way of exploring purposes, employing a robust suite of
tools such as rich pictures, root definitions, and conceptual models to discover what is possible
given the history, culture, and politics of the problem situation (p. 216). The SSM methodology
seeks to clarify all the different perspectives of all possible stakeholders. Somerville, Schader,
and Huston (2005) found that in order for systems thinking to be effective, leadership is

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

110 | P a g e

necessary from all levels of the library not just from the top down. Results of the process
included more interaction between librarians and faculty about student assignments, more
paraprofessional involvement in reference service and the creation of a Learning Commons.
As evidence-based research, this article would be considered weak evidence. Not only
was it limited to the results of a change process at one particular library, but it was based only on
the opinion of two librarians who led the change process and a faculty co-author. Bias was a
strong possibility because it was in the researcher’s self-interest to proclaim his or her change
initiatives as being successful. The authors provided no evidence that service actually improved
as a result of the change initiatives. There was no evidence offered to back up their claims and
there was no information provided about other stakeholders – academic librarians, support staff,
faculty and students. Even a simple satisfaction survey from library users before and after the
change would have bolstered their claims. Unfortunately, nothing of the sort was supplied.
Appreciative inquiry. Appreciative inquiry (AI) is another technique for dealing with
change management. It also is related to transformational leadership because it “focuses first on
what is working particularly well in an organization instead of focusing on problems as in the
deficit thinking approach more often taken by organizations during the change management
process” (Kelly, 2010, p.165). AI is a four stage cycle involving discovery – appreciating,
dreaming – envisioning results, design – co-constructing, and destiny – sustaining. AI is not
linear but a flexible process – a broad framework to manage change. A relatively new model to
the library profession, AI has not been adopted by many libraries and is an area rife for further
study. As Kelly (2010) stated “given the long history of taking a problem solving approach, most
libraries would find applying AI effectively would require a considerable shift in the
organization’s values and beliefs in introducing change” (p. 173).

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

111 | P a g e

Schlosser (2011) documented in a case study a change initiative using AI at Ohio State
University (OSU) libraries. The planning process was called OSUL 2013. Appreciative inquiry
(AI) was used to lead the organizational change process. To begin the process thirty five staff
members attended a workshop conducted by Maureen Sullivan, an organizational development
consultant specializing in libraries. After the workshop six volunteers met to synthesize the
results and create themes. As a result of this process five goals were created: assessment (ideas
judged on merit and decisions based on evidence), collaboration, innovation, scholarly
communication, and ubiquity (materials and service available when needed). Five task forces
were created to prepare final reports on these goals. After the reports two implementation teams
were created which resulted in five pilot projects: adoption of AI process, create an OSU library
lab, create an online suggestion box, improve organizational communication, and create an
innovation seed fund program. All participants in the AI process were invited to evaluate it either
through paper surveys or online through a wiki. A wiki is a web-based application which allows
people to work on content in collaboration with others; it is often used for group project work.
Most evaluations were positive about the AI process. “Most of the negative comments dealt with
participants’ anxiety about the future of the process” (Schlosser, 2011, p. 162).
This article was not very valuable from an evidence-based perspective. Not only was it a
case study but it was authored by a leader of the OSUL organizational change process. Bias was
possible as it was in the author’s best interest to declare the process a success. There was no
assessment of whether service improved. The survey results which claimed stakeholders were
positive were not reported. Only 17% of OSU staff participated in the OSUL process which is a
very low rate of participation (Schlosser, 2011). Even the author admitted “many evaluations
stressed that greater participation would be necessary to keep the process going; others expressed

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

112 | P a g e

skepticism or cynicism about the libraries’ ability to change and the Executive Committee’s
commitment to doing so” (p. 162). Schlosser (2011) also admits that it was difficult or
impossible to measure whether the program was a success.
Organizational culture. Organizational culture is a key aspect of change management as
it may directly influence the reaction of employees to any change initiative. By their nature some
organizational cultures may be more open to change while other organizational cultures may be
resistant to change. Library directors often focus on changing the culture of an academic library
if they believe that culture is fostering resistance to change among the academic librarians who
work in that environment.
Shepstone and Currie (2008) looked at the organizational culture and climate of a
Canadian library by surveying staff members in the midst of a director initiated change initiative.
Research was conducted at the University of Saskatchewan Library using the Competing Values
Framework (CVF) originally created by Cameron and Quinn. They wished to measure the
current dominant culture and the preferred culture of the library. Shepstone and Currie (2008)
defined organizational culture as “a collective understanding, a shared and integrated set of
perceptions, memories, values, attitudes, and definitions that have been learned over time and
which determine expectations of behavior that are taught to new members in their socialization
into the organization” (p. 358). Librarian’s responses to the survey indicated the current library
culture was a Market culture. “A Market culture is characterized as a results-oriented workplace
where leaders drive the organization toward productivity, results and profit, an emphasis on
winning holds the organization together, the prevailing concern is on competitive actions and
achieving goals, targets and increasing its competitive position” (p. 360).
The preferred culture profile for the library was the Adhocracy culture. Shepstone and

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

113 | P a g e

Currie (2008) stated that adhocracy culture is “characterized by a dynamic, entrepreneurial and
creative workplace where people take risks, leaders are visionary and innovative, the
commitment to experimentation and innovation holds the organization together, readiness for
change and meeting new challenges is important and the emphasis is on being at the leading edge
of new knowledge, services and products” (p. 361). The methodology of this article was very
strong as the authors used a validated survey the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument
(OCAI). The response rate of 67% was good for a survey of this type. There were several helpful
tables and graphs including a breakdown of the response rate by library employee type, a sample
of the OCAI questions, and culture profiles by type of librarian (tenured/nontenured). There were
some issues, however. One of the authors was employed at the Saskatchewan Library, which
raises the possibility of bias. The research was conducted in only one library, making its
generalizability weak. Despite these issues, this was an important article as it is one of the few
examinations to date of organizational culture in an academic library in the midst of a change
initiative.
Assessment. Assessment of library services is the vital last step in change management
because it measures whether implemented changes have successfully improved services, lead to
cost savings, or improved work processes. Assessment can also be considered a leadership
competency. However, several studies have found assessment to be a neglected aspect of change
initiatives in academic libraries.
Lakos (2007) interviewed university library directors on their use of Evidence-based
Library Management (EBLM). Use of EBLM was measured as an aspect of leadership, as it
required creating a culture of assessment and risk-taking behavior. He conducted qualitative indepth interviews of library directors mostly from ARL libraries. The sample was non-random

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

114 | P a g e

and basically a convenience sample. He contacted thirty university library directors and campus
administrators for interviews and received positive responses from twenty-one. Seventeen phone
interviews were conducted and four were in person interviews. The author had three research
questions which were the focus of his inquiry dealing with data gathering and assessment, and
whether data-driven decisions were being made on a regular basis. He found that a culture of
assessment and data analysis was severely lacking in the academic library. In particular:
Directors expressed an awareness of their own personal difficulties with systematically
using data and analysis in their own decision-making processes. They acknowledged that,
even when they had a data framework, they did not use it while making decisions. They
wondered whether established work practices, such as relying on intuition and on
accepted assumptions, were more difficult to change and overcome than they originally
expected. They all agreed that the quality of decisions would be better, more reliable, and
more effective if based on actual data and trend analysis (p. 443).
Lakos (2007) also found that library directors “are slow in identifying external sources of
analytics, reports, and skills as alternatives for lack of local services” (p. 446). He did find one
university library that had created a dedicated team for assessment. This was an important article
as it reflects the practices in the largest and best funded academic libraries in the United States –
ARL libraries.
Strategic planning. Strategic planning is often used by library directors for creating a
sense of direction, and for making decisions on allocating resources to follow such a plan.
Academic libraries are often part of the strategic plan of the overall higher education
organization. Strategic planning is used to determine the future direction of the organization,
through goals and objectives. Library directors are often called on to create short term (1 -2
years) and long term (3-5 years) goals as part of the strategic planning process. Strategic
planning is often used to assist with change management as well.
Lee (1993) documented organizational change in the Harvard College libraries in a case

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

115 | P a g e

study that emphasized the importance of strategic planning during a radical change initiative.
“One of the first steps in the strategic planning process was developing a Vision Statement,
which was carried out in conjunction with revising the mission statement” (p. 226).
Organizational development was also found to be necessary to assist with the transition. A
restructuring of Harvard’s Widener Library resulted in plans to transfer over a million print
volumes to remote storage, made substantial cuts to print journal subscriptions, introduced
significant overall library budget cuts, and led to a substantial staff reorganization. Although Lee
(1993) reported many of the changes were positive, she also stated, “these mandated changes
were costly, time consuming, distracting, exhausting and painful to many” (p. 230). Twenty
librarians accepted an early retirement package which along with the reorganization resulted in
new leadership in over twelve key programs.
While a case study, this article was important as it documented an early change initiative
in academic libraries. Its evidence would have been of more value had it included a survey of
staff or users, or a qualitative measure such as interviews or a focus group. There was also no
hard evidence presented that the changes improved services or staff processes. However,
although Lee was an Associate Librarian at the Harvard College Libraries and a leader of the
change initiative it was an accurate portrayal of the issues that can be encountered during a
radical change process.
Learning organizations. Library directors often try to create what is referred to as a
learning organization. This term is applied to an organization that facilitates the learning of its
staff and continuously transforms itself. Senge (1990) stated that a learning organization has five
main features; systems thinking, personal mastery, mental models, shared vision and team

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

116 | P a g e

learning. Creation of such an environment is particularly appropriate in an organization which is
part of a higher education institution such as an academic library.
Giesecke and McNeil (2004) also looked at the transition to a learning organization. One
of the interesting things about the article was that it discussed the role of leaders in a learning
organization. Leaders must take on three roles in a learning organization: designer; teacher; and
steward. Designers are “responsible for building a foundation of core values and organizational
purpose” (p. 59). Teachers serve as coach and guide. Stewards are “responsible for protecting the
mission and ensuring the organizational values are understood and practiced” (p. 59). The article
also includes a case study of the creation of a learning organization at the University of Nebraska
– Lincoln (UNL).
The process of transitioning to a learning organization began with a new vision statement
and continued with staff training and development (Giesecke & McNeil, 2004). A consultant was
also brought in to train staff in learning organization principles. Individual learning for personal
mastery was also encouraged through staff sharing, committee membership, a campus mentoring
program, staff development workshops, and computer skills and training courses. Assessment of
the success of the learning organization implementation was made through staff development
program surveys and a campus wide survey conducted by the Gallup Corporation. Giesecke and
McNeil (2004) found in the Gallup survey that “most staff rated the Libraries as excellent or very
good on key learning organization concepts” (p. 66).
The major limitation of the research was that it was a case study on change at the UNL
library. As such, it may not be generalizable to the profession as a whole. Although there was

Review of the Research Propositions
These research propositions emerged from a systematic review of the literature.
1. Leader competencies associated with transformational leadership behaviors will be
preferred by academic librarians when being led through a change initiative over
transactional and task oriented behaviors.
2. Leader competencies associated with emotional intelligence will be preferred by
academic librarians when being led through a change initiative over transactional and
task oriented behaviors.
3. Strategies for dealing with radical change such as organizational development, systems
thinking, appreciative inquiry, creating a learning organization, re-organization of staff,
and the frequency and use of library services assessment are tools used by library
directors to lead academic librarians through a change initiative.
4. Organizational climate and changing the climate are often a focus of library directors as
they seek to diminish resistance to change among academic librarians.

Summary of the Systematic Review

Chapter 3 began with an introduction, a review of the purpose of the study, and a
restatement of the research question. The structure of the systematic review and the identification
of the theoretical lenses followed. The main content of the chapter was a critical review and
evaluation of the literature focusing on leader competencies as well as change management. The

chapter concluded with a review of the research propositions.
Chapter 4 presents an analysis and discussion of the evidence revealed by the systematic
review of the literature of leadership and management competencies. In-depth coding using the
qualitative data analysis software ATLAS-ti was used to uncover themes in the literature of fields
undergoing rapid change such as library science, nursing, information technology, management,
and the military. The analysis revealed that all four propositions were supported and one
unexpected finding was revealed. Conclusions are reached and alternative perspectives are
presented.

CHAPTER 4
ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
Introduction
The findings of the dissertation in relation to the research question will be analyzed and
discussed in this chapter. Chapter 1 introduced the topic, presented the research question, and
discussed the turbulent environment of change that exists in the academic library environment.
Chapter 2 described the methodology used to conduct the research for the dissertation. Chapter 3
presented the systematic review of the literature on leadership competencies and change
leadership. This chapter presents the in-depth findings of the systematic review uncovered
through meta-ethnographical analysis of the literature utilizing the qualitative data analysis
software ATLAS-ti. Through a three step coding process, themes which ran through the
literature were discovered and are explained in this chapter. After the findings are presented they
are summarized. Conclusions are expressed and alternate perspectives investigated. The chapter
concludes with a summary.

Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this research was to investigate leadership and management competencies
to discover which of these competencies were most important for library directors and senior
managers to master in order to lead academic libraries into the future. Without proper leadership
in this period of rapid change, academic libraries could become irrelevant in the higher education
landscape. Mastery of vital leadership and management competencies is the key to leading
academic libraries and librarians into a brighter future. In addition, leadership and management
competencies are also important in every field. Knowledge of which competencies are most

120 | P a g e

successful in leading change initiatives will be valuable to management practitioners and to
managers in every field of endeavor.

Presentation, Summary, and Analysis of the Findings
Introduction
The focus of this dissertation research was on the following research question: Which
leadership and management competencies are most vital for library directors and senior
managers to possess as they lead their organizations through the current uncertain climate into
the future? This research question was answered through an evidence-based analysis of the
literature of fields undergoing rapid change.
Four research propositions emerged from this systematic review of the literature:
Proposition 1: Leader competencies associated with transformational leadership behaviors will
be preferred by academic librarians when being led through a change initiative over transactional
and task oriented behaviors.
Proposition 2: Leader competencies associated with emotional intelligence will be preferred by
academic librarians when being led through a change initiative over transactional and task
oriented behaviors.
Proposition 3: Strategies for dealing with radical change such as organizational development,
systems thinking, appreciative inquiry, creating a learning organization, re-organization of staff,
and the frequency and use of library services assessment are tools used by library directors to
lead academic librarians through a change initiative.
Proposition 4: Organizational climate and changing the climate are often a focus of library
directors as they seek to diminish resistance to change among academic librarians.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

121 | P a g e

The analysis and discussion which follows was based upon and structured around these
four propositions, and upon the one unexpected finding that emerged from the systematic review
of the literature in Chapter 3.
Proposition 1: Transformational Leadership
Burns first proposed the theory of transformational leadership in relation to political
leaders such as President John F. Kennedy in his seminal work, Leadership (Burns, 1978). Burns
stated that the transforming leader “recognizes and exploits an existing need or demand of a
potential follower, but, beyond that, the transforming leader looks for potential motives in
followers, seeks to satisfy higher needs, and engages the full person of the follower; the result is
a relationship of mutual stimulation and elevation that converts followers into leaders and may
convert leaders into moral agents” (p. 4). However, it was Bass who built upon Burns’ theory,
applied it to management, and began to investigate it empirically. Bass and Riggio (2006)
believed that transformational leaders “help followers grow and develop into leaders by
responding to individual followers’ needs by empowering them and by aligning the objectives
and goals of the individual followers, the leader, the group, and the larger organization” (p. 3).
Although there have been different attempts to operationalize the various aspects or
facets of transformational leadership, the dimensions proposed by Bass are the most accepted
(Herold, Fedor, Caldwell & Yi, 2008). Bass proposed that there were four transformational
behaviors that leaders could practice: inspirational motivation, idealized influence, intellectual
stimulation, and individualized consideration (Bass & Bass, 2008). Bass also operationalized
Burns’ theory of transactional leadership proposing three transactional behaviors: contingent
reward, active management by exception, and passive management by exception (Bass & Bass,
2008). The major difference between Burns and Bass on transformational and transactional

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

122 | P a g e

leadership is that Burns saw them as separate and distinct constructs, while Bass considered the
two theories as related and as one part of a continuous spectrum (Golm, 2003).
Bass operationalized and measured transformational leadership through the Multifactor
Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) (Hater & Bass, 1988). Although Bass refers to questionnaire
items measured through the MLQ as factors or components they are essentially leadership and
management competencies (Avolio, Bass & Jung, 1999). Alire (2007) claimed that
transformational leadership should be the most effective leadership style for academic libraries
due to the need for constant change and adaptation. One of the propositions of this research was
that academic librarians would prefer transformational leadership behaviors when undergoing a
change initiative. It was uncovered during the coding process that this was indeed the case. Many
of the most important leadership and management competencies described in the literature are
related to Bass’ operationalization of transformational leadership. Figure 1 presents a concept
map of the competencies related to transformational leadership which were highly valued by
employees in the systematic review of the literature. Transactional leadership related
competencies are also identified. The four transformational behaviors of individualized
consideration, intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation, and idealized influence and their
related competencies are presented next. Finally, the transactional leadership related
competencies of reward and recognition are discussed.
Individualized consideration. Leadership competencies related to individualized
consideration which were highly valued included mentoring, empathy, listening, treating
followers with respect, and developing staff. The most highly valued of these competencies was

Figure 1: ATLAS-ti Network View of Leadership Competencies Associated with Transformational Leadership (Lewis, 2014)

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

124 | P a g e

mentoring or coaching. Mavrinac (2005) pointed to the importance of traditional mentoring,
especially for librarians in larger academic libraries with faculty status, as it plays a vital role in
the tenure process. Mentoring provides “career, psychosocial, and professional benefits, it is a
one-on-one, learner-centered relationship providing a safe context in which to express concerns,
fears, and aspirations (p. 397). Academic librarians prefer and value directors and senior
managers who are willing to engage in mentoring relationships with their staff. Mentoring also
plays a vital role in succession planning as directors train senior staff and give them with
leadership opportunities (Hernon, Powell & Young, 2001).
Chow and Rich (2013) identified two other leadership competencies highly valued by
academic librarians, empathy and listening. Empathy was defined by administrators as a “quality
that emphasizes compassion with a focus on people, openness to change and flexibility because
employees have lives and interests outside of work, and a need to recognize and be attuned to the
humaneness of people that allows one to hear both their words and body language” (p. 8).
Hopper (2005) pointed out that empathy does not prevent a leader from making uncomfortable
yet necessary decisions. Tough decisions such as terminating employment or making necessary
changes are made in as humane a manner as is possible. Listening is a competency which is
related to empathy because those leaders who focus on their followers and care about them are
also willing to listen to their opinions and concerns. Chow and Rich (2013) found that “listening
to and reflecting on others’ desires before deciding on what steps should be taken next and
maintaining open lines of communication” was a vital leadership competency especially in an
environment of rapid change (p. 8).
Intellectual stimulation. Bass’ operationalization of intellectual stimulation was
associated with three highly rated leadership competencies – creativity, problem solving, and

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

125 | P a g e

innovation. All three of these closely related competencies were highly ranked in the literature
but the most important competency was creativity. This leadership competency includes both
being creative and having the ability to engage in creative thinking. “Creative leaders have a
curious and playful outlook, which helps them perceive the world in new and interesting ways
they encourage and inspire innovation, imagination and out of the box thinking (O’Brien &
Robertson, 2009, p. 376). In an atmosphere of rapid and constant change such as academic
libraries the ability to engage in creative thinking and problem solving is a highly desirable
leadership competency.
The creativity competency was so highly valued because it directly relates to problem
solving. Mumford, Zaccaro, Johnson, Diana, Gilbert, and Threlfall (2000) combined these two
competencies into one meta-competency called creative problem solving. “Creative problem
solving involves a complex set of skills beginning with problem construction, where the
selection and screening of knowledge representations derived from past experiences is used to
define the nature of the problem structure, structure information search, and select concept
relevant concepts” (p. 18). This information can be used to reorganize or restructure existing
concepts and provide new understandings that enable innovative solutions. From creative
problem solving arises innovation. Shepstone and Currie (2008) linked organizational culture
and leadership to innovation stating that fostering and modeling innovative thinking was the
responsibility of the library director and senior managers and that it was their responsibility to
make sure that innovation was encouraged and absorbed at all levels of the organization. In a
rapidly changing environment leadership competencies such as problem solving, creativity, and
innovation are an essential part of any managerial tool kit.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

126 | P a g e

Inspirational motivation. Bass’ operationalization of inspirational motivation is related
to the most highly ranked leadership competencies found in the systematic review such as
communication, inspiring a shared vision, advancing the organizational mission, motivating
others, and inspiring others. Communication was the most highly valued leadership competency
of all two hundred competencies created in first stage coding. When combined with related
competencies such as listening, advocating, being articulate, collegiality, and building
relationships it was the most important meta-competency as well. Communication includes both
verbal and written communication skills but by far the most important aspect of communication
is oral communication ability. Communication is especially vital in periods of change. Improved
communication helps make followers more aware of the details of change occurring in an
organization and more aware of the effects of those changes on the organization (Crawley-Low,
2013). It is important that employees know that change is not being implemented for
insignificant reasons or to their detriment but rather that it is for the good of the organization.
Despite its importance it would appear that some library directors and senior managers are
lacking in communication skills. Buttlar and Dumont (1996) found a decrease in “peopleoriented skills such as guiding, communicating, and interacting with patrons and staff members,
and particularly those skills that help individuals cope with change” (p. 58). Lack of
communication between leaders and followers, especially during change initiatives, and its
attendant problems was a clear theme that ran through the literature.
Closely following communication was the ability to create a shared vision with one’s
followers. Creating a shared vision and being a visionary was the second most highly ranked
leadership competency during first stage coding. Creating a vision and getting one’s followers to
buy into that vision is at the heart of Bass’ conceptualization of transformational leadership.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

127 | P a g e

Vision is a quality administrators felt involves having a clear idea of what one wants to
accomplish within the context of the bigger picture and the library’s mission and overall
vision of the organization while also being attuned to the “here-and-now” issues necessary
to get there. This enables leaders to clearly articulate their vision that helps “set the tone”
for the entire organization and find balance between the overall broad direction of their
organization and the detailed daily goals that must come together for overall success to be
achieved. Library leaders with good vision must think globally, consider several steps
ahead when making plans, be a good thinker, and be able to produce ideas and vision that
resonate with others through his or her passion for the work (Chow & Rich, 2013, p. 8).
Staff must accept and actively work toward accomplishing the shared vision. If the vision is
ignored or actively fought against by the staff the vision can never be accomplished. Giesecke
and McNeil (2004) explained the importance of creating a shared vision:
The leadership of the organization cannot dictate a shared vision. Instead, the vision
develops from many people within the organization creating a picture of the future. All
members of the organization must understand and contribute to the vision. The vision has
to be meaningful to them and be something that relates to their individual visions of the
organization. By working together to create the vision and then working to incorporate that
vision into each unit or part of the organization, we can create a focus for the organization
that will guide all parts of the organization (p. 58).
Related to creating a shared vision is the advancement of the university mission. Much of
the vision will be related to the parent university’s mission of teaching and learning. “Growing
recognition of the critical role of the library organisation in achievement of the parent university
organisation's teaching and learning mission” is a crucial responsibility of the academic library
leader both with administrators and the library staff (Somerville, Schader & Huston, 2005, p.
221). Hernon, Powell and Young (2001) found that one of the most important considerations by
university provosts when hiring a library director is alignment with the university mission. One
provost commented that “candidates rarely appreciate that their professional qualifications are
generally not the deciding factors when a search committee is reviewing the top 10 applications,
all of whom have already met the search criteria, instead ability to embrace the institutional

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

128 | P a g e

mission and having talents/experiences that do not duplicate those already available on campus
are usually more important” (Fitsimmons, 2005, p. 74).
The final two leadership competencies associated with inspirational motivation are more
prosaic but still vitally important. Motivating and inspiring others are especially necessary during
periods of change. Squires (1993) found that managers were considered to be superior
performers by their supervisors if they possessed the ability to motivate their employees and give
them honest feedback. Transformational leaders have abilities that allow them to “provide a
supportive environment while motivating and inspiring followers to higher levels of personal
action and to achieve more than they thought possible” (Hernon & Rossiter, 2006, p. 273).
Inspiring followers is closely related to the building a shared vision competency, while
motivating followers is one of the prime competencies that a manager must possess. A motivated
and inspired work force is capable of achieving great things particularly in the midst of a change
process.
Idealized influence. Four leadership competencies were associated with Bass’
operationalization of idealized influence. Leaders who were regarded as possessing integrity and
having ethics or guided by ethical considerations were highly regarded. Leaders who were
charismatic and acted as role models were also highly valued. Integrity was the most highly
ranked leadership competency. Caldwell (2003) found that one of the most important
competencies for change leaders was integrity. Kowske and Anthony (2007) also found integrity
to be a highly ranked leadership competency in their investigation of global management
competencies. Leaders who “act with integrity demonstrated principled leadership and sound
business ethics, they showed consistency among principles and values, and built trust with others
through their own authenticity and follow-through on promises” (p. 26). Interestingly library

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

129 | P a g e

literature did not focus on integrity as often as the literature in other fields. It could not be
determined whether this is because the competency is less valued in librarianship or is just
assumed to be possessed.
Having ethics or being ethical was another highly valued leadership competency. Hicks
and Givens (2013) in their research on library core competencies discussed the importance of
principled transformational leadership. Kowske and Anthony (2007) found that in the United
States possessing a high degree of ethics was a highly valued leadership competency but it was
not as highly valued in some other cultures. Acting ethically toward employees during change
initiatives was also considered to be important. Caldwell (2003) stated that many change leaders
felt that acting ethically toward their employees was more important than crude self-interest or
responding to market driven competitive forces.
Charisma is a somewhat controversial topic in leadership. In an early investigation of
transformational leadership Roberts (1985) stated that charisma is an element in successful
change processes. Roberts (1985) concluded that the “transformative process was not dependent
on the charismatic qualities of the superintendent, but that charisma was born out of crisis, and
nurtured with a vision, mission, structure and process by an effective change agent” (p. 1042).
Yukl (1999) pointed out that there is a great deal of confusion about the relationship between
transformational and charismatic leadership. Some theorists treat the two theories as equivalent;
others, such as Bass, as “distinct but partially overlapping processes,” while others see the two
concepts as separate and “perhaps even incompatible” (p. 300). Charisma seems to be a helpful
but not completely necessary leadership competency. The idea of the charismatic leader who can
inspire everyone and solve every problem goes back to the great man theory of leadership and
has been mostly discredited (Caldwell, 2003). Having a commanding presence has also been

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

130 | P a g e

found to be a leadership competency. “Presence is a multifaceted capability, similar to charisma,
which enables leaders to captivate the attention of others and be completely focused in the
moment” (O’Brien & Robertson, 2009, p. 376). Age seemed to increase this competency which
was found to be lacking in younger study participants. While not highly ranked acting as a role
model was another leadership competency associated with idealized influence.
Transactional leadership. Transactional leadership was described by Bass and Riggio
(2006) as occurring “when the leader rewards or disciplines the follower, depending on the
adequacy of the follower’s performance” (p.8). Transactional leadership relies on contingent
rewards or on active/passive forms of management by exception. Bass and Bass (2008) defined
contingent reward as a constructive transaction. “The leader assigns a task or obtains agreement
from the follower on what needs to be done and arranges for psychological or material rewards
of followers in exchange for satisfactorily carrying out the assignment” (p. 623). Transactional
leadership can be effective in many circumstances. In many studies, contingent rewarding
correlates “almost as highly as transformational leadership with outcomes in effectiveness and
satisfaction” (p. 370). In many ways, transactional leadership makes an employee’s job simple –
the employee is told what to do and instructed how to do it. A good performance is rewarded and
bad performance is punished. Some employees enjoy this type of work environment – they know
exactly where they stand and little independent thought or initiative is required. However, for
more motivated and innovative employees, such an environment can become tedious and stifling.
Two leadership competencies associated with transactional leadership were highly ranked
in the systematic review – reward and recognition of staff accomplishments. Reward is a quite
simple competency based on the idea that most followers like to be praised when they do a good
job. Rewards do not have to be monetary or tangible mere acknowledgement of a job well done

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

131 | P a g e

is often enough. Parsch and Baughman (2010) found that simple ceremonies such as recognition
events for years of service awards and for librarians who receive promotions were important
motivators. Funds to support staff to obtain additional educational credentials were also rewards
that employees valued. Sherman et al. (2007) found that appreciation and recognition of
accomplishments were key to the retention of nurses. Galuska (2012) also stressed the
importance of reward and recognition for successful growth of nurses as study participants
claimed recognition reinforced learning and increased commitment to ongoing leadership
development.
Transactional leadership competencies such as reward and recognition can be important
to library directors and senior managers when trying to motivate academic librarians. In addition,
transactional leadership is often necessary when decisions must be made quickly and there is no
time for consensus building. Finally, small every day decision making is often best handled by
transactional leadership. Some decisions just aren’t important enough to require any other
leadership behavior. Managerial competencies often are related to transactional leadership. On
many occasions it is more appropriate to be a manager rather than a leader.
Proposition 2: Emotional Intelligence
Emotional intelligence is typically broken into four domains: self-awareness; selfmanagement; empathy; and interpersonal/social skills. Some scholars add a fifth domain of
motivation. Boyatzis, Goleman and Rhee (2000) developed the Emotional Competence
Inventory (ECI) to measure emotional intelligence. This inventory is essentially a list of
emotional intelligence competencies. In the library field al Ansari and al Khadler (2011) studied
leadership competencies of library professionals in Kuwait. A survey of over two hundred
informational professionals found that sixteen of the top twenty competencies were aligned with

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

132 | P a g e

Goleman’s domains of emotional intelligence. One of the propositions of this research was that
academic librarians would prefer leadership competencies associated with emotional intelligence
when undergoing a change initiative. The systematic review of the literature revealed that this
proposition was fully supported. Leadership competencies associated with the emotional
intelligence domains of self-awareness, self-management, empathy, and interpersonal/social
skills are discussed in the next section of the dissertation.
Self-awareness. “Leaders high in emotional self-awareness are attuned to their inner
signals, recognizing how their feelings affect them and their job performance. They are attuned
to their guiding values and can often intuit the best course of action, seeing the big picture in a
complex situation. Emotionally self-aware leaders can be candid and authentic, able to speak
openly about their emotions or with conviction about their guiding vision” (Goleman, 1998, p.
96). Seven leadership competencies associated with self-awareness were found during the
systematic review of the literature – being articulate, intuitiveness, self-confidence, resilience,
intelligence, sense of humor, and enthusiasm. The most highly rated competency was being
articulate. This competency is closely related to building a shared vision as being able to
articulate a vision and direction for the library or organization is how this competency is most
often described in the literature. Promis (2008) in an analysis of library director job
advertisements characterized this typical requirement as “the ability to thoughtfully articulate the
goals and work of the library to its several constituencies” (p. 27). Articulate in some articles
also refers to possessing good oral, written and communication skills. In this regard being
articulate is related to the communication competency. Figure 2 presents a concept map of the
competencies related to emotional intelligence which were highly valued in the systematic
review of the literature.

Figure 2: ATLAS-ti Network View of Leadership Competencies Associated with Emotional Intelligence (Lewis, 2014)

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

134 | P a g e

Intuitiveness or intuition was another highly rated leadership competency related to selfawareness. “Intuition is the ability to tap into our natural knowing capacity (e.g. internal sources
and tacit knowledge) to obtain knowledge without a logical explanation, it requires high levels of
somatic sensitivity and the ability to suspend judgment” (O’Brien & Robertson, 2009). Muller
and Turner (2010) described intuitiveness as the leader arriving at “clear decisions and being
able to drive their implementation in the face of incomplete or ambiguous information by using
both rational and emotional perceptions” (p. 447). Intuition/intuitiveness is in many ways the
opposite of assessment and evaluation which were also highly ranked leadership competencies.
However, intuitiveness was the lowest ranked competency in an investigation of the military by
Hawkins and Dulewicz (2007).
Self-confidence was another highly valued leadership competency associated with selfawareness. Self-confident leaders know their abilities and their weaknesses which allows them to
play to their strengths. Self-confident leaders enjoy a challenge and welcome difficult
assignments. Self-confident leaders often have a “sense of presence, a self-assurance that lets
them stand out in a group which also gives a sense of confidence to their followers” (Das & Das,
2010, p. 7). Sharing power and truth-seeking are other competencies associated with selfconfidence. Self-confident leaders have a “firm grasp of their own capabilities and those of
others; they apply the skill of candid self-analysis internally and externally and are unflinchingly
realistic” (Hopper, 2005, p. 11). The literature reveals that opportunities to practice leadership
and responsibility often lead to increased self-confidence as does leadership development
training (Crawley-Low, 2013; Galuska, 2012).
Resilience was another leadership competency associated with self-awareness. Resilience
refers to emotional resilience. Physical resilience was coded as stamina and was a seldom

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

135 | P a g e

mentioned competency. Emotional resilience is defined as the ability of a leader to be able to
maintain consistent performance in a range of situations. “He or she retains focus on a course of
action or the need to obtain certain results in the face of personal challenge or criticism” (Muller
& Turner, 2009, p. 447). “Resilient leaders bounce back from difﬁculties, cope well with crises
and sustain high energy levels under constant pressure” (O’Brien & Robertson, 2009, p. 376).
O’Brien and Robertson (2009) found that resilience decreases with age. Perhaps unsurprisingly
Hawkins and Dulewicz (2007) found that emotional resilience was the most important leadership
competency for Scottish police officers. It was also a highly ranked competency for nurses
(Sherman et al., 2007). Library literature listed emotional resilience as an important leadership
competency but not at the level of other fields. The lack of a life or death nature to librarianship
probably accounts for this difference with policing and nursing.
Intelligence or intellect was also a highly valued competency related to self-awareness.
Hernon and Rossiter (2006) defined intelligence as the “cognitive ability to deal with complex
scenarios and situations” (p. 263-264). Kreitz (2009) found intelligence was the most highly
ranked leadership competency for senior managers in her inquiry into emotional intelligence
competencies in academic libraries. Interestingly it was ranked in the middle of library director
competencies. Mahmoodi and King (1991) listed both leadership and management competencies
under their meta-competency cognitive skill. Included under cognitive skill were such
competencies as “processing information effectively, learns quickly, utilizes own learning style,
draws accurate conclusions from financial, numerical, and statistical material, recognizes subtle
relationships and new patterns in information, and uses mathematical and statistical techniques to
manipulate data” (p. 30-31). If knowledge is included with intellect then it becomes one of the
most important leadership competencies.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

136 | P a g e

Possessing a good sense of humor was a sometimes highly valued competency related to
self-awareness. Some studies found sense of humor to be an important leadership competency
while other studies put it at the bottom of the rankings. This is an interesting competency
because it is one that cannot be learned. You are either born with a sense of humor or are
humorless. Library directors listed possessing a sense of humor as an important leadership
competency for ARL library directors (Hernon, Powell & Young, 2002). Hopper (2005) found it
the fifth most important self-awareness leadership competency in her content analysis of library
leadership literature. It would seem that having a good sense of humor can be a useful
competency but probably not one that is essential.
Being enthusiastic or possessing abundant enthusiasm was also a highly valued
competency related to self-awareness. Jordan (2012) found that public librarians ranked the
enthusiasm competency at a lower level as their years of experience increased. One could
surmise that more experienced librarians had less enthusiasm for the job and therefore
considered it to be a less important competency. Young, Hernon and Powell (2006) found that
GenX librarians ranked enthusiasm in the 2nd quartile of personal attributes they desired in a
library director. Enthusiasm was found to be a key competency of change leadership (Higgs &
Rowland, 2000). Finally, Kowske and Anthony (2007) listed enthusiasm as a global leadership
competency particularly related to motivating others.
Self-management. The emotional intelligence domain of self-management is also often
called self-regulation. “Leaders with emotional self-control find ways to manage their disturbing
emotions and impulses, and even to channel them in useful ways. A hallmark of self-control is
the leader who stays calm and clear-headed under high stress or during a crisis – or who remains
unflappable even when confronted by a trying situation” (Goleman, 1998, p. 98). Six leadership

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

137 | P a g e

competencies were associated with the emotional intelligence self-management domain –
flexibility, adaptability, initiative, integrity, ethics, and fairness. Flexibility was the most highly
valued leadership competency associated with self-management. Being flexible is essential in an
environment of rapid change. Ammons-Stephens et al. (2009) identified flexibility as the most
important leadership competency for the library profession. Interviewees who were part of
disaster response teams at academic libraries claimed the ability to be flexible, and most
importantly being given the freedom to be flexible, was the most important competency that
contributed to their successful efforts (Wilkinson, 2012). Finally, flexibility is a vital competency
when dealing with other cultures. One participant in Bueno and Tubb’s (2012) investigation of
global leadership competencies commented “negotiating with people from different countries is
difficult because of cultural aspects. The way I believe I managed to do it was being flexible not
only on the negotiation matter, but trying to understand the culture and adapt my behavior to it”
(p. 219).
Closely related to flexibility is adaptability which was another highly rated leadership
competency related to self-management. “When a sudden unusual event threatens to disrupt
normal operations a rapid but appropriate response is needed to minimize the adverse effects on
the organization. How well a leader handles these immediate crises is an indication of their
adaptability” (Yukl & Mahsud, 2010, p. 82). The three most important competencies of a
successful director were found to be “flexibility, adaptability, and a willingness to accept change
as a way of life” (Hernon, Powell & Young, 2001). Caldwell (2003) found adaptability to be a
key competency in his analysis of change managers and change leaders. Adaptability was
mentioned as a key competency in almost every discussion of change agency. Kowske and

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

138 | P a g e

Anthony (2007) ranked demonstrating adaptability as the third most important competency in
their examination of global leadership competencies.
Displaying initiative was another highly rated leadership competency related to selfmanagement. “Leaders who have a sense of self-efficacy, that believe they have what it takes to
control their own destiny usually display initiative. Leaders with initiative seize opportunities or
create them rather than simply waiting. Such a leader does not hesitate to cut through red tape, or
even bend the rules, when necessary to create better possibilities for the future” (Goleman, 1998,
p. 99). Young, Hernon and Powell (2006) found that GenX librarians ranked initiative in the 1st
quartile of personal attributes they desired in a library director. Initiative was the 4th highest
ranked self-management competency in Hernon and Rossiter’s (2006) article on emotional
intelligence competencies important to ARL library directors. Similarly to transformational
leadership, being ethical and having integrity were also highly ranked competencies related to
emotional intelligence. The final competency related to self-management was being fair or
treating followers with fairness. This competency was not as highly ranked as the other
competencies related to self-management.
Building relationships. The emotional intelligence domain of relationship building was
associated with six competencies – fundraising/resource gathering, collaboration, changing the
culture, staff development, consensus building, and networking. Fund raising/resource gathering
was the most highly ranked competency related to relationship building. This competency relates
to several different financial aspects of academic library management. Fundraising deals with
development and cultivating donors to give gifts. Also included under this competency is grant
writing activities. Finally, resource gathering deals with the activities of the library director
which lead to increased funding from the parent institution. “Library leaders are increasingly

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

139 | P a g e

being called on to identify and cultivate external resources and solicit resources to support
library and information services and programs” (Winston & Dunkley, 2002, p. 171-172).
Fundraising has become a very important activity for directors of large research libraries,
and even small academic library directors are expected to bring in occasional grants and small
gifts. Winston and Dunkley (2002) found in their analysis of library director job advertisements
that fundraising, development and donor relationship building were becoming an important part
of library director activities, but concluded that most directors lacked these competencies and
found developing them challenging. Directors at private institutions are expected to engage in
more fundraising activities than those at public schools (Hernon, Powell & Young, 2001). The
ability to be successful in securing resources—funds, technology, staffing, etc. was the most
highly ranked managerial competency by GenX librarians (Young, Hernon & Powell, 2006).
Fundraising was seldom mentioned in the other fields studied rather a similar competency
managing resources was considered important in these fields.
Closely following fundraising as an important leadership competency was collaboration.
This competency covers being able to work well with others, and being able to build
relationships with other constituencies both on and off-campus. Promis (2008) found
collaboration and cooperation the second most frequently cited competency in her review of
emotional intelligence in academic libraries. “Collaboration encompasses collegiality,
participation, inclusiveness, shared decision-making, shared goals, and partnership” (p. 28).
Holloway (2004) found that one of the impacts of increased organizational development in
academic libraries was more team building and collaborative work. One of the goals of OSUL
2013, the organizational change process at Ohio State University Libraries, was increased
collaboration between individuals and work units (Schlosser, 2011). Kowske and Anthony

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

140 | P a g e

(2007) found in their investigation of global leadership competencies that both individualistic
and collectivistic cultures highly value collaboration and teamwork supporting the theory that
globalization has led to highly ranked competencies being similar in all cultures.
Having the ability to change the culture is a highly ranked leadership competency in all
the fields included in this dissertation. Much of the literature on academic libraries dealing with
change highlights culture change as a vitally important aspect of the transformation process.
“Changes in the culture of an organization are first seen as changes in the behaviours and
attitudes of employees, and occur over time as basic assumptions are changed” (Crawley-Low,
2013, p. 72). Kreitz (2009) found being able to change or shape a library’s culture was a top five
leadership competency for library directors. Fitsimmons (2005) found that experience in
changing a library’s culture was the third most important competency a library director must
possess to be effective. Wren and Dulewicz (2005) in their survey of the Royal Air Force found
that the second most important leadership competency was the ability to adjust work culture to
meet the long-term needs of the desired change. Crawford and Nahmias (2010) in their analysis
of change competencies found that the most important factor in success was changing behaviors
and the organizational culture to achieve goals.
Another important leadership competency associated with building relationships was
staff development. For a library director assisting academic librarian learning, growth, and
professional development is an important competency. Staff development is also an important
component in succession planning. Developing others was not an important competency for
project managers but was in the military (Muller & Turner, 2010; Wren & Dulewicz, 2005).
Developing people was a top ranked competency in the nursing literature (Jennings, Scalzi,
Rodgers & Keane, 2007). Sherman, Bishop, Eggenberger and Karden (2007) found being

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

141 | P a g e

connected with staff and seeing them develop were key satisfiers for both experienced and
inexperienced nurse managers. Hawkins and Dulewicz (2007) found that although developing
others was a low ranked competency those leaders who ranked high in this competency were the
most highly ranked managers in 360 degree performance reviews.
Consensus building was another highly ranked competency associated with building
relationships. Kreitz (2009) found that building consensus was an important competency for
senior managers but not for library directors. Mumford et al. (2000) found that consensus
building was an important leadership competency related to problem solving as convincing peers
and subordinates was an important part of developing and implementing solutions. Finally,
networking was another important competency associated with building relationships. Caldwell
(2003) found networking to be a key competency possessed by change managers. Higgs and
Rowland (2000) found networking to be an important competency that supported change
leadership. In the nursing literature Sherman et al. (2007) found that nurse managers needed to
establish effective networks with professional colleagues within and outside the organization.
Networking was not as highly valued in the library literature.
Interpersonal competence/social skill. The final domain of emotional intelligence is
interpersonal competence/social skill. There were four leadership competencies associated with
interpersonal competence – team building, valuing diversity, being accessible/approachable, and
being open to new ideas. Team building is a “strength of leaders who are able to generate an
atmosphere of friendly collegiality and are themselves models of respect, helpfulness, and
cooperation. Team builders draw others into active, enthusiastic commitment to the collective
effort, and build spirit and identity. Leaders with the leadership competency of team building
spend time forging and cementing close relationships beyond mere work obligations” (Goleman,

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

142 | P a g e

1998, p. 99). Caldwell (2003) named team building as the second most important competency for
change managers. Kreitz (2009) listed teambuilding as a top five leadership competency for
senior managers but not for library directors. Similarly, Promis (2008) found team building to be
a highly valued competency for department heads and associate directors but not for library
directors.
Team building is a highly valued competency in libraries that have a clan culture. Clan
culture is characterized by an emphasis on team building, team work, consensus, participation,
and concern for people (Kaarst-Brown, Nicholson, von Dran, & Stanton, 2004). The clan culture
is one that is preferred by most academic librarians but the hierarchical and market cultures tend
to be the norm (Shepstone & Currie, 2008). To reach a clan culture training in team building is
necessary for both leaders and followers making this a key competency for academic library
leaders. Parsch and Baughman (2010) found organizational development and team building to be
well underway in their look at OD use in academic libraries. The trend of academic libraries to
move away from hierarchical organizations toward a team environment will only increase the
importance of this competency in the future.
Valuing diversity is another highly ranked leadership competency related to social skills.
The library profession has a long history of valuing and encouraging diversity in its ranks a trend
that continues today. In 1999, ALA created a Core Values Task Force which identified 11 values
embraced by the library profession, one of which was “values and supports diversity through
resources and services” (Mavrinac, 2005, p. 395). Hernon, Powell and Young (2001) found
supporting diversity a frequently mentioned competency in library director job advertisements.
Gen-X academic librarians listed sensitivity to diversity as a second quartile competency in their
desired managerial attributes of library directors (Young, Hernon & Powell, 2006). Respect for

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

143 | P a g e

individuality was the fifth highest ranking competency in Hernon and Rossiter’s (2006)
investigation of EI competencies of library directors. Interestingly, Fitsimmons (2005) found a
significant difference in commitment to diversity between public institutions (8.10 mean) and
private institutions (7.66 mean). This was the largest spread between all the competencies by
institution type. Interestingly, none of the literature from other fields studied listed diversity as an
important competency except in regard to the effects of globalization on the workplace.
Accessibility and approachability was also a highly ranked leadership competency related
to social skills. “Accessible to others might be seen in a library director who by and large
responds enthusiastically to unexpected interruptions in her daily activities or unexpected
demands for her attention; a director who makes the time to wander through the library and greet
patrons and staff” (Hopper, 2005, p. 14). Being accessible was a highly ranked leadership
competency for ARL library directors (Hernon, Powell & Young, 2002). Accessibility is
probably more valued in large research libraries because the director tends to have little day-today interaction with their staff. Accessibility was ranked in the second quartile by Gen-X
librarians as well (Young, Hernon & Powell, 2006). Face-to-face contact is a characteristic
valued by the Gen-X generation. Accessibility was also a highly ranked competency for senior
managers (Kreitz, 2009). Approachability was a highly ranked competency of nurse managers
(Sherman et al., 2007). No other field mentioned accessibility/approachability as an important
leadership competency.
The final leadership competency associated with social skills was being open to new
ideas. “By being open-minded and receptive to everybody’s ideas, a leader may find that he will
get more creative solutions to the problems his organization faces than if he were using a
homogenous group where everybody comes from the same background” (Bueno & Tubbs, 2012,

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

144 | P a g e

p. 220). Caldwell (2003) found openness to ideas was a vital leadership competency for both
change leaders and change managers. Kowske and Anthony (2007) discovered fostering open
communication was a global leadership competency. Staying open to new ideas and approaches
was an important competency for nurse managers (Sherman et al., 2007). Surprisingly, being
open to new ideas was not an important competency in library literature, in fact it was never
mentioned at all.
Proposition 3: Change leadership strategies
One of the propositions for this research was that strategies for dealing with radical
change such as assessment of the frequency and use of library services, organizational
development, creating a learning organization, systems thinking, appreciative inquiry, and reorganization of staff are tools used by library directors to lead academic librarians through a
change initiative. The systematic review and coding of the literature found that to be the case.
How to successfully lead change is an important competency in every field. “It is widely
accepted that the majority of change initiatives fail to meet their stated goals, indeed, some
estimates of successful change in Fortune 1,000 companies are as low as 50% or even 20%”
(Wren & Dulewicz, 2005, p. 296).
Academic library directors employ a variety of strategies to accompany change initiatives
and to try to assure their success. Assessment/evaluation of library services is a strategy
frequently employed by library directors to initiate change. Assessment is often linked to the
university mission, and used by “libraries and institutions to question which services and
programs they should provide, which ones are most significant, and how they can better allocate
scarce resources to the most significant programs and services” (Hernon, Nitecki & Altman,
1999, p. 10). Another frequently employed technique is organizational development (OD).

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

145 | P a g e

Hawthorne (2004) stated most “OD initiatives within libraries grow out of change management
efforts when libraries seek to restructure organizations, redesign jobs and work, improve
processes and workflow, and increase performance capabilities in order to enhance the
organization’s ability to survive and thrive in a world of change” (p. 174). The creation of a
learning organization to assist with change is another method commonly employed during
change initiatives. Creating a learning organization only works when the “library staff act as
learning agents for the library—that is, when they are responding to changes in the internal and
external environments of the library” (Riggs, 1997). Top down directives to commence
organizational learning will fail if the library staff does not buy into the concept.
Associated with learning organizations is systems thinking. The systems thinking
approach is comprised of an iterative four stage process – finding out, modeling, comparison,
and taking action (Somerville & Howard, 2008). It can assist with productive change initiatives
if properly implemented. Appreciative inquiry is another technique which focuses on what is
done best by an organization and applies these strengths to change. “Appreciative inquiry
ensures that vital elements of exploration and discovery stimulate insights to reveal new
potentialities and possibilities which can build on earlier successes and strengths” (Somerville &
Farner, 2012). Staff reorganizations are often undertaken as part of a change initiative. Staff
reorganizations occur for many reasons including attempts to better address user needs, adapt to
changes in library collections, and to reallocate resources to new, developing areas in
librarianship (Baillargeon & Carlstrom, 2013). The relationship between these six techniques is
displayed in Figure 3.

Figure 3: ATLAS-ti Hypertext View of Competencies Associated with Change Leadership (Lewis, 2014)

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

147 | P a g e

Assessment/evaluation. Assessment of library services was the most heavily used
competency to accompany change initiatives. Evaluation of circulation, reference, collection
development, and database usage statistics is often the starting point for a change initiative.
However, assessment or evaluation of current services is often lacking or resisted by library staff.
Lakos (2007) pointed out that:
(l)ibrary leaders have succeeded in their careers without having an assessment
framework. This may be one of the main reasons for the slowness in creating local
structures for analytics. Past managerial success and entrenched management structures
and workflows may account for the challenges posed to library leaders in integrating
available data and analytics into their decision-making frameworks (p. 446).
While many academic libraries have begun to develop a “culture of assessment”, many others
continue to lag behind. Another issue is that while many libraries gather statistics, they often fail
to utilize them when making decisions. Lakos (2007) stated:
(s)ome directors expressed an awareness of their own personal difficulties with
systematically using data and analysis in their own decision-making processes. They
acknowledged that, even when they had a data framework, they did not use it while
making decisions. They wondered whether established work practices, such as relying on
intuition and on "accepted" assumptions, were more difficult to change and overcome
than they originally expected (p. 443).
The systematic review revealed that evidence-based decision making is still a competency that is
underutilized in most academic libraries.
Organizational development. As shown in Figure 3, a heavily utilized leadership
competency in academic libraries is organizational development. Organizational development
(OD) is “an ongoing, thoughtfully planned effort by all members of an organization to improve
how that organization operates, serves its stakeholders, fulfills its mission and approaches its
vision” (Stephens & Russell, 2004, p. 241). OD is often supported in large academic research
libraries by a staff member who is dedicated to that purpose (Holloway, 2004). The main reason

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

148 | P a g e

academic libraries have adopted OD as a change driver is the impact of technology on work
processes. Other drivers were budget cuts, customer needs, organizational structure, and culture
change. Libraries have adopted different approaches to organizing their OD efforts: the three
most commonly adopted models have been Galbraith’s Star, the Balanced Scorecard, and Hoshin
Planning.
Organizational development has been heavily utilized in large academic libraries but it is
more informally used in medium and small libraries (Parsch & Baughman, 2010). While often
utilized, organizational development implementation can often be lacking. One issue with
organizational development is that it tends to benefit the library not the librarian - “developing
the organization is emphasized over the development of the individual” (p. 18). The other is that
more assessment measures need to be undertaken on OD efforts to determine how they impact
both the library and the staff. Despite these issues organizational development is an often used
leadership competency in academic libraries and one which is only going to grow in importance
in the future.
Learning organization. The creation of a learning organization was another leadership
competency practiced by library directors when leading a change initiative.
The learning organization is predicated upon the notion that organizational learning
occurs through individuals and teams, that learning is a natural and normal human want,
and that learning must be ubiquitous, boundary-less, horizontal in nature, and span all
employee groups in the context of an open and supportive environment. In practical
terms, learning must be made operational and in alignment with the organization’s
structure, processes, rewards, underlying assumptions, values, attitudes, and behaviors in
order to support this cultural change (Mavrinac, 2005, p.392).

The adoption of a learning organization model is often associated with the creation of leadership
and management competencies in academic libraries (Winston & Dunkley, 2002). Leaders in
learning organizations must be prepared to take on three roles for the model to be successful –

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

149 | P a g e

designer, teacher, and steward (Giesecke & McNeil, 2004). As designer the leader is responsible
for focusing on core values such as quality customer service. As teacher the leader serves as a
mentor or coach. As steward the leader assures that the organizational mission is understood and
practiced by the followers.
One of the keys to implementing and successfully using the learning organizational
model is that learning must take place and be supported at all levels of the organization
(Caldwell, 2003). This can often be an issue in academic libraries as para-professional staff are
often treated as second class citizens and seldom given the development opportunities provided
to degreed librarians. This is not just an issue in librarianship, the nursing profession experiences
similar problems. “When investment in learning is limited to a small number of individuals, the
learning can be lost, reducing the dissemination of learning more broadly” (Galuska, 2012, p.
341). Nursing experiences high staff turnover due to the heavy workload demands and stressful
working conditions. Loss of individuals who have been developed as leaders with the proper
competencies can often damage the learning organizational model.
Systems thinking. Another leadership competency identified in Figure 3 often employed
by library directors during change initiatives was systems thinking. Leaders who engage in
systems thinking “view the organization in its entirety and ensure that each part realizes that, by
itself, it cannot achieve the systems' mission and that each part depends on the other parts to
understand people and why they behave as they do, the variability of work, how people learn and
develop, and interactions among systems, variability, learning, and human behavior” (Hernon,
Powell & Young, 2001, p. 141). The systems thinking competency allows a leader to “see the
bigger picture, to see the interrelationships of a system, and to move beyond a simple cause and
effect approach to actually seeing continuous processes” (Giesecke & McNeil, 2004, p. 58). In

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

150 | P a g e

systems thinking the individual parts of a system are less important than understanding that the
interaction of those parts is what is most important.
The obvious disadvantage of systems thinking is the all too common approach of treating
employees as mere cogs in the machine instead of human beings with needs and wants. Phipps
(2004) pointed out that:
(d)esign of new systems requires broad organizational and human resource knowledge.
Systems that are deeply embedded in a hierarchical culture are not easy to replace. A
feeling of loss, a sense of confusion, and lack of understanding of the reasons for change
often lead to difﬁculties in the implementation period. Constant assessment and
reﬁnement of the system are required (p. 74).
Library directors who look at the library environment as a system made up of
interchangeable parts will quickly ruin the morale of their followers. It is true the library as an
organization is a system, but it is a system which has at its core the skills, abilities, talents, and
competencies possessed by the academic librarians that make up that system. The key to the
systems thinking leadership competency is that the leader is not only able to see the big picture,
but also the small picture – the effect of systems changes on individuals.
Appreciative inquiry. The final leadership competency that was often practiced by
library directors during change initiatives was appreciative inquiry. Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is
a specific technique for leading change and it focuses on finding what is done the best within an
organization and seeks to build on those strengths. “AI is a form of transformational inquiry that
selectively seeks to locate, highlight, and illuminate the ‘life-giving’ forces of an organization’s
existence” (Kelly, 2010, p. 164). The positive outlook of appreciative inquiry often leads to
engaged and inspired followers. Learning from positive experiences and applying those lessons
to new situations and problems is a leadership competency that is extremely powerful. However,
it was the least used change leadership competency in the systematic review.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

151 | P a g e

Staff reorganizations. Frequent staff reorganizations are a fact of life in 21st century
academic libraries. Although there are many reasons for these reorganizations the main drivers
are budget cuts and technological change. Many libraries have reorganized their structure in
response to these changes. Chan and Soong (2011) reported that in a survey of ARL libraries
17 had completed a library-wide reorganization, while 34 had completed the reorganization of
specific units. “In total, 51 percent attributed their organizational changes to information
technology, while 46 percent noted declining resources as an important force influencing
change” (p. 23). Reorganizations to adapt to the impact of technology are often a worthwhile
endeavor, however, if reorganizations are improperly handled the impact on library staff is often
extreme and demoralizing. Even wealthy institutions such as Harvard are not immune. A 2010
reorganization plan with the goal to move forward effectively in the face of technological change
and financial challenge resulted in cutting almost one-third of the library workforce (Goldberg,
2012). It also resulted in some bad publicity for Harvard as library staff attending a town hall
type meeting tweeted they were being fired as the meeting was ongoing, and students conducted
protest marches.
Like all management techniques the six strategies for change leadership addressed in this
dissertation can be either beneficial or harmful to academic libraries and their staffs depending
on whether they are implemented properly or in a ham-handed manner. The success of these
change initiatives also depends on library directors and senior managers acting with empathy
toward their employees and providing the support necessary to make change effective. Improper
use of change leadership techniques can lead to demoralized staff and poor service to faculty and
students.

Proposition 4: Organizational Climate and Culture Change
The last proposition that library directors often focused on the organizational climate and
changing the climate was also supported by the evidence uncovered in the systematic review.
Organizational climate was one of the most often used codes during first stage coding in
ATLAS-ti, Organizational culture can be defined as a
collective understanding, a shared and integrated set of perceptions, memories, values,
attitudes and definitions that have been learned over time and which determine
expectations (implicit and explicit) of behavior that are taught to new members in their
socialization into the organization. It is the organizational culture that gives identity,
provides collective commitment, builds social system stability and allows people to make
sense of the organization. Organizational culture plays a critical role in creating a work
environment where employees are committed and contribute to the success of the
organization (Shepstone & Currie, 2008, p. 358).
The evidence revealed that understanding an organization’s climate and culture is the key to
enacting meaningful change. Library directors ranked understanding the culture of an
organization the most important factor to be considered when making a decision (Dole, Hurych
& Liebst, 2005).
Organizational climate is so important that the Association of Research Libraries (ARL)
has developed a survey called ClimateQUAL to measure it. The Organizational Climate and
Diversity Assessment (ClimateQual) measures “library staff perceptions concerning their
library's commitment to organizational policies and procedures, principles of diversity, and staff
attitudes” (Parsch & Baughman, 2010, p. 4). Mavrinac (2005) stated:
Organizational culture is inextricably linked to transformational change. Altering the
culture of an organization, the underlying assumptions that drive “how things are done
around here” at every level of the organization, is extremely difficult. There is a strong
relationship between the success of the change initiative and its alignment with the
existing organizational culture. There is an element of paradox in this when one
remembers that a characteristic of transformational change is the alteration of the culture
of the organization. Schein considers culture the “most stable and least malleable” part of
the organization, adding to the challenge of effecting deep and pervasive transformational
change (p. 393).

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

153 | P a g e

In particular large academic libraries often have a rigid and inflexible culture which is
resistant to change. In smaller libraries academic librarians are used to wearing many hats and
perform many different duties. In large academic libraries staff are able to specialize in one area.
Changing that area of specialization is extremely traumatic and often will be resisted.
In such an atmosphere library directors will often focus on changing the culture.
“Changes in the culture of an organization are first seen as changes in the behaviours and
attitudes of employees, and occur over time as basic assumptions are changed” (Crawley-Lowe,
2013, p. 72). Transformational leadership and emotional intelligence related competencies are
valuable when attempting to change the culture of an academic library (Hernon & Rossiter,
2006). Kreitz (2009) found that library directors ranked changing culture as the fourth most
important leadership competency for library directors. Achieving long lasting, permanent
culture change is difficult if not impossible. Library directors who have the ability to change the
culture of an organization possess an extremely high ranked and valued leadership competency.
Additional Proposition Finding: Competencies Are Universal
One of the more interesting findings of this research involved the universality of
leadership and management competencies. The systematic review of the literature and related
coding of competencies revealed that competencies deemed important in one field were also
deemed important in the other fields included in the research. This finding would seem to
support the theory of convergence proposed by Gentry and Sparks (2012) who hypothesized that
globalization would lead to homogenization of leadership competencies despite differences in
national culture. Technological convergence has also been theorized as a driver in the
standardization of leadership competencies (Hacklin, Adamsson, Marxt, & Margareta, 2005).

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

The only leadership and management competencies that were not transferable between
fields were specific knowledge related competencies. In librarianship these would include
competencies such as budgeting, technology skills, information literacy, collection development,
reference interviewing and cataloging. Even some of these knowledge based competencies
would be useful in other fields. Budgeting, technology skills, and even information literacy have
application to other fields. Only collection development, reference interviewing, and cataloging
have no applicability to other fields. An examination of the top leadership and management
competencies supported this contention. All of the leading competencies are presented in Table
2. They are applicable in almost any setting or organization.

During second stage coding, related competencies were combined to create metacompetencies. Combining the occurrences of these related competencies led to the creation of a
ranked list of leadership and management meta-competencies regardless of field.
Leadership and leadership competencies were the most desired competencies in the
systematic review. Ammons-Stephens et al. (2009) stated:

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

(t)he success of libraries as organizations is determined by the actions of the individuals
who work in those libraries; the success of those individuals in carrying out the missions
of those libraries is in large measure a reflection of the type and quality of leadership.
Successful library leaders demonstrate certain skills that are instrumental in the delivery
of desired outcomes. We usually think of the demonstration of these skills as
competencies (p. 63).
All of the fields included in the systematic review highly valued leadership and leadership
competencies. The most closely related competencies to leadership and leadership competencies
are displayed in Table 3 using code co-occurrence coefficients calculated in ATLAS-ti.

The second most valued leadership competency as shown in Table 3 was communication
and related competencies such as listening, being articulate, and being persuasive.
Communication means listening to and reflecting on others’ desires when deciding on what
steps should be taken next. Library leaders must communicate ideas that make sense and
inspire others while at the same time being extremely efficient and effective in how they
communicate. They must also be willing to listen and network with others, maintain open
lines of communication, and have strong presentation, writing, and listening skills. As one
administrator put it, “good communication skills help administrators realize the full
potential of the staff.” They also must maintain a good rapport with those that work in the

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

library tangentially and consistently network with employees, colleagues, and other
institutions (Chow & Rich, 2013, p.8).

Teamwork and collaboration as shown in Table 5 were the next most highly ranked
management and leadership competencies in the systematic review.
The theme of teamwork and collaboration, which can be described as a cooperative or
coordinated effort on the part of a group of persons acting together as a team or in the
interests of a common cause, was by far the most common and arguably the most powerful
theme that emerged in the interviews and focus groups as well as in the documents and
artifacts at both institutions. This finding was not especially surprising to me given that I
was interviewing disaster team members; however, what proved intriguing to me was that
when the concept of leadership was discussed – almost without exception – it was either in
the context of teamwork and collaboration or initiative and did not emerge as a separate
major stand-alone theme (Wilkinson, 2012, p. 141).

Creativity, innovation, and creative problem solving as shown in Table 6 were the fourth
most highly ranked leadership and management competencies in the systematic review.
Like other researchers, we define creativity as the production of novel and useful ideas in
any domain. We define innovation as the successful implementation of creative ideas
within an organization. Thus no innovation is possible without the creative processes that
mark the front end of the process: identifying important problems and opportunities,
gathering information, generating new ideas, and exploring the validity of those ideas
(Amabile et al., 1996, p. 1).

Building a shared vision and being visionary as shown in Table 7 was the fifth most
highly ranked leadership competency.
The leadership of the organization cannot dictate a shared vision. Instead, the vision
develops from many people within the organization creating a picture of the future. All
members of the organization must understand and contribute to the vision. The vision has
to be meaningful to them and be something that relates to their individual visions of the
organization. By working together to create the vision and then working to incorporate
that vision into each unit or part of the organization, we can create a focus for the
organization that will guide all parts of the organization (Giesecki & McNeil, 2004, p.
58).

Competencies associated with being a change leader or managing and leading change as
shown in Table 8 were the sixth most highly valued competencies in the systematic review.

Perhaps the most dominant discourse in librarianship for the past two decades has been the
discourse of change. Change brought about by technological innovation, changes in
organizational structure, and service expectations of library users have been constant topics
of discussion within the LIS literature for decades. During the 1990s, however, the
discourse on change accelerated, primarily as a result of the impact of the Internet and the
possibilities afforded to libraries in response to electronic resources (Hicks & Given, 2013,
p. 15).

The most closely related competencies to being a change leader or managing and leading change
are displayed in Table 8 using code co-occurrence coefficients calculated in ATLAS-ti.

Competencies associated with assessment, evaluation, and evidence-based decision
making shown in Table 9 were the seventh most highly valued competencies in the systematic
review.
The need to demonstrate measurable evidence will eventually force librarians to change
their vision and values and, as a result, develop services and processes that are based on
working toward realistic learning, research, and scholarly outcomes. Only clarity of
purpose will inform the skills needed within the profession to deliver the requisite services
efficiently and effectively. Librarians will have to be able to learn to measure the right
things and change from a culture of intuition-based decision-making to a decision-making
framework based more on evidence, analytics, and results (Lakos, 2007, p. 447).

Competencies associated with planning and strategic planning shown in Table 10 were
the eighth most highly valued competencies in the systematic review.
Developing a system for envisioning, planning, and taking organizational strategic action
to assure future success is a requirement for any organization that foresees a need for its
core services in the future. A strategic planning system that deﬁnes a common
destination, sets direction, and involves members in taking action is the ideal system for
surviving in a rapidly changing environment. Too many planning systems fail to provide
strategic direction, become outdated quickly, and stop short of action planning and
continuous review. (Phipps, 2004, p. 85).

Competencies associated with flexibility and adaptability shown in Table 11 were the
ninth most highly valued competencies in the systematic review.
If you are not flexible enough to understand the work in a different business environment,
you are not going to be successful. Two things I think are important are flexibility and
respect… You have to understand that everyone may have the same goals, but how you
accomplish them is not always this one way, there may be many, many ways to
accomplish the same thing. If you say, ‘there is only one right way to do it,’ this is not
true, and that is a mistake (Bueno & Tubbs, 2012, p. 219).

Competencies associated with motivating and inspiring others shown in Table 12 were
the tenth most highly valued competencies in the systematic review.
Inspirational motivation is the degree to which the leader articulates a vision that is
appealing and inspiring to followers. Leaders with inspirational motivation challenge
followers with high standards, communicate optimism about future goal attainment, and
provide meaning for the task at hand (Judge & Piccolo, 2004, p. 755).

The universality of these top ten meta-competencies is readily apparent. A leader who is
proficient in most of these meta-competencies will be successful in any field. Not only do these
meta-competencies apply in all fields, they are applicable globally regardless of culture. Tubbs
and Schulz (2006) created a taxonomy of global leadership competencies and meta-competencies
which often corresponds with this research. Five of their seven meta-competencies were
leadership, communication, teamwork, creativity and innovation, and leading change. While
many leadership competencies are generalizable regardless of field or culture, some
competencies are idiosyncratic to a company or national culture (Morrison, 2000). However, it
would seem that as globalization continues to shrink geographic boundaries, the universality of
leadership and management competencies will only continue to increase in the future.
Summary of the Findings
This research for this dissertation was focused on responding to the research question:
Which leadership and management competencies are most vital for library directors and senior
managers to possess as they lead their organizations through the current uncertain climate into
the future? Four research propositions emerged and were addressed from a systematic review of
the literature.
1. Leader competencies associated with transformational leadership behaviors will be
preferred by academic librarians when being led through a change initiative over
transactional and task oriented behaviors.
2. Leader competencies associated with emotional intelligence will be preferred by

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

164 | P a g e

academic librarians when being led through a change initiative over transactional and
task oriented behaviors.
3. Strategies for dealing with radical change such as organizational development, systems
thinking, appreciative inquiry, creating a learning organization, re-organization of staff,
and the frequency and use of library services assessment are tools used by library
directors to lead academic librarians through a change initiative.
4. Organizational climate and changing the climate are often a focus of library directors as
they seek to diminish resistance to change among academic librarians.
The evidence uncovered during the systematic review of the literature supported the four
propositions that were presented in Chapter 3. One additional finding arose from the systematic
review which was unexpected. As theorized in the first proposition librarians did prefer
leadership and management competencies associated with transformational leadership over
transactional leadership competencies when undergoing a change initiative. Leadership
competencies associated with individualized consideration such as empathy, respectfulness,
listening, mentoring, and developing staff were highly valued by academic librarians. Leadership
competencies associated with intellectual stimulation such as problem solving, creativity,
innovation, and creative problem solving were also highly ranked. Competencies associated with
inspirational motivation such as communication, creating a shared vision, advancing the
organizational mission, inspiring others, and motivating others were also top ranked attributes.
Leadership competencies associated with idealized influence such as having ethics and being
ethical, possessing integrity, being a role model, and having charisma also were key. Only two
competencies associated with transactional leadership were highly ranked – reward and
recognition of staff accomplishments.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

165 | P a g e

The second proposition that academic librarians would prefer leadership and management
competencies associated with emotional intelligence over transactional leadership competencies
when undergoing a change initiative was also supported. Leadership competencies associated
with self-awareness such as intelligence, enthusiasm, sense of humor, being articulate,
possessing emotional resilience, being confident, and intuitive were all highly valued.
Competencies associated with self-management such as adaptability, flexibility, integrity, being
ethical, possessing initiative, and treating followers fairly and equally were all top ranked skills.
Leadership competencies associated with building relationships such as collaborating, consensus
building, networking, fundraising, resource gathering, changing the culture, and developing staff
were all highly appreciated qualities in a library director. Leadership competencies associated
with interpersonal and social skill such as being accessible, being approachable, teambuilding,
being open to new ideas, and valuing diversity were all abilities that academic librarians highly
graded.
The third proposition that strategies for dealing with radical change such as
organizational development, systems thinking, appreciative inquiry, creating a learning
organization, re-organization of staff, and creating a culture of assessment were tools used by
library directors to lead academic librarians through change initiatives was also supported.
Organizational development, systems thinking, learning organization models, staff
reorganizations, and assessment and evaluation of library services were competencies often
practiced by library directors. Although appreciative inquiry was less used it is a technique
which is gaining popularity.
The fourth proposition that organizational climate and changing the climate are often a
focus of library directors as they seek to diminish resistance to change among academic

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

166 | P a g e

librarians was also supported. The library literature is replete with the importance of creating the
proper organizational climate and with suggestions for changing the climate to an environment
that is accepting of change.
Finally, the last and somewhat unexpected finding was that leadership and management
competencies were universal regardless of field and culture. Globalization has led to a
homogenization of leadership and management competencies as has the impact of technology.
Leadership and management competencies that were highly ranked in library literature were also
highly valued in other fields undergoing rapid change such as medicine, nursing, information
technology, management, and the military. The only competencies which are not transferable
between fields are those which are knowledge specific. In the library field knowledge
competencies such as collection management, cataloging, and information literacy are among
those which are not valued in other professions.
Conclusions
The analysis of the findings of the systematic review of the literature demonstrated that
there are numerous management and leadership competencies that are important in fields
undergoing rapid change. Competencies associated with transformational leadership were highly
valued in academic libraries. This is hardly surprising as transformational leadership is touted as
being most valuable in periods of change. Competencies associated with individualized
consideration such as having empathy, treating employees with respect, listening to follower’s
opinions, and mentoring and developing staff were highly valued in the literature. Competencies
associated with intellectual stimulation such as being creative, innovative, and engaging in
creative problem solving were competencies common to highly rated library directors and senior
managers. Inspirational motivation is the at the heart of transformational leadership and here

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

167 | P a g e

were found the most highly valued competencies in the research – communicating with one’s
followers, creating a shared vision, focusing on the organizational mission, and motivating and
inspiring others. Competencies associated with idealized influence such as behaving ethically,
having integrity, possessing charisma, and being a role model for one’s followers were also
highly ranked competencies. The transactional leadership style was not preferred and only the
competencies of reward and recognition of follower accomplishments were highly prized.
Convincing empirical support of the transformational leadership model is still lacking
(Rafferty & Griffin, 2004). Most of the issues arise in trying to measure what Bass called the
sub-dimensions of transformational leadership, the individual conceptualizations that make up
the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ). Other academics have developed their own
measures of transformational leadership which at best provide mixed support of the
transformational model. This dissertation research shows strong support of transformational
leadership competencies when practiced by library directors and senior managers. There was
little to no preference for transactional leadership behaviors such as active or passive
management by exception. The preference for contingent reward behaviors such as reward and
recognition is not surprising. Some scholars have argued that contingent reward should be
operationalized as a transformational construct not as a part of transactional leadership.
Just as highly valued were many of the competencies associated with emotional
intelligence. Although there are varying conceptualizations of emotional intelligence, the
competency based model of Goleman (1998) is the most accepted and most relevant to this
research. Competencies associated with self-awareness such as intelligence, being articulate,
having a sense of humor, possessing self-confidence, being emotionally resilient, being intuitive,
and possessing enthusiasm were all highly ranked in the systematic review. Self-management

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

168 | P a g e

competencies such as possessing integrity, acting ethically, being flexible and adaptable,
possessing initiative, and treating followers fairly were also highly valued. Interpersonal and
social skill competencies such as being open to new ideas, being accessible and approachable,
possessing teambuilding skills, and valuing diversity were also of great importance in academic
libraries. Relationship building competencies were the most highly ranked attributes associated
with emotional intelligence and included collaborating, networking, resource gathering,
fundraising, consensus building, changing the culture, and developing staff.
The preference for emotional intelligence related competencies was also an unsurprising
finding. George (2000) suggested that EI plays a vital part in leadership effectiveness and
proposed that the ability to understand and manage moods and emotions in oneself and in others
is a major factor in the effectiveness of leaders. EI enhances a leader’s ability to solve problems
and to address issues facing the organization. In particular, a “leader high in emotional
intelligence is able to accurately appraise how their employees feel and use this information to
influence their followers’ emotions, so that they are receptive and supportive of the goals and
values of the organization” (p. 1040). There has also been shown to be a strong empirical link
between the components of emotional intelligence and those of transformational leadership
(Gardner & Stough, 2001). A preference for transformational leadership related competencies
should equate with a preference for emotional intelligence related competencies and this was
confirmed by the systematic review.
The unexpected finding of the research related to the universality of leadership and
management competencies. Whether the field was librarianship, management, nursing, medicine,
information technology, or the military, competencies that were highly valued in one field were
almost always highly valued in the other fields. Only knowledge based competencies were

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

169 | P a g e

specifically valued by one profession and unimportant in others. This finding is supported by
those of other researchers. Jordan and Cartwright (1998) found that there were a limited number
of key competencies which predict success in a global environment. Jokinen (2005) identified
these important competencies as self-awareness, entrepreneurialism, inquisitiveness, optimism,
self-regulation, social skills, empathy, cognitive skills, acceptance of complexity, and
networking. With the exception of inquisitiveness these competencies were also found to be
highly important in the systematic review of the literature. Caligiuri (2006) suggested that global
leadership competencies will be the key to success for organizations in the 21st century.
As expected it was found that library directors utilize many different methods when
attempting a change initiative. Change leadership competencies such as organizational
development, creating a learning organization, systems thinking, creating a culture of
assessment, and appreciative inquiry were all change management competencies academic
library directors and senior managers employ when leading a change initiative. It is open to
debate how effective these techniques are in the workplace. Although much of the literature,
especially in librarianship, touts the benefit of these techniques, there is little empirical evidence
to support their utility. Most of the data consists of case studies or expert opinion which is low in
evidentiary value in the systematic review hierarchy. Even in articles which espouse the
effectiveness of these techniques, there is usually some reference made to resistant and
recalcitrant staff who refuse to accept change.
The evidence from the systematic review of the literature suggests that academic library
directors and senior managers would be better served by developing and utilizing change
management competencies rather than employing unproven change techniques and models.
Many of the leadership and management competencies that were highly valued in this research

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

170 | P a g e

are effective when utilized during periods of rapid change. Pagon, Banutai, and Bizjak (2008)
created a change competency model presented in Figure 4 that includes many of the
competencies highly ranked in the systematic review of the literature. Although Pagon et al.,
(2008) divide up leadership competencies in a different manner than is done in this dissertation
almost all the competencies in the figure have been discussed previously. In this model
antecedents are abilities that a manager already possesses when he or she takes over a position.
Some are innate and some have been developed through experience. Competencies are presented
in three dimensions: cognitive, functional, and personal/social. Cognitive competencies include
divergent thinking, critical thinking, creativity, problem solving, strategic thinking, analytical
skills, and numerical abilities. Functional competencies include language and communication
skills, technological skills, multicultural competencies, learning abilities and personal
development, managerial skills, and decision skills. Personal/social skills include self-direction,
interpersonal skills, teamwork, compassion, integrity, mobilizing skills, personal and social
values, and ethics. The final column presents the outcomes of properly utilizing these change
management competencies – improved employee productivity, greater relationship quality,
decreased conflict, a greater level of cooperation, an improved organizational culture and
climate, attainment of goals, successful change implementation, higher employee satisfaction,
more motivated followers, and increased customer satisfaction. The evidence determined from
the systematic review of the literature suggests that employing such leadership competencies
during a change initiative would be more successful than employing unproven and faddish
change techniques continually being churned out in popular management literature.

Finally, organizational climate and changing the climate were often a focus of library
directors and senior managers as they sought to diminish resistance to change among academic
librarians. Assessing the organizational climate is a vital first step in any change initiative. The
evidence from the systematic review of the literature suggests that this step is often omitted in
academic library change initiatives. Proper assessment such as suggested by Shepstone and
Currie (2008) can uncover not only the current organizational climate but can reveal the
preferred organizational climate of the library staff which will greatly facilitate change. Most
academic libraries are market cultures while research suggests that most librarians would prefer
adhocracy and clan cultures. Resistance to change would be greatly lessened by such an
approach. The vast majority of academic librarians are not resistant to change but rather resistant

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

172 | P a g e

to bad change (Dent & Goldberg, 1999). A change initiative that began with an examination of
current culture and then utilized a transformation to a preferred culture as the reason for change
would be much more effective than top-down mandated change.

Alternate Perspectives
The area of leadership and management competencies is not without its critics. Various
authors have criticized leadership competencies as flawed constructs. The largest criticism of
competencies is that they are generic and do not take into account the situation, the task, or the
individual. Leadership cannot be dissociated from the temporal and situational context (Salaman,
2004). If the organizational culture or organizational structure is deficient, a leader may be
powerless to achieve proscribed goals and targets. “Failure to consider the broader social context
of leadership is to miss the signiﬁcant role played by other factors including followers,
managerial rewards and sanctions, beliefs about legitimate authority, organizational systems,
nature of the work and cultural environment in the leadership process” (p. 75). In certain
circumstances even an incredibly gifted leader who has mastered numerous competencies may
be set up to fail.
It has also been suggested that the leadership competency approach leads to conformity
and does not account for the differences between managers. Bolden and Gosling (2006) argued
that the competency approach is founded on three ﬂawed assumptions: “(1) that those who excel
in the same role display the same behaviors; (2) that these behaviors can be learned; and (3) that
improving on your weaknesses leads to success” (p. 150). They believed that organizations
should focus on outcomes not on behaviors or competencies. This is an important point because
numerous studies have found that managers often take different approaches to a problem and

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

173 | P a g e

may be equally successful. Every manager has strengths and weaknesses and should focus on
their strengths when tackling a problem.
Another criticism of competencies is in regard to their use or rather misuse. The
management and leadership competency approach is often used as a framework for evaluating,
monitoring, and comparing managers by human resource departments (Bolden & Gosling, 2006).
Competencies under these circumstances then become lists of areas to improve upon which is not
what they were originally designed to accomplish. Conger and Ready (2004) pointed out that
using leadership and management competencies for both evaluating and developing employees
can lead to serious issues. Competencies were designed so that managers can access their
strengths and weaknesses. Weaknesses should be admitted and improved through training.
However, when used for performance evaluation purposes, it is in the employee’s best interest to
hide their weaknesses defeating the intent of measuring competencies.
Use of competencies for performance evaluation can also lead to unrealistic expectations.
Mintzberg (2004) stated that “acquiring various competencies does not necessarily make a
manager competent” (p. 257). A manager may compile a long list of impressive competencies
through training programs, but if they are not used properly they are essentially useless.
Similarly, just because a manager does not seem to possess a great deal of competencies does not
necessarily mean that he or she is incompetent. Also managers who have been identified as being
strong in one competency may overuse that competency applying it in the wrong ways or wrong
situations. The “everything looks like a nail when you have a hammer” phenomenon.
Conger and Ready (2004) claimed that leadership and management competencies suffer
from three limitations – they are complicated, conceptual, and designed to apply to current
conditions. Competency frameworks tend to be complicated because the lists of competencies

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

174 | P a g e

are usually quite long. How does the manager decide on which ones to use and which ones to
concentrate on improving? They may also cause an organization to lose focus on the most
important competencies or values. Leadership competencies are still mostly conceptual; there has
been limited study of their effectiveness in real world scenarios. Finally, they apply to the
present; there is no guarantee that competencies that are important today will be important in the
future. The incredible pace of change in today’s business environment means that a competency
vital to success today or in the past, may be of little use in the not so distant future.
There is also controversy about whether leadership and management competencies can be
learned through training. Tubbs and Schulz (2006) argued that some aspects of leadership are
more or less fixed at a young age while others are able to be developed and improved through
training. For instance, having a sense of humor is an often cited leadership competency. Is it
possible to learn how to have a sense of humor? It would seem unlikely that this competency or
others such as persuasiveness, being intuitive, or being humble can be improved through
training. There is even disagreement about whether acting with integrity can be taught. Tubbs
and Schulz (2006) claimed that competencies that are part of an individual’s core personality
cannot be taught or improved upon. Core personality competencies include extraversion,
agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to new experiences.
However, competencies outside this core can be learned and improved upon.
Finally, Markus, Cooper-Thomas and Allpress (2005) argued that competency models
lack content, construct, face, and predictive validity. Construct validity is lacking because it is
difficult to operationalize and accurately observe and measure competencies in the real world.
Content and face validity may be lacking because there is no agreement about what is meant by
the term competency. Leadership and management competencies are used interchangeably.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

175 | P a g e

Predictive validity is also an issue as possessing many competencies does not always equate to
being a good or successful manager. "The current approach to competencies has been
confounded by over-simplified generic models. Instead of supporting capability development
through diversity, the competency approach is being used to promote standardization through
prescription” (p. 125).
Summary
Chapter 4 presented an analysis and discussion of the evidence revealed by the systematic
review of the literature of leadership and management competencies. In-depth coding using the
qualitative data analysis software ATLAS-ti was used to uncover themes in the literature of
fields undergoing rapid change such as library science, nursing, information technology,
management, and the military. The analysis revealed that all four propositions were supported
and one unexpected finding was revealed. Conclusions were reached and alternative perspectives
were presented. Chapter 5 presents the conceptual framework developed from the analysis,
discussion, and conclusions.

CHAPTER 5
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
Introduction
In this chapter, the conceptual framework and its relationship to the research question is
presented. In Chapter 3 the management and library literature on leadership competencies and
change management was discussed. Building on this research, Chapter 5 examines the
relationship between leadership competencies and change management, and creates a conceptual
framework of the interaction of these two factors which are at work in the current academic
library environment. This conceptual framework is presented both in narrative form and
graphically through a theoretical model (diagram).

Restatement of the Problem and Purpose
Possession of important leadership competencies can be a vital component of change
management. Future library leaders must possess and use the proper competencies which will
engage and motivate academic librarians. Leadership competencies will be a vital factor in
determining whether current and future change initiatives are successful at keeping academic
libraries relevant in the higher education landscape. The purpose of this dissertation is to
determine through scholarship and research which leadership competencies are most important
for future library directors as they guide academic libraries into an uncertain future. These
competencies are also vital in assisting librarians to cope with the constant change initiatives
often mandated by rapid technological change and other outside factors affecting the academic
library environment. The objective of this dissertation is to assist library directors, librarians, and

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

177 | P a g e

university administrators in discovering best practices for leading the academic library through
this period of tumultuous change into the future.
Research Question
Which leadership and management competencies are most vital for library directors and
senior managers to possess as they lead their organizations through the current uncertain climate
into the future?
Research Propositions
These research propositions emerged from a systematic review of the literature:
1. Leadership competencies associated with transformational leadership behaviors will
be preferred by academic librarians when being led through a change initiative over
transactional and task oriented behaviors.
2. Leadership competencies associated with emotional intelligence will be preferred by
academic librarians when being led through a change initiative over transactional and
task oriented behaviors.
3. Strategies for dealing with radical change such as organizational development,
systems thinking, appreciative inquiry, creating a learning organization, reorganization of staff, and the frequency and use of library services assessment are
tools used by library directors to lead academic librarians through a change initiative.
4. Organizational climate and changing the climate are often a focus of library directors
as they seek to diminish resistance to change among academic librarians.

Introduction to the Conceptual Framework
The purpose of the conceptual framework is to depict and clarify the important
relationships that have been discovered in the evidence-based systematic review of the literature
conducted in Chapter 3. Maxwell (2013) described the conceptual framework as “primarily a
conception or model of what is out there that you plan to study, and of what is going on with
these things and why—a tentative theory of the phenomena that you are investigating; the
function of this theory is to inform the rest of your design—to help you to assess and refine your
goals, develop realistic and relevant research questions, select appropriate methods and identify
potential validity threats to your conclusions” (p. 33). In essence, the purpose of the conceptual
framework is to explain the research and describe why it is important and necessary to both
scholars and practitioners.
The Message in the Systematic Review of the Literature
The systematic review revealed that leadership competencies are a heavily studied area in
both management and library literature. In particular, leadership competencies are often
investigated in fields that are undergoing rapid or continuous change such as academic libraries.
Leader competencies are often operationalized in different manners. Some competencies are
associated with tasks and others are associated with interpersonal skills. Competencies can be
learned and improved upon; they are not innate. In this respect they differ substantially from the
older trait based theories of leadership. The literature revealed that a core set of competencies is
associated with successful change management regardless of the field in which the leader is
operating. Competencies such as communication, creativity, inspiring a vision, and honesty are
all important characteristics of a successful change leader no matter the profession.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

179 | P a g e

The Conceptual Framework
At the most basic level a competency can be defined as an ability or capability. Boyatzis
(2011) stated that a competency consists of two elements – an intent and an action. Thus people
may possess competencies and for various reasons choose not to use them. Dole, Hurych and
Liebst (2005) defined a competency as “a specific range of skills, abilities, or knowledge that
enable or qualify someone to perform a particular function or to carry out selected
responsibilities” (p. 125). For the purpose of this dissertation a competency was defined as an
ability or skill that enables a library director or senior library leader to perform functions or
strategies that assist with the process of change management, or help lead to the successful
completion of such an initiative.
Bolden and Gosling (2006) grouped competencies into three distinct areas: management,
behavioral, and organizational. Management competencies are technical or task oriented
competencies. Thus these competencies are primarily used by change managers. In the library
environment this type of competency would be used by senior staff members who are directing a
change initiative. Behavioral competencies are personal attributes such as intellectual and
emotional qualities; although these are innate they can also be improved through training and
education. Behavioral competencies are often associated with change leaders such as library
directors. Organizational competencies are business processes that are associated with enhanced
performance such as organizational development, creating a learning organization, and peer
mentoring. Bolden and Gosling’s (2006) view of competencies is graphically depicted in Figure
5.

Much of the management literature looks at competencies from the perspective of change
management and differentiates between those competencies practiced by change leaders
(presidents and CEOs) and those practiced by change managers (team leaders and project
managers). This is the perspective taken by Caldwell (2003) who divided competencies into
those practiced by change leaders and those practiced by change managers. Although he created
a separate list of the top ten competencies for both change leaders and managers, there is a great
deal of overlap between the lists. Learning from others, openness to new ideas, and adaptability
and flexibility are three competencies that appear on both lists (Caldwell, 2003, p. 288-289).
Crawford and Nahmias (2010) divided change competencies into those practiced by project

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

181 | P a g e

managers and change managers. Higgs and Rowland (2013) created eight subclusters under the
overarching competency of change management.
Other authors combine all of these competencies under the aegis of leadership or leading
change. Muller and Turner (2010) investigated leadership competencies while grouping these
abilities into three subclusters: intellectual, managerial, and emotional. Most of the library
literature follows this practice. Table 13 presents a typical view of leadership competencies.

The model developed for the purpose of this dissertation considered all the various
competencies to be leadership competencies. In this model leadership competencies consist of
various subclusters such as emotional, intellectual, managerial, personal, and task oriented
competencies. These competencies are practiced by change leaders (library directors) and change
managers (senior library staff) in order to implement change initiatives necessitated by outside
factors such as declining budgets, technological change, and faculty/student demands influencing
the academic library environment. Library directors and senior staff use these competencies
when practicing change management techniques such as organizational development, creating a
learning organization, and appreciative inquiry. Academic librarians are affected by them and
implement these changes which when employed effectively should result in either improved
services or procedures. The ultimate goal of this process is to create an effective and successful
library of the future. Figure 6 presents a graphical depiction of this conceptual framework.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries

The model begins with the parent institution, the college or university. Next the forces
which influence the academic library are depicted – administrators who may propose budget cuts
or staffing changes, continual technological change, and the shifting demands of faculty and
student users. In this unsettled environment library directors and senior managers often propose
change initiatives to meet these competing demands. Library directors practice emotional,
intellectual, personal, and managerial leadership competencies as they lead change. Senior
managers tasked with implementing these changes use managerial and task leadership
competencies to direct the required changes. Academic librarians are those effected by the
leadership competencies and also must exhibit their own leadership competencies in order for
change to be successful. Successful change results in solutions to library problems or the seizing
of opportunities. Usually this success is shown through improved services or procedures or
perhaps cost saving measures for the library. Unsuccessful change initiatives produce negative
feedback from end users or librarians which will result in revised change initiatives or inertia.
Academic libraries that can follow this model successfully will remain relevant in the 21st
century higher education landscape becoming an integral part of their parent institution’s
mission.
Summary
Chapter 5 provided a conceptual framework designed to answer the research question:
which leadership and management competencies are most vital for library directors and senior
managers to possess as they lead their organizations through the current uncertain climate into
the future? The chapter began with an introduction which explained the purpose of creating a
conceptual framework. A restatement of the problem and purpose, the research question and
propositions, and the message in the systematic review of the literature followed which

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

185 | P a g e

expressed the patterns and themes which emerged in Chapter 3. The body of Chapter 5 consisted
of the conceptual framework which narratively and graphically depicted the various models of
competencies which exist in both the management and library literature. The conceptual
framework concluded with a narrative and graphical depiction of the academic library
environment, and the role of competencies in change management. The conceptual framework
included a depiction of the use of these competencies as strategies to implement change
management. Successful change initiatives lead to improved procedures and services which
contribute to the overall goal of a successful academic library of the future. Unsuccessful change
initiatives lead to a feedback loop in which patrons and academic librarians communicate issues
to academic library directors and senior managers. Such unsuccessful change initiatives should
lead to future change initiatives until successful change is achieved.
Chapter 6 will provide conclusions, implications, and future trends in leadership
competencies and their impact on academic libraries. It will also discuss the top leadership and
management competencies specific to academic librarianship, as well as provide a leadership and
management mega-competency model for use in development of academic librarians. Chapter 6
will conclude with suggestions for further research and a discussion of the research limitations.

CHAPTER 6
CONCLUSIONS, IMPLICATIONS, AND TRENDS
Introduction

Chapter 1 presented the purpose of this dissertation which was to determine which
leadership and management competencies were most important for library directors and senior
managers to possess as they led their organizations into the future through the current turbulent
environment of constant change. This research question was answered through a systematic
review of the literature of management and library science utilizing the qualitative data analysis
software ATLAS-ti. The evidence revealed that competencies associated with the four
dimensions of transformational leadership – individualized consideration, intellectual
stimulation, inspirational motivation, and idealized influence - were vital to leading change in
academic libraries. The systematic review also disclosed that competencies related to the four
dimensions of emotional intelligence – self-awareness, self-management, interpersonal
competence or social skill, and building relationships - were also key to leading and managing
change. The evidence also revealed that library directors frequently used techniques such as
organizational development, systems thinking, creating a culture of assessment, creating a
learning organization, and appreciative inquiry to lead change initiatives. Library directors also
focused on the organizational culture of an academic library and changing that culture as key to
implementing a successful change initiative. Finally, the systematic review uncovered that
leadership and management competencies are universal across professions – those that are
important in one field are usually important in other fields. The only competencies which did not
cross disciplines were those which were specific to a profession. For instance, reference

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

187 | P a g e

interviewing, cataloging, collection development, and information literacy were library specific
competencies which were not applicable to other professions.

Overall Conclusions
One of the goals of the research was to create a list of management and leadership
competencies which were vital to leading academic libraries into the future. A list of the top ten
meta-competencies which were created by second stage coding was presented in Chapter 4. This
list was created using ATLAS-ti by combining first stage codes into meta-competencies using all
51 articles that were included in the systematic review of the literature. These 51 articles were
from a variety of disciplines undergoing rapid change including librarianship, management,
information technology, medicine, nursing, and the military. In order to determine if there were
any differences based on field, another analysis was run in ATLAS-ti using only the 32 library
specific articles. Table 14 presents the results of this analysis.

As can be seen from Table 14 nine of the ten competencies remained the same when just
the library literature was used as the evidence base. Interestingly the top competency shifted and
communication competencies were ranked in the first position while leadership competencies
dropped to second ranking when just the library literature was considered. This may not be
surprising when one considers the library profession. Many academic librarians are by nature
introverts and often lack communication skills. Scherdin (1994) found in a large scale analysis of
librarian personality types sponsored by the ACRL that sixty-three percent of librarians tested as
introverted, based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test. Williamson, Pemberton, and
Lounsbury (2008) found that most academic librarians were introverts except for academic
reference librarians. Perhaps for this reason communication competencies are highly valued in
academic libraries even more than leadership competencies. This would also tend to agree with
recent management literature which has found that in many cases introverts make the best
leaders due to their high level of self-awareness (Cain, 2013; Laney, 2002). The team based
environment in academic libraries also puts a premium on communication rather than leadership.
Teams tend to be based on group decision making rather than having a single leader who makes
all the decisions.
The next major difference between the two lists was quite surprising. Managing/leading
change was the sixth highest ranked competency in the systematic review but dropped to eighth
when just the library literature was considered. Planning/strategic planning and
assessment/evaluation/evidence-based decision making were tied for sixth ranking in the library
literature. Considering the incredible amount of change that has occurred in the library
profession in the last 25 years, this finding was unexpected. Perhaps academic librarians have
become inured to change and no longer consider it to be out of the ordinary? The other

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

189 | P a g e

explanation is that strategic planning and evidence-based decision making are highly important
competencies in academic libraries. Higher education has become preoccupied with long-range
and strategic planning in the last few decades, and as a result this competency has become very
important for library directors to possess when they report to academic deans. Likewise
evidence-based decision making while still underutilized has become an important competency
due to the influence of medical librarianship on the profession.
The final difference between the two lists occurred at the tenth ranking. Motivating and
inspiring others was the tenth highest ranked competency in the systematic review but dropped to
twelfth when just the library literature was considered. Ahead of motivating/inspiring others in
the library competency rankings were technological skill (91 occurrences) and social skill (89
occurrences). Considering the importance of technology in the academic library environment, its
inclusion in a list of library related competencies is unremarkable. Technology has been one of
the primary drivers of change in academic libraries going back to the 1970’s with the arrival of
the first online public access catalogs (OPACS). An academic librarian without technological
skill cannot function in the 21st century academic library. Advanced technological skills continue
to be a premium competency for academic librarians, and one which can lead to higher salaries.
However, the one job in academic libraries that does not necessitate technological skill is library
director. Although technological skill does help a director oversee the work of other library
employees. Interpersonal competencies or social skills are highly valued competencies in
academic libraries for the same reason that communication competencies are highly valued.
Since most academic librarians appear to be introverts, they may lack interpersonal competence
or find social interaction difficult, therefore, librarians with this competency possess a highly
valued skill.

Implications for Management
There are three primary areas where this research can assist management practitioners.
All are in the area of human resources. Leadership and management competencies can be used to
improve both interviewing and hiring practices, training and development of employees, and
succession planning. The federal government has used competencies extensively as part of hiring
practices. In 1990, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) began developing competencies
to be employed in hiring practices. These were not knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) but
were designed to measure soft skills such as those associated with leadership and management
competencies. OPM competency models have been used by federal agencies to identify the
critical competencies for different occupations, and to establish the criteria for selection tests
(Rodriguez, Patel, Bright, Gregory, & Gowing, 2002). Leadership competencies can be used to
create rating scales for use in structured interviewing. “The structured interview process
incorporates behavioral anchors describing low to highly effective behaviors, and interview
questions are written to align to entry, career, and advanced levels of the job” (Campion, Fink,
Ruggeberg, Carr, Phillips & Odman, 2011, p. 254). Boyatzis (2008) believed that emotional,
social, and cognitive intelligence competencies can predict effectiveness in almost every
profession. While many corporations have adopted measuring leadership and management
competencies as part of their hiring procedures, many more could benefit from creating a
competency model for their organization.
Probably the most important area where management and leadership competencies can be
successfully applied is in training and development of employees for leadership roles. This
approach is “one of the most dominant models for management and leadership assessment and
development in the UK” (Bolden & Gosling, 2006, p. 149). The competency approach to

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

191 | P a g e

employee development has also become vital in the United States. Competency modeling was
used by almost 75 percent of all companies as a tool for leadership development (Conger &
Ready, 2004). For those aspiring to leadership roles competencies offer the foundation for a
tangible developmental plan. Most importantly, when a competency framework is adopted on an
organizational-wide basis, the top executives of a corporation can research and agree upon the
leadership skills and behaviors that are most valued in the context of their company (Conger &
Ready, 2004). Competencies are used extensively by the U.S. military for development of
officers. “Competencies provide a common language to discuss leader and unit performance, and
leader selection, development and advancement. This common language enables the Army to
assess its leadership and units, and feed the results into its training and leader development
programs” (Steele & Walters, 2001, p. 30). By utilizing successful leader competencies from
leaders past and present, the Army hopes to develop officers with a capacity for “lifelong
learning, possessing the competencies of self-awareness and adaptability vital for success in an
uncertain and constantly changing environment” (p. 32). Many other organizations could benefit
from creating leadership and management competency frameworks for training and developing
the skills of their employees.
The final area where leadership and management competencies can be invaluable is in
the area of succession planning. 3M has been a leader in using management and leadership
competencies in their human resources department for promoting succession planning. In a large
corporation, such as 3M, putting employees in the right jobs and promoting from within is a
priority. As Alldredge and Nilan (2000) concluded in their research at 3M, “The fact that it takes
years to develop the understanding necessary to function effectively within 3M’s breadth of
businesses and technologies encourages promotion from within” (p. 134). 3M developed a tool

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

192 | P a g e

useful in succession planning by “merging competencies with an existing list of job experiences
critical for successful general management at 3M” (p. 137). Such a tool is useful because it can
incorporate the unique culture of an organization when developing a list of leadership and
management competencies. Developing competencies that are compatible with organizational
culture is key in succession planning and advancement decisions. In addition to culture, Groves
(2007) states it is vital to succession planning systems that they “focus on action-oriented
developmental activities designed to enhance leadership competencies aligned with the
organization’s strategic goals” (p. 249). The leadership competency of mentoring or coaching is
also a key factor in succession planning. Current leaders in an organization need to mentor and
coach future leaders in the leadership competencies that are most important for success.

Implications for Librarianship
Leadership and management competencies have been a frequent area of research in
librarianship but to date no researcher has created a model of the most important competencies
necessary for the success of library directors and senior managers in leading change. Ronald
Riggio, the distinguished management scholar who acted as a member of the expert panel for this
dissertation, has consulted with several academic libraries on change leadership and suggested
that the development of a change leadership competency model would be valuable to the
profession as a method for leader development and selection. Thus another focus of this
dissertation was to create such an academic library change leadership competency model. This
model is presented in Figure 7.

Figure 7. Academic Library Leadership Mega-competencies (Lewis, 2014, adapted from Day et
al., 2014).
As can be seen from Figure 7 the most important mega-competency is personal mastery
(875). Personal mastery is comprised of over thirty individual competencies. The most important
of these, based on number of occurrences, are interpersonal competence/social skill (89),
emotional intelligence (62), initiative (62), mentoring (56), commitment (55), self-awareness
(42), integrity (36), empathy (34), accountability (30), and valuing diversity (30). The second
most important mega-competency is knowledge (728). There are nineteen individual
competencies that make up the knowledge mega-competency. The most important of these

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

194 | P a g e

competencies are technological skill (90), strategic planning (74), budgeting (74), planning (71),
fundraising (57), goal setting (48), systems thinking (45), information literacy (35), and political
savvy (35). The third most important mega-competency is communicating a vision (705). This
mega-competency consists of ten individual competencies. The most important of these
individual competencies are building a shared vision (192), communication (176), being
articulate (63), trust (65), advancing the university mission (48), and motivating others (47).
The fourth most important mega-competency is leadership and change management
(574). This mega-competency consists of nine individual competencies which include leadership
(208), managing/leading change (97), leadership competencies (79), transformational leadership
(51), and change leadership (41). The fifth most important mega-competency is teamwork and
collaboration (424). This mega-competency consists of ten individual competencies, the most
highly valued were teambuilding (121), shared decision making (78), collaboration (73),
delegating (34), and consensus building (31). The sixth most important mega-competency is
creative problem solving and innovation (335). This mega-competency consists of five
individual competencies – customer service (79), creativity (72), innovation (63), user needs (63)
and problem solving (58). Flexibility/Adaptability (181) was the seventh most important megacompetency. This mega-competency consists of five individual competencies. The most
important competencies were flexibility (80), risk taking (45), adaptability (37), and agility (14).
The final mega-competency was assessment and evaluation (145). This consists of two
individual competencies – assessment/evaluation (115) and evidence-based management (30).
The academic library leadership mega-competency model can be useful in both
developing and selecting new leaders who have the proper competencies for leading libraries
into the future. The mega-competencies can also be used for purposes of self-assessment by

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

academic librarians. They can be used by organizations to provide guidelines for developing and
training academic library staff. The mega-competencies can also be used as a communication
tool to promote discussion of which competencies are most important for library directors and
senior managers to possess to lead their libraries into the future. It should be noted that while
there were eight separate mega-competencies created, there is in actuality a great deal of overlap
among the competencies. Also that while the mega-competencies are based on evidence gathered
from a systematic review of the library literature, they have not been empirically tested or
proven.

Implications of Emerging Trends
Technology
Technology has had an immense impact on academic libraries in the past thirty years and
will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Some of the technologies that are impacting
academic libraries now and in the near future include discovery catalogs, streamable media,
downloadable e-books, mobile technologies, radio frequency identification (RFID), cloud
computing, Web 2.0 tools, digital preservation, patron-driven e-book acquisition, and
teleworking. Discovery systems or next generation catalogs (NGC) are the next big thing in
academic library services. Most academic libraries have invested in an NGC or plan to do so
soon in an attempt to compete with Google as the first place students and faculty go for their
information needs. Discovery systems attempt to create one-stop shopping for patrons by
combining access to all library resources in one place. Books, e-books, journal and magazine
articles, streaming video, and every electronic resource an academic library owns are put into
one place – the online catalog. In theory, this approach seems reasonable as the one box search
interface resembles Google. Unfortunately once the user presses search, what is returned is a

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

196 | P a g e

jumbled up mess of resources that is confusing and often unusable. Google works because
everything it links to is a freely available web site. Such is not the case with library resources –
licensed databases, journals, e-books, and videos all require log-ins or remote identification
through student IDs and barcodes. The discovery system quickly falters in this environment – it
isn’t easy like Google and it often doesn’t work properly. Students who use a discovery system
quickly abandon it and return to Google. NGCs have been disappointments so far. The question
is, should academic libraries continue to invest scarce resources in developing discovery systems
or just cede the field to Google?
Although few academic libraries have taken the radical step of not having an OPAC, to
do so is actually feasible and may be the most reasonable solution to many of the issues facing
academic libraries. Discovery services and OPACs are expensive to purchase and maintain. Most
students and faculty already turn to Google for their information needs. Academic libraries can
and often do upload their journal and magazine holdings to Google Scholar. Many patrons access
these materials without even realizing that their library paid for them. Print books can be
accessed through OCLC WorldCat a reasonably priced database or through a simple (cheap)
open source catalog. While this would require patrons to go to more than one place to get their
information, it would seem to be a valuable compromise. Funding spent on catalogs and
discovery services could instead be spent on licensing additional content for the user. The 21st
century library is really about access to information not ownership of information. Abandoning
the OPAC could be the key to survival for many academic libraries as they compete for scarce
resources in the higher education landscape.
Other technologies. Streaming media has already begun to enter the academic library
mainstream. DVD replaced VHS and streaming video will eventually replace DVD. Streaming

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

197 | P a g e

video offers the advantage of off-campus, 24/7 access so it will inevitably replace DVD. There
are issues which remain to be resolved. Streaming video is more costly than DVD and
authentication is required. The biggest issue is probably bandwidth. Streaming video is a
notorious bandwidth hog and can slow the campus network to a crawl if too many users are
accessing it. As institutions upgrade their campus networks this should become less of an issue,
and costs will eventually come down. Downloadable e-books have not been adopted in academic
libraries as readily as in public libraries. Most public libraries now offer downloadable e-books
to their patrons of popular fiction. The issue with academic libraries is content. Very few
scholarly titles are currently offered as downloadable content. However, in the near future that
will change and academic libraries will adopt this technology.
Mobile technologies. Mobile technologies have already begun to impact academic
libraries and will continue to do so. A recent survey found that eighty-nine percent of college
students own a smart phone, and eighty percent watch streaming video on their smart phone
(Jackson, 2014). Academic libraries will have to revamp their web pages to be more readable on
smart phones. Databases will need to be searchable mobilely. Catalogs, if they continue to be
relevant, must be searchable mobilely. Many catalogs now offer a mobile version often called an
AirPAC. “In light of these trends, the question for libraries is not will users access library
services through mobile devices but what type of experience will the eventual user have and
what library services will be available to them” (Cummings, Merrill & Borrelli, 2010, p.34). The
mobile market continues to evolve at a rapid pace, and academic libraries must strive to provide
quality services to this user group.
Radio frequency identification. Radio frequency identification (RFID) of print books
offers many advantages to academic libraries. Finding lost books in large libraries is an almost

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

198 | P a g e

impossible task. RFID makes it possible with the wave of a wand. Misshelved books are easily
put in proper order by student workers with RFID. It also prevents theft, speeds up checkout, and
makes an inventory of an entire collection possible in days rather than weeks or months. Despite
these advantages RFID has been slow to be adopted by academic libraries. One obstacle is cost
as the equipment and supplies are expensive. The major obstacle is staff time. In order to adopt
RFID a library must physically pull every book off the shelf and attach a radio frequency tag
instead of a barcode. In libraries with hundreds of thousands of print titles this is a daunting task.
The conversion cost for an academic library can range from $113,000 to over $1.2 million with
an average cost of over $500,000 (Singh, Brar & Fong, 2006). As print books become less
important it may not be cost effective to invest in this technology. Despite its advantages RFID is
a technology that may have arrived too late to be adopted by most academic libraries.
Cloud computing. Academic libraries are increasingly moving to cloud computing for
both user and library needs. Cloud computing is a delivery model for information and services
that “uses the internet infrastructure to allow communication between client side and server side
applications” (Carlin & Curran, 2011, p. 14). Cloud service providers offer “platforms for their
customers to use and create their web services, much like internet service providers offer
costumers high speed broadband to access the internet” (p. 14). “Customers do not own the
actual physical infrastructure but merely pay a subscription fee and the cloud service provider
grants them access to the clouds resources and infrastructure” (p. 14). While cloud computing
brings benefits such as lower cost it also creates issues such as security and patron privacy
concerns. User needs for desktop applications such as Microsoft Office, productivity software,
browsers, and video and image processing programs, can all be met through cloud computing.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

199 | P a g e

Library applications such as hosting the library web site, the integrated library system (ILS), the
library catalog, digital repositories, and staff storage can also be met through cloud computing.
Cloud computing changes the way libraries acquire, configure, manage, and maintain
computing resources to achieve their educational mission. The availability of cloud computing
allows libraries to focus on teaching and learning and leave general computing maintenance to
the major IT companies (Han, 2013). While cloud computing promises on-demand access and
lower costs, it also brings threats. Patron confidentiality could be threatened by hackers. In
addition data stored in the cloud is vulnerable to loss due to improper backup, damage by
viruses, and outright theft by Internet criminals (Bansode & Pujar, 2012). Despite these issues
academic libraries will increasingly become cloud based organizations in the future as the
flexibility and lower costs associated with this move will be difficult to ignore.
Web 2.0 tools. Academic libraries have increasingly relied on Web 2.0 tools to entice
faculty and students into using their resources. These tools include wikis, blogs, social media
such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, You-tube, and Instagram, RSS feeds, and instant
messaging. Such services are used by academic libraries primarily as marketing and publicity
vehicles, although instant messaging is often used to provide basic remote reference services.
Web 2.0 tools provide many benefits to academic libraries such as “the quick spread of
information with simple steps; communication and promotion; enhanced interaction between
library and students; and access to students’ comments and suggestions” (Chu & Du, 2013, p.
69). These tools can also be used to engage library users and get feedback on services, to keep
library patrons up-to-date with news and information, and promote library events. Since these
tools are free the only real drawback to Web 2.0 tools is the drain on staff time. Web 2.0 tools
can also cause an academic library to lose focus on its core mission. However, it is clear that

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

200 | P a g e

academic libraries will increasingly adopt Web 2.0 tools to serve their users in new and
interesting ways.
Digital preservation. One of the main focuses of academic libraries in the future will be
in digital preservation of print materials. While Google and other organizations such as JSTOR
and the Hathi Trust have preserved many print books and journals through scanning programs,
much remains to be done in this area. University archives are a rich source of unique print items
which are only available to library users who can physically visit. Preserving these materials
digitally and providing online access to them is a niche which academic libraries can fill. Most
academic libraries already have digital repositories for storing and making available the scholarly
efforts of its faculty and students. Academic libraries with their expertise in preservation are also
uniquely placed to lead the effort to protect culturally important born digital information such as
emails and web pages (Higgins, 2011). Walters and Skinner (2011) stated that academic libraries
“need to be repositioned as vibrant knowledge branches that reach throughout their campuses to
provide curatorial guidance and expertise for digital content, wherever it may be created and
maintained” (p. 5). It is clear that digital preservation should be a focus of academic libraries in
both the short and long term.
Patron driven e-book acquisition. Many academic libraries have begun to implement
patron driven acquisition (PDA) of e-books. There are a number of models for PDA but they all
involve uploading e-book records to the library catalog. If a patron tries to access the full-text of
an e-book record, then the library purchases it from the vendor and the patron gets instant access.
Sometimes one click, three clicks, or even five clicks are necessary before the purchase option is
initiated. Traditionally many print purchases are never checked out of academic libraries. Studies
of print book use often find that as high as thirty-five to forty percent of academic library

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

201 | P a g e

collections are never used (Rose-Wiles, 2013). PDA is a shift in library collection development
practice from just in case (buy everything) to just in time (buy only what is needed). In theory
PDA should lower costs but that has often not been the reality. There is also a serious concern
that patron driven collection management can lead to out of balance collections. “There is a real
difference between building a balanced collection for the future and giving patrons what they
want now. There is a realistic concern that patrons, in buying for immediate need, will change
the nature of academic collections over time, generating excessive amounts of purchases in one
area to the detriment of building a balanced collection” (Hodges, Preston & Hamilton, 2010, p.
219). Another issue is that many library users still prefer to use print over e-books. Nicholas and
Lewis (2008) found that seventy-seven percent of undergraduate students preferred to use a print
book over an e-book for research purposes. “Despite some advances in e-book technology, some
users will undoubtedly continue to prefer print books, particularly if they wish to read a book in
its entirety rather than search or browse it” (Rose-Wiles, 2013, p. 25).
Teleworking. Teleworking or telecommuting has not been heavily utilized in academic
libraries. Technical services librarians, because they do not have any public services
responsibilities, have been allowed to telework several days a week especially in bigger
academic libraries with a large staff. Michigan State University experimented with allowing a
cataloger to telework five days a week for six months as a pilot project as far back as 1994
(Black & Hyslop, 1995). Because of their public service responsibilities reference librarians were
unable to utilize this option. However, information communication technology (ICT) has
progressed to the point that reference service can easily be provided through instant messaging
(IM) or chat technology. Foley (2002) proposed using IM for telecommuting purposes after a
pilot project at the University of Buffalo. Most academic libraries now offer some form of virtual

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

202 | P a g e

reference service through IM, chat, or text messaging. Some academic libraries have hired
outside vendors to staff their remote reference services. As Millennials enter the library work
force in larger numbers, teleworking may become a more desired option. Millennials with their
preference for more flexible working conditions and demand for greater work/life balance are
expected to prefer positions that offer a telecommuting option (Nicholas, 2012). While
telecommuting is little practiced in academic libraries at this time, improved ICT technology
should make it a more attractive and frequently used employment option in the future.
From the previous discussion it is easy to see the reason technological competencies are
so important for academic librarians to possess. Skill in technology was the eighth most
important mega-competency for library directors and senior managers. Many of the most
important decisions in the direction of academic libraries hinge on which technologies are
adopted. Some decisions will be relatively easy to make such as adopting mobile applications
and Web 2.0 tools. Others such as RFID technology may be passing fads which could easily
divert precious library resources down a rabbit hole. Digital preservation efforts are another area
of technology which library leaders must decide to embrace or cede to other fields. Probably the
most important technology decision library leaders must make is what to do about the library
catalog. There are many options available such as vendor produced discovery services, open
source catalogs, catalogs that utilize web-browsing, or no catalog at all. Technological leadership
competencies will be key in making this decision. It is vital that academic libraries choose the
correct avenue to pursue and do not waste precious funds in a vain attempt to out-Google
Google. Library directors with technological leadership competencies will make the correct
decisions and position their libraries for success in the educational mission of their parent
institution.

Globalization
Globalization has begun to impact academic libraries and this impact will increase in the
future. As the pool of college age students in the United States has grown smaller many
universities have increased recruiting of students overseas. This increased recruitment of foreign
students has impacted academic libraries as librarians must learn to educate students from other
countries with different learning styles and in many cases with English as a second language.
Many of the leadership competencies discussed in this research, especially those dealing with
interpersonal competence, are helpful in instructing students from outside the United States. The
ability to be flexible and to accommodate differing learning styles is also key. Due to
globalization visiting scholars from other countries are also often found at U.S. colleges and
universities. Academic reference librarians in particular must have the leadership and
management competencies to provide appropriate services to this clientele.
Another impact of globalization is the expansion of U.S. universities into other countries
through satellite campuses. In many cases, librarians may be called upon to create libraries at
these campuses or to provide services remotely to these locations. Green (2013) found that
librarians at international branch campuses “deal with stresses and obstacles that extend beyond
the usual workplace challenges, as they navigate new cultures and customs that dictate how they
interact with the students and faculty” (p.18). Leadership competencies dealing with social skills
and communication can be the key to successfully adapting to working in a foreign country.
Collaboration is another leadership competency that is essential in operating an academic library
in a foreign country. One of the most important success factors for expatriate academic librarians
is the level of collaboration between the satellite campus and the main U.S. campus (Green,

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

204 | P a g e

2013). The satellite campus is often reliant on the main campus for provision of information
resources and technical expertise.
The other effect of globalization is on the vendors that academic libraries rely on to
provide them with databases, scholarly material, and library systems. As in many other industries
library vendors have seen a wave of consolidation as large corporations buy up smaller
competitors. While this often provides the benefit of economies of scale it also creates less
competition for the library market. As a result the cost of journals, databases, and library systems
have all skyrocketed in the past twenty years. Only the print and e-book markets have remained
somewhat competitive. As academic libraries become more and more reliant on these megacorporations for their systems and information needs, their options shrink and there are few
alternatives available to them. For this reason supporting and developing open access alternatives
is key to the survival of academic libraries in the future.
Legislation
One of the most important developments for academic libraries has been the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) mandate that medical research conducted with federally funded NIH
grants must be made available to the public through open access sources. Researchers funded by
NIH grants are required to submit an electronic copy of their completed manuscripts to the
National Library of Medicine's research repository, PubMed Central, no later than a year after
the official publication date. Lowry (2012) pointed out that Open Access is critical to scientific
progress because it increases citations and follow-on research, the pursuit of new research
pathways, lets scientists incorporate new findings into their research rapidly, and “encourages
contributions by unforeseen participants expanding the potential for new, innovative,
interdisciplinary discoveries” (p. 251).

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

205 | P a g e

The Federal Research Public Access Act (2012) would have required that eleven federal
government agencies require Open Access to federally funded research similar to the NIH
mandate, but it failed to be enacted by Congress mostly due to heavy opposition from the
publishing industry. Despite this setback the Obama Administration has been a strong supporter
of Open Access, and recently passed a White House Directive through the Office of Science and
Technology Policy (2013) which requires any federal agency that sponsors over $100 million in
research to develop plans to make this research publicly accessible. The directive suggests a
similar policy to that in place for NIH funded research. While this plan is still in development, it
is likely that Open Access journals will be the recipients of this research. For academic libraries
Open Access offers the opportunity to provide high quality scientific information to their
institution at a reasonable cost. For this reason it is vital that academic librarians collaborate with
and communicate the importance of Open Access to the faculty at their institutions.
Unfortunately in the area of copyright the federal government has become more
restrictive. The Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (1998) extended the term of
copyright to life of the author plus 70 years, and for works of corporate authorship, it extended it
to 120 years after creation (Lowry, 2012). This had the unfortunate result of setting back
digitization efforts of print works, and is the reason why post-1923 works are not available fulltext in Google Books. Likewise the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998) was damaging to
academic libraries as it “struck a serious blow to the principle of fair use, placing librarians and
others who could likely claim fair use when copying a DVD or PDF file in a Catch-22 scenario.
While the act of copying the file may be legal according to fair use, breaking through any DRM
technology that prevents that copying is now illegal” (McDermott, 2012, p. 9). The “fair use”
exception to copyright law has also come under attack as publishers have sued academic libraries

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

206 | P a g e

for placing journal articles on electronic reserve. Many of these cases are still wending their way
through the court system but for the most part academic libraries have been successful in
defending their right to “fair use” of copyrighted educational material.
Several leadership competencies will be vital in promoting both Open Access and
copyright fair use. Library leaders need to utilize communication competencies to impress upon
their faculty the importance of making their research available through Open Access journals and
institutional repositories. The advocacy competency will also be key as librarians need to be
vocal supporters of the copyright fair use exception and Open Access. The American Library
Association does a good job of lobbying Congress about the importance of fair use to the
educational process in opposition to the efforts of for-profit publishers to further restrict
copyright exceptions. It is also important that academic librarians use the fair use exception to
provide vital services to their users. The knowledge mega-competency is also crucial as
academic library leaders need to be the campus experts on copyright law and Open Access
requirements such as Creative Commons licensing.
Other Trends
Bibliometrics. Bibliometrics is the method used to quantitatively measure scholarly
output and includes citation counts, journal impact factor, h-index, Google Analytics, and other
metrics. As the methods of scholarly communication become more diverse and complex, faculty
members are increasingly turning to academic librarians to assist with bibliometric analysis of
their publications as part of the tenure application process. “Perhaps the most manifest
expression of the scientometric activity trend is that many university and university college
libraries have created positions explicitly titled ‘bibliometrician’”(Astrom & Hansson, 2013, p.
5). Simply conducting a citation count through a database such as Web of Science or Social

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

207 | P a g e

Sciences Citation Index is no longer sufficient to achieve tenure. Colleges and universities are
increasingly interested in determining exactly how faculty members impact the scholarly
communication process. For this reason, librarians who possess knowledge-based competences
in a field such as bibliometrics will be highly valued in the future academic library environment.
Space considerations. Another emerging trend in academic libraries is the redesign of
library spaces to accommodate 21st century teaching and learning requirements as well as to
reflect the lessened importance of maintaining print collections. “The physical library is
increasingly geared to meeting the needs of students, with cafés and social space provided
alongside information resources and other services” (Creaser & Spezi, 2012, p. 4). Also
connected with this issue is the loss of physical space as other institutional departments such as
tutoring services, IT departments, and faculty centers for teaching and learning are increasingly
moved into academic library space. Digitization efforts, compact shelving, and remote storage
are frequently used to decrease the footprint of print collections in academic libraries. The
question then becomes what will this extra space be used for? Academic libraries frequently use
this space for increased instruction areas, group and individual study, library commons, and
cafes. However, there are many other departments on campus that are willing to grab this newly
available space. Housing IT and tutoring services in the library often makes sense as it provides
one-stop shopping for students who are need of services. However, increasingly faculty and
administrative offices as well as classrooms are placed in this newly available space. Continuing
pressures on library space are inevitable. “Libraries must have a compelling vision, strong
campus advocates, and data to justify space allocations as more and more information is digital.
Additionally, it is important to take part in strategic planning processes to understand where
opportunities might exist to align goals with potential partners and to gather support for new

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

208 | P a g e

initiatives” (Butter & Persily, 2010, p. 47). Leadership and management competencies such as
strategic planning, goal setting, innovation, and collaboration will all be key to academic
librarians being a part of the space reorganization process at the institutional level.
Information literacy. As the importance of information literacy grows due to the digital
information explosion and the demands of the college and university accreditation process,
academic librarians will increasingly be involved in curriculum development as partners with
faculty. Learning outcomes assessment increasingly shows that while students have access to
numerous sources of information they are often overwhelmed and confused, as well as unable to
evaluate and differentiate its quality. University accreditation bodies are increasingly including
information literacy objectives in their evaluation of institutions. Universities are increasingly
turning to academic librarians for assistance with embedding information literacy into the
curriculum. Academic librarians are increasingly becoming involved in course instruction in
varying ways from providing information literacy instruction sessions, being “embedded” in the
course by making frequent classroom visits, and being available for student consultations, to coteaching courses (Creaser & Spezi, 2012). Increasingly academic librarians are involved in
curriculum design and planning. This enables librarians to “assist faculty with creating learning
outcomes, and how they can help students develop information literacy skills and become
competent practitioners” (p. 7). Possession of information literacy competencies will become
increasingly important to library leadership in 21st century academic libraries.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

209 | P a g e

Limitations
Petticrew and Roberts (2006) stated that systematic reviews do not always provide a
definitive answer to the research area being studied. A systematic review may only identify the
need for additional research. “The results of reviews are often provisional and indicative, rather
than definitive” (p. 272). Systematic reviews can also be biased or flawed if the researcher is not
careful. “The most common and probably the most serious flaw is the lack of any systematic
critical appraisal of the included studies, but other flaws are common, including a restricted
search for relevant studies, a lack of exploration of heterogeneity among the studies, lack of
information on the exclusion and inclusion criteria, and inappropriate statistical combination of
studies” (p. 271).
Booth and Brice (2004) stated that evidence based research in the information sciences is
based on the idea of a hierarchy, in other words some research designs are superior to others in
reducing bias. However, this is only a generality; in actual practice “the quality of the actual
planning and implementation can vary dramatically” within a particular research design (Booth
& Brice, 2004, p. 43). A major limitation of evidence based research is that it relies on the skill
of the researcher in separating the wheat from the chaff. It is incumbent on the researcher to
determine the quality of each article included in the review, to appraise the methodology,
determine the value of the findings and the conclusions, and to properly synthesize them into a
valuable contribution to the literature which can be relied on by practitioners.
Lastly, the limited number of studies included in this review could constitute a limitation
as it is possible that synthesizing a larger number would have led to the discovery of additional
themes. All relevant library science literature was used in this systematic review but the body of
management literature covering leadership competencies is extensive. Not every management

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

210 | P a g e

article could be included, and the inclusion criteria was limited to other fields undergoing rapid
change. The use of qualitative studies also limits the generalizability of the findings. “Qualitative
research is often regarded as being ungeneralizable beyond individual cases and post-modernists
reject generalization altogether” (Kane, Wood & Barlow, 2007, p. 791). Different
inclusion/exclusion criteria could also affect the results. For instance, it is quite possible that
leadership behaviors and styles are perceived differently in countries outside the United States
and Canada. Although the search strategy was well-thought out and many databases were
searched, it is possible that relevant articles were missed thereby affecting the synthesis. The
greatest limitation is the use of only one reviewer in conducting the research. Use of multiple
reviewers in conducting the meta-ethnography would guard against personal bias and also assure
accuracy and quality (Booker, 2010).

Areas for Future Research
There are many areas rife for future research in the evidence base of management and
leadership competencies. One is the effect of gender on leadership competencies. The research
seems to suggest that gender does have an impact on leadership competencies, in other words
men and women have different innate strengths and weaknesses in competencies but this has yet
to be empirically proven. Age is another factor that seems to affect leadership and management
competencies. Some competencies seem to increase with age while others decline. The old adage
that with age comes wisdom may not be far from the truth at least as it relates to leadership and
management competencies. The biggest controversy in the research on management and
leadership competencies is the nature/nurture debate. Are leadership and management
competencies innate or can they be developed through training. The research suggest that some
competencies are learnable and can be developed through training, while others are innate and

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

211 | P a g e

you either possess them at an early age or you will never possess them. However, this aspect of
leadership competencies like much of the leadership literature is still in dispute and awaits
development through future research.
In addition, future research needs to focus on identifying the most important management
and leadership competencies for the future. In today’s rapidly changing, globalized world
competencies that are important now may be unimportant in the near future, and little used
competencies may become vital. The impact of situation and context on leadership and
management competencies also needs further research. Future research needs to focus more
specifically on prioritizing which leadership competencies seem to be the most potent in the most
situations (Tubbs & Schulz, 2006). Another area for future research is to “examine how
contextual factors, such as work environment characteristics and organizational environment
characteristics, affect the relationship between leadership and management competencies and
managerial effectiveness” (Caligiuri & Tarique, 2012, p. 9). The optimal level and amount of
training to develop leadership and management competencies also needs further investigation.
The effectiveness of leadership and management competencies at the individual, team, and
organizational is an area in need of further study. Leadership and management competency
research in library literature has been lacking in the past five years. Many of the same issues with
management study of competencies needs to be investigated in the field of libraries as well.

Summary
This research investigated which leadership and management competencies were most
important for leading academic libraries into the future. An evidence-based systematic review of
the literature revealed that competencies associated with transformational leadership were highly
valued by academic librarians in an environment of rapid change. Similarly competencies

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

212 | P a g e

associated with emotional intelligence were highly valued attributes in library directors and
senior managers. The research found that leadership and management competencies had
universal application regardless of profession. Only knowledge-based competencies associated
with a profession were not of value in other fields. Strategies for dealing with radical change
such as organizational development, systems thinking, appreciative inquiry, creating a learning
organization, re-organization of staff, and the frequency and use of library services assessment
were found to be tools used by library directors and senior managers to lead academic librarians
through a change initiative. Finally, organizational climate and changing the climate were often
the focus of library directors as they sought to diminish resistance to change among academic
librarians.
This research also included lists of the highest ranking and most important management
and leadership competencies in the management field and in librarianship. A conceptual
framework of the impact of leadership and management competencies in the academic library
environment was presented. A leadership competency model was developed to assist academic
librarians in development of the most important competencies required in the 21st century
academic library. The importance of the research to management and library practitioners was
presented. Possible limitations of the dissertation were discussed. The dissertation concluded
with suggestions for areas of future research in leadership and management competencies.
The Successful 21st Century Academic Library
What will the successful 21st Century academic library look like? With the current rate of
technological change it is almost impossible to make even short term predictions. Successful
academic libraries will integrate digital and print resources in a manner that best assists the
educational mission of the university, and which supports the teaching and learning needs of

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

213 | P a g e

faculty and students. It will provide both individual, small group, and large group spaces for
study and collaboration. The resources of the library will be easy for users to navigate and
available both on-campus and remotely with 24/7 access. The successful academic library of the
future will be more than a building, it will be the center of the university where faculty and
students gather to study, learn, research, and even socialize. Most importantly, the successful 21st
century academic library will properly utilize the myriad of talents possessed by its most
important resource – academic librarians. Academic librarians will fulfill many roles and provide
expertise in a multitude of areas – information literacy, collection development, digital
preservation, Open Access advocacy, copyright expertise, research assistance, metadata
knowledge, use of Web 2.0 tools, bibliometric proficiency, and assistance with social media and
mobile technologies.
While it may be difficult to predict what the successful academic library of the future will
look like, it is much easier to chart how library directors and senior managers can guide their
libraries to this goal. Key to this transformation is the successful practice of leadership and
management competencies at all levels of the academic library. While this dissertation has
focused on library directors and senior managers, every academic librarian must be a leader. It is
impossible for any library leader to possess or develop all the leadership competencies discussed
in this research. Every academic librarian must find his or her niche and be prepared to assume a
leadership role when the competencies they possess become important to supporting a library
goal or initiative. There will be two leadership competencies which will be vital to this
transformation – the creative problem solving and innovation mega-competency, and the
leadership and change management mega-competency.

Creative problem solving and innovation mega-competency. The creative problem
solving and innovation mega-competency will be one key factor in the transformation of the
academic library. Creative problem solving and innovation was the sixth most important megacompetency in the library literature but it will be vital to transforming academic libraries for the
future. This mega-competency consists of five individual competencies – customer service,
creativity, innovation, user needs, and problem solving. All these competencies will play a part
in the academic library transformation process. High quality customer service and user needs
should be the focus of academic librarians as they solve problems, work creatively, and innovate.
Figure 8 depicts how the creative problem solving and innovation mega-competency can lead to
a transformed academic library.

As the model depicts, creative problem solving and innovation must be practiced at all
levels of the library – at the individual, team, and organizational level. At the organizational level
library directors must build and communicate a vision of the transformed academic library they
wish to create and empower their staff to achieve this vision. At the team level academic
librarians must assume leadership responsibilities, and use their specific management and
leadership competencies to contribute to team learning and achieving library goals. At the
individual level all academic librarians need to practice continuous learning so that leadership
and management competencies can be developed to support the transformation process. Library
directors need to provide the resources to develop academic librarians and create an
organizational climate that fosters shared learning. This type of organizational climate will lead
to the creation of a learning organization – one which can continue to adapt and transform to
meet the needs of its users. Many competencies and techniques will assist with this process.
Professional development, leadership, and skills training will be available to all academic
librarians and support staff as well. Academic libraries will move away from hierarchical
organizational charts to flattened structures which will lead to enhanced communication. The
strategic planning and goal setting knowledge competencies will be effectively utilized by library
directors and senior managers. The technological skill leadership competency will be used to
adopt improved technology which simplifies the research process for faculty and students. The
end result will be an innovative and successful academic library of the 21st century prepared to
embrace the teaching and learning mission of its parent institution.
Leadership and change management mega-competency. The leadership and change
management mega-competency is the other key to successfully leading academic libraries into
the future. This mega-competency consists of nine individual competencies which include

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

217 | P a g e

leadership, managing/leading change, leadership competencies, transformational leadership, and
change leadership. Managing and leading change will be crucial to the success of 21st century
academic libraries. Library directors and senior managers will need to practice the competencies
associated with transformational leadership to empower their staff to achieve their vision. Most
importantly, as mentioned previously it will be vital that academic librarians at all levels act as
leaders in the transformational process. The leadership competency that can best assist with this
process is self-leadership.
Self-leadership. A crucial leadership competency for the future of academic libraries is
self-directed leadership. Theoretically this would mean that every academic librarian is a leader,
and that all librarians are completely autonomous and responsible for all decision-making in their
own milieu. Charles Manz (1986) is the management theorist who has advocated for what he
called self-leadership. “Building on Bandura’s social learning theory, Manz argued for fostering
self-planning, self-direction, self-monitoring, and self-control, which could replace otherwise
needed supervision” (Bass and Bass, 2008, p. 871). Wassenaar and Pearce (2012) believed selfleadership could be a “possible substitute for a more traditionally appointed, vertical leader” (p.
367).
Manz and Sims (1980) first proposed self-management and found that “the more
individual group members knew and understood about the organization’s needs, the more highly
skilled they were, and the more motivated they were to engage in activities that were productive,
the more likely their ability to lead themselves would mitigate the need for proximal control,
direction, and supervision” (Wassenaar & Pearce, 2012, p. 367). In 1986 Manz proposed his
theory of self-leadership which he conceptualized “as a comprehensive self-influence perspective
that concerns leading oneself toward performance of naturally motivating tasks as well as

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

218 | P a g e

managing oneself to do work that must be done but is not naturally motivating” (p. 589). With
this theory Manz (1986) began to move from self-management to self-leadership – the idea that
employees could lead themselves without a direct supervisor.
Perhaps the ultimate goal of self-leadership practice should be to enhance the
effectiveness of employees in managing their own thought patterns. For example, in
addition to systematically managing one's own behavior or altering the physical context
or the process by which work is performed, one can manage his/her mental representation
of the work. In a sense, the job is redesigned mentally rather than physically (p. 594).

There has been little discussion of self-leadership in the library literature but it will be
one of the most important competencies for the transformation process. Figure 9 depicts how the
self-leadership competency can assist with the creation of the successful 21st century academic
library.

Figure 9 portrays the role of the self-leadership competency in the transformational
process to successful 21st century academic library. This model’s major influence came from the
work of Carmeli, Meitar, and Weisberg (2006). As a result of their thinking, the figure begins
with the influence of the three aspects that make up self-leadership: behavior focused strategies,
natural reward strategies, and constructive thought patterns. Academic librarians who practice
positive behavior focused strategies will identify specific behaviors that need to be changed,
enhanced, or terminated, will set challenging goals and be self-motivated, and will avoid
mistakes or correct them when they occur. Librarians who practice natural reward strategies will
find work pleasant, enjoyable, and stimulating leading to better performance. Finally, academic
librarians who exhibit constructive thought patterns will have a positive attitude and view
difficulties as obstacles to be overcome. Librarians who practice these three behaviors will
exhibit high levels of the self-leadership competency.
In the model high levels of self-leadership will lead to superior levels of creative
potential. However, creative potential must be nurtured. Those academic librarians who perceive
high levels of organizational support, and perceive supervisory support for creativity, will exhibit
greater levels of creative self-leadership. Library directors and senior managers can support
creative potential through providing a vision and progressive strategic planning for the future.
Funding must be made available to provide for professional development and training in
leadership and management competencies. Creative behavior must be encouraged and autonomy
provided to librarians. Micromanagement of creative library staff must be avoided. Supervisory
support of creative behavior is provided by encouraging academic librarians to challenge the
status quo, having an open attitude toward risk taking, using mistakes as learning opportunities,
and sharing knowledge and information (DiLiello & Houghton, 2006). Academic librarians who

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

221 | P a g e

receive the appropriate organizational and supervisory support will evidence high levels of the
creative self-leadership competency.
In the final stage of the model creative self-leadership will lead to a successful 21st
century academic library where leaders support all library staff through training and providing
incentives and rewards for innovative behavior (Phelan & Young, 2003). Proper training
methods increase self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation, which leads to the acquisition of vital
leadership and management competencies. Providing an adequate wage system, bonuses for
innovative behavior, and other forms of economic reward are also necessary to turn creative selfleadership into the leadership and management competencies necessary for the successful
academic library of the future (Carmeli, Meitar & Weisberg, 2006).
Final Thoughts
Most transformational change in academic libraries is either technologically or
economically motivated. Where is the evidence-based proof that these changes have resulted in
improvements? Saving money is an improvement to the bottom line but that is its only impact.
The successful academic library of the future will use the assessment/evaluation megacompetency to make evidence-based decisions from two perspectives: high quality service to the
user and contribution to the teaching and learning mission of the university. Typical library
evaluation of the past has looked at collection size, access to electronic resources, number of
seats available, operating hours, total number of computers, budget, and staff to student ratios –
which while important do little to measure either level of service to the user or contribution to
the mission. They also don’t measure staff job satisfaction and morale – two important factors
that directly affect service to the user.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

222 | P a g e

Mission to the university can be measured through outcomes assessment – what have
students learned through their library interactions? However, these types of measurements are
rare and difficult to perform properly. The previously mentioned ARL survey LibQual does not
do this but is basically a satisfaction survey. Wood, Miller, and Knapp (2007) stated that
“understanding outcomes, developing approaches to use outcomes as an assessment technique,
training staff to be able to implement outcomes assessment, and then using the results for
decision making can be time-consuming and difficult” (p. 172). Also important is gathering data
from the user perspective. Satisfaction surveys are not enough – they inevitably result in high
user satisfaction. There is an ARL survey that claims to measure this – ServQual. However, like
LibQual there has been no research that verifies its construct validity. Academic librarians who
possess the evaluation/assessment mega-competency will be the leaders who use evidence-based
management to successfully lead their organizations into the future.
Although there has been a great deal of discussion about transformational change in
academic libraries in the last few decades, the reality is that other than staffing and work
processes, little has changed. “Even though librarians and library managers have talked a great
deal about developing teams, empowering staff, and implementing innovative management
strategies, the actual organizational framework of academic libraries has remained largely static.
College and university libraries today are openly hierarchical, just as they were decades ago,
reflecting a managerial pattern that owes more to the corridors of the business community than to
the halls of the academic world” (McKinzie, 2000, p. 1). Library directors and senior managers
often give lip service to participatory management and transformational leadership tenets, but
seldom follow through on its promise for change.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

223 | P a g e

In order for real change to occur there must be a change in the leadership and
management competencies practiced by library directors and senior managers. Too many library
leaders engage in micromanagement of their staff. Library directors need to concentrate on the
leadership competencies uncovered in this research that empower their employees to create
transformational change. Every library staff member must be empowered and developed to
possess the competencies that are necessary for transformational change. There must also be an
understanding among all academic librarians that while change is not easy, it is necessary to
create the successful academic library of the future. As Beerel (2009) stated “the vision may be
sobering and challenging; one that calls for sacrifice, personal resilience and determination. The
task of leadership is to mobilize others to embrace this vision because it is aligned with reality,
regardless of its personal appeal” (p. 70).

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

255 | P a g e

If Y/T < 75 percent or if N + U/T = 25 percent then you can safely conclude that the section
identifies significant omissions and that the study’s validity is questionable. It is important to
look at the overall validity as well as section validity.
Calculation for overall validity: (Y + N + U = T)
If Y/T > 75 percent or if N + U/T < 25 percent then you can safely conclude that the study is
valid.

Appendix E Sample Expert Panel Invitation Letter

7-23-2014
Dr. Ronald Riggio
Henry R. Kravis Professor of Leadership and Organizational Psychology
Claremont McKenna College
500 E. Ninth Street
Claremont, CA 91711
Re: Inviting Your Participation in an Expert Panel
Dear Dr. Riggio:
I am writing to invite your participation in the Doctor of Management Program at the University
of Maryland University College. A key part of our six chapter dissertation outline/process (see
attached) is the involvement of topic experts whom we ask to read and comment on a draft of the
beginning sections of a student’s dissertation. The Expert Panel, as it is called, is comprised of
persons with either academic or practical experience on the topic (or both). The purpose of the
Expert Panel is to obtain comments and advice from those who know the topic either from their
own research or from their extensive experience.
Dissertations in the UMUC Doctoral program follow evidence based research. The evidencebased research (EBR) approach includes systematic reviews of research studies, case studies,
quasi-grounded theory development, and analysis of data previously collected by others. The
rationale for taking this approach is that the DM program is committed to developing
practitioner-scholars who are competent consumers of management and educational
administration research.
We are not asking for you to do an extensive critique of a dissertation in progress, but rather to
respond to a set of questions (see attached) which focus on the draft of the first two chapters.
Please respond to the student regarding your participation as a panel member through the email
or residence address provided below. The title of the dissertation is also provided. If you are
agreeable, you will receive the draft dissertation in the next several days. At that time it would
be very helpful if you could return your evaluation within the following two to three weeks
directly to the doctoral student.

Dissertation Topic: The Academic Library in the 21st Century: What Competencies Must
Library Directors and Senior Managers Possess to Successfully Lead Their Organizations into
the Future
Feedback from: Dr. Lynn Baird

Please provide your insights and suggestions for each of these topic areas. Comments and
suggestions under each topic are expected and very much appreciated.

Clarity of the Study Problem – Is the topic’s relationship to the field of management practice
made clear and explained?

Your observations:
The topic, leader competencies required for library leaders, is clear and seated in the context of a
bleak future for academic libraries. The case for the demise of the academic library seemed to
have a historical context (perhaps could be updated to reflect a more modern set of concerns).
The study’s problem has solid grounding in that successful leadership of academic libraries
depends on the leaders’ abilities and talents. To identify these competencies then should lead to
strategies on how these can be taught or acquired.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

266 | P a g e

Significance of this Study – To what extent would this study contribute to the practice of
management? How original is this study?

Your insights, including awareness of similar studies or research that would duplicate this
study?
The significance of this study is in the application of evidence-based librarianship to the study of
academic library leadership/management. This research method is not widely used in the field of
library science and has the potential for providing a quantitative lens to understanding the topic
as well as to better inform the profession of this research methodology.

Scope of this Study – Is the scope of this study made clear? Is it focused on management issues
that can be realistically investigated?

Your observations about its do-ability:
The student intends to do a systematic review of previous studies to locate evidence of leader
competency. There are two major challenges presented here, in my opinion. One, how does the
student use a quantitative tool to interpret qualitative research (and, in this case, I think we
should identify the Delphi method as a qualitative tool). Second, locating sufficient current
studies to address the problem: have the recent economic crises yielded different competency
needs? Academic libraries have, in the past seven years, undergone new pressures presented by
the post-global economic collapse as well as the academic interpretation of the No Child Left
Behind Act, which makes assessment a much more prominent part of the leadership agenda.

Literature informing this Study – Does the type and relevance of literature reviewed here
provide the proper direction for this study?

Your observations and suggestions literature sources that would be helpful:
The literature review provided in this draft seemed to be insufficient to provide the theoretical
framework for this research project. I believe the student provided an example of the study itself?

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

267 | P a g e

Conceptual Framework – Does the student present a clear picture of how key factors are related,
and how those factors would be explained through research?

Your comments:
The graph created by the student was a helpful visual aid. I suggest the second column that
centers on the library might be removed and placed in the background, as this describes the
context for the leadership activities. I might suggest the student reflect on the library user’s role
as this might better describe the successful academic library of the future.

Overall Written Quality – Does this study present a clear line of reasoning consistent with other
management research materials you are familiar with?

Your suggestions for overall improvements that can be made to this approach:
I was confused by the directions this work took. I saw some language fully repeated between
chapters. From the organizational structure, I expected the leadership competencies for different
fields to be identified and then compared with leadership competencies for change management.

I also anticipated seeing a discussion of research methods that might have compared the
strengths/weaknesses of EBL. As it was, I felt I needed to read more about EBL in order to
complete this questionnaire.

Finally, I found it difficult to read through some of the grammatical errors. I am confident that
these will be corrected in the final version.

Overall Practical Value – Does this study offer a clear and recognizable opportunity to produce
results that would impact a management practice?

Your comments:
I think the field of leadership is not well understood nor presented in professional coursework. I
expect this study will help both practitioners as well as library science instruction.

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

268 | P a g e

Overall Strengths of this study

Your comments:
I am intrigued by the concept of EBL and look forward to seeing how one applies the lens of
discovering knowledge on a literature that is based on constructed realities.

Overall weaknesses of this study

Your comments:
At this point, I think the literature review needs to be strengthened in order to support the study.

Dissertation Topic: The Academic Library in the 21st Century: What Competencies Must
Library Directors and Senior Managers Possess to Successfully Lead Their Organizations into
the Future
Feedback from: Dr. Jon Cawthorne
Please provide your insights and suggestions for each of these topic areas. Comments and
suggestions under each topic are expected and very much appreciated.
Clarity of the Study Problem –
Your observations: I believe John K. Lewis’ investigation of leader and manager competencies
for academic library directors is well articulated and timely. The study problem is clear. I
appreciate the through discussion of the disruptive era, OPACs and online databases. I would
like to see Mr. Lewis extend this conversation with a brief discussion of recent developments
with Discovery Systems. These new search instances go beyond the single item OPAC and
online databases. They represent our professions effort to make searching easy as Google,
however, Discovery Systems search, return and display results very differently. I believe
Discovery Systems represent the future and OPACs will slowly disappear. Adding this
discussion will strengthen the study problem and help bring more authenticity and clarity to the
academic library current environment.
Significance of this Study –
Your insights, I believe this study contributes to the growing research on the future of the
academic library. Significant, deep and sustainable change happens through leadership at all
levels of the organization, but specifically the top level which this study so aptly addresses.
Further, I believe the design of the study which focuses on critical competencies is needed and
unique. I would add encourage Mr. Lewis to investigate the following research from Dr. Wilson.

directors deeper understanding of culture becomes important because 1) cultures can change and
2) top leaders often may be unaware of actions and perspectives that influential leaders around
them (in this case HR professionals that sit on management teams) grasp enough about bringing
about cultural change.
Cawthorne, J.E. (2013). Viewing the Future of the University Library through the Perspective of
Scenarios
I look forward to reading the findings from this study.

Scope of this Study – Is the scope of this study made clear? Is it focused on management issues
that can be realistically investigated?
Your observations about its do-ability: I believe the scope is very do-able. This research is
squarely focused on the management and leadership of library directors. An area that may need
clarity only for me and probably does not affect the existing study is the difference between Mr.
Lewis’ research question on page 20 and research propositions that emerged from the review of
the literature. I believe the question refers to (the professional) competencies library directors
poses to affect change. On page 80, under the heading, Review of Research Propositions, Mr.
Lewis notes the “personal leadership behaviors” preferred by librarians and (I presume) staff. I
would ask are the competencies the same?
Literature informing this Study – Does the type and relevance of literature reviewed here
provide the proper direction for this study?
Your observations and suggestions literature sources that would be helpful: See significance of
study…for several references related to Culture. I recognize the focus is on the literature of
academic libraries. Since there is not a great deal of research in the library profession, it might
be wise to selectively introduce ideas and concepts from other fields that support the

investigation of organizational development and culture. If interested, I can provide a list of
resources Mr. Lewis may consider.
Conceptual Framework – Does the student present a clear picture of how key factors are related,
and how those factors would be explained through research?
Your comments: Yes.

Overall Written Quality – Does this study present a clear line of reasoning consistent with other
management research materials you are familiar with?
Your suggestions for overall improvements that can be made to this approach: I believe Mr.
Lewis should be commended for the depth of thought displayed throughout Chapters 1-4.
Overall, I agree with his analysis. I am not sure I can add much in the way of improvements. On
page 11, I would note under Significance of the Problem, the use of the word, “disappear”. This
word and its meaning to an entire profession, to me, confirms a very prevalent fear among
librarians. In fact, Appreciative Inquiry teaches us to focus on what is good, and building on
what we do well. And what librarians do is needed even more, however, the challenge is to bring
a new understanding to our organizations that is not based on fear and scarcity; rather one that
acknowledges the skill of the professional librarian. If I had any suggestion, I’d say steer clear of
stark descriptions of the problem. I am happy to elaborate on this point if necessary.
Overall Practical Value – Does this study offer a clear and recognizable opportunity to produce
results that would impact a management practice?
Your comments: Yes.

Overall Strengths of this study
Your comments: Mr. Lewis’ interest and study will be an exciting addition to the conversation
of change and transformation in academic libraries. Further, I believe that his focus on the top
leader is extremely valuable. I appreciate his statement of the problem and the importance to
leadership and management within academic libraries.
Overall weaknesses of this study

DMGT 891 student: John K. Lewis

Dissertation Topic: The Academic Library in the 21st Century: What Competencies Must
Library Directors and Senior Managers Possess to Successfully Lead Their Organizations into
the Future
Feedback from: Ron Riggio

Please provide your insights and suggestions for each of these topic areas. Comments and
suggestions under each topic are expected and very much appreciated.

Clarity of the Study Problem – Is the topic’s relationship to the field of management practice
made clear and explained?

Your observations: The topic is crystal clear: determining the competencies needed by library
leaders in a time of incredible transition.

Significance of this Study – To what extent would this study contribute to the practice of
management? How original is this study?

Your insights: I was unaware that there was ANY research directly on this topic (library
leadership), but research was covered in the dissertation. However, this goes beyond that

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

274 | P a g e

research, so it could be a very significant contribution both to research knowledge, but also in
guiding libraries in their leader selection and development efforts.

Scope of this Study – Is the scope of this study made clear? Is it focused on management issues
that can be realistically investigated?

Your observations about its do-ability: I believe that this topic is an important one and one that
can be addressed. However, without knowing specifically the details of the methodology I am
unable to determine if this is the BEST way to go about studying the question.

Literature informing this Study – Does the type and relevance of literature reviewed here
provide the proper direction for this study?

Your observations and suggestions literature sources that would be helpful: This is an
extremely comprehensive and detailed review of the relevant literature. The scope of the
literature review is quite broad and it is very strong.

Conceptual Framework – Does the student present a clear picture of how key factors are related,
and how those factors would be explained through research?

Your comments: I think that the research question is quite clear, but I have concerns about the
methodology. It just is not completely clear to me (but I am an empiricist). I would like to have
seen more attention to the research question itself and what “model” or framework for leader
competencies is informing this work.

Overall Written Quality – Does this study present a clear line of reasoning consistent with other
management research materials you are familiar with?

Future Leadership Competencies in Academic Libraries – John Lewis

275 | P a g e

Your suggestions for overall improvements that can be made to this approach: The writing
quality and attention to detail are quite high. This is an exceptionally strong part of the
dissertation.

Overall Practical Value – Does this study offer a clear and recognizable opportunity to produce
results that would impact a management practice?

Your comments: This could potentially be ground-breaking from a practitioner standpoint to
help inform libraries how to lead in a changing environment. It is much needed work, as I have
spoken to several library heads about leading and managing change and the difficulties
associated with fundamental transitions taking place in academic libraries.

Overall Strengths of this study

Your comments: Exceptionally strong literature review

Overall weaknesses of this study

Your comments: I am not as clear on the methodology and how the study will actually be
carried out.
