ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS
The School of the Library

Masters in Library and Information Science

Professor Johanna R Drucker, Chair

Despite the enormous efforts which preceded the founding of the School of Library
service at UCLA, two critics in the August 1959 issue of Southern California Chapter of the
Special Libraries Association Bulletin--Robert Lewis and Frank Bennett, the latter of which was
the Bulletin’s editor--created a stir in the special libraries community when they adamantly went
against the general consensus of enthusiasm for the School of Library Service, and rather,
vehemently opposed it. In exploring the reasons for and responses to these criticisms, this thesis
will present an argument as to why these early critics were erroneous in their assessment of
library education in Southern California and why the School of Library Service’s legacy and
history, especially the efforts of Regent Edward Augustus Dickson, are essential in
understanding the importance of UCLA’s “School of the Library.” Using information which was
known in 1959 as well as that which is now known in retrospect, this thesis will assert reasons
why the University of California Regents made a commendable decision in approving the School
of Library Service at UCLA.

Importance of Topic
Future decisions regarding the fate of library education at UCLA may be informed by the
context and arguments provided herein. It is the hope of the author of this thesis that in
exploring the foundational philosophies on which the School of Library Service was built and
confronting the anxious predictions of even its most ardent critics, the reader will develop an
appreciation for the Regents’ decision to approve the SLS, so that any future discussion of
decommissioning or dismissing ALA accreditation may be strongly reconsidered.

Introduction
The idea for a professional school of librarianship at UCLA was initially met with
opposition. This thesis will show that the opposition was not warranted and that over the years
the school has shown its value.
Although the idea for library education at UCLA can be traced back to the early 1920s, it
was not until November 1958 that the School of Library Service was officially approved by the
University of California Regents. 1 Regent Edward Augustus Dickson, who was arguably the
most influential figure in the founding of UCLA, had envisioned that UCLA would have all the
professional schools. A professional school of library education, which he liked to call “The
School of the Library,” was one of his most adamant pursuits. That Dickson would pass
unexpectedly just two years prior to Regent approval of UCLA’s School of Library Service is
one of the saddest unknown tragedies of UCLA.
The decades-long history of library education at UCLA from idea to inception is integral
to understanding the school’s importance in Southern California library education history.
Although the school’s most visceral critics--who chose to make themselves known only after its
approval--presented arguments which completely ignored the legacy leading up to the SLS’s
founding, this thesis should serve as the final rebuttal to their arguments by showing that not
only were their criticisms unwarranted when they made them, time has also disproved their
erroneous predictions.

Chapter 1: Beginnings of Library Education in Southern California and the Origins of UCLA

The idea for library education at UCLA has been traced by Lawrence Clark Powell as far
back as a proposition set forth by Los Angeles city librarian Everett Perry who, in 1930, had
approached both UCLA and USC to see if either would relieve the duties of running the Los
Angeles Public Library’s librarian training school. 2 The LAPL had been established in 1872. In
1891, Los Angeles’ sixth city librarian and former newspaper woman, Tessa Kelso--described as
a tough, distinctive and unconventional woman--established the LAPL’s first systematic training
program for library employees. 3 Kelso’s successor, Mary Jones, further helped to develop the
training program’s courses and encouraged LAPL staff to enroll. 4 Despite a month-long
investigation of Jones’ largely-contested dismissal, the decision to replace Jones with Charles
Lummis, was upheld by the Los Angeles city council--a decision which Susan B. Anthony
predicted in saying “of course the man will win, because there's only men to settle it.” 5 6 Charles
Lummis was a character of the old west. He was the first City Editor of the Los Angeles Times, a
writer, historian and Indian rights activist. He had had a number of unique experiences such as
walking 143 days to Los Angeles from Cincinnati and surviving being shot by an assassin in the

name Lummis as one of the SLS’s “patron saints” along with Sydney B. Mitchell, the Founding
Dean of the school of librarianship at University of California, Berkeley, and James L. Gillis, the
California State Librarian from 1899 until 1917. 9 Lummis contributed to the LAPL training
school program by setting higher admission and entrance examination standards for applicants. 10
Five years after his appointment, he was succeeded by Everett Perry.
Everett Perry was born in Massachusetts in 1876 and educated at both Harvard and the
New York State Library School, in Albany. Perry held a life-long ambition of one day directing a
major library and when traveled to Pasadena to attend the ALA convention in 1911, he
successfully interviewed for the position of LAPL library director. Shortly after his appointment
at the LAPL, Perry, too, raised the difficulty of the entrance exam for the LAPL training school.
He also set a maximum age of thirty, and encouraged completion of college prior to applying.
Perry appointed Helen Kennedy, graduate of University of Illinois Library School and former
instructor at the Wisconsin Library School, as principal of the LAPL’s training school. When
Kennedy was promoted to the head of Los Angeles’ branch libraries she was succeed at the
LAPL school by Theodora Brewitt, also a graduate of Wisconsin and former librarian from Long
Beach Public Library.

In 1913, Brewitt lengthened courses and added classes in current events, book selection,
trade bibliography, library history, and library binding. By 1914, the LAPL school’s program
duration was eleven months, included a formal internship program, and no longer required a
commitment to work at the LAPL upon completion of the program. LAPL’s training class
system had been officially organized into a professional library school supported by public
library funds. 11 Also in 1914, the LAPL, which had been previously housed in rented downtown
buildings, moved into a new building at Grand and 5th Street. This building at Grand and 5th had
previously been occupied by the California State Normal School’s Southern Branch, which had
moved to a new campus on Vermont Avenue. 12 As of 2017, this is now the site of Los Angeles
City College.
The California State Normal School, which later became San Jose State University, had
been founded in 1862 as a school for teachers, and in 1881, Los Angeles residents--of which
there were roughly 12,000--successfully lobbied for the California State Legislature to authorize
its Southern Branch. The Southern Branch of the California State Normal School opened in
1882, and in 1887 became known as the Los Angeles State Normal School. In 1917, Ernest
Carroll Moore was recruited from Harvard to serve as the President of the Los Angeles State
Normal School. Moore has been described as a kindly, unassuming, and old-fashioned man, with
a passion for learning. 13 He loved to read and collect books, especially the classics, philosophy,
education, and history, and held a foundational philosophy that “Education is learning to use the

tools which the race has found indispensable.” 14 Moore also had a plan to petition the University
of California to consider operating a teacher’s college through the Normal School. Moore was
regarded as an educator and belonging to the “Dewey philosophy of education,” and University
of California Regent Edward Augustus Dickson, admiring Columbia and what that university
had become, wanted to see what Moore thought about the idea of making a major university and
not just a school of education. 15
Shortly after his appointment in 1917, Moore met with Dickson, the only Southern
California member of the University of California Board of Regents. Dickson had been
appointed to the Board of Regents in 1913, by Governor Hiram Johnson, whose election Dickson
had helped to secure. Johnson had been elected in 1910 as member of the Lincoln–Roosevelt
League, a group founded by Dickson, who was the editor and publisher of the Los Angeles
Evening Express, and fellow newspaperman Charles Rowell. Dickson and Rowell had used their
newspapers to promote a favorable image of Johnson. Upon being elected, Johnson said to
Dickson, “Dick you can have anything you want. What do you want? Railroad commissioner?”
Dickson said “I’d like to be Regent,” so we has appointed Regent, and so overjoyed by the
appointment, that he came to tell his wife with tears in his eyes. 16 Dickson, who was the
youngest regent in UC history at age thirty-three, had his own plan of eventually opening a great
University in Los Angeles as part of the UC system and enthusiastically supported Moore’s plan,
despite the fact that Benjamin Ide Wheeler, President of the University of California from 1899

to 1919, as well as Regent Rowell, were both rather opposed to the idea of a southern campus. 17
Dickson attributes his position as editor and publisher of the Los Angeles Evening Express, a
newspaper which he would later go on to own, as largely influential in promoting public opinion
in favor of the creation of a “University in the Southland.” 18 Fortunately David Prescott Barrows,
the new President of the University of California in 1919, did not share his predecessor
Wheeler's objections and on May 23, 1919, Governor William D. Stephens signed Assembly Bill
626 into law, which transformed the Los Angeles Normal School into the Southern Branch of the
University of California.
Developing simultaneously but as a separate entity, the Los Angeles Public Library
School had been admitted into the Association of American Library School in 1918, promoting
itself as California’s only accredited program. 19 Marion Horton succeeded Brewitt as its
principal and the LAPL school began a program which allowed graduates to take their fifth year
in training school and at the same time to receive their teachers' certificate. 20 In 1921 the Los
Angeles Public Library School was recognized in the Williamson Report, an extensive study
conducted by Charles Williamson, Director of Information Service of the Rockefeller
Foundation, and prepared for the Carnegie Corporation of New York for the purpose of
providing the Carnegie trustees with an accurate assessment of library education in the United
States. 21 When Williamson conducted his study, he had visited the fifteen schools across the
nation between the months of December 1920 and May 1921, and met with all the library

directors. His research is presented in two parts, Training for Library Work from 1921 and
Training for Library Service from 1923. Of the fifteen Schools presented in the Williamson
Report, three were located in California: LAPL, the Riverside Library Service School in
Riverside, and the University of California in Berkeley, which offered courses in library service.
The Riverside Library Service School began when Joseph Francis Daniels became
Riverside library director in 1910. Shortly after his appointment, Daniels, his staff, as well as a
few students, began a study of their daily work within the library so that they could improve
service and better inform the library’s policies and mission. The study evolved into the Riverside
Library Service School which Daniels founded in 1911, and by 1913 the school was offering
courses in both summer and winter. The courses were taught by reputable faculty, the expenses
of which were offset by student fees. In October 1921, just months after Williamson and Daniels
met, and shortly before the first Williamson report was completed, Daniels died unexpected from
a paralytic stroke, and this event changed Williamson’s support for the Riverside Library Service
School. 22 23
Williamson had been so “captivated” by Daniels that even though he believed that “the
training for librarians like the training of teachers is a state rather than a city function,” and that
“library schools conducted by public libraries should be regarded as temporary expedients,”
Williamson was willing make an “exception to sound policy,” since he believed Daniels to be a
man of “inspiration and genius” who had genuine affection for his community. 24 Although
Daniel’s approach encompassed not much more than an apprenticeship-styled “learn-by doing”
approach, Williamson believed that “a year spent in that environment, no matter what the

character of the formal instruction, would be excellent preparation for service in small town and
rural libraries.” 25 Without Daniels, however, Williamson could only conclude that the Riverside
Library Service School should be “given up” and that California State library interests should
focus on the two “strategically located” schools at Los Angeles and Berkeley. 26
Library education at UC Berkeley had begun when Melvil Dewey, of Dewey Decimal
fame and the founder of the New York State Library School, wrote to the University of
California president Benjamin Ide Wheeler in 1901 to suggest that he consider the opportunities
for library education on the West Coast. 27 The University of California, which had opened in
Berkeley as the College of California in 1869, had begun offering summer courses in
librarianship in 1902. Despite the opening of the California State Library School in Sacramento
in 1914, the University of California continued to offer summer courses in librarianship until
1918. After his graduation from McGill University, Sydney Bancroft Mitchell had been working
at Stanford as an order librarian where he met and became friends with colleague Edith Margaret
Coulter, who had graduated from both Stanford and the New York State Library School. 28
Coulter then transferred to the University of California’s reference department, eventually
becoming that department’s head, and it was she who recommended Mitchell to fill Harold
Leupp’s position in Accessions and as Assistant Librarian after Leupp was promoted to
University Librarian in 1918. 29 An emergency course in library training was initiated by Mitchell

and quickly developed into a School of Librarianship which soon achieved national prominence.
In 1922 Mitchell gave up his work as head of the Accessions Department and became Associate
Librarian and lecturer in library science. 30 In 1921, the State Library School closed and the
duties were turned over to the University of California. The Department of Librarianship was
approved for the College of Letters and Science in 1921 and courses began in 1922.
Despite the desirable location and prominent instructors of UC Berkeley’s library school,
Williamson still reported that the Los Angeles Public Library School had strongest library
program in California and the best location. 31 Given the LAPL School’s proximity to the new
Southern Branch University of California, Williamson proposed that: “there is just now a
splendid opportunity to put the State School on its feet and bring it into cooperative relations
with the Los Angeles School [...] aid from the Carnegie Corporation that would result in proper
support of a university library school by the great State of California would go far toward
stimulating and guiding development in other states.” 32 According to Williamson, the value of
this example could be increased by bringing the Los Angeles Public Library School under the
state school. “Since the University of California already had a Southern Branch in Los Angeles,
the Los Angeles Public Library would probably be glad to turn over its school to the university,
if its proper support and administration were assured.” 33 Herein is an example of how the idea
for a library school at UCLA can arguably be traced as far back as 1921. The reason Lawrence
Powell could only trace the origin of the idea for library education at UCLA back as far as 1930,
was because the Williamson Report of 1921, Training for Library Work, had not been published

30

until 1971 when it was reproduced from a typewritten copy Charles Williamson had shared with
librarian Sarah K. Vann, and it was only 1961 when Powell had given his interview in which he
traces the origins back to 1930, meaning that Powell had probably not yet had the opportunity to
read a copy of the unpublished 1921 Training for Library Work. 34
When the Southern Branch of the University of California had opened in 1919 there were
only 250 students enrolled in courses through the College of Letters and Science. 35 By 1920,
there were 910 students, and by 1921 there were 1479. 36 Added to the teachers’ college, the total
in 1921 was 3050. 37 In February 1922, at a meeting of the Regents, a four-year curriculum in the
teacher’s college at the Southern Branch of the University of California on Vermont Avenue
gained the support of Regents Cochran, Sartori, and Haynes, and when the establishment of a
third year curriculum in the College of Letters and Science at the Southern Branch of the
University of California was put to a vote, it passed by only one vote on February 13, 1923. 38
The Southern Branch’s first commencement took place in June 1923 at which time twenty-six
students received their Bachelor’s in Education. On December 10, 1923, the Regents finally
approved a fourth senior year for the College of Letters and Science and the University of
California Southern Branch was now a full-fledged four-year university.
As the University continued to grow a new site was scouted by Regent Dickson and Irwin
J. Muma, who was a prominent Los Angeles business director and president and organizer of the
Los Angeles Rotary Club. Dickson and Muma’s scouting expeditions led to their taking a stroll

through a piece of property with rolling hills near Bel Air. Dickson, who had survived a severely
life-threatening pneumonia in 1921, describes having stood in the middle of this empty field in
Westwood in 1923 surrounded by the Bel Air hills and being stuck by how the landscape was
quite reminiscent of the land on which UC Berkeley had been built. 39 Dickson himself was a
graduate of Berkeley, completing his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1910. He almost completed a
Master’s degree in economics there too, had his thesis not sank in the ocean. Dickson had been
working to complete his thesis while teaching English in Japan, but had left Japan early because
he did not like living there. 40 41As he was leaving he noticed a sampan sinking off the side of his
boat, the very sampan which contained his all luggage, including his thesis manuscript. As it
sank, he said to himself, “There it goes, I’m going to be a newspaper man,” and went on to work
at the Sacramento Union, the San Francisco Chronicle, and eventually became the editor,
publisher, and owner of the Los Angeles Evening Express. 42 43
The field in which Dickson stood was part of an area known as Wolfskill Rancho, named
after famous pioneer John Wolfskill, who along with his brother William, had established the
development of California’s agricultural industries. Wolfskill Ranch had come to be owned by
Arthur Letts, a prominent Los Angeles merchant, with whom Dickson met, and who showed
immediate interest in Dickson’s university plans. 44 Letts unfortunately passed shortly after their
meeting and the charge of the estate was given to developers Harold and Edwin Janss, who were

also supportive of Dickson’s vision and who offered him 200 acres for the development of the
university. Despite there being sixteen other sites available for the university's new home, when
the Janss brothers increased their offer to 383 acres, the Board of Regents accepted the deeds of
the property on February 16, 1926. 45
By 1926, the Vermont Avenue campus library was getting ready for the big move to the
Westwood campus (also known as the Beverly campus). John E. Goodwin would oversee this
relocation. Goodwin had, in 1923, had replaced the first librarian at Southern Branch’s
University library, Elizabeth Fargo. Elizabeth Fargo became librarian in 1903 when she replaced
Harriett E. Dunn, the State Normal School at Los Angeles's first librarian who had previously
been a grammar and history instructor at the school since 1884. When the Southern Branch had
moved to Vermont Avenue under Elizabeth Fargo, the library had approximately 25,000 books,
and by the time of the move to Westwood under John Goodwin, the library had over 75,000
volumes. 46 47 Also in 1926, Berkeley's departmental program for librarianship became a separate
graduate School of Librarianship and its Dean, Sydney Mitchell, and the new Southern Branch
librarian John Goodwin, who had been roommates together while at Stanford together, worked
out a mutually-beneficial arrangement in which Goodwin would recruit librarians for Berkeley's
library School and Mitchell would recruit Berkeley BLS grads for the Southern Branch library
staff. 48 The Regents would official change the name of the Southern Branch to University of
California at Los Angeles in 1927, and the University of California at Los Angeles would be
formally dedicated on March 28, 1930.

Chapter 2: The 1930s, Great Depression, Powell and Horn first come to UCLA

By the time of the Great Depression, the resources of the Los Angeles Public Library had
become strained. Although the LAPL experienced a 60-percent increase in demand for books,
from 1929 to 1933, it also experienced a 24-percent drop in per-capita tax receipts and the
library’s resources. 49 This spike in usership could be attributed to the rapid population growth in
California; from 1920 to 1930, the population of California had grown 65.7 percent. 50 Los
Angeles City Librarian Everett R. Perry attributed the LAPL’s growth in patronage to the
increased need to ascertain facts and discover inspiration and ways in which to spend leisure
time profitably. 51 The financial situation was so dire that Perry proposed to President Sproul and
Regent Dickson the establishment of a library school on the Los Angeles campus of the
University of California, mentioning that his library board concurred in the position taken by the
American Library Association which, in line with the sentiments of Charles Williamson in the
Williamson report, favored the professional training of librarians in universities rather than in
libraries. Although Edward Dickson was largely in favor of the idea for library education at the
Southern Branch, President Sproul, who was himself a USC graduate, was opposed. 52
Regent Edward Dickson--who in 1931 had left newspaper work to become President of
the Western Federal Savings and Loan--put pressure on Goodwin to try to convince president
Sproul of the benefits of library education at UCLA, but Goodwin would have none of it because
having a school of library education at UCLA would mean that he would no longer be able to

benefit from his mutually-beneficial arrangement with Mitchell. Library education in Northern
California had already been made more competitive since San Jose State College, which had
originally been founded as the first Normal School in San Francisco in 1857, had begun offering
courses in librarianship in 1928, which by 1930, had evolved into a full training program. 53
Although the Los Angeles Library School had successfully trained more than 400
librarians, much to Perry’s dismay, it was discontinued in 1932. Perry pleaded for either the
University of California at Los Angeles or the University of Southern California to relieve the
duties of running the library school from the LALP, but to no avail. When Dean Sydney Mitchell
had received an urgent call from the 1932 California Library Association convention in Santa
Barbara to inform him that there was a growing movement to recommend the establishment of a
new library school, and that there was much talk of UCLA being the idea location, Mitchell
immediately hurried to Santa Barbara and “succeeded in checking that threat.” 54 In 1933, even
though no longer providing the library school, the LAPL still had to further reduced its hours
despite a growing demand for service. 55 Sadly Everett Perry died of a heart ailment on October
30, 1933.
The 1930s marked a time of significant expansion of the UCLA library including large
donations from Danish historian Kristian Erslev as well as professors Axel Koch, Friedrich
Kluge, Verner Dahlerup, Otto Bremer, and Konrad Burdach which added over 20,000 volumes
in the subject areas of Northern European studies, especial Germanic and Scandinavian
philology. 56 In 1926, William Andrews Clark Jr. had announced his gift of the Clark Library to

UCLA as a memorial of his father, and in 1934 the title passed to the Regents, at which time it
was revealed that Clark has left a further bequest of an adequate endowment. 57 In 1936, the
Regents purchased the Robert Ernest Cowan collection, who was the bibliographer to William
Andrew Clark collection of 8,000 rare volumes including books, pamphlets and maps, and
materials relating to early history of California. 58 In 1938, when UCLA and Berkeley jointly
purchased the Burdach and Bremer collection, it marked an early cooperative buying venture
between the two schools which was handled “with much wisdom and goodwill.” 59 In the 1930s,
Berkeley’s library education program also continued to thrive. In 1933, under new accreditation
standards, the American Library Association named Berkeley one of only five “Type I”
designated schools due to its graduate degree offerings, and in 1937 the school received an
endowment grant of $150,000 from the Carnegie Corporation. 60 The glimmers of library
education at UCLA were also apparent in the 1930s. In 1935, with the support of its rapidly
growing library and in cooperation with Berkeley, UCLA began offering a summer source in
librarianship as part of the “first wave of post-Depression expansion” of library schools in the
United States. 61

After the closure of the LAPL school, summer sessions held at the University of Southern
California from 1933-1936 met the need for library training in the region. USC had been founded
in 1880 as the first private research university in California. After four years of pressure from the
Alumni Association of the Public Library for a graduate library school at the University of
Southern California, the resources of the defunct Los Angeles Public Library school were
transferred there and the School of Library Service at USC was inaugurated in September
1936. 63 The School of Library Service at USC first opened under temporary director Andrea D.
Osborne in 1936. In 1937, the name was changed to School of Library Science and was operated
from 1937 to 1946 under the directorship of Mary Duncan Carter. Carter held a baccalaureate in
library science from the New York Library School at Albany and a doctorate from the University
of Chicago. She had been a teacher of library science at McGill University and the University of
Southern California, prior to becoming Director of the Library School at USC. 64 USC’s library
school was accredited by the Board of Education for Librarianship of the American Library
Association in 1938 for its two year program in which a Bachelor of Science in Library Science
was granted at the end of the first year, and a Master of Science in Library Science degree award
at the end of the second. 65
During the late 1930s, a couple of other important individuals appeared in the library
landscape of Southern California. Around the time of 1937-38, Lawrence Clark Powell, a young
man who was a family friend of Edward Dickson, had graduated from the BLS program at

Berkeley and took a job as a bibliographical checker at the UCLA library. 66 Edward Dickson had
been friends with Lawrence’s father George Powell. 67 George Harold Powell worked for the
U.S. Department of Agriculture as a pomologist in the Bureau of Plant Industry, studying fruit
storage and transportation, and had first travelled to California in 1904 to study the problem of
citrus fruits rotting in transit. 68 Lawrence Powell was born while his father was working in
Washington DC in 1906. Dickson would later tell Powell that when he and his wife Wilhelmina
visited the capital, such as when Dickson took a position as assistant to senator John Works in
1910, George Powell would provide the Edward Dickson and his wife Wilhelmina with chilled
California Orange juice every morning. 69 Powell's family returned to South Pasadena, California
when he was five years old, and Powell would go on to graduate from South Pasadena High
School and to receive a B.A. from Occidental College in 1928 and completing his doctorate from
the University of Burgundy in Dijon in 1932. 70
Lawrence Clark Powell’s liked modern art, jazz, sports cars, and Mozart. 71 In some ways
Powell was very opposite Edward Dickson, who much preferred quiet to any type of music and
strongly disliked certain types of Modern art. 72 One of the most differing aspects in particular of
Dickson and Powell’s personalities was in their politics. Dickson was an active progressive and

newspaperman to help elect Hiram Johnson in 1911, and who, in 1932, served on the Republican
State Central Committee and California Delegation. Contrastingly, in 1934, Lawrence Clark
Powell--who would have been about twenty-seven or twenty-eight--had registered as a
Communist.73 Powell describes having done so in protest of the social inequities which had
become apparent to him during the Great Depression. The CPUSA was a growing movement in
the 1930s. In 1930, it had 7,545 members; in 1934 that number grew to 23,760, and by 1938,
membership was approximately 75,000. 74
Despite their differences, Dickson and Powell shared significant similarities, most
notably a love of books and learning. Prior to working at UCLA, Powell had worked as a
shipping clerk at local rare bookstores until Los Angeles City Librarian Althea Hester Warren, in
Powell's words, “plucked me out of Jake Zeitlin's bookshop and sent me off to Berkeley,
completing a Certificate of Librarianship from UC Berkeley in 1937.” 75 Powell later returned to
Los Angeles to work for Warren at the Central Library in downtown Los Angeles, after which he
returned to the UCLA library to work in acquisitions. By the early 1940s, Goodwin had changed
the library classification from Dewey Decimal to Library of Congress, he had also opposed and
eventually defeated a proposal to make the library at Los Angeles an adjunct collection of a main
research library at UC Berkeley, and had taken the library from 39,000 to close to 400,000
volumes. In order to reward Powell for his good work, Goodwin allowed him to select the UCLA

Also in 1937, another important figure in the history of library education at UCLA, a
young man named Andrew Harlis Horn, graduated from UCLA with his BA in History. Andrew
Horn had been born in Ogden, Utah in 1914. Horn’s father was a Union Pacific railroad engineer
and his mother was a self-taught stenographer, known for having recorded the Scopes trial. The
Horns moved to California when Andrew was a teenager. He graduated from Venice High
School in 1932, completed an AA degree at Santa Monica Junior College in 1935, a BA degree
in history at UCLA in 1937, and a Master’s degree in History and Economics in February of
1940, also at UCLA. Although he had initially studied Latin American history, Professor David
K. Bjork encouraged Horn to study European history. He graduated again from UCLA with his
Ph.D. in Medieval History and Economics in 1943. While a student at UCLA, Horn worked as a
research assistant, teaching assistant and lecturer. From 1942 to 1943, Andrew Horn also worked
for Douglas Aircraft Company writing technical manuals. Horn joined the U.S. Army in
November 1943, and was soon assigned to the Educational Reconditioning Branch of the
Medical Department, where he planned programs, taught courses and provided counseling to
soldiers. UCLA, however, had not seen the last of Andrew Horn. 78

Chapter 3: The 1940s: Powell Succeeds Goodwin and Dickson Keeps Pushing for his “School of
the Library”

In 1943, the Riverside Library Service School had closed, making the only three
programs for library education in California the University of California’s School of
Librarianship at Berkeley, the School of Library Science at the University of Southern
California, and the Department of Librarianship at San Jose State College. Williamson’s
recommendation that library education should occur within the university setting had come to
actualization in California. Although Berkeley’s summer program on the Los Angeles campus
was suspended temporarily in 1942 following the entry of the United States into World War II, it
was resumed after the war. In 1944, UCLA’s only professional school was Education, yet
Edward Dickson would routinely try to persuade Goodwin to consider a “School of the Library,”
as he liked to call it. 79 Powell observed this and asked himself why, within a university that had
only one professional school and a library that barely held 400,000 volumes, did a school of
library education mean so much to Dickson? 80
Dickson, like Powell, was very much a man of books. He would often bring Powell
unusual and rare books to be put on the library shelves. 81 Dickson had a personal library in his
home and Ann Sumner, a close family friend of the Dicksons who had been a junior writer for
the Los Angeles Evening Express, recalls being entranced by his reading habits, how he would
sit in his library in the evening with his wife, on a blue sofa, plowing through the encyclopedia to

answer questions he had stored up during the day. 82 Dickson had also become a member of the
Los Angeles Board of Library Commissioners in 1948. He sat on the board for many years next
to Dr. Rufus von KleinSmid, president of USC, during which time he saw many USC graduates
filling Southern California library positions. Powell speculated that this bothered Dickson, who
would have liked to see UCLA graduates “get some of the gravy.” 83 Dickson, however, was not
the kind of man to be motivated by rivalry or self-promotion. According to Harold Hamill, who
had become LAPL Librarian in 1947, “From the day of his appointment, the Library staff was
aware of Mr. Dickson's keen intellect and sincere interest. He did not take his responsibilities
lightly, and followed each item brought before the Board with close attention. There was only
one way to persuade Mr. Dickson of the value of any proposition under consideration, and that
was solely on its own merits. He could not be appealed to except in terms of public interest.” 84
In 1944 Powell also became Director of the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library as
well as University Librarian at UCLA upon Goodwin’s retirement, at which time Ernest Moore
said to him, “Mr. Goodwin was the first Librarian of UCLA. He was the shaper of the Library.
You are in his footsteps. The undertaking, as you know, is both vast and responsible. The part
which the Library must do will never be completely done. It gratifies us to see it growing into
great power.” 85 Thus the Mitchell-Goodwin arrangement came to an end. Upon Powell’s new
appointment as University Librarian at UCLA, one of his first callers was Edward Dickson, who
would regularly visit, often bringing with him rare and valuable books for Powell to put on the
open stacks, and Dickson would ask Powell just when he was going to open that “School of the

Library.” 86 In February 1946, Governor Warren had signed Assembly Bill 35 along with a $7
million provision for a medical school at UCLA, and Dickson was determined that UCLA should
have all the professional schools. 87 Powell, however, did not think UCLA was ready for a library
school, and would not be fully convinced of UCLA’s ability to support such a school until 1951.
In the meantime, Powell would have to “divert” Dickson by reassuring him that UCLA was
indeed destined to have all the professional schools. 88 Powell first wanted to reorganize, extend
and develop the UCLA library and branch system. Dickson agreed to wait, but according to
Powell, every year thereafter he would continue to come by Powell’s office to keep asking just
when he was going to open the school. If Powell claimed he needed to get the budget, Dickson
would say that was “nonsense” and that all Powell needed was to found the school and that
Dickson would help find the money. Powell quotes Dickson as saying to him, “You can have
classes out here on the lawn. I’ll bring the benches. It doesn’t matter, facilities or not. The idea
comes first.” 89
In 1947, Powell created a department of Special Collections at UCLA to house rare and
valuable material. Also in 1947, after working at John Hopkins University for a year teaching
classes on the History of Western Civilization, Andrew Horn returned to work at UCLA as a senior

Library Assistant. Horn left briefly to complete his BLS from Berkeley in 1948 and returned
again to UCLA that year to become the Assistant Head of the UCLA Library’s Department of

The 1948 report A Report of a Survey of Needs of California in Higher Education by the
Legislative Interim Committee on the Survey of Higher Education found that “The graduate
library schools of the University of California and the University of Southern California have the
facilities to supply the entire needs of the State for library personnel trained at this level; the
problem in California is not one of a shortage of training facilities but rather one of providing
salary scales for library service that will attract sufficient personnel to use the training facilities
fully. Under present conditions libraries employ teacher-librarians trained at San Jose who are
not prepared at the graduate level or for public library service. It is expected that the University
of California and the library profession of the State will take leadership in endeavoring to raise
levels of compensation in order that training may be brought to the standard that prevails where
the finest type of public library service is provided.” 90 In response to the report, a prelibrarianship curriculum was developed at UCLA, not to offer undergraduate courses in
librarianship, but to counsel students on preparation for admission to graduate library schools
elsewhere. 91

Chapter 4: The Loyalty Oath Controversy Comes Between Powell and Dickson, but then Brings
Them Closer Together

Beginning around 1946, the Southern Regents began to favor the decentralization and
reorganization of the university system to allow for more autonomy at UCLA. There were often
long delays and cumbersome procedures and even occasions when UCLA had to lobby in
Sacramento against the university. The Southern Regents even had secret study made by a
consulting group in Chicago favoring decentralization, but, as the plan would diminish power
from the north, Sproul was opposed to it. 92 The Southern Regents gained an ally when John
Francis Neylan, a regent from the north, joined in opposition of Sproul. The division between
Sproul and the Southern Regents continued to escalate even after Edward Dickson succeed
James Moffitt to become Chairman of the Board of Regents in 1948. 93 94 95
On March 25, 1949, after California State Senator Tenney had introduced a series of bills
to address the growing concerns regarding suspected communists in government, Sproul
proposed that UC employees, including faculty, be required to swear to a new Oath stating that
they are not members of the Communist party. Despite the prior rivalry between Sproul and the
Regents in regards to decentralization of the University and recommendation for revisions from
the Northern Section of the Academic Senate, the UC Regents supported Sproul’s proposal, and
the Oath was revised and approved. Despite widespread faculty opposition to the Oath, President

Sproul issued an October 1st, 1949 deadline by which each member of the UC faculty must
return a signed copy of the Oath. That November, “non-signers” of the Oath formally organized
in protest at Berkeley, yet this did not derail the Regents one bit. 96 In December the Regents
fired a UC Berkeley Physics Teaching Assistant, Irving David Fox after Fox was called before
the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) on suspicion of security breaches at the
Radiation Laboratory during which time Fox admitted having attended communist meetings in
the past. The House Un-American Activities Committee had been established in 1938 as a
committee of the U.S. House of Representatives to investigate allegations of communist activity
in the United States, during the early years of the Cold War. Regent Edward Dickson was largely
in favor of HUAC. According to Dickson’s nephew Edward Hawkins Dickson, “He was a great
supporter of Joe McCarthy, and he was all for these Un-American Activities investigations.” 97
On February 24, 1950, the Regents voted 12-6 that faculty that had not signed the Oath
by April 30th must be terminated by June 30th. One hundred and fifty UC faculty members met
at Berkeley to again protest, and publicly refuse the sign the Oath. 98 Upon realizing just how big
of a controversy the issue had become and its possible legal implications, President Sproul began
to reconsider whether or not the Oath was a good idea in the first place. Sproul’s rival John
Francis Neylan had initially opposed the Oath when Sproul first proposed it, but when Neylan
became aware that Sproul was withdrawing his support, he took the opportunity to try to
undermine Sproul’s leadership abilities by leading the Regents to favor of the Oath, which put
Sproul in the difficult position of having to come out against the very thing which himself had
proposed. Since Sproul was largely “immobilized” by his difficult position, California Governor

Earl Warren, in an unconventional role for a State governor, led Regental opposition to the Oath
and was especially opposed to the firing of non-signers. 99
On March 6th, 1950, eight thousand students met to discuss the Oath and the very next
day, seven-hundred and fifty faculty members protested at Northern Section of the Academic
Senate. On March 31, 1950, the Regents met to discuss the Oath, but ended up spending the
meeting debating who controls the university. 100 The Regents in favor of the Oath, led by
Neylan, felt that if they did not uphold their stance that it would compromise their governing
authority. The Regents voted ten-to-ten on a motion to withdraw the ultimatum to sign the Oath,
but since it was tie, the ultimatum remained. 101 In June of 1950, President Sproul requested that
157 employees be terminated for not signing the Oath, or for issues regarding the signing of the
Oath, however he also recommended 62 of the 75 non-signers be retained. In July of 1950, the
Regents voted ten-to-nine to support President Sproul’s recommendations and retain the majority
of the non-signing faculty, which now numbered only 39. 102 This decision was quickly reversed,
however, on August 25, 1950, when the Regents met again to vote 12-10 to reverse their July
decision and fire the non-signers. Although some non-signers ended up signing after the vote, a
total of 31 faculty were actually fired, including UCLA history Professor John Caughey who
actually called Regent Dickson at his home to engage with him in “heated telephone
conversations” which turned into “bitter four hour shouting match[es],” which even Dickson’s
wife Wilhelmina said were “pretty hectic.” 103

On August 31, 1950, the non-signers sued for reinstatement in the case of Tolman v.
Underhill. Professor Edward Chace Tolman had been a vocal leader of the resistance of the oath
and after the Regents sought his dismissal, he sued the Regents; Robert M. Underhill was the
Regents’ secretary and treasurer. 104 In September of 1950, since California Governor Earl
Warren was up for reelection, he realized he needed to promote an image of himself being tough
on Communism, so despite his initial opposition, Warren asked the Legislature to approve a
special loyalty oath for all State employees. The Legislature passed the “Levering Oath” which
required all state employees to sign a loyalty oath disavowing any radical beliefs. Regent Neylan,
who had led the Regents in favor of Sproul’s Oath, was actually strongly against the Levering
Oath because he felt the Legislature should not be interfering in the autonomous governing
authority of the Regents. On April 6, 1951, the Court of Appeal ruled in Tolman v. Underhill
against the Regents, stating that they had violated a Constitutional prohibition on political
influence on the University. 105 The case was then appealed in the California Supreme Court in
October of 1951 and the Regents voted 12-8 to rescind the Oath requirement, but still upheld the
UC policy against employing Communists. 106 An effort by Regent Neylan to reverse the decision
failed 12-5 in November of 1951. Although Sproul’s Oath was rescinded, UC employees still
had to sign the Levering Oath, which would now be required of all State employees, until it too
was deemed unconstitutional in 1967. 107
On November 27, 1951, the State Senate Interim Committee on Education, called
Lawrence Clark Powell to testify in a two-day hearing investigating un-American activity in

education. Powell was being investigated in regards to exhibits in the Library reference room,
especially one in particular called “Threats to the Schools,” which contained books and
pamphlets that discussed the problems facing public education. 108 Senator Nelson Dilworth
accused the exhibit of discouraging prospective teachers, whereas Powell believed it would
stimulate discussion and allow student teachers to more fairly consider professional issues. 109
During the hearing, the committee brought up the fact that back in 1934 Powell had registered as
a Communist. Although Powell freely admitted his registration, explaining his actions in that it
was a social protest and he was young, the media took the opportunity to sensationalize the
admission. 110 Also during in the hearing, Serrill Gerber, the president of the Los Angeles
Federation of Teachers, questioned the Oath, believing that it should not be enforced since it
would essentially be ineffective, since signers could lie and that it would cause greater damage
by discouraging potential teachers from entering the field. 111 This debate was one also had by
Regent Dickson and his nephew Edward Hawkins Dickson. Edward Hawkins Dickson argued
that “a Communist doesn't give a damn whether he takes an oath or not, Communists will lie all
the time,” to which his namesake uncle would respond, “Well it’s alright, because then you could
catch them for perjury.” 112
Dickson had called Powell at home to let him know that he was going to take out a full
page advertisement in the Los Angeles Times in support of the Regents and to let him know that
he would like to include Powell’s name as supporting the Regents. 113 Powell felt a tremendous

amount of political pressure because he felt as though it had been implied to him by Dickson that
Powell’s responsibility as an administrator of the library included Powell not taking any position
which would jeopardize the library’s budget recommendations. 114 Powell was very much
opposed to the Oath. Powell shared his private feelings with Dickson that “We don't need a
special oath; we already have an oath to support the Constitution as state employees; we don't
need a special oath for the university. And I don't want to take a position in this as an
administrator; I want my staff to feel that I'm not coercing them one way or the other." 115 Powell
determined that he was going to sign the special Oath and include a letter to the Regents as an
attachment stating that he was signing under protest because he wanted to go on record, saying “I
was going to, in other words, walk the fence. But I told the staff, as I recall, that ‘you're free to
do whatever you have to do in your own intellectual honesty, and I don't expect any of you to
take one position or another; you're absolutely free,’ but I said, ‘Those of you who don't wish to
sign the oath and won't sign it at all, I'll protect your position as long as I can. I'll attempt to keep
you on the payroll by one means or another up to the last ditch; so go ahead and do what you
have to do.’” 116
Shortly after Powell’s Communist registration had been publicized and sensationalized,
Regent Dickson visited Powell at UCLA, to meet with him in person. Dickson’s nephew Edward
remembers being with his uncle at UCLA while the two men met in private at the library,
“[Powell] was a great friend of Uncle Ed’s and uncle went in and had a long talk, and the fellow
told him the whole story. [...] He said that the fellow told him that he wasn’t really a Communist
but you know the Depression days and everything. [...] I think it was true of a lot of people [...] I

damn near was a Communist myself. [...] Things were desperate.” 117 Nephew Edward recalls this
meeting as having a significant impact on his uncle, “He cried, and he came out a rather changed
man after that.” 118 After fully realizing the devastating effects that the Oath hysteria had on
Powell, Dickson was determined to make things right. As UCLA School of Medicine founder
Elmer Belt recalled, “The greatest thing Dickson did for Larry Powell was the day the
newspapers came out and said Larry Powell was a Communist.” 119 Dickson, who was also still
the President of Western Federal Savings and Loan, invited Powell to lunch with him at the
California Club where he was meeting with a group of bankers. Dickson introduced Powell as
“our very valuable librarian at UCLA.” 120 Then Dickson relayed to his colleagues how dismayed
he was with the papers for their portrayal of Powell by saying things like “the goddamned
newspapers,” and “to think I once owned that paper!” 121 Dickson then took Powell with him to a
meeting of the Board of Regents and where he told them “In the newspapers this week it was
announced that Larry Powell is a Communist. Now he’s not a Communist and he’s my friend,
and I want that to be the end of it.” 122
According to Elmer Belt in regards to Dickson’s actions against the onslaught of antiPowell sentiment, “this man stopped it just blank, just stopped it.” 123 Throughout this situation,
the true extent of Edward Dickson’s loyalty and support for Lawrence Powell had been made
known to many, most of all, Powell himself, and it was just about this time, in 1951, that Powell

would also become fully convinced of UCLA’s ability to support a library school. In 1952, the
State Supreme Court ruled in favor of the non-signers in Tolman v. Underhill and ordered the
University to reinstate them at which time the Regents decided not to petition for a rehearing. 124
Through this situation the greatest differences in personality and opinion which existed between
Dickson and Powell became the very thing which brought them closer together, cementing their
friendship. As Powell would put it, “Dickson and I, you see, were more political, compromising
types and though I didn't support him, he didn't use this against me. He was able to go and
resume our friendship and we became closer and closer as the years passed.” 125

Chapter 5: The Ball is Rolling for Library Education at UCLA
At the end of 1951, two days after Christmas, President Sproul, made a request to Robert
D. Leigh, who had directed the Public Library Inquiry, a comprehensive survey of the American
public library on behalf of the Social Science Research Council, to conduct a special survey to
determine if there is need for an additional school of librarianship and if there is such a need, and
whether or not the need could be met by UCLA. 126 In his request to Leigh to supply the report,
Sproul had recognized only UC Berkeley and the University of California as the two schools of
librarianship in California because the program for professional instruction in librarianship at
San Jose was only an undergraduate department rather than a library school. San Jose’s program
was, however, included in Leigh’s report since it was designated by the State Department of
Education as its only library teacher-training institution in California’s state colleges giving
professional education for the library positions in the public schools.
Leigh conducted his report by sending multiple questionnaires to the chief librarians and
libraries of all types and sizes throughout California, the list of which was provided by the
California State Library as well as the Elementary School Division of the State Department of
Education. The questionnaires were sent to 1328 libraries, and 986 replied. 127 Leigh also had
separate questionnaires for all those who held professional positions in the libraries which were
filled-out and returned by way of the chief librarian, as well as a non-professional librarian
questionnaire, which was distributed by ten of the largest libraries in the state. A questionnaire
was also sent to California library school students at USC, Berkeley, and San Jose State as well
as students in out-of-state library schools whose homes were in California. Students’ contact

information had been made available to Leigh through correspondence with the, as of 1952,
thirty-three ALA-accredited library schools. There were seventeen such students, sixteen of
which responded to the survey. All but the chief librarians’ questionnaires were anonymous.
Leigh also consulted each California library school’s records as well as personally performed an
examination of the facilities and resources at UCLA. Over the course of six weeks from January
to February, and then from May to June of 1952, Leigh met and interviewed over 150 librarians
and library staff including Lawrence Powell. Powell felt that the population explosion in
California would entail a need for at least three schools, possibly as many as six, but Powell
could not convince Leigh of this outlook. 128
Leigh, however, did report on the favorable opinion of his respondents toward library
education at a public institution in Southern California. In presenting excerpts of the anonymous
questionnaires Leigh includes one which reads, “I have met four girls who would be fine
prospects for librarianship. Each had some non-professional library experience, was industrious
and intelligent. Not one, in spite of her enthusiasm for library work, could afford the tuition fees
of the only university library school in this area. In short, state support of a library school in
Southern California would be the greatest boon to the public library since Carnegie.” 129
According to Leigh, only about a third of respondents favored enlarging the existing
schools rather than creating a new library school. 130 Among junior college, high school, and
special librarians 75% of respondents favored the school. 131 A majority of chief librarians
favored the new school and only two-thirds of the amount that favored the new school opposed

it. 132 Municipal librarians favored a new library school by a slight majority and county librarians
were divided equally. 133 Only University librarians had a majority which favored expansion of
existing facilities. 134
Leigh reports that “a goodly number of comments dealt specifically with the instruction
staff” and that “as for Berkeley and USC, some of the comments regarding faculty and
leadership were directed at both, some at one or the other of the two schools specifically, with
Berkeley receiving the major load of criticism.” 135 This criticism included statements which
Leigh received as responses to his questionnaires. One was disparaging of the program USC
saying that “USC has become very weak with too much turnover on the faculty and weak
direction.” 136 Another was critical of Berkeley in writing that “the UC Library School is coasting
on the momentum given it by Mr. Mitchell; it still has a reputation for excellence which cannot
continue long under the present Administration.” 137 A commenter had also noted that “now the
pendulum seems to have swung to the other extreme at least at Berkeley, where theory so far
dominates that it has left practical problems and professional ethics behind.” 138 A different
respondent also criticized both schools in saying “neither library school has adequate faculty,
courses, or facilities nor are the heads of either school in sympathetic touch with the practicing
librarians in the State.” 139 Interestingly, Leigh notes that “there was no negative criticism of the

work being done at San Jose.” 140 As of 2017, San Jose’s is the only program of these three
schools which has remained in continuous operation since the Leigh report. Despite much of the
feedback he received in favor of library education at UCLA, Leigh's report recommended against
the establishment of the library school at UCLA because he believed that California could not
support three major library schools. 141 Leigh did, however, note that “needs might best be served
by the transfer of the USC school to UCLA.” 142 USC, however, was not going to do that.
On January 13, 1953, City Librarian Harold Hamill wrote to Regent Dickson regarding
“the immediate need for a library school at the University of California in Los Angeles.” 143
Harold had been appointed by the Public Library Executives Association of Southern California,
made up of the executives of about seventy public libraries, to help work toward the establish of
such a school. Hamill wrote to Dickson of the nation-wide shortage of trained librarians which
was particularly drastic in Southern California. Despite the LAPL’s plan to increase salaries--for
example, twenty years prior the salary had been $1400 a year and it was now $3,456 a year,
which increased to $4260 after four full years--the trained librarian shortages, according to
Hamill, were as acute as they had been in the war years. 144 Hamill wrote that the library school at
USC graduated about fifty trained librarians annually, but that once these librarians are divided
amongst the many different types and kinds of libraries in Southern California, there was still a
significant shortage. Hamill told Dickson that he believed USC’s library school was doing a
good job under limited circumstances, but that there are “very definite limitations imposed by the

conditions under which it operates.” 145 Hamill gives an example of such limitation in that USC’s
program did not offer night classes that would give credit toward the library science degree.
Hammill suggested to Dickson that “in a very real sense we not only need more trained
librarians, but we need to attract to the profession an increasing number of superior people with a
capacity to be more than able technicians,” adding that “librarians in Southern California have a
united hope that a library school of the strongest possible type, with full facilities and faculty,
will be available soon to correct the present situations.” 146
Also in 1953, Governor Goodwin Knight, who had succeed Governor Warren after
Warren resigned to become Chief Justice of the United States, was attempting to gather support
for Powell’s dismissal, owing to the whole communist ordeal, and Powell quotes Dickson as
having said to Knight something to the effect of “I'll have you know, sir, Dr. Powell is known to
me personally and professionally, and I vouch for his antecedents and character and loyalty.
Does the governor wish to say anything more on this?” 147 After this confrontation, Dickson was
informed by Sproul that the governor dropped the issue. 148 In 1954, Powell, who was now
determined to give Dickson his School of the Library, went to Columbia University to work as a
visiting professor so that he could observe their classes and operations. 149 After he returned, he
learned that the USC school was rather “shaken up” by the possibility of a school at UCLA. 150
Powell would later tell how in 1955, at a conference at Occidental on library education, Powell
had been promoting his plans for library school at UCLA and suggested that the enrollment

would not jeopardize USC, but rather, would stimulate enrollment, and that in response to this
statement he heard “hollow laughter” coming from a section of USC faculty in the audience. 151
Martha Boaz was the USC library school’s seventh Dean by the time she took over the
position in 1955. Boaz knew that Powell had been working to gain library school support
throughout the mid-1950s contrary to the recommendations of the Leigh Report and she was not
too amicable to the idea of a library school at UCLA, stating that “I was opposed to the
establishment of the school for several reasons and expressed my opinions. My major reason was
that I felt that the Los Angeles area could not support two such schools, although the demand for
librarians was high in the late 50s and early 60s. I also thought that many students would go to
UCLA because of the low cost at a state university with practically no tuition compared to our
relatively high tuition at USC, a private university.” 152 She felt that the potential competition
threatened her program and she noted that “the competition between library schools is even more
noticeable than that between schools within one institution.” 153 She believed that California had
enough library school programs that were already accredited to fulfill the library education needs
of the state. She liked the idea of a model wherein Berkeley could educate the librarians in
Northern California and USC could educate those in Southern California. According to Boaz,
“We had a good faculty, a good curriculum, and we were doing a ‘thriving business.’” 154 Boaz
also believes that her stance against the UCLA school was not entirely biased and laments that
“Despite the negative surveys and the abundance of schools, Larry Powell, tough and
determined, persisted in his goal and got his school. I was concerned and worried about the

situation and talked to a number of people about it. Although I was probably prejudiced because
of my association with USC I think I would have opposed the UCLA school, even had I been in
a detached position. From a practical point of view and from a budget point of view, it seemed
that starting a new school would be a drain on the state’s money supply and it would establish a
rivalry situation that would not be healthy.” 155
In 1955, a restudy of the 1948 report A Report of a Survey of Needs of California in
Higher Education, entitled A Restudy of the Needs of California in Higher Education devoted
about three pages out of over 450 to outline the concerns regarding education for librarianship.
Despite the small amount of space given to the topic, Library Education was listed along with the
other important disciplines of professional education such as Architecture, Dentistry,
Engineering, and Law. The Restudy Report referred to librarianship as a “slow-developing”
profession. 156 The report estimated that in 1952, there were 3,514 persons holding professional
positions in California libraries and also figured that only 2,585 beginning professional positions
would open between 1955 and 1965. 157 This report, like the Leigh Report, recommended against
a new library school in favor of bolstering the existing library schools, which the report
recognized to be those at San Jose State College, University of California at Berkeley, and the
University of Southern California, as well as a new library school at Immaculate Heart College.
The restudy also recommended, much to the dismay of Powell and Dickson, that the matter of a
library school at UCLA should not be reconsidered until 1960. 158

Immaculate Heart College, established by the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary,
was founded in Los Angeles in 1906. The college was located on the same campus as a high
school and middle school which the Sisters had established in 1905. According to instructor
Hazel Adele Pulling, the idea for the library school at Immaculate Heart had been requested by
their alumnae for many years. 159 The Immaculate Heart administration recognized the need for
more trained librarians in Southern California and in August 1951, the decision was made to
establish a program in library science. Undergraduate classes began in the spring of 1953 and the
State Department of Education soon approved the program. 160 In 1955, Sister Mary Regis, who
led the Immaculate Heart library education program, seeing the need for trained librarians and
recognizing that Immaculate Heart was ready to begin offering Master’s degrees in library
education, first met with Powell to make sure she would not be infringing on his plans for a
library school. 161 She asked him directly whether or not he was going to open a school at UCLA.
Powell told her that has soon as he had the budget and the authority that he would plan to do so.
Sister Regis asked him when that would be, and Powell did not have an answer. Sister Regis told
Powell that if he would open one soon, that would satisfy the need, and Immaculate Heart would
not need to do so, however, if UCLA was not going to open a library school, then Immaculate
Heart felt they should, given they had an established program, and Southern California libraries
were expressing an immediate need. Powell laments that “We couldn't get the UCLA School
open in time to satisfy the Catholic Sister Librarians, so they went ahead and set up a small
school themselves.” 162 While Powell believed Immaculate Heart was a good school, he did not

believe that Immaculate Heart had the resources to become an ALA-accredited school, even
though in 1956, the Western College Association did approve their Master’s program. 163 164
Immaculate Heart was a Catholic institution, but their library education program was
open to all, and all courses were designed to meet the needs of the individual regardless of
religious affiliation. The Sisters believed that “for as sure as librarianship has a common core of
techniques, materials, services, and administrative practices, so do the spiritual basis of our being
have a common ground on which we all meet,” and that library science is an auxiliary discipline
and therefore background knowledge and continual growth in subject knowledge and
appreciation of the arts is essential. 165 The graduate program was open to both men and women,
however, the undergraduate college was for women only. The college’s undergraduate program
was restricted to non-professional work and all professional training was covered at the graduate
level. Courses were offered in late afternoon and evening to accommodate in-service students
and work-study situations. The school offered three programs of study: a Public Library
Certificate program, the California State Librarianship Credential, and the Master’s in Library
Science. The school enjoyed a growth from an enrollment of six in the spring of 1953 to fortyeight in autumn of 1956. 166
Despite the findings of the Restudy Report, and despite the new Library Science Master’s
program at Immaculate Heart, Powell still felt increasing pressure from the field schools and
public libraries to open a library training school at UCLA. Neither Dickson nor Powell much
cared for findings of the Restudy Report, least of all that it had recommended delaying the matter

until 1960. To help remedy the situation, one of Powell’s library staff, Everett Moore, offered on
behalf of the rest of the staff to start an “underground” seminar to work on planning the library
school at UCLA. 167 Moore, an avid member of the American Library Association's Intellectual
Freedom Committee and an officer of the Freedom to Read Foundation, had attended Occidental
as a student with Powell. 168 After completing a Master’s in English at Harvard in 1933 and a
certificate in librarianship from UC Berkeley in 1939, Moore began working as a reference
librarian at Berkeley and the University of Illinois until the United States’ involvement in World
War II, at watch time he worked as an Education Officer in the South Pacific. Moore join the
UCLA Library staff in 1946 where he worked as the head of the Reference Department. 169
To avoid violating the mandate from the Regents that the issue of library school not be
addressed until 1960, Powell, Moore, and approximately twenty other individuals would convene
in secret after work from six-to-nine in the evening once-a-week on their personal time. 170
During these secret meetings, they would bring a “bag supper” over which they would blueprint
and plan the potential library school. Powell describes what became known as “The Library
Education Seminar,” as a “wonderful underground movement.” 171 Also as a way of avoiding the
Regent’s mandate, Powell drove all around Southern California to meet with librarians in coffee
shops on his personal time to gain their insight and counsel. He describes the enthusiastic support
of other librarians such as Edwin Castagna from Long Beach, Enoch Pratt from Baltimore, John
Henderson from the Los Angeles County Library, John Smith and Donald Davidson from Santa

Barbara, Edwin Coman from Riverside, and of course, LAPL Librarian Harold Hamill. 172 Even
Berkeley’s library school’s Dean Perry Danton was “always helpful.” 173 At this time, according
to Powell “no one ever worked actively against it. The terrible thing we had to work against was
inertia. You can fight hostility; but inertia--it’s like punching a sandbag; it just doesn't move and
you only hurt yourself.” 174
In 1955, the Library Education Seminar issued its “Credo for Librarians,” which had
been inspired by the Engineer’s Creed, a professional pledge adopted by the National Society of
Professional Engineers. The Engineer’s Creed had been issued in printed form in June, 1954. 175
The Engineer’s Creed pledged to give the utmost performance, to participate in none but honest
enterprise, to place service before profit, the honor of the profession above personal advantage,
and the public welfare above all other considerations. The Credo for Librarians includes many of
the engineer’s themes such as service, truth, and belief in high ideals. It reads as follows:
“The Credo for Librarians
Librarian is a calling which offers rich opportunities for dedicated service.
The collection and care and transmission of mankind’s recorded knowledge--his
deepest thoughts, his lightest fancies, is a privilege and responsibility of high order, a
responsibility implying devotion to the ideals of free inquiry and to the search for truth.
The library discipline is not an easy one, but one that demands intensive and
continuing study, and also an imaginative approach to the existing task of uniting books

and readers. Schools of librarianship should be places of inspiration as well as of
instruction, and the voices of their leaders should be strong and clear.
Librarians must rally gifted young men and women to the profession by appeals
to their idealism and their desire for service.
As librarians, we are committed to a life of professional service guided by these
beliefs.” 176
Another important piece of literature was also published in 1955, which was Edward
Dickson’s University of California at Los Angeles: Its Origin and Formative Years. The work is
beautiful book and story tracing the founding of UCLA from Dickson’s appointment to Board of
Regents in 1913 to the formal dedication of the University of California at Los Angeles in 1930.
Dickson describes the dedication: “Thus were realized the hopes of those of us who labored,
amidst hopes and disappointments, for so many years to bring to the Southland, for the youth of
today and of future generations, a great University.” 177 Lawrence Clark Powell provided the
forward for Dickson’s book in which Powell describes how, despite the fact that “the steps which
had to be taken before his vision materialized of a university in southern California [...] often
consisted of one backward and two forward, or two sideways and three forward, [...] there was
always a net gain in progress.” 178 Powell attributed this progress largely to Dickson’s
“extraordinary combination” of vision, persistence, persuasiveness, teamwork, and faith. 179

176
The credo was reprinted in the June 9 1956 issue of the Oakland Public Library’s Oak Leaves newsletter as
well as vol. 9 no. 7 of the Fly Leaf of Santa Barbara Public Library. Both are found in Box 19, Graduate School of
Library and Information Science. Administrative files (University Archives Record Series 408). UCLA Library

On May 6, 1955, Dickson received a letter from a young man at the University of North
Carolina in Chapel Hill, introducing himself as Andrew Horn. 180 In 1954, the Horns had moved
across the country so Andrew could work as head of the library and professor of librarianship at
the University of North Carolina. While in Chapel Hill, Horn also served on the North Carolina
State Library Board of Trustees, and during the summer of 1955, he was featured on the
television program Know Your Library, which was broadcast from University of North
Carolina 181 Horn had written to Edward Dickson at his home address to let him know that he had
received Dickson’s book through his membership in the Friends of the UCLA Library, and that
he had very much enjoyed reading it. Horn recalls to Dickson having remembered the story of
the founding of UCLA from when he was a teen in Los Angeles, and that he had even worked as
a newsboy selling the Los Angeles Express, though he admits to Dickson that he was more
interested in selling the paper than reading it. Horn wrote to thank Dickson for his great work
and notes that “there is one more chapter in UCLA’s history which I look forward to reading -the establishment of a Library School by Edward A. Dickson and Lawrence C. Powell. That is a
work which the two of you have begun and which I know you will not abandon.” 182
Edward Dickson was undeniably committed to a “School of the Library” at UCLA. It
meant the world to him. Sadly, the great Edward Augustus Dickson passed unexpectedly on
February 22, 1956, at the age of 76, after several weeks of severe illness. His devoted wife,
Wilhelmina, whom he had been married to since 1907, was devastated, as were many others who

Gustave O. Arlt, the Associate Dean of the UCLA Graduate School, delivered the eulogy noting
that “few of us had the remotest idea of the amazing scope of his interests.” 186 Artl spoke of
Dickson’s character, his integrity, and his honesty, kindness, gentleness and loyalty to the State,
Nation, and institutions which he loved.” 187 Arlt stated that “I regard him as probably the
greatest influence for good that has ever been for the University of California at Los Angeles.” 188
President Sproul described him as “not only a prime advocate and vigorous supporter of the
University he loved but also its tutelary genius.” 189
Dickson was a man for whom jazz was “terra incognita.” 190 He had a distaste for fiction,
except he always read Horace on trips. 191 His collections included 19th century McGuffey’s
Readers schoolbooks, Abraham Lincoln ephemera, and Neo-Babylonian cuneiform tablets. 192 193

collections, and shortly before his death, he had traveled to Seville, Spain where he found a
Columbus library of memorabilia and writing in the Biblioteca Colombiana containing volumes
from Columbus’s own personal library. Although Dickson was fascinated by the collection, he
was horrified by the fact that the library had no funds for the protection and storage of the
volumes and there were leaks in the roof. 195 So he took it upon himself to raise the funds and set
up a committee with the mission of protecting the library and doing research work. According to
Powell, “Although I disagreed with him later on politics, Modern art, and the need for a special
loyalty oath for university employees, he never penalized me nor the library because of our
differences. Although tough, he was never mean. He pursued a noble vision, and the realization
of it is evident in all the UCLA has become.” 196

Chapter 6: Regents Approve
Because the School Library Association and the Public Library Executives Association of
Southern California had presented such a tremendous need for trained personnel in their libraries,
in 1957, the need for an additional school of librarianship in Southern California was referred to
a liaison committee for immediate restudy. The Regents formed the Liaison Committee for
Continuing Study of Higher Education in California to study extent to which the need was being
met by the facilities available for librarian training in Southern California and appointed Thomas
Dabagh as the chair. Powell was glad to have Dabagh as the chair and described him as “shrewd,
tactful, and adept,” and credits Dabagh as a major contributor to the momentum which made the
library school happen. 197 Dabagh, former County Law librarian of Los Angeles and Special
legislative assistant to President Sproul, had a strong concern that the population explosion in
California which was happening in the 1950s would produce a rapid surge in the need for trained
librarians. California’s population in 1950 was approximately 10.5 million and from 1950 to
1960, the population would grow to over 15 million. 198 Powell emphatically described the
population boom as: “You could see them coming over the border like locusts. The women were
getting pregnant faster than ever; babies were being born. My God, it was really a crisis which
many of us had foreseen for a long time.” 199
The Liaison Committee’s report was published in December 1958. The report studied
enrollment from 1950 to 1957 of part-time and full-time students and staff at Immaculate Heart
and the University of Southern California, the number of graduates and kinds of library degrees
awarded, the institutes and workshops offered by the existing schools, as well as tuition, student

work and scholarship opportunities. USC and Immaculate Heart were both asked for appraisal of
the need for trained librarians and as well as the amount of additional library students which
could be accommodated at the time of the report, in 1957. San Jose State College was also
approached because their library program, as of 1957, was still the only one in California
designated primarily for the preparation of public school libraries. The report recommended that
due to expected shortages in the number of trained librarians as well as UCLA’s recruiting
potential and ideal location, that a graduate school of library science be established at UCLA and
that it become accredited. 200 The report also recommended that potential students for UCLA’s
library school be recruited from “new sources” so as to avoid taking too many students from the
existing library schools in Southern California. 201 The report does not elaborate on what the new
sources would be, and whether or not this would include the UCLA undergraduate student body.
The report noted that UCLA is “admirably equipped with the essentials necessary for a first rate
library school.” 202 Also in 1957, Powell achieved what he felt was the “best thing [he] did in the
field of administration,” in organizing an institute held at UCLA called “A New Look at Library
Administration,” sponsored by the extension division and the library, which welcomed enrollees
from all over the country. 203
In 1957, Andrew Horn returned to California to work as the college librarian at
Occidental College. Powell had the idea that Horn should return to help start the UCLA library
school. According to Horn, “Powell was more determined and more confident and was perhaps a

good deal closer to the feeling of librarians in the region, and he tended to be a little more critical
of what the existing library schools were doing.” 204 As Powell had travelled around and talked
to all the librarians, Horn speculated that in talking to those at Occidental, Powell likely
mentioned that when a library school should open at UCLA, he would be interested in recruiting
Horn. As a consequence, Horn had to assure Occidental when going to work there that he was
not just using it as a stepping-stone to UCLA. According to Powell, Horn’s “whole dream and
desire was to return to his own alma mater, UCLA.” 205 Horn, however, had a more practical
rationale for his eventual return. He believed that the best work he could have accomplished at
Occidental was in his early years when he reorganized the library and planned new budget
system. Horn did have the idea in mind that he would like to return to UCLA to help start the
school, but for Horn it was not as much of a matter of “destiny” as it was for Powell. In a later
interview Powell would admit that it was he, Powell, who had the “fate” of his position and his
father’s familial relation to Regent Dickson; whereas Horn had the “faith,” in that his
contributions to the SLS were fueled by a faith in the future success of the school. 206 Powell
described how in being fated into the role as the University Librarian for one of, if not the,
largest research center in the Southwest, that he must use his “forces” for good. 207 Powell’s
motivation for continuing Dickon’s fight for the “School of the Library” at UCLA was the result
of a force greater than himself. According to Powell, “I was a chosen instrument as it were, and I
had to do this.” 208

After meeting with Chancellor Raymond Allen, who was UCLA’s Chancellor from 1952
to 1959, Powell submitted a planning budget and at the last minute was called by California
Governor Edmund G. Brown, informing him that a modest 25 to 30 thousand had been allotted
for a planning year for the library school. 209 There was cause for celebration in November of
1958 when the Regents finally approved the first phase development of the Schools of
Architecture, Dentistry, and Librarianship at UCLA for a total of $78,520. 210 This amount was
part of a greater approval of $142,570,429 for the operating budget for the University of
California which included allotments for normal merit salary increases, building construction,
and new services and activities which, aside from the new schools at UCLA, also included
$300,000 for research into air pollution and $224,958 for expansion of agricultural research,
among many other endeavors. 211 Powell was told by Horn that Horn would be interested in
leaving administrative work in librarianship and coming into a teaching and research role. 212
Powell had been authorized by Chancellor Allen and Dean Vern Knudsen of the Graduate
Division to negotiate with Horn to leave Occidental, afterwhich Chancellor Allen had departed
for an economic mission in Indonesia, leaving the leadership of the university to Knudsen, who
became Acting Chancellor. Horn understood Dickson’s vision and accepted Powell’s offer on
the provision that he needed to give Occidental at least six months so that they could select
Horn’s successor. Powell, in an unconventional role for a University Librarian, and operating

under the assumption of approval from Allen and Knudsen, negotiated with Andrew Horn to join
him at UCLA in 1959. 213
Shortly after Horn’s agreement, the Governor Brown removed about thirty-seven things
from the enormous budget including the library school at UCLA. Knudsen had been a strong
supporter of professional library education at UCLA and worked with Powell and Governor
Brown to restore the budget for the library school. Of all the things removed from the budget
only three were restored: one concerning atomic energy, the other, statewide agriculture, and the
third was “the little library school at UCLA,” which gave Powell “a strong feeling of
participation with atomic energy and statewide agriculture.” 214 However, in restoring the
allotment for a library school at UCLA, only the funds for the operating budget were restored
and the budget did not restore the equipment or space provisions. Only a salary for Horn and a
secretary's salary were provided. To make matters worse, Chancellor Allen had called Horn
around May of 1959, after Horn’s successor had already been named at Occidental, to inform
Horn that his appointment had not been approved as a Professor, but rather as a Lecturer, which
meant a non-tenure appointment and that there would be no salary advantage in Horn’s leaving
Occidental for UCLA. 215
Powell had to decide whether to be Dean of the new library school or University
Librarian or both. At the Chicago Library School, the Dean and the University Librarian had
been the same person at the same time, but, by the late 1950s, it was not common practice
amongst library schools. Horn assumed that he would be Planning Officer and Powell would be
Dean, but Powell ended up spending most of his time in the library and according to Horn, “I

52

don’t remember really whether I was to be Acting Dean, but this didn’t matter because there
really wasn’t any purpose in that. I was just to be there. I had some misgivings about whether the
appointment was really appropriate, because it had been assured, more-or-less, by telephone and
I knew that faculty appointments were made by [the budget] committee.” 216 Horn was well
aware of the budgetary restraints, but another concern which he encountered was in regards to
the beginnings of the California Master Plan. The California Master Plan included efforts to
divide professional and technical training into the state colleges, whereas universities would only
retain certain professional education and graduate education, for example, Medicine and Law.
UCLA had closed its Home Economics program, which Horn saw a sign of “the university
drawing its line.” 217 He was unsure of where Librarianship would fall, and found that enthusiasm
for the school was not universal and there were a number of people who only wanted to increase
traditional academics or the existing professional schools, rather than found a new professional
school.
It was in fact a lack of professionalism which most struck Andrew Horn in coming to
UCLA. Chancellor Allen abruptly resigned in June of 1959. Allen had been encouraged to do so
after it was found out that he had taken part in making illegal payments of $40 a month each to
football players at UCLA that had not been sanctioned by the Pacific Coast Conference. 218 The
PCC was a college athletic conference of as many as 10 colleges with competitions in football
basketball and baseball. In 1956, the conference's commissioner Victor O. Schmidt claims to
have attempted to conduct an investigation, from which he was barred by Chancellor Allen.
Chancellor Allen denies that he blocked the investigation and claims to have provided Schmidt

with information regarding the booster clubs, which along with the alumni organizations, were
being used the fund the illegal monthly payments to football players. 219 Despite Allen’s denial,
UCLA was fined $95,000 by the PCC and placed on a probationary period until July 1, 1959. 220
After his resignation, Allen became the Director of the International Cooperation Administration
in Indonesia. 221 With Allen’s resignation, Horn felt as though he was arriving just as UCLA’s
administration lost a lot of leadership and support for the library school. Horn knew that even
while Allen was still Chancellor, Allen had an unfavorable relationship with the Budget
Committee for obvious reasons, and after Allen left, Horn found little support for restoring the
budget for the facilities and equipment. Horn did not even know to whom in the administration
he was supposed to report and when he first arrived, he did not even have a place to sit down. 222
Horn was able to make an office for himself in the downstairs level of the library, but as
far as class space was concerned, he still faced a considerable struggle to get the space
reassigned to the library. He knew he needed to get the program approved, along with classes
and faculty, and he knew this would require an academic approach, but academic work was not
something in which he or Powell had ever specialized. Horn felt as though he and Powell were
both coming from more of a non-academic background. Horn found himself in a predicament
which he dubbed a “personal problem,” wherein he had been convinced that the opportunity to
join Powell in the building of the School of Library service at UCLA would be a fantastic
opportunity, but then as soon as he had given his notice and found his successor at Occidental, he

became inundated with warning signs that things would not go smoothly at UCLA. 223 Horn
believed that the school should have been finalized before he was ever asked to accept the
appointment, and he admits that had he not already gone as far as to have secured his successor
at Occidental, he might not have ever left for UCLA, “and perhaps if I had not accepted, I’d have
been personally better off… but that’s quite questionable too.” 224 Horn decided to himself not to
continue for more than a year with a non-tenure appointment, but admitted that even that would
be challenging.
Over the summer of 1959, Horn did an enormous amount of research into accreditation,
other schools’ curriculums, and advice from other library school leaders. An area of growing
importance for Horn was that of accreditation. ALA standards had recently been revised and
according to Horn, “I thought that I had to look at what could be accredited by the American
Library Association. It seemed to me that, no matter how good a program we had, if it wasn't one
that would be acceptable with the national accrediting agency, we would attract some very
interesting students, but we would very seriously limit their possibilities of employment,
because, increasingly, the best library systems are specifying a degree from an accredited library
school.” 225 With the help of Powell’s administrative assistant Barbara Boyd and Horn’s secretary
Ellie Schuetze, Horn studied and analyzed the course offerings at the accredited library school.
They compared this research with the past work of the Library Education Seminar, the
discussions of which had largely centered around the ways in which the current schools could be
improved, and saw that in creating a quality curriculum to meet with the written accreditation
standards of ALA, it was important to emphasize bibliography, and that a book-centered

223

225

Ibid, 36.
55

curriculum was essential. They paid particular attention to advice from the Dean and the faculty
of the Berkeley library school and Berkeley’s program was very influential. Horn believed that
by patterning his curriculum after core elements of the Berkeley Library School, it would help to
facilitate an exchange of students. After compiling an enormous amount of research over the
summer of 1959, Horn created a document entitled “Education for Librarianship at UCLA.” 226
By October of 1959, Horn had a telephone in his office and had secured employment for
Ellie Schultze as his full-time secretary, who had been previously splitting her duties between
helping Horn and helping Powell. Horn was able to call and consult with Martha Boaz directly.
Although he found her to be nice and cordial, she did seem concerned with the effect that the
UCLA library school would have on her school. Others were much more supportive. Horn had
also secured the support of the Acting Chancellor Vern Oliver Knudsen, who had known Horn
when Horn was a graduate student at UCLA, when Knudsen was Dean of the Graduate School.
Knudsen believed in the library school at UCLA and was very sympathetic to Powell and Horn’s
efforts. In September, 1959, Chancellor Knudsen appointed an Advisory Committee. The duties
of the advisory committee were to create an official program and curriculum of the school,
including course descriptions, admission requirements, as well as the requirements for the
M.L.S. degree. The committee would also work to figure out the limitations of the class size and
half-time enrollment, and finally, to not only create the criteria for the selection of a faculty, but
to provide sound nominations of individual faculty members, as well as for an inter-campus
advisory council. The members of Knudsen’s committee that were tasked with these goals were:

Chairman of the Committee;

Chapter 7: The Argument

Then it happened: The August 1959 issue of the Southern California Chapter of the
Special Libraries Association Bulletin was published. Robert Lewis, a law librarian from Los
Angeles, who had worked for the Melveny & Myers law firm, and who served on the Executive
and Advisory Board of the Southern California Chapter of the Special Libraries Association, had
written an article called “A Minority View,” and Frank Bennett, a librarian at Riker Laboratories
and the editor of the Bulletin, had written its introduction providing an enthusiastic endorsement
for Lewis’s stance, which was, at its core, unabashedly opposed to a library school at UCLA. 228
229

Lewis’s article was based on a speech which he had, unbeknownst to Powell and Horn,

delivered to the audience at the May 18, 1959 meeting of the Executive and Advisory Board of
the Southern California Chapter, wherein Lewis encouraged library organizations to take a stand
against the establishment of a third library school in Southern California. Based on Lewis’s
speech, a motion was passed by committee, of which Lewis was a member to “obtain a clearer
picture of the problem.” 230 However, the first that Powell and Horn had even ever heard of this
inquiry was in November 1959, after the Southern California Chapter of the Special Libraries
Association President Doris Banks wrote to Powell on behalf of the Bulletin to distance herself

and her organization from Lewis and Bennett, and to give Powell background information on
how the article had came to be. 231
After his speech, Lewis had written to the presidents of all the library organizations he
could find listed. In corresponding with those who were willing to respond to him in regards to
whether or not UCLA should open a third library school in Southern California, only one
respondent reported official action in favor, five no action, one was described as being “group
favorable,” there were three personal expressions in favor, and one personal belief “too late to
oppose.” 232 It is unknown whose response belonged to whom. The findings of the inquiry noted
that, although Martha Boaz of USC and Sister Mary Regis of Immaculate Heart found the
statistics concerning capacity and enrollment available in the December 1958 Liaison Committee
report to be valid, it was felt that this report failed to present a complete picture because “much
had been omitted.” 233 The committee, of which Lewis was a part, determined that the 1956-57
figures of enrollment which had not yet been published presented “a better picture.” Committee
chairman Margaret R. Anderson, noted that she felt that after her conversation with Powell that
he had made a logical and reasonable argument for the establishment of the school. She also
summed up the situation by stating that “since the library school at the University of California is
an accomplished fact with Andrew H. Horn appointed as Lecturer in Library Services and
registration scheduled for the fall of 1960, it is hoped that a third library school will help the
administrators of the two established schools obtain more funds and that the importance of their

schools will be recognized even more.” 234 This statement confirmed that, despite Lewis's
objections, the library school was by then a reality which would proceed, and the committee
could do nothing more than send its well wishes. Lewis, however, was not ready to give up.
Lewis’s article’s main criticism was that the School of Library Service at UCLA was an
unnecessary expenditure. Lewis believed that since the University of Southern California and
Immaculate Heart College were, as of 1959, already offering Master’s degrees in library
education, opening a third school in Southern California would be an unwise expenditure of tax
revenue and would adversely affect the already low enrollment numbers at USC and Immaculate
Heart. Lewis used the analogy of a hypothetical situation in which two mills were operating at
two-thirds efficiency, and proposed that, rather than to build a new mill, the best solution was to
increase the efficiency of either existing mill. The mills, to Lewis, were symbolic of USC and
Immaculate Heart, both of which had room in their library degree programs for more students.
Lewis sites the statistics obtained from his committee’s investigation: Immaculate Heart had a
capacity of approximately 150 with an enrollment of 70 and USC had a capacity of 300-350,
with an enrollment of 195-225. 235 Given these low numbers, Lewis argued that the “group
character” of librarians obliged support of the existing Southern California library degree
programs by discouraging a new and competing program. Lewis felt that the opening of such a
program was evidence of how the UC system was “calculated to hurt private education.” 236
SCCSLA Bulletin Editor Frank Bennett, who earlier in the edition had announced his
retirement, also provided a troublesome introduction for Lewis’s piece. Herein Bennett, like
Lewis, recommends expansion of the existing library education graduate degree programs in

Southern California as they “do not cost the taxpayer one cent and are more than adequate,” and
he also suggests that the low enrollment numbers at either school are not due to the prohibitive
costs of private education, but rather, a lack of desirable library students and job candidates. 237
Bennett suggests that candidate quality could be improved by offering better wages for graduates
of library education programs, but then Bennett’s editorial quickly descends into a vicious
personal attack on Lawrence Clark Powell. He demands an explanation from the Regents as to
why they chose “a librarian for this high position who has the dubious distinction of having been
a registered COMMUNIST [sic]”, referring to that article from 1951. Bennett then closes his
introduction with a cryptic question, asking his readership if they have ever read “The Naked
Communist.”238 The book which Bennett refers to is one in which former FBI Agent W. Cloen
Skousen, describes a Communist plot for world domination. 239

Chapter 8: The Response to Lewis and Bennett

Librarians throughout Southern California were outraged and many wrote a number of
letters to express how they felt about what the Bulletin had published. One librarian in particular,
Roy Hollerman, the Librarian at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC La Jolla, had written
a series of letters to all involved, to come to the defense of Powell and UCLA and to show his
support. Hollerman was thorough and direct in his responses. Regarding Lewis and Bennett’s
concerns that the existing schools are not operating at capacity, Hollerman wrote to the Bulletin
and copied Powell and Horn to state that “There comes a point of diminishing returns when the
higher the number of students attending, the lower the standards must be placed as regards the
time and attention given to their training.” 240 Hollerman also pointed out that the Immaculate
Heart library school, although “offering excellent courses” is not an accredited school, showing
that Andrew Horn was not alone in regards to his perceived importance of ALA accreditation. 241
Hollerman added in his letter to the Bulletin that he felt that the lower cost of attending a state
institution would encourage more young people who could not afford a fifth year at a private
university to enter the profession. He believed that USC “has been holding its own in the other
fields against any encroachments of the University of California and its branches,” and
speculated that the school at UCLA might even raise the standards of library training to an even
higher level. 242 In a separate letter Hollerman wrote to Frank Bennett personally to address
Bennett’s attack on Powell, telling Bennett that “We are all for the Democratic freedom of

speech. We all greatly admire your strong patriotism, but what you had to gain by false
accusations it is difficult to understand. It is my belief that a human being never makes any real
points for himself by trying to lower another individual in the eyes of his fellow man.” 243 On
November 25, 1959, Andrew Horn wrote a letter to Roy Hollerman, thanking him for his
willingness to protest the Bulletin’s August issue. Horn states to Hollerman that “This whole
thing, as often happens when persons lose their heads—has probably backfired. I suspect the
Southern California Chapter of SLA lost a lot more than the UCLA School of Library service
did.” 244
Other examples of support include a letter to the Bulletin and copied to Lawrence Powell
from E. Jorgensen, the Chief Librarian of the Navy Electronic Laboratory dated September 18,
1959, addressed to Doris Banks, the Chapter President. Jorgensen wrote Banks to “protest the
attack on personalities which appeared in the last issue of the Chapter Bulletin,” and added that
“There is in my own opinion no reason why the official journal of a professional organization
should print an unprovoked, personal attack. There is no justification for a writer to attempt to
bolder his arguments by an appeal to the emotions, especially through the device of a totally
unwarranted and vicious attack on the motives and character of the principals in this case. There
is also no justification for “sponsoring” such attacks by printing them in the Bulletin.” 245
Similarly Jean Legg, of the California Research Corporation Standard Oil Company of
California, had written Banks on September 11, 1959, to let it be known that “Regardless of the

circumstances, or of my personal opinion of the proposed library school, I am ashamed to be
associated with a group which has sanctioned by publication an attack inappropriate undignified,
unprofessional, and frankly fanatic. If I had any choice about being listed as a member of the
Southern California Chapter--and I believe I do not--I would resign. As it is, I wish to disapprove
absolutely of the actions of the chapter in this matter.” 246 Banks replied to Legg by detaching
herself from Lewis and Bennett by stating that: “At SLA Headquarters in June I discussed this as
a problem, and wholeheartedly agreed with Miss Lucius’s counsel that in our real need for
trained librarians, our only stand can be to support library schools.” 247 Banks goes on to add that,
“Further, the Board voted to not inform SLA Headquarters unless trouble arises but attempt to
handle our problems ourselves. They voted to inform Dr. Powell that the special meeting was
called and that the Bulletin issue represents personal opinion and not necessarily the feeling of
the Board, the Advisory Council, nor the Membership. They voted to not distribute a special
apology issue, but to encourage letters to the editor and expression of more personal opinions.
Much as I deplore this thing ever happening, and much as I myself feel like running away, I feel
we as a Board are trying to meet the situation in a panicked, a throughout [sic] way. We shall not
undo the wrong; we may, however, build some support for Dr. Powell’s new school.” 248 Banks
then wrote Powell personally to say “I am shocked, as I’ve been shocked these two weeks. I am
most apologetic for having any connection with the organization publishing this thing. Having
survived in Boston in the days of the Congressional investigations at Harvard and the Philbrick

attacks, I resent any association smacking of more of the same.” 249 Herbert Philbrick had been a
Boston advertising executive who had been recruited by the FBI to infiltrate the Communist
Party as a spy.
Although many of these letters were addressed to Powell, because Powell was busy
finalizing his affairs as University Librarian and preparing the library for his successor, much of
the correspondence of the School of Library Service fell upon that of Andrew Horn. On
December first, 1959, Horn wrote a personal and private list of rebuttals to Lewis’s arguments.
According to Horn “[Lewis] wrote to the presidents of thirteen library organizations in Southern
California. Five replied, four were personally delighted at prospect of the school.” 250 Andrew
Horn could not see that the establishment of the school at Immaculate Heart had had any
negative effect on USC’s enrollment and Horn asks why, if the Immaculate Heart and USC
schools offer superior programs, would students prefer UCLA? “Answer, obviously, is cost,”
Horn writes, adding that he knows individuals who would come to UCLA but not USC nor
Immaculate Heart as a matter of cost. 251 In regards to a particularly verbose statement of Lewis
that “it is fallacious, shocking, contrary to good sense, shallow, ill considered, etc. to contend
that a school at UCLA will improve recruiting,” Horn reminds Lewis that UCLA is the largest
university in Southern California, in terms of the annual amount of Bachelor’s degrees conferred
as well as in terms of enrollment of graduate students. Horn adds that “There is a very good
reason to believe that the faculties of UCLA would direct students to professional librarianship if

a school existed on the campus.” 252 The research and feedback which Horn had already reviewed
over summer had indicated such.
Regarding Lewis’s argument that Immaculate Heart and USC’s standards need to be
improved and that the library profession should “lend a hand,” Horn personally thinks that if
the USC library school is better than UCLA’s, then the best potential students would go
to USC, and suggests that the three schools could each develop a special emphasis. Horn adds
that “The profession should certainly help USC and UCLA,” pointing out that UCLA is no less
worthy of support from the library profession. Regarding Lewis’s accusation that the University
of California is acting with calculated intent to hurt private education, Horn writes “I don’t
believe it.” 253 He points out that Lewis was educated in private institutions with a BS from
Princeton, LLB from Harvard, and BS from Columbia, and says that “I for one could not have
gotten my education in private institutions, and there is good many like me. In fact private
institutions could not at present do the job.” 254 He also adds that the establishment of other
professional schools and graduate programs in different fields at UCLA have not hurt any
corresponding programs at USC. Horn points out that even though Lewis laments that there was
no vote of which he was included, Lewis still calls his article “A Minority View,” recognizing
that the majority of those who would vote against a library school at UCLA would still find
themselves in the minority, should a hypothetical vote have taken place. In addressing the Leigh
Report, Horn notes that although it predicted that the existing Southern California library schools
should be able to recruit and train enough librarians to meet the need, they have not been able to
do so. Horn ends his notes by asserting that “The Joint Staff Report concluded that a school at

252

253

254

Ibid.
66

UCLA should be able to recruit and train some additional librarians [...] It really is up to Mr.
Lewis to prove this is impossible – his arguments have not convinced me.” 255
This handwritten note, which as far as can be confirmed, was never sent, presented nor
published, was nevertheless written in two different colors so as to emphasize certain points in
red and saved within University archives for posterity. While Horn was writing these points, a
letter was already enroute from Robert Lewis to Lawrence Powell which had been written
Sunday, November 29th, 1959 to acknowledge the upcoming Association Chapter meeting at the
UCLA campus that coming Friday. Lewis made it clear that his views regarding the UCLA
library school “remain unchanged” and that “[...] in this instance I shall not want to go to the
dinner and meeting Friday unless I can know that my presence will not be disagreeable or in any
way embarrassing to you or Dr. Horn. I am confident you will understand my sincerity in asking
you to be absolutely candid in telling me how you feel.” 256 In his response letter which he
addressed to Robert Lewis written November 30, 1959, Powell thanks Lewis for writing and
assured him that his “attendance at the dinner meeting Friday night will not embarrass us.” 257 He
then defers debate at the dinner by saying, “Although the meeting Friday night is not planned for
discussion, I am sure there will be opportunities in the future for frank discussion of library
education in general and here at UCLA in particular.” 258 That Powell says he looks forward to
“meeting and greeting” Lewis at the dinner confirms that the two had not met prior to December,
1959.

The only record of public statement from UCLA regarding the Lewis debacle came from
that very meeting of the Special Libraries Association Chapter at UCLA, on Friday December 4,
1959 when Horn presented his paper “Education for Librarianship.” In his introductory speech,
he only addressed the incident to say that what had been written was “contemptible rather than
challenging,” afterwhich he did not deign to address the attack any further, and rather chose to
highlight the incredible history of the School of Library Service. He told of the immense amount
of groundwork established prior to his and Powell’s contributions and let all in attendance know
that it was Regent Dickson who had been promoting the idea of a library school at UCLA since
1930, and it was not until the early 1950s that Dickson was finally able to convince Lawrence
Clark Powell that resources of the UCLA Library could support the school. Horn boasts that
UCLA is now an ideal center for library studies by touting its seventeen well-stocked and staffed
libraries, as well as the recently-acquired “Western Data Processing Center with its IBM Type
709 Data Processing System,” which Horn mentioned was already being used in a number of
projects related to the library. Thus the advisory committee for the School of Library Service
proceeded with its planning year. 259

Chapter 9: The Planning Year and Dedication

The year from September 1959 to September 1960 would be used to accomplish many
preliminary tasks in the establishment of a new school of librarianship at UCLA. These tasks
included further planning of the details of the program so that it may meet the accreditation
standards of the California Department of Education and the American Library Association,
recruiting faculty and staff, evaluating applications, development of an operating budget
estimate for the next 5-10 years, providing outreach and progress reports to the CDE and ALA,
establishment of a liaison with other institutions which have programs for training librarians,
particularly those already partnered with Berkeley, proposing to the School of Education, Los
Angeles a joint program leading to the California Credential in School Librarianship, developing
an administrative organization, and ordering equipment and supplies. 260 The School of Library
Service was set to open September 19, 1960.
As the deadline grew close, the SLS quickly accomplished its goals. The criticisms of
Lewis and Bennett had not deterred applicants in the slightest, much the contrary, there were
way more applications than could ever be admitted. As soon as the Regents had approved the
school in November 1958, Powell had begun to receive informal applications and inquiries from
potential students. By the close of the planning year, Powell had received over 500 applications
and inquiries from people in California as well as 33 other states and 11 foreign countries. 261
Since the class was limited to only 50 full-time students, with the assistance of the Admission
section of the Graduate Division, the committee, and other librarians with whom the library
school seminar had been in contact, Powell was able to recruit other librarians to conduct

interviews with potential students on his behalf. Support was offered from many local
institutions who generously provided facilities and funds to support work-study programs for
students. These institutions included The Los Angeles City Public Library, the Los Angeles
County Public Library, the Santa Monica Public Library, the Occidental College Library, and the
West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Center. The Technical Book Company of Los
Angeles offered to supply a substantial collection of reference books and the antiquarian
booksellers, Zeitlin and Ver Brugge, were approved by the Regents to support a five-year
Lectureship in Bibliography, allowing the school to invite distinguished guest lecturers. 262
In recruiting the School of Library Service’s faculty, Lawrence Clark Powell had a belief
that outstanding teaching could be expected only from people who had been seasoned in library
work, and at the same time, he deplored a trend to staff library school faculties with young
instructors whose chief qualification was the PhD degree. 263 Many of the original faculty which
the SLS recruited had received their library degrees from the UC Berkeley Library School.
Although this was noted as a negative in the SLS’s 1962 ALA inspection, Powell defends his
faculty in that, “I don’t think the Berkeley Library School under Mitchell, Coulter, and Sisler
ever had any copyright philosophy with which they indoctrinated their graduates.” 264 Powell
then admits that practicality, not a philosophical agenda, was the reason behind the large percent
of Berkeley graduates within his faculty, “It wasn’t really a philosophical inner circle, it was an
expedient inner circle—that is, here were the people that were possible to start with, without
going through an enormous amount of nationwide screening […] you simply couldn’t have done

that and got the thing open.” 265 He goes on to explain that most of the faculty were picked on the
basis of their success as librarians, and made an important statement regarding his own
foundational philosophy in that “A lot of people didn’t and still don’t regard librarianship as a
true academic discipline. I don’t know that I do myself.” 266
By the time faculty and preliminary curriculum announcements were made in the annual
report of the planning year, Andrew Horn had finally been named Associate Professor and
Assistant Dean. Horn taught Bibliography, Reference and Documentation and the Introduction to
Library Service joint staff class section on library history. The other founding faculty offered the
first class of students a broad range of courses taught by a powerhouse of instructors. These
instructors included Frances Clarke Sayers, a well-renowned children's librarian, author of
children's books, and lecturer on children's literature, who, as a lecturer in the English
Department at UCLA, had played an integral role in helping the Library Education Seminar to
plan curriculum. She had taught for several years as a member of Dean Mitchell's faculty at
Berkeley, and at the School of Library Service would teach courses in children’s library service.
Faculty member Barbara Boyd, who had a Master’s in public administration from UCLA and
twenty-years’ experience working as a county librarian in Modoc County and a field consultant
in the state library, would teach public library work at the city, country, regional, and federal
levels. Tatiana P. Keating, a native of Russia and who had received her graduate and
undergraduate degrees at Berkeley and an MLS from USC, and had organized the high school
library at Reseda High School in San Fernando Valley when study body welled to 3,000, would
teach school library service. And perhaps the most famous, Seymore Lubetzky, a worldrenowned scholar of cataloging, was recruited to teach cataloging and classification. Lubetzky

265

Ibid, 464.

266

Ibid, 480.
71

had more than a quarter century of experience in the field. He received his BA from UCLA and
MA from Berkeley, as well as degree from Berkeley’s library school. Lubetzky was friends with
Powell, having begun his library career in the UCLA library in 1936 as a junior with Powell and
their friendship had endured. 267 268 In persuading Lubetzky to return to UCLA, Powell promised
him freedom to continue his leadership in international cataloging standardization and also the
freedom to write his magnum opus. Also Powell himself would work as an instructor. Powell’s
teaching experience included his work at the Columbia Library School in 1954, and as well as
teaching in the UCLA English department. Five of the six UCLA School of Library Service
faculty, all but Sayers, had attended UC Berkeley’s library school. 269
The opening dedication ceremony of the School of Library Service took place Sunday
afternoon, September 18, 1960 during which time a noteworthy speech was given by Paul
Horgan. Horgan was a Southwestern author of fiction, biography, and history who had
previously, between 1926 and 1943, been librarian of New Mexico’s military institute at
Roswell. In his speech entitled “One of the Quietest Things,” Horgan said, “It is an occasion
which marks yet another stride of the University toward excellence and inclusiveness in its
embrace of the whole spirit of man.” 270 In his speech, Horgan describes having met Powell in a
bookstore in Albuquerque and going for iced coffee at a nearby hotel and having a good talk
about books, writing, travel, research, and life. During their talk, Powell told Horgan of Powell’s
“visionary hope” for a library school at UCLA and Horgan said that if the school ever does open,

he would like to see it, to which Powell quickly replied, “When we are ready to open, you come
and give the speech of dedication!” 271 The philosophy which would continue to resonate
throughout the school is reflected in “One of the Quietest Things” where it says “For the very
word library is now in itself too narrow to describe the repository of such records.” 272 Horgan
asked the students how they would like to be able to see and hear Julius Caesar, Shakespeare,
Napoleon and Abraham Lincoln on “sound film” and told how future generations would be able
to do just that with figures such as Eisenhower. Even the newspaper reporter covering the event
was aware of the importance of the SLS in stating that “The new school has a capacity for only
50 students but at least is a beginning to relieve the acute shortage of librarians which plagues
the entire United States.” 273 “One of the Quietest Things” proved enormously popular with
letters arriving from as far as Johannesburg to request a copy from Powell. For this reason,
Lawrence Clark Powell saw to it that 500 copies be printed and distributed from the SLS “as a
remembrance of its natal day.” 274
Just a few days later, on September 23, 1960, Chancellor Franklin David Murphy
delivered his inaugural address. 275 Murphy had succeeded Acting Chancellor Vern Knudsen after
Knudsen had personally given Murphy a tour of the campus earlier in the year when convincing
him to join UCLA. 276 During his speech, Murphy set forth his goals for UCLA as a university in

Chapter 10: The Thesis

Which brings us to the crux of this thesis: Were Robert Lewis and Frank Bennett right or
wrong? Was a library school at UCLA a justified decision which had been a long time in
development, or simply part of a plot to destroy private education? The arguments which Lewis
and Bennett had made against the school were that UCLA would take business away from the
existing schools, that it would keep the current schools from expanding, that it would use funds
and resources to create the new school for the purpose of solving a problem (the need for trained
librarians) that could be solved with less expenditure by expanding the existing schools, and
lastly, but most memorably, that there is the argument on Bennett’s part of the communist
allegations against Lawrence Clark Powell. Although, sadly, Edward Dickson was not alive to
deal with this argument as swiftly and adeptly as he had done in the past, the notion that the
validity of the idea to create a library school at UCLA could be compromised because the
founding Dean had once registered as a Communist over two decades prior becomes all the more
absurd given the fact that Powell himself had initially not been convinced of UCLA’s ability to
support the school. As the aforementioned history informs us, Powell would not be fully
convinced until 1951, when the one of the most anti-communist Regents, one of the very
Regents who had strongly supported the Loyalty Oath and President McCarthy's HUAC
investigations, who had been an active progressive Republican and successful newspaperman
and banker, was the one to convince Powell that UCLA should have a “School of the Library,”
notably convincing him shortly after coming to his defense for the very thing that eight years
later, his most verbose critic would try to indict him for--his communist affiliations. According
to Powell, “no one was more anti-communistic than Dickson.” 279 The fact that the President of

279

Powell, “Looking Back at Sixty,” 290.
75

the Western Savings and Loan had been the strongest and most enduring supporter on record of
the library school at UCLA should attest to the argument that the school was not founded as part
of a plot to hurt private education nor private business in general, much the contrary, in many
ways it promoted free enterprise by offering the students more choices when selecting which
school is right for them.
In many ways, the Regent approval to establish the library school at UCLA may be seen
as a tribute to Edward Dickson. As a significant founder of UCLA before it was even UCLA,
and one of UCLA’s strongest supporters from its founding to day of his death, Dickson had
envisioned that UCLA would have all the professional schools, and he especially had a place in
his heart for his “School of the Library.” A man of books and an avid collector, a defender of
libraries and a Library Board member, the library school at UCLA was enormously important to
Dickson. That he did not live to see its founding is one of the saddest, yet unknown, tragedies of
UCLA history. For someone who achieved such a grand vision to have created UCLA into all
that it had become literally from the ground up, and as a man who had a reputation for only
promoting endeavors which would be most beneficial to society, it makes sense that Dickson’s
vision for a professional school of library education at his university would be honored after his
untimely passing, not only because of a matter of legacy, but because his track record for
beneficial endeavors had been so successful, giving a precedent for great potential to his idea of
a “School of the Library.”
The fact that UCLA was able to model its program so closely to Berkeley, and through
the UC system, facilitate joint programs and opportunities, also adds to the case for a library
school at UCLA. By the time UCLA’s library school was established, UCLA also had one of the
top libraries on the West Coast. According to Lawrence Powell in the annual report of the
planning year regarding the budget, “It is evident that the University intends to provide the funds
76

and facilities required by a graduate library school which must operate at the level of excellence
attained by existing schools which have been accredited by the American Library
Association.” 280 ALA did not normally consider accreditation until a school had been in
operation for three years, but even before UCLA began offering classes at the SLS, ALA was
already studying the program and planning for an accreditation visit at the end of the 1960/61
academic year. Powell felt that the close similarity of the program to Berkeley's School of
Librarianship, the fact that the Advisory Council of the School of Librarianship at Berkeley was
being expanded to become that University of California Advisory Council on Education and
Librarianship, and the proposal to invite graduates of the UCLA School of Library Service to
membership in the UC School of Librarianship Alumni Association, all helped to promote the
case for an early accreditation of UCLA’s program. Although the efforts on the part of UCLA’s
School of Library service to seek accreditation, along with Andrew Horn’s previous statements
on the matter, and Holleman's letter pointing out that Immaculate Heart was not accredited,
accreditation by ALA was still not as important in 1959 as it become in the decades since and
Immaculate Heart still had a well-reputed program even without ALA accreditation.
Even though both Martha Boaz and Sister Mary Regis had expressed their concerns
regarding the library school at UCLA, Horn notes that “[Lewis] has spoken and has attempted to
get thirteen library organizations in Southern California to agree with him. I am not aware that
many organizations, IHC and USC included, have joined forced with him,” and no evidence had
been found to indicate that they had. 281 Although all three Southern California library schools
were encompassing of a broad enough curriculum so that the attendee could, after graduation,
choose from a number of career paths, Immaculate Heart maintained a reputation for training

280

Powell, Annual Report 1959-60, 3.

281

Horn, “Horn Notes,” 1.
77

school librarians, USC had a reputation for training public librarians, and UCLA had a reputation
for training academic librarians. The scheduling also affected the students which were attracted
to which school. For example, USC was, according to Boaz, “kind of geared to people who were
working, so you could take courses on Saturdays, you could take evening courses, and you didn't
have to register for full-time courses. You could be working and be working toward your degree
at the same time.” 282 Since each of the schools had a form of specialization, and since the need
for trained librarians continued to grow until the late 1960s, enrollment never suffered at
Immaculate Heart nor USC due to the opening of UCLA’s School of Library Service.
Although Boaz admits that there was tension be in the beginning between the two
schools, a number of librarians in the area talked with her about it, including Harold Hammill
and John Henderson, the Los Angeles City and County librarians, respectively. They had lunch
with Boaz and assured her of their loyalty and support to her school. During an interview in
1963, Powell pointed out that “The enrollment at the USC library school has gone higher than
it’s ever been. It’s now at it’s highest enrollment and the establishment of the UCLA library
school has not jeopardized USC.” 283 USC’s library school would in fact continue to enjoy
success until 1985 when a decision was announced, with which Martha Boaz’s successor Roger
Greer did not agree, that a $55-million library would be built at the same time they were
announcing the closure of the library school. 284 Boaz had retired in 1978 and was no longer in
the position of Dean by the time the school closed in 1986. She “did all she could,” but was not
well-treated by USC, and she was denied the occupancy of the building that she had helped to

fund. 285 As a worse fate, like her forefather Everett Perry, although she lived to see her library
school shut down, she did not live to see it reinstated, as she died in 1995, and a program in
librarianship at USC was not offered again until January of 2017.
Regarding the announcement to close the USC school while building a new library, Greer
is quoted as saying, “They tell me when it’s finished, they’ll have one of the greatest research
facilities in the country, well, they’ll have one of the greatest warehouses full of wood and
chemicals, but research is still a human activity […] you might as well claim 50 million parking
places are just as important as books because unless you’re talking about someone using them,
it’s meaningless.” 286 The reason for the decommissioning of the USC library school given by the
Vice Provost Robert Biller was: “You have to recognize this field is going through a very
difficult period of change—change in virtually every dimension you could imagine: in the way
the field is conceptualized, how it is supported, character of research, of education, literally our
fundamental idea of what a library should be is being challenged […] It’s clear it will be a
generation before all of this gets sorted out. So the real issue, then, is: Is this an area where the
university can marshal strength for the long haul?” 287 Biller went on to describe how a study
committee was formed to assess the pros and cons of the library school at USC, and found that
although enrollment was up (enrollment was slightly more than 100 students), it was still USC’s
smallest graduate school on campus. Since Biller found grants and aid to be insignificant and no
benefactors on the horizon, it was decided that the school should close. 288

Greer had lamented that the library community had become enamored with the
technologies of the library and lost sight of their reason for being. It has been speculated that as
the USC library school was closing, circa mid-1980s, there existed a sentiment that universities
were “de-committing” library schools because the profession had become technical and that
“there is no conceptual substance requiring research or advanced degrees,” and that “USC
discontinued Roger's School because of the persistence of the technical perception on the part of
the Administration.” 289 Interestingly, Biller's prediction that it would take a generation before
USC gets sorted out proved more or less correct, thirty years being about as long as it took for
USC to reopen an ALA-accredited program. The answer to Bennett's question as to whether or
not USC survived the opening of a library school at UCLA is yes, as the library school at USC
did last for fifty consecutive years and nearly twenty five years after the founding of UCLA,
which proves wrong Lewis's point that opening a third school would adversely affect the
enrollment of the existing schools. UCLA did not have a negative effect on USC's library
school's enrollment; enrollment at USC's library school was up, and that was not the reason for
its closure, which turned out to be merely a hiatus.
The establishment of a library school at UCLA also had less of an effect on Immaculate
Heart College than the controversies which plagued Immaculate Heart in the 1960s. The Sisters
had disbanded in the late 1960s after several years of feuding with Rome, and especially with
Cardinal James Francis McIntyre, the American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church and
Archbishop of Los Angeles from 1948 to 1970. 290 Due to the Sisters’ controversial practices,
McIntyre barred the Sisters from teaching within the Archdiocese in 1967. These practices
included abandoning the habit, eliminating daily prayer, taking part in “encounter group therapy”

sessions with psychologist Carl Rogers and the Esalen Institute, and, most egregious, the refusal
to recognize ecclesiastical authority. 291 Over two-hundred nuns left Immaculate Heart by 1969,
and of the remaining sisters, 354 left the faith but retained the campus property. The fifty-four
nuns who maintained their orthodoxy moved to Wichita, Kansas where they continued to operate
a teacher training school. 292 Although little information exists regarding the fate of the library
school at Immaculate Heart, a small newspaper clipping from 1972 reveals that a party was held
to note the closing of the library school with a wine-tasting for alumni on Sunday, February 27,
1972 from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. at 781 Prospect Ave, in Pasadena, an historical private residence
built in 1909 which is often referred to as “The Hindry House.” 293 This Arts and Crafts style
home was designed by Arthur and Alfred Heineman, and for three decades was owned and cared
for by Albert and Marka Hibbs. Marka Hibbs was a longtime librarian at Flintridge Preparatory
School. 294 Financial difficulties which resulted from the dissolution of the nuns' direction and
subsequent loss of support forced the entire Immaculate Heart College to close in 1981, however,
the Immaculate Heart College Center offered Master's degrees in Feminist Spirituality and
Global Education until 2000. 295

296

Although the Northern California library schools were not of concern to the Bulletin
critics Lewis and Bennett, their fates are still important in the defense of a library school at
UCLA. Berkeley’s Library School had begun offering a Ph.D. and a Doctor of Library Science

(DLS) degree program in 1954 and a Master of Library Science degree (MLS) in 1955, and
continued to thrive until 1995, when what had evolved into the School of Library and
Information Studies at Berkeley closed and became the School of Information Management and
Systems that same year. Although it was technically a different school and no longer ALAaccredited, much of the curriculum and skills learned were very similar. According to Patrick G.
Wilson, former Dean of UC Berkeley's School of Information Management and Systems, “I was
looking at some pieces of paper, the list of courses which are formally offered in the new school,
and then the list of courses which are actually taught in the school, and the difference is quite
startling. If you look at the list of courses that are formally offered, that are on the books, it looks
like this is really a continuation of the old school in the sense that there are courses which are
recognizably successors to the courses which, for me, were the core of the curriculum: the
organization of materials, the selection of materials, the information service, what you do for
people, and so on. So it looks like what had happened was that the school was given a new name
and a new orientation but at the heart of the school was still a visibly similar professional core.
What people would do for people would be recognizably the same kind of stuff.” 297 From 1995
to 2017 the only two schools of library education in California were at San Jose and UCLA.
Since 1986, UCLA has been the only library school left standing in Southern California which
has been in continuous operation since its founding.
When Edward Dickson founded UCLA one thing that was of utmost importance to him
was the placement of a founder's rock to give a sense of establishment and permanency of place.
According to Sumner, “He had this terrible passion down there for instant tradition. You can’t
get instant tradition, but he wouldn’t recognize that. He tried hard. That’s why he wanted
founder’s rock, that’s why he wanted a senior row of trees, why he wanted all these things,

297

Wilson, "Philosopher of Information,” 208.
82

because he harped back to Berkeley with its tremendously older traditions.” 298 Throughout his
lifetime, Edward Dickson displayed as strong an adherence to the “School of Library” as he did
founder's rock, yet tragically his life was cut short before he ever had the chance to see it. One
cannot doubt that were Dickson alive to have read the articles of Bennett and Lewis that he
would have had quite the impactful response, given his reputation as a banker, businessman,
anti-communist, Regent, and adamant supporter of the Library School and Lawrence Clark
Powell. One can only speculate his reaction, as one may only speculate Dickson's reaction to
UCLA today and all that the library school has become. Now doubt he would be proud to see the
bustling campus he had envisioned having grown even larger and more populated than he had
ever seen, and to see that his “School of the Library” has weathered the decades including a
rocky start with angry critics and a time of decommissioning which later plagued the other,
previously-established schools. One only can hope that the library school at UCLA may be seen
as a fragment of the founder’s rock, in that, in a way, it is a fragment of the very core of one of
its most notable founders’ vision as well as of his very being. In light of its significance in the
scope of legacy, history, and in librarianship as both a profession and an academic discipline,
should the discussion of its decommissioning or dismissal of ALA accreditation ever arise at
UCLA, it is hoped that such talk be strongly reconsidered.
