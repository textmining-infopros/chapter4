DIGITAL CURATION THROUGH THE LENS OF DISCIPLINARITY
THE DEVELOPM ENT OF AN EMERGING FIELD
Patricia Beasley Condon
Simmons College School o f Library and Information Science
ABSTRACT
Digital curation is both maturing within the information disciplines and becoming
increasingly embedded in practice. We are observing an increase in employment opportunities,
education and training, and research in the area o f digital curation. However, it is still unclear
how and where the transmission o f this knowledge and skills set fits within higher education.
The purpose o f this study was to explore the development o f digital curation as an academic field
by conducting an in-depth analysis o f how this area is evolving. The research questions
addressed were: Is digital curation emerging as an autonomous discipline? Where does digital
curation fit within the educational landscape?
The methodologies employed were scoping the literature, content analysis o f published
literature in the area o f digital curation, and interviews with individuals engaged in the area. In
this dissertation, the conceptual model put forth by D ’Agostino (2012), which views a discipline
as the interaction o f ten elements that characterize a discipline interpreted within a framework o f
“shallow consensus” was used. Five key themes emerged from the data analysis: terminology,
collaboration, multiple discipline engagement, education, and areas o f professional and scholarly
focus. Findings suggest that digital curation has not emerged as an autonomous discipline, but
does meet several o f the criteria to indicate its potential for emergence. Although education for
this area fits well in coordination with the information disciplines, skill development is important
across all domains. This study provided markers for gauging the progress o f digital curation as
an emerging field.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Digital curation is both maturing within the information disciplines and becoming
increasingly embedded in practice. Defined broadly in this study, digital curation involves the
active lifecycle management o f data for current and future use (the definition o f digital curation
is discussed in more detail in the Delimitations section o f this chapter, the Curation Community
section in Chapter Four, and in the Terminology section in Chapter Six). As the creation and use
o f digital information become ubiquitous, it is increasingly acknowledged that data require
lifecycle management for their long-term accessibility and preservation. Data are defined by the
United Kingdom-based Digital Curation Centre (DCC) as “any information in binary digital
form” including databases, simple digital objects such as text or image files, and complex digital
objects such as websites (Digital Curation Centre, n.d.a). This definition encompasses materials
such as digital cultural heritage; research and scientific data in the natural, physical, and social
sciences; and business, government, and personal digital information.
The area o f digital curation has emerged rapidly within professional and research
practice, more rapidly than higher education curricula or professional training have been able, for
the most part, to establish coherent approaches to instruction. As practitioners and researchers
develop fundamental best practices and procedures for the lifecycle management o f data, the
educational and skill requirements for professionals in digital curation and related areas
continues to be defined and refined (Kim, Warga, & Moen, 2013; Osswald, 2013). There has
been progress in developing core curriculum models for higher education and professional
training programs. M ost notably, comprehensive curriculum frameworks were developed by two
international projects, the Digital Curator Vocational Education Europe project (DigCurV,
hup: u \\ u .iliucur-cducatinn.orii), and the Digital Curation Curriculum Project (DigCCurr,

hu p: \\ \\ u .iK m w .a iu Jiii.vvi.irr) at the University o f North Carolina at Chapel Hill, both which
concluded in 2013.
Within archival studies, and library and information science (LIS) programs, there are
expanding degree-granting and continuing education programs offering advanced certificates,
concentrations, courses, and training in the area o f digital curation. In fact, 1 found no less than
10 million dollars in grants has been awarded from 2010 to 2014 by the Institute o f Museum and
Library Services (IMLS) through the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program for projects in
the United States that are specifically designed to improve training opportunities and build
curricula for continuing and higher education programs in curation and management o f materials
in a digital environment ( http: v\\v\\.im K »o\ recipients granlseareh.aspy). This sum only
includes projects related to the development and improvement o f education and training for
digital curation and related areas. There were numerous other funded projects involving
implementation and applied research.
Statement o f the Problem
Some indicators suggest that digital curation is emerging as an area distinct from other
fields or disciplines. There have been advances in best practices, visible growth in higher and
continuing education curricula offering both coursework and training in digital curation, and
considerable grant funding for applied research, educational programming, and practical
implementation in digital curation and related areas. In fact, a 2011 article published in the

International Journal o f Digital Curation (Higgins, 2011), proposes that digital curation has
emerged as a new discipline. In the article, Higgins outlines the emergence o f a digital
preservation infrastructure in the United Kingdom starting in the mid-1990s, the steady increase
o f international preservation development projects and agendas, and the growth o f education and

2

training opportunities in digital curation. Higgins suggests that “through the iterative workshop
and agenda setting process'" (p. 84) digital curation has made great strides in establishing itself as
a new discipline.
However, identifying digital curation as a newly emerged discipline may be premature.
Becoming a discipline requires a certain degree o f embeddedness and institutionalization within
higher education. Digital curation is at least equally embedded in practice. Although there is a
visible growth in educational programs, it is still unclear how the education for this knowledge
and skills set fits within the educational landscape. The answer to this uncertainty hinges on
whether digital curation is emerging as, for example, a discipline in its own right, a specialization
within the information disciplines, or as a set o f interdisciplinary best practices employed by
those who work with digital assets. No study has provided an in-depth analysis into this matter.
Insight gained from such a study will be useful for stakeholders, including educators and
practitioners, seeking to understand the environment in which the knowledge transfer o f
competencies related to digital curation takes place.
Purpose o f the Study and Research Questions
This dissertation research is designed to explore the educational landscape o f digital
curation and investigate whether the area o f digital curation is emerging as an independent
discipline in its own right. This study focuses on identifying themes that emerge from the
academic discourse and scholarly communication, and understanding the level o f consensus
among educators, practitioners, and researchers about how they view this domain. Its purpose is
to explore the character, development, and education o f the area o f digital curation by conducting
an in-depth analysis o f how this area is evolving.

3

The research questions addressed in this study are:
RQ1: Is digital curation emerging as an autonomous discipline?
a.

In what ways do interviewees describe the relationship o f digital curation to
areas within the information disciplines?

b. Are there indicators that suggest digital curation is emerging as a discipline
in its own right?
RQ2: Where does digital curation fit within the educational landscape?
a. To what extent and in what ways do interviewees express the role o f
education in the knowledge transfer o f digital curation practices, skills, and
theories?
Conceptual Framework
Academic disciplines are the interaction o f intellectual, organizational, and social
elements. In this research, I use the definition o f discipline presented by Del Favero (2003).
Academic disciplines are defined as:
Providing the structure o f knowledge in which faculty members are trained and
socialized; carry out tasks o f teaching, research, and administration; and produce research
and educational output. Disciplinary worlds are considered separate and distinct cultures
that exert varying influences on scholarly behaviors as well as on the structure o f higher
education (p. 10).
This definition captures the complexity o f a discipline and highlights the influence disciplinarity
has on how members o f the discipline are educated, socialized, and perform their research and
teaching responsibilities. In addition, it emphasizes the institutionalization o f disciplines and the
impact that differences among disciplines have on the structure o f higher education.

Emerging disciplines are characterized by organizational instability, a lack o f coherent
discourse, and a struggle for legitimacy within higher education. Governance and leadership are
not clearly defined. The intellectual, research, and teaching domains "often sit uncomfortably
between existing academic institutional boundaries” (Kimbell, 2009, p. 3). The power and social
structures o f emerging disciplines are viewed as unstable, marked by a lack o f consensus and
shared norms (Maguire, Hardy, & Lawrence, 2004).
There exists an extensive body o f research on academic disciplines. The process o f
convergence, differentiation, fragmentation, and specialization o f disciplines into subdisciplines
and new disciplines is a complex process involving intellectual, organizational, and social
changes. Criteria for identifying that a field has emerged as a new discipline are not wellestablished; however, several researchers have put forward useful sets o f criteria. Although the
criteria vary in presentation, they provide similar elements o f assessment that take into account
institutional and intellectual aspects that aim to get at the dynamic qualities o f a discipline.
In this dissertation, I use the conceptual model put forth by D ’Agostino (2012) that views
a discipline as a cultural system: the interaction o f elements that characterize a discipline
interpreted within a framework o f “shallow consensus” (p. 341). In D ’Agostino’s model, a
discipline is made up o f an intellectual field o f inquiry and institutional infrastructure.
D ’Agostino derived from the literature a set o f ten elements that comprise a discipline within
these two domains (Table 1.1). This set o f elements “represents, if nothing more, a good starting
point for further enquiry, implying, as it does, a checklist o f questions which we might raise
about a discipline or ‘w annabe’ discipline” (p. 337). The ten elements each contain more
granular observable criteria. In presenting these elements, D ’Agostino is “claiming that there is
wide acceptance of, commitment to, or use of, these elements by a community o f enquiry whose

D 'Agostino contends that although we can define a discipline in terms o f it meeting the
criteria, we must also contextualize the development o f the discipline historically and accept that
members o f the discipline may have varying interpretations o f what each element embodies.
D ’Agostino uses the phrase shallow consensus to denote the varying degrees o f agreement that
members o f the same discipline share about their discipline or aspects o f their discipline.
Shallow consensus permits a definition o f disciplines using rigid criteria and still tolerates
internal variation within the discipline. It is within this social framework o f shallow consensus
and the historical context o f the area’s development that we understand how the elements o f a
discipline came to be organized and represented as they are. Chapter Four provides an historical
narrative o f the development and emergence o f digital curation. This narrative contextualizes the
themes and their corresponding disciplinary elements that are presented in the Findings and
Discussion chapters.
Overview o f Research Design
This dissertation employs a qualitative multimethod research design. The methodologies
used in this dissertation were scoping the literature, content analysis o f published literature in the
area o f digital curation, and interviews with individuals engaged in the area. First, I conducted a
broad, comprehensive, and systematic survey o f the literature related to the area o f digital
curation. Next, I conducted content analysis using a standardized coding instrument on a
selection o f the literature surveyed (n=460). Then, I conducted fourteen interviews with
individuals identified from scoping the literature. Lastly, the units o f analysis from the content
analysis and interview transcripts were coded using an open coding framework in NVivo
qualitative analysis software.

7

The initial step in the data collection process was a broad and systematic scoping the
literature related to the area o f digital curation. This survey was designed to be comprehensive
in order to gain a holistic representation o f the literature associated with the development and
current practice o f the area o f digital curation. There were four objectives o f this survey. First, 1
used the survey to broadly describe and characterize the literature relating to the area o f digital
curation. Second, I used the results o f the survey to delineate the population from which the
sample was taken for the content analysis. Third. I used the results o f the survey to identify
participants for interviews. Lastly, 1 used the literature that was collected during the survey to
compile a narrative o f the development o f the area and conduct a literature review on education
and curriculum development in the area o f digital curation.
From scoping the literature, I identified three subsets o f literature for the content analysis.
The content analysis probes in depth the International Journal o f Digital Curation (n=237; 20062012), conferences presentations (n=53; 2001-2012; search term s digital curation and digital

stewardship ), and the top 5% most frequently cited articles in Scopus and Web o f Science
(n=l 70; 2001-2012; search terms: data archiving, data curation, data preservation, data

stewardship, digital archiving, digital curation, digital preservation, and digital stewardship).
For the content analysis, a total o f 460 articles, editorials, conference posters and presentations,
and research papers were coded. The data from the content analysis were recorded using a
standardized spreadsheet coding instrument.
From scoping the literature, I identified participants for the interviews. Three selection
criteria were applied to identify the participants: interviewees must have displayed active
engagement in the area o f digital curation discourse and community within the past year;
interviewees must have been involved or working with digital materials in some capacity related

8

to digital curation for at least five years; and collectively, participants had to make up a diverse,
international panel. Fourteen participants were interviewed, at which point no new or relevant
information was emerging from the interviews. The interview protocol was based on a set o f
predetermined open-ended questions that were flexible enough to allow for follow-up questions,
probing, and pursuing topics that naturally arose during the interview but structured enough to
address the object o f this research. Interviews were conducted via telephone (3) or Skype (11)
and each took approximately 60 minutes.
Data collection, analysis, and discussion o f the research questions were structured using
the conceptual framework as a guide. Interview transcripts and the abstracts from the content
analysis samples were coded using NVivo. The coding scheme included both emergent (datadriven) and pre-defmed (research- and theory-driven) codes. For the analysis, I mapped the
emergent codes to the pre-defmed codes that were defined by the conceptual framework. This
was in addition to the fixed bibliometric coding scheme that was used for the content analysis as
mentioned above.
Limitations
There are four limitations that have the greatest potential impact on the quality o f the data
and their effectiveness at addressing the research questions. First, purposive sampling was used
in this study rather than a randomized sampling method. Non-probability sampling restricts
generalization o f the findings because the sample is not necessarily representative o f the
population. Purposive sample is common in qualitative research designs. Second, the sample
for the content analysis is limited by the materials available. Discourse in the area o f digital
curation includes community-based publications and grey literature. They are more difficult to
locate via conventional searching methods and not accessible in citation databases. This has the

potential to impede the selection o f units o f analysis for the content analysis as well as the
selection o f possible participants for the interviews. Third, in the library and information science
fields publishing trends differ between scholars and practitioners (Schlogl & Stock. 2008:
Haddow & Klobas, 2004; Powell, Baker, & Mika, 2002), and this difference may very well be
present in digital curation publications. Additionally, publishing trends differ among disciplines.
Because the sample selection for both the content analysis and the interview participants relies
heavily on published materials, these differences have the potential to impact the sample. Lastly
all interviews were conducted in English and samples for the content analysis were limited to
articles or presentations written in English. These limitations are discussed in more detail in
Chapter Nine.
Delimitations
1 have chosen to investigate whether digital curation is emerging as a discipline rather
than whether it is. for example, a community o f practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991: Wenger.
McDermott, & Snyder, 2002), an emergent profession (or semi-profession) (Abbott, 1988;
Freidson, 1999; Bastian & Yakel, 2005), or a field o f research (Fensham, 2004). Several key
criteria for digital curation to be considered a profession are visibly missing, specifically the
existence o f a professional association and community sanction either by licensure or educational
requirements (Chatterjee & Stevenson, 2008). Researching digital curation as an emergent
discipline allows for its professionalization and status as a community o f practice or field o f
research to be at least tangentially addressed in this study. Additionally, focusing on
disciplinarity embeds the discussion o f digital curation within higher education.
I have chosen to approach this research using the term digital curation as designation o f
an area, which is sometimes defined or referred to using terms such as data curation , data

10

stewardship . digital preservation , and digital stewardship. Each o f these terms expresses a
particular nuance in their meaning and use, which I explore in this study.

I define digital

curation broadly as involving the active lifecycle management and preservation o f data for
current and future use. Using a broad definition allows me to capture the breadth and depth o f
the area without getting distracted by ambiguous terminology. The year 2001 was selected for
scoping the literature and content analysis because that is the year that the term "digital curation”
was coined (Beagrie. 2006). This date is significant if we assume that K uhn’s concept o f
paradigm and lexicon bears some relevance - the existing taxonomy was not adequate to explain
the phenomenon and therefore a new term was coined to account for the changes that were
occurring. Additionally, although the relationship between digital curation and digital libraries,
digitization, or electronic records management will be explored, articles about these three topics
without some reference to the larger vision o f digital curation are not included in the analyses.
Significance o f Study
Reflection on the scholarly and societal position o f emerging fields is a familiar theme.
Some fields such as communication, cultural studies, nursing, and women’s studies have lengthy
histories o f reflexivity about the nature o f their status as an independent discipline within higher
education often emphasizing that their field possesses standard characteristics o f a discipline (see
During, 2006; Craig, 2008; Boxer, 2000). More established fields, although perhaps still new
compared to the traditional natural and social sciences, often focus on exhibiting the historical
development and legitimacy o f their discipline rather than on demonstrating that standard
elements o f a discipline are present (see Bender & Schorske, 1998; Lemaine, MacLeod, Mulkay,
& Weingart, 1976).

The information disciplines (museums studies, archives and records management, and
library and information science) are not immune to this reflection. For the information
disciplines, this reflexivitv about the nature o f their position within higher education often stems
from the challenges o f education for a practical or professional field in general. Library science
has long struggled with not only its identity as a discipline within higher education but also with
its identity as a profession (Bates, 2012; Bates, 2010; Audunson, 2007; Goode, 1961). Archives
and records management are also poised between expanding as a profession, or semi-profession,
and an academic discipline (Shepherd, 2012; Bastian & Yakel, 2006; Cox, 1986). Indeed, Bates
(1999. 2012) argued that “information science need(s) to be seen as a different type o f discipline,
in comparison to the usual array o f disciplines” (Bates, 2012, p.2). She used the term “meta­
discipline” to describe the information disciplines.
The area o f digital curation faces a similar quandary. Digital curation may be regarded as
an emerging discipline, a specialization within an existing discipline, a broadening o f a current
field such as preservation, or a set o f interdisciplinary best practices. Depending on how digital
curation is perceived by its community and how it is positioned within higher education and
practice determines important features o f the education and training o f digital curation practices,
skills, and theories. Aspects such as the environment in which it is taught, for example
continuing education and training workshops or degree-granting higher education programs;
which disciplines or fields are most aligned with the area; and who is responsible for instruction
and who needs to receive instruction are ascertained by understanding how the area is maturing.
This study provides insight into the development o f the area o f digital curation.
The impact o f having a field identified as an independent discipline can have many
significant advantages. For example, it increases the stability and legitimacy o f the field within

12

higher education institutions: it allows for greater potential to obtain financial resources: and it
provides the discipline with the autonomy to develop curriculum, train students, and select
doctoral students for the continuation o f the discipline. This study is useful for stakeholders who
seek to understand the current educational landscape o f digital curation, and its position among
the information disciplines and within higher education.
Additionally, this research contributes to the literature about the emergence o f disciplines
and furthers our understanding o f the educational complexities accompanying that potential
emergence. Although the focus o f this study is an in-depth analysis o f digital curation, it
approaches the analysis uniquely by first applying a recently published model o f disciplinaritv
and then honing in on what the current identity o f digital curation means for knowledge transfer.

CHAPTER 2: RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
In this chapter I describe the research design and methodology used in this dissertation.
This study employed a qualitative multimethod research design. The methodologies employed
were scoping the literature, content analysis o f literature related to digital curation themes, and
interviews with people engaged in the area o f digital curation. I developed the coding instrument
and interview protocol to collect data about the elements that characterize a discipline based on
the criteria established by the conceptual framework that was identified from the literature
review (see Chapter Three).
Principles and practices related to the lifecycle management and long-term preservation o f
data are increasingly relevant for information professionals and researchers working with digital
assets. We are observing an increase in employment opportunities, education and training, and
research in the area o f digital curation. Some indicators suggest that digital curation is more than
a set o f practices and skills; rather it is emerging as an autonomous discipline. The purpose o f
this study is to explore the academic position o f digital curation and what it means to be an
emerging discipline. Insight gained from this study will be useful for stakeholders seeking to
understand the position o f digital curation among the information disciplines and within higher
education.
The research questions addressed in this study are:
RQ1: Is digital curation emerging as an autonomous discipline?
a.

In what ways do interviewees describe the relationship o f digital curation to
areas within the information disciplines?

b. Are there indicators that suggest digital curation is emerging as a discipline in
its own right?

15

RQ2: Where does digital curation fit within the educational landscape?
a. To what extent and in what ways do interviewees express the role o f
education in the knowledge transfer o f digital curation practices, skills, and
theories?
This chapter is organized in three main sections. The first section. Research Design,
discusses the study’s qualitative multimethod research approach. The next section,
Methodology, details the strategies o f inquiry and data collection techniques employed in this
study, as well as descriptions o f the samples. The final section o f the chapter, Data Analysis,
focuses on the treatment and analysis o f the data.
Research Design
The first part o f this study comprised literature-based investigations. A review o f
relevant literature was conducted to provide a context for understanding academic disciplines,
explore what it means to be an emerging discipline, and establish criteria for identifying
disciplines (Chapter Three). This literature review engages material from multiple disciplines,
referencing publications across many domains. Then, the database that was compiled from the
results o f scoping the literature was used to inform a narrative o f the development o f the area o f
digital curation (Chapter Four) and a literature review about digital curation education and
curriculum development (Chapter Five). Together, these three chapters provide a backdrop on
which the findings, discussion, and conclusion are contextualized.
The second part o f this study comprised primary data collection using a qualitative
multimethod research design. Qualitative research is suitable for the exploration and holistic
description o f complex phenomena. The aim o f qualitative research is to “make sense of, or to
interpret, phenomena in terms o f the meanings people bring to them” (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005,

16

p. 3). Compared to quantitative studies, samples sizes in qualitative research tend to be smaller
and purposively selected. In qualitative approaches, the data are less structured and data
collection is more flexible and inductive than in quantitative strategies (Guest, MacQueen, &
Namey, 2011). Data collected is usually text, images, or sounds (i.e. not numbers) and analysis
requires ‘'close reading" to uncover contextual meaning and identification o f patterns. Findings
tend not to be generalizable but rather potentially transferable to different settings.
In a qualitative multimethod approach, the researcher collects, analyzes, and integrates
data from more than one qualitative strategy o f inquiry or data collection technique within a
single study. In multimethod research, the investigator does not mix qualitative and quantitative
approaches but employs more than one data collection method or more than one strategy o f
inquiry ffom within the same type o f approach, qualitative or quantitative, to address the
research questions (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003). This differs from mixed method research
designs, in which the researcher combines qualitative and quantitative strategies o f inquiry and
data collection techniques (Creswell & Clark, 2007; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003).
The rationale for using a multimethod research design is to improve the trustworthiness,
or reliability and validity, o f the study through triangulation; to offset the weaknesses o f each
individual method; and to provide a more complete picture o f the research problem.
Triangulation involves collecting data from multiple sources or using multiple methods to
ascertain if the various forms o f data converge to support similar findings (Kopinak, 1999). This
technique is used to improve confidence in the findings and support the credibility,
dependability, and confirmability o f the research (Krefting, 1991; Jonsen & Jehn, 2009).
Employing multiple research methodologies or the collection o f multiple forms o f data also acts
to offset the weaknesses and balance the strengths inherent in the individual approaches. For

17

example, content analysis describes what text reveals, but may not explain the underlying
motivation or behavior in the patterns observed; whereas interviews provide explanations o f the
meanings behind actions. Used together, the researcher is able to observe not only what patterns
emerge but why the patterns are emerging. Another example is that interviews involve
interpersonal relationships which may be challenging to replicate or unintentionally bias the data,
whereas content analysis is designed to be unobtrusive and potentially replicable. Lastly, a
single method is often not sufficient to capture the trends and details o f a complex phenomenon
such as the potential emergence o f digital curation as an autonomous discipline. Using a
multimethod approach provides more variety o f detail and different levels o f perspective in the
analysis (Kopinak, 1999).
M ethodology
This research employed three methodologies: scoping o f the literature, content analysis,
and interviews. Scoping studies are a broad stroke survey o f the literature. According to Arksey
and O ’Malley (2005), there are four different reasons for conducting scoping studies: “to
examine the extent, range, and nature o f research activity; to determine the value o f undertaking
a full systematic review; to summarize and disseminate research findings; or to identify gaps in
the existing literature” (p. 21). Scoping studies are distinct from systematic reviews in that they
do not usually assess the quality or examine each study in depth. Rather scoping studies
summarize the extent o f the domain by mapping the breadth o f the literature (Levac, Colquhoun
& O ’Brien, 2010).
Content analysis has its foundation as a research methodology in mass communication.
Krippendorff (2013) defines content analysis as “a research technique for making replicable and
valid inferences from texts (or other meaningful matter) to the contexts o f their use” (p. 24). Elo

and Kyngds (2008) build on that definition and identify that “the aim [of content analysis] is to
attain a condensed and broad description o f the phenomenon, and the outcome o f the analysis is
concepts or categories describing the phenomenon” (p. 108). Using this methodology,
inferences about patterns and themes are made through the examination o f the record (White &
Marsh, 2006).
For content analysis employed in this study, qualitative data is collected and findings are
presented both qualitatively and quantitatively. There is a tendency to present content analysis
as either a qualitative or quantitative research methodology. This dichotomy is debated in the
literature (see Krippendorff, 2013; Zhang & Wildemuth, 2009; Elo & Kyngas, 2008; Neuendorf,
2002; Holsti, 1968). Krippendorff (2013) questions the value o f distinguishing between
quantitative and qualitative content analysis: “Ultimately, all reading o f texts is qualitative, even
when certain characteristics o f a text are later converted into numbers” (p. 22). Creswell and
Clark (2007) consider it a “gray area” and explain that in a typical content analysis a researcher
collects qualitative data and analyzes the data both qualitatively and quantitatively (p. 12).
The interviews consisted o f focused, semi-structured interviews with individuals engaged
in digital curation and related areas. The aim o f the interview is to understand behaviors,
experiences, facts, and meanings from the point o f view o f the respondent. Kvale and
Brinkmann (2009) lay out ten key features o f interviews including that the interviews are a social
interaction; they are focused on the research topic but flexible in their structure; the interview is
conducted in a manner that encourages description o f specific situations rather than general
opinions and strives to reduce ambiguity through follow-up and clarification; and the researcher
is open to new and unanticipated themes rather than imposing predetermined categories onto
phenomena (p. 30-32).

19

Scoping the literature, content analysis, and interviews are suitable methodologies to
address the research questions o f this study. As described in detail in the next chapter,
disciplines are the interaction between intellectual, organizational, and social structures. Two o f
the essential mechanisms o f this interaction are communication and consensus. Several theorists
view scholarly publications as facilitating and mediating disciplinary communication (Stichweh,
2001; Hyland, 2004). Hyland (2004) explains:
In academic fields this means that texts embody the social negotiations o f disciplinary
inquiry, revealing how knowledge is constructed, negotiated and made persuasive. Rather
than simply examining nature, writing is actually seen as helping to create a view o f the
world. This is because texts are influenced by the problems, social practices and ways o f
thinking o f particular social groups. In other words, discourse is socially constitutive
rather than simply socially shaped; writing is not ju st another aspect o f what goes on in the
disciplines, it is seen as producing them. (p. 3)
Consensus, or the level o f agreement among scholars within a discipline, is an underlying
factor o f most o f the conceptual frameworks for modeling our understanding o f disciplines and
emerging disciplines. Scoping the literature provides a summary view o f the area’s discourse.
Content analysis uncovers patterns and themes found in scholarly communication while
interviews reveal how these patterns are understood by members o f the community. These
methodologies expose communication patterns and levels o f consensus among scholars.
Scoping the Literature
The initial step in the data collection process was a comprehensive survey o f the literature
relating to the area o f digital curation. There were four objectives o f this survey. First, I used
the survey to broadly describe and characterize the literature relating to the area o f digital

20

curation. Second, I used the results o f the survey to delineate the population from which the
sample was taken for the content analysis. Third, I used the results o f the survey to identify
participants for interviews. Lastly, I used the literature that was collected during the survey to
compile a narrative o f the development o f the area and conduct a literature review on education
and curriculum development in the area o f digital curation.
The process implemented for scoping the literature was adapted from the method for
performing systematic literature reviews (Jesson, Matheson, & Lacey, 2011) and was designed to
be comprehensive, methodical, and transparent (see Table 2.1 for a summary o f the approach).
This survey was broad and inclusive in order to gain a holistic representation o f the literature
associated with the development and knowledge base o f the area o f digital curation. The survey
included practical and scholarly articles, books, conference papers and presentations, reports, and
white papers that discuss concepts and practices related to digital curation. Literature searches
were conducted primarily using vendor libraries and databases available through Simmons
College Library, and supplemented with the journals listed on the Digital Curation Centre
website ( h t t p : u u u . d c c . a c . u k r e s o u r c e s c u r a t i o i i - i o i i r n a l s ). An exhaustive list o f search terms
was used to conduct this survey. See Appendix A for the literature databases, search fields, and
complete list o f search terms used in scoping the literature.

Description o f th e Sample. Scoping the literature consisted o f two parts. The first part
was a comprehensive, systematic search across 50 databases using 98 search terms (see
Appendix A). The result was an EndNote database o f bibliographic information for the 50,476
articles that were retrieved. The results included books, conference proceedings, dissertation and
theses, journal articles, and reports. Excluded from the results were newspaper articles and
patents. The date coverage for the entire database was 1957-2014 and comprised articles across
all domains. The relevancy o f the results varied among the results o f different search terms and
even within the results o f the same search term. The EndNote database was used to inform the
literature-based investigations, the selection o f samples for the content analysis, and identifying
interview participants.
For the second part, eight key search terms were isolated from the results o f scoping the
literature and the date range was limited to 2001-2012. The key search term s were: data

archiving, data curation, data preservation, data stewardship, digital archiving, digital curation,
digital preservation, and digital stewardship. For this subset, 5,579 items were retrieved and a
more detailed analysis was conducted.
Interviews
Purposive sampling was used to select interviewees who offered a particular expertise,
insight, or perspective concerning this study’s research purpose. Weiss (2008) explains that
many interview studies use “panels o f knowledgeable informants” rather than samples that
represent the population (p. 17). The panels are made up o f “people who are uniquely able to be
informative” and “view [the] topic from different perspectives or who know about different
aspects o f it” (p. 17).

23

The participants for this study were selected to provide a diverse array o f outlooks on this
research. The panel o f interviewees was designed to contain an international representation; a
variety o f roles (for example, educators, practitioners, or participants in research and
development); a mixture o f disciplinary backgrounds; and a range o f topical interests in the area
(for example, biocuration, data publishing and sharing, or digital preservation).
Fourteen purposively selected interview participants were identified first through
suggestions made by my dissertation committee and then supplemented by authors that emerged
from the literature survey results. Selection o f interview participants had to meet three criteria:
1. Participants must have displayed engagement in discourse, education, or research
related to digital curation within the past year. For example, potential participants
must have published research in a journal or presented research at a conference
related to digital curation; taught coursework, continuing education, or training
workshops related to digital curation; or have participated in a collaborative project
related to digital curation. This criterion was established to ensure that interviewees
were active members o f communities engaged in digital curation and related areas.
2. Participants must have been involved or working with digital materials in some
capacity related to digital curation for at least five years. This criterion was
established so that the interviewees would have a longitudinal view o f the area.
3. Collectively, participants had to make up a diverse, international panel. The area o f
digital curation is often assumed to be a global and multi-discipline challenge
(McGovern & Skinner, 2012; Constantopoulos et al., 2009; Rusbridge et al., 2005).
This criterion was established to account for this assumption. Diversity was achieved

24

by including participants with different nationalities, disciplinary backgrounds,
professional roles, and types o f organization o f employment.
Description o f the Sample. The interview participants presented diverse and
international perspectives on this study’s area o f interest. Fourteen people engaged in the area
digital curation were interviewed. Table 2.2 identifies the interview participants by country o f
employment and type o f organization in which they were employed.

Interviewees were employed as administrators, educators, and practitioners in eight
different countries. There were five female and nine male interview participants. All
participants had been involved in their area related to digital curation for at least seven years and
had a minimum o f a M aster’s level education. H alf o f the participants held PhDs. The
backgrounds o f the interviewees included archaeology, archival science, biology, computer
science, information technology, library and information science, and physics. Interviewees
were employed at funding agencies; national, private, and regional archives or libraries; physical
and social science data archives; research centers; and universities. Interviewees identified
themselves as occupying roles such as administrator, advocate, archivist, biocurator, data curator,
digital archivist, educator, preservation specialist, and project manager.
Interview Procedure and Protocol. All o f the interviews followed the same procedure.
Potential participants were sent an email inviting her/him to participate in the study. The email
introduced the researcher and the purpose o f the study, and described the details o f the
interviewee’s participation. A copy o f the informed consent form was included as an attachment
with the invitation email. Interviews were scheduled during December 2013 and January 2014
for those individuals who replied to the email expressing interest in participating. Interviews
were conducted via telephone (3) or Skype (11) and each took approximately 60 minutes. Two
days before the scheduled interview, the participant was emailed a meeting reminder with the
interview guide attached for her/his review. All interviews were recorded using an Olympus
DM-620 digital recorder to help ensure accurate transcriptions. Transcriptions o f the interviews
were outsourced to a local service in Boston, MA who signed a confidentiality agreement. All
correspondence and interviews were conducted in English.

26

The focused, semi-structured interviews were guided by a written interview protocol (see
Appendix B). The interview protocol was based on a set o f predetermined open-ended questions
that was flexible enough to allow for follow-up questions, probing, and pursuing topics that
naturally arose during the conversation. The interview protocol in this study was developed
using a model presented by W engraf (2001) (Table 2.3). W engraf identifies a three step model
in which interview questions are derived from theoretical questions which are derived from the
study’s overarching research question. W engraf explains that “the [theoretical questions] are
formulated in the theory-language o f the research community, and the [interview questions] are
formulated in the language o f the interviewee’’ (p. 62). The assumption o f the model is that the
interview questions provide the data for the researcher to address the theoretical question, which
taken together assist the researcher in answering the research question. Additionally, some o f the
interview questions were adapted from research discussed in the literature review (see Fensham,
2004; Phillips, 2003).
Ethical Considerations. This research was approved by the Simmons College
Institutional Review Board (study number 13-028) on October 24, 2013 and was conducted to
meet high ethical standards. As the researcher, I completed the Simmons College human
subjects research investigator web-based training for minimal risk research through the CITI
(Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) Program. To protect the confidentiality and
privacy o f the interviewees, each is only identified by her/his geographical region and general
professional role. Additionally, informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Content Analysis
Content analysis is a systematic process. The content analysis conducted in this study
follows the procedure outlined below (see Leedy & Ormrod, 2010; Zhang & Wildemuth, 2009;
White and Marsh, 2006; Neuendorf, 2002). First, based on the study’s research questions, the
content to be analyzed was identified. The population and sampling method were defined, the
unit o f analysis was determined, and the sample was drawn. Next, categories o f inquiry and
coding scheme were established and the codebook was prepared. The coding scheme was
piloted, assessed for consistency, and the coding process was adjusted as necessary. Then,
records were systematically reviewed and data were recorded according to the coding scheme.
The data were then summarized, patterns were identified, and research questions addressed, and
findings from the content analysis were related to previous research or conceptual framework.
Description o f Sample. Purposively selected subsets o f the literature were investigated
in depth using content analysis. A sample was selected that represented factors that characterize
the emergence o f disciplines. Three subsets were used as samples: the International Journal o f

Digital Curation (n=237; 2006-2012); conference papers and posters retrieved in the literature
survey using the search terms digital curation and digital stewardship (n=53; 2001-2012); and
the top 5% most highly cited articles in Scopus and Web o f Science using the main search terms

data archiving, data curation, data preservation, data stewardship, digital archiving, digital
curation, digital preservation, and digital stewardship (n=170; 2001-2012). The year 2001 was
selected as the start date because the phrase “digital curation” was coined in that year (Beagrie,
2006, p.4). The unit o f analysis for the content analysis was individual articles, conferences
papers or posters, editorials, research papers, and reports. For the content analysis, 460 units o f
analysis were coded (see Appendix D for bibliographies o f the content analysis samples).

29

The International Journal o f Digital Curation {IJDC) was selected because journals
“provide authorized outlets for contributions to the literature o f the field” (D ’Agostino, 2012, p.
335). Although several journals publish articles and research relevant to digital curation topics,
the IJDC is the first journal dedicated to publishing articles, news, and research on the curation
o f digital assets and related issues.

In discussing the role o f journals in scholarly communities,

Solomon (2007) notes that “a hallmark o f a discipline’s coming o f age is the establishment o f a
new journal: in essence, staking out the intellectual territory o f the new field” (p. 3). IJDC was
established in 2006 by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC), a leading organization in the United
Kingdom that provides expertise in data management, and digital preservation and curation
activities. The IJDC is an online, biannual, open access journal published twice annually, with
the exception o f three issues in 2009 and one in 2010 and 2006. The journal publishes peerreviewed research papers and non-peer-reviewed general articles (see Table 2.4 for details o f the
sample). Submission is open, but many published items were first presented at the International
Digital Curation Conferences.

Conferences are another sanctioned channel o f communication and contribution within
disciplines. They support both formal and informal network-building, make public current and

30

emergent research, and “foster in individuals an affiliative identity with the discipline”
(D ’Agostino, 2012, p. 334). Conference paper and poster presentations were selected from the
results o f scoping the literature (see Table 2.5 for details o f the sample). The sample
concentrated on presentations that were retrieved using the search terms digital curation and

digital stewardship to create a manageable sample size that honed in on content created by
communities that specifically employ this terminology. Focusing on these two search terms
provided a narrower sample that was mostly influenced by the information fields and to some
degree the technology fields.

Twenty-nine conferences were represented in the sample. The International Conference
on Theory and Practice o f Digital Libraries (formerly the European Conference on Research and
Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries, ECDL), IS&T Archiving Conference, Joint
Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL), and the iConference, accounted for almost half o f the
papers in the sample.
Highly cited articles were selected because citations are another means o f communication
and network-building, a measure o f validation o f research findings or ideas, and are an indication
o f the level o f contribution within a field (Lucio-Arias & Leydesdorff, 2009; Bommann. de
Moya-Anegon, & Leydesdorff, 2010). Citations can be useful indicators o f trends in scholarly
31

communication and the diffusion o f disciplinary knowledge “by paying homage to pioneers,
identifying original publications, providing background reading and alerting readers to
forthcoming works” (Meho, 2007, p. 3). The most frequently cited articles germane to the area
o f digital curation were identified in Scopus and Web o f Science. These included articles and
research papers, conference presentations, and editorials that had been cited in those databases
seven or more times (see Table 2.6 for details o f the sample). Limiting the sample to the top 5%
allowed for a manageable sample size that was also large enough to include articles from an
array o f disciplinary perspectives.
Using the key search terms data archiving, data curation, data preservation, data

stewardship, digital archiving, digital curation, digital preservation, and digital stewardship, a
total o f 3,383 unique items were retrieved. O f these, the 215 that were cited seven or more
times, according to the citation counts in the databases, were collected. Forty-three o f those
articles were determined to be not substantively relevant to the area o f digital curation and two o f
the articles were in German. The remaining 170 (the top 5% most cited articles) included 127
unique journal or conference titles. The articles represented a range o f disciplines and
subdisciplines within the broad fields o f archival studies, museums studies, and library and
information science; computer science, engineering, information technology, and mathematics;
and the life, physical, and social sciences.

Data Collection. Data collection for the content analysis took place over the fourmonth period o f December 2013 through March 2014. A coding instrument was developed for
the content analysis. The coding instrument consisted o f a codebook and corresponding data
collection form. The codebook was drafted to record definitions o f codes and to ensure
consistent coding (see Appendix C). A corresponding standardized data collection form created
in Microsoft Excel was used to record data about each unit o f analysis. The data collection form
consisted o f basic bibliometric variables about each unit o f analysis including data about the
publication source, authorship, disciplinary perspective, and subject focus. Each unit o f analysis
was examined in turn. In many cases, it was possible to assign values in the coding instrument
from the abstract or associated metadata. In most cases, it was necessary to skim part or all o f
the publication to assign certain codes.

T rustwort hiness
Ensuring the trustworthiness o f qualitative research is comparable to ensuring the
objectivity, reliability, and validity o f quantitative research. Guba (1981) proposed four criteria
for assessing the accuracy and consistency o f qualitative research that correspond to the more

33

broadly understood concepts used for quantitative research (see Table 2.7). Strategies for
establishing trustworthiness are addressed widely in the literature (see Shenton, 2004; Krefting,
1991; Lincoln & Cuba, 1985; Guba, 1981).

There are several ways that I addressed trustworthiness in this study. Notably, this
research was designed as a multimethod study employing three distinct research methods and
collecting data from multiple types o f sources. As mentioned above triangulation increases the
trustworthiness. Additionally, for the content analysis, intracoder reliability was assessed and a
standardized coding instrument was used. For the interviews, sessions were recorded,
transcribed, and returned to interviewees for review.
Intracoder reliability was assessed for a portion o f the content analysis. Intracoder
agreement is established when one coder makes the same coding decisions about a record at two
separate times. Intracoder agreement is effective for evaluating changes in the coding process
over time that may result from, for example, the coder’s expectations o f the data, maturation o f
the coder’s thinking, or fatigue (Neuendorf, 2002; Weber, 1990). For the purposes o f this study
a simple percent agreement was calculated. In April 2014, after coding was completed, I

34

recoded the first twenty documents that I had coded in December 2013. Intracoder agreement
was ninety-nine percent.
Employing a standardized coding scheme for data collection with pre-deflned
classifications increases the trustworthiness o f the analysis and provides a means o f replicability
(White & Marsh, 2006). A standardized coding scheme, complete with codebook and
spreadsheet-based data collection form, was used for one part o f the content analysis. The
second part o f the content analysis was coded using NVivo qualitative analysis software using a
combination o f emergent and a priori coding. The a priori codes were based on D ’Agostino’s
(2012) model o f a discipline.
There is a complex relationship between the interviewer and interviewee and my
presence had an effect on the respondents and how they engage with the phenomenon o f interest.
I used the same interview guide for all interviews. Although it was flexible enough to allow for
tailored follow-up questions, the main set o f questions was always addressed. It is important to
understand and acknowledge the role I perform in collecting and analyzing the data. In the
qualitative interviews, I act as the data collection instrument. To address issues o f bias and
trustworthiness I recorded interviews for accurate transcriptions; I took notes during the
interviews to record contemporaneous annotations; and I wrote memos documenting the research
process throughout (Shenton, 2004). Additionally, each participant had the opportunity to
review, comment on, and make corrections to the transcripts o f her/his interview. It was these
edited transcripts that were used for the final coding and analysis.
Pilot Studies
The coding instrument and interview protocol were both piloted on small samples prior to
data collection for the full study. The coding instrument for the content analysis was piloted to

35

assess the feasibility and scale o f the coding categories and sample size. The interview protocol
was piloted to assess the clarity and wording o f interview questions. The pilots also helped
identify areas with the potential for bias. Both the interview protocol and the coding instrument
were refined based on the experiences o f the pilot studies.
One o f the disadvantages o f content analysis is that it can be time-consuming depending
on the sample size and complexity o f the coding scheme. This was addressed in the pilot study.
I piloted the coding instrument for feasibility and scale using the 2010 issue o f the International

Journal o f Digital Curation which contained sixteen items. Adjustments were made to the
coding instrument based on the outcome o f the pilot. First, an attainable and effective sample
size was able to be established for the final study. Second, two changes were made to the coding
instrument. Originally, authorship codes included author name, affiliation, role, discipline, and
country for the first three authors. However, professional role and discipline were not
straightforwardly distinguishable in most cases. Those two codes were eliminated. Also,
originally, research methodology codes were going to be collected for research design,
methodology, and data collection technique. These codes were replaced with an open-coded
methodology comments option.
The interview protocol was piloted on three participants (see Table 2.8). Pilot interviews
were conducted in a similar manner as the research interviews. The main distinction was that for
the pilot interviews, participants were encouraged to comment on the interview questions. 1 was
interested in her/his answers to the questions, and also interested in observations about the clarity
o f the questions, if they seemed leading in any way, and the overall coverage o f the interview.
Based on the pilot interviews and discussions with the interviewees, the interview guide was
refined and revised. The revised interview protocol was submitted to the Simmons College IRB

36

and the changes were approved. The pilot interviews were coded using NVivo to assess the
coding procedure; however, the data were not included with the research interviews for the final
analysis.

Description o f Data Analysis
Interview transcripts and the abstracts from the content analysis samples were coded
using NVivo qualitative data analysis software. This was in addition to the bibliometric coding
scheme that was used for the content analysis as described above. Coding the units o f analysis
from the content analysis and the interview transcripts together within the same coding scheme
effectively merged data analysis for a more comprehensive presentation and interpretation o f the
findings. NVivo provides a platform that facilitates the coding process and improves the ability
to systematically extract, manage, organize, and visualize data. All content was coded in the
interview transcripts. For the units o f analysis from the content analysis, abstracts were coded
and in the absence o f an abstract, introductory sections were coded. From NVivo and the coding
instrument for the content analysis, descriptive statistics o f the samples and qualitative excerpts
were extracted.

37

NVivo was used to code both emergent and a priori codes. The primary coding scheme
was based on emergent, data-driven codes that grew organically out o f the data. A copy o f the
coding scheme is found in Appendix C. In addition, an a priori coding scheme was based on the
criteria set forth in the conceptual framework used in this study (D ’Agostino, 2012). This set o f
criteria, which was derived from previous research, was used because it provides a
comprehensive and detailed list o f elements that comprise a discipline. The emergent codes
were mapped to the a priori codes for analysis.
Data coding and analysis was an iterative process. 1 moved progressively from
unstructured, emergent themes to the refinement o f those themes and the development o f
categories to the mapping o f those categories to a priori codes. This coding process allowed for
a granular analysis o f themes emerging in the literature and the identification o f how those
themes correspond and constitute a discipline. The process for coding was largely adapted from
Hahn (2008).
For the initial coding, I conducted an unstructured thematic analysis by identifying datadriven themes and patterns that emerged from the interviews and content analysis sample. For
example, the following excerpt from an article in IJDC was initially coded as DCUDigital

Curation Process Model.
In this paper we review two recent models for digital curation introduced by the Digital
Curation Centre (DCC) and the Digital Curation Unit (DCU) o f the Athena Research
Centre. We then propose a fusion o f the two models that highlights the need to extend the
digital curation lifecycle by adding (a) provisions for the registration o f usage experience,
(b) a stage for knowledge enhancement and (c) controlled vocabularies used by
convention to denote concepts, properties and relations. (Constantopoulos, et al., 2009, p.
34)

38

This excerpt also from IDJC was coded as Preservation Network Model:
We describe the components o f a Preservation Network Model and go on to show how it
may be used to plan preservation actions according to the requirements o f the particular
situation using illustrative examples from scientific archives. (Conway. Matthews.
Giaretta, Lambert. Wilson, & Draper, 2012, p. 3)
This excerpt from an interview transcript was coded as DELOS Digital Library Reference

Model:
Interviewee 08: The reference model for digital library management system used to be
called DELOS Reference Model, is quite an interesting model for this as well. It looks
more at digital libraries, but it does look at the whole aspect o f how people gain access
and so on to this material, so obviously keeping it for something.
The second round o f coding was more focused, in which I explored the initial coding and
aggregated codes into more general categories. The above coded excerpts were combined with
other similarly coded items. General categories were created for types o f models which grouped
the above excerpts into the codes Digital Curation Models, Preservation Models, and Digital

Library Models, respectively.
The final round o f coding consisted o f refining the coding scheme into manageable final
codes. I collapsed, expanded, revised, and finalized the coding categories using the categories
from the second round as subcodes, when appropriate. The codes described above, for example,
were aggregated together into a single final code named EmergentCode Models.
Lastly, to thoroughly explore the themes that emerged from data analysis and address the
research questions, I mapped the finalized coding categories with the a priori codes established
in the conceptual framework. The EmergentCode Models code was aligned with the
disciplinary element “body o f accumulated knowledge” from the conceptual framework
(D ’Agostino, 2012). This final code informed one o f the criteria that characterizes that element,
specifically, the recognition o f conceptual and explanatory models, frameworks, and theories.
39

Summary
In this chapter, I discussed the research design and methodologies employed in this
dissertation, as well as actions taken to address ethical considerations and issues of
trustworthiness. This dissertation employs a qualitative multimethod research design. The
methodologies employed in this dissertation were scoping the literature, content analysis o f
published literature in the area o f digital curation, and semi-structured interviews with
individuals engaged in the area. This study focused on identifying themes that emerged from the
practical and scholarly discourse, and understanding the level o f consensus among educators,
practitioners, and researchers about how they view this domain. The content analysis data was
recorded using a standardized coding instrument. Units o f analysis from the content analysis and
interview transcripts were also coded together using emergent codes in NVivo. Emergent codes
were mapped to a priori codes derived from the conceptual framework.
In the next chapter, I present a review o f relevant literature related to theories o f
disciplinarity. The aim o f this literature review is to provide a context for understanding
academic disciplines, explore what it means to be an emerging discipline, and establish criteria
for identifying disciplines. The literature review provides support for the conceptual framework
used in this study.

40

CHAPTER 3: UNDERSTANDING ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES
In this chapter I review relevant literature about academic disciplines. There exists an
extensive body o f research on disctpl inarity from the fields o f education, history o f science,
philosophy, and sociology o f knowledge and science that examines the differences between and
relationships across academic disciplines as well as the internal dynamics within individual
disciplines. The function o f this literature review is to provide a context for understanding
academic disciplines, exploring what it means to be an emerging discipline, and establishing
criteria for identifying disciplines. This chapter also serves to provide support for the conceptual
framework used in this study.
This literature review is organized in three main sections. The first section, Academic
Disciplines, briefly provides an historical context for disciplinarity and then explores the
definition o f a discipline. The next section, Theories o f Disciplinarity, reviews cultural and
social theories and metaphors that have been employed for understanding disciplines, and
conceptual frameworks for classifying disciplinary differences. The final section, Emerging
Disciplines, focuses on how new disciplines emerge and criteria for identifying them.

Academic Disciplines
Although there is a long history o f academic disciplines as a means o f organizing
knowledge for teaching and learning in higher education, the structure o f the modem university
system that emerged in the nineteenth century changed the function o f disciplines and the role o f
the academic researcher. The discipline evolved from being a storehouse for disciplinary
knowledge to a complex social system o f disciplinary knowledge production. Since the
nineteenth century, “the discipline has functioned as a unit o f structure formation in the social
system o f science, in systems o f higher education, as subject domain for teaching and learning in

41

schools, and finally as the designation o f occupational and professional roles’’ (Stichweh, 2001.
p. 13727).
Beginning in the nineteenth century, higher education experienced an evolution o f its
intellectual, organizational, and social structure that had significant impact on disciplinarity. A
shift from predominantly instruction and dissemination o f knowledge to an increased emphasis
on knowledge production and discovery through original inquiry promoted the establishment o f
research universities (Rothblatt, 2001; Shumway & Messer-Davidow, 1991; Metzger, 1987). As
original research in the university setting increased, disciplinary specialization increased. In
part, specialization was a response to the growth o f scientific and technical knowledge and the
emergence o f the social sciences (Strober, 2006; Wray, 2005; Shumway & Messer-Davidow,
1991). Organization o f universities into departments, which were largely determined by
discipline or subject matter (Shumway & M esser-Davidow, 1991; Faricy, 1974), further
encouraged specialization in both research and teaching (Shils, 1979). Disciplinary
specialization necessitated improved communication, such as the formation o f discipline-specific
associations and journals, among geographically-dispersed researchers whose focused interests
were aligned (Shumway & Messer-Davidow, 1991; Metzger, 1987). These developments,
among others, transformed higher education into a modern university system which supported
the increase in number and diversity o f academic disciplines and their subsequent subdivision
and proliferation throughout the twentieth and into the twenty-first centuries.
Toward a Definition o f Discipline
In their most basic form, disciplines are fields o f knowledge that organize the teaching
and learning o f practical skills and theory. Modern usage o f the term “discipline” combines the
meanings o f “discipline,” which is historically associated with the learning o f practice and

42

exercise, with “doctrine," which is historically associated w ith the teaching o f abstract theory
(Craig, 2008; Shumway & Messer-Davidow, 1991). In tracing the etymology o f the term
“discipline," Shumway and M esser-Davidow (1991) concluded that “to call a field a ‘discipline'
is to suggest that it is not dependent on mere doctrine [or abstract theory] and that its authority
does not derive from the writings o f an individual or a school, but rather from generally accepted
methods and truths" (p. 202).
In current use, however, academic disciplines are more than fields o f knowledge, but “are
bound up in complex ways with organized scholarly professions and academic departments"
(Craig, 2008, p. 10). Becher and Trowler (2001) expounded on this complexity:
The concept o f an academic discipline is not altogether straightforward...The answer [of
whether an academic field is a discipline] will depend on the extent to which leading
academic institutions recognize the hiving o ff in terms o f their organizational
structures...and also on the degree to which a freestanding international community has
emerged, with its own professional associations and specialist journals... International
currency is an important criterion, as is a general though not sharply defined set o f
notions o f academic credibility, intellectual substance, and appropriateness o f subject
matter, (p. 41)
In this excerpt, Becher and Trowler highlighted three aspects o f the concept o f discipline:
community, intellectual qualities, and organizational structure.
Some definitions o f academic disciplines emphasize their role in the organizational and
institutional structure o f higher education. Possibly the most visible effect o f the differentiation
o f a discipline is the expansion and growth o f academic departments and the variety o f degreegranting programs in universities (Becher & Trowler, 2001; Evans. 1995; Clark, 1983).

43

I In iv e r sitie s are organized into departments, which are for the most part defined by discipline.
This has led some to believe that "a discipline is at bottom nothing more than an administrative
category" (Jencks & Riesman, 2002, p. 523). However, the manner in which an institution
groups disciplines and departments into colleges and schools can vary among institution. Craig
(2008) emphasized the institutional function o f disciplines by asserting that an “ ill-defined set o f
academic units and professional groups" (p. 10) has displaced the association o f a discipline with
learning o f practice and exercise.
Other definitions focus on the intellectual qualities o f academic disciplines. Simply put,
disciplines are “the tools, methods, procedures, exempla, concepts, and theories that account
coherently for a set o f objects or subjects” (Klein, 1990, p. 104). In his exploration o f whether
physical education had reached disciplinary status, Henry (1976) defined an academic discipline
as “an organized body o f knowledge collectively embraced in a formal course o f learning... the
content is theoretical and scholarly as distinguished from technical and professional” (p. 13). As
in this definition, theory and research are often privileged over the practical application o f skills.
Still other definitions highlight the community and social construction o f academic
disciplines. A community is a group o f individuals that shares something in common, such as
backgrounds, culture, identity, or interests. Bueger (2012) explained that “disciplines are
communities organised by a distinct set o f shared practices, vocabularies and institutions”
(p. 101). These shared practices have significance within the context o f the group. Bueger
further explained that disciplines “give meaning and legitimacy to academic practices such as
writing and presenting research, reading or teaching; they are a means to evaluate one’s status,
and give intelligibility to distinct claims to knowledge” (p. 101).

44

In addition to the three components o f disciplines highlighted above, disciplines are also
defined in terms o f power relations, in particular as social control over knowledge or boundary
constructions around domains. Perhaps most associated with expressing disciplines in terms o f
power is Foucault who described a discipline as “a system o f control in the production o f
discourse” (Foucault, 1971/1972, p. 224). The goal o f a discipline, as a social structure, is to
“control a body o f knowledge by subjecting it to systematic organization” and “shape the
consciousness and conduct o f those who seek to apply this body o f knowledge” (Winters, 2010,
p. 4889). The power relations within and among disciplines are also a struggle to demarcate
knowledge and research domains. In writing about the contentious relationship between
w om en’s studies and disciplinarity. Boxer (2000) explained that a discipline “serves to identify
both a body o f knowledge and a process o f constructing boundaries, o f regulating and shaping
that body, as well as the training required to participate in producing the knowledge housed in it”
(p. 121).
In this research, I use the definition presented by Del Favero (2003) because it combines
the various aspects o f disciplines discussed above. Academic disciplines are defined as:
Providing the structure o f knowledge in which faculty members are trained and
socialized; carry out tasks o f teaching, research, and administration; and produce research
and educational output. Disciplinary worlds are considered separate and distinct cultures
that exert varying influences on scholarly behaviors as well as on the structure o f higher
education, (p. 10)
Theories o f Disciplinarity
Exploring the definition o f academic disciplines provides an understanding o f the
complexity o f the concept, but does not uncover how the different elements interconnect to form

45

and sustain disciplines. Disciplines have layers o f interrelated structures: the research
community operates within the structures o f the discipline; a discipline interacts with other
disciplines; the discipline exists within the larger higher education system; and the disciplinary
and higher education systems function within society. All o f these areas have been explored in
the literature.
Disciplines through the Lens o f Cultural and Social Theories
Bourdieu (2001/2004) offered this definition o f academic disciplines based on elements
o f a broader cultural and social theory:
A discipline is defined by possession o f a collective capital o f specialized methods and
concepts, mastery o f which is the tacit or implicit price o f entry to the field. It produces a
‘historical transcendental’, the disciplinary habitus, a system o f schemas o f perception
and appreciation (where the incorporated discipline acts as censorship). It is
characterized by a set o f socio-transcendental conditions, constitutive o f a style, (p. 65)
There are three interacting and essential concepts in this definition: field, capital, and habitus.
Bourdieu (1993) defined field as “a separate social universe having its own laws o f functioning
independent o f those o f politics and the economy” (p. 162) and “where, in accordance with its
particular laws, there accumulates a particular form o f capital” (p 164). An academic discipline
qualifies as a field. Bourdieu provided three fundamental forms o f capital: “economic capital,
which is immediately and directly convertible into money...; cultural capital, w hich...m ay be
institutionalized in the form o f educational qualifications; and social capital, made up o f social
obligations (‘connections’)” (Bourdieu, 1997, p. 47). Other examples o f capital in academic
disciplines include awards, committee appointments, grants, and publications. Habitus has been
defined in many ways, but one way to understood it is as “embodied history, internalized as a

second nature and so forgotten as history" (Bourdieu, 1990, p. 56). Fleshing this definition out,
it is past learned assumptions, behaviors, and dispositions through socialization that structure
actions in the present. As it concerns academic disciplines, the habitus o f scholars is their
opinions and perception o f academic activities associated with their discipline. These combine
to produce a discipline that is characterized by particular behaviors and conduct.
The broader cultural and social theory supporting Bourdieu’s definition o f discipline is
practice theory. Simply defined, practice theory is “a theory o f the relationship between the
structures o f society and culture on the one hand, and the nature o f human action on the other"
(Ortner, 1989, p. 11). Practices are actions, beliefs, skills, and tacit knowledge that occur within
a political context. Practice theory is interested in exploring the relationship o f the action o f
individuals to the whole system o f culture and how these practices produce, reproduce, alter, and
perpetuate a culture (Ortner, 1989; Schatzki, 2001). Bourdieu understood practice as the
interaction and relationship between capital, field, and habitus.
Working within the framework o f practice theory, Knorr Cetina (1999) concluded that
disciplines can be described as epistemic cultures. Knorr Cetina defined epistemic cultures as
“those amalgams o f arrangements and m echanism s...which, in a given field, make up how we

know what we know. Epistemic cultures are cultures that create and warrant knowledge” (p. 1).
Culture here is defined as “the aggregate patterns and dynamics that are on display in expert
practice and that vary in different settings o f expertise” (Knorr Cetina, 1999, p. 8). Knorr Cetina
conducted ethnographic research in high-energy physics and molecular biology laboratories.
The research explored the diverse components and strategies for arranging, constructing, and
valuing knowledge within the group, emphasizing the attitudes, practices, and processes o f
knowledge production. The practices o f knowledge production are contextualized within the

47

microcosm o f an epistemic culture (or knowledge setting) which can explain variation among
disciplines. The usefulness o f discussing a discipline in terms o f epistemic cultures establishes a
context for seeing disciplines as “knowledge-in-action" (Knorr Cetina. 1999, p. 3) and not
limited to static organizational structures.
Influenced by Niklas Luhm ann's theory o f social systems, Stichweh described disciplines
as communication systems. Communication and the transfer o f knowledge is a key issue in
understanding the structure o f a discipline. Stichweh (2001) explained that “the emergence o f
the scientific discipline is equivalent to the invention o f new communication forms specific o f
disciplinary communities” (p. 13728). Stichweh viewed scholarly publications as facilitating
and mediating disciplinary communication, influencing knowledge production and exchange,
and reifying a discipline’s identity. As noted above, one o f the major impacts o f disciplinarity
during the nineteenth century was specialization, the division o f labor and subsequent
differentiation and fragmentation o f disciplines into subdisciplines and new disciplines.
“Specialization is, first o f all, an intellectual orientation. It depends on a decision by individual
scientists to concentrate on a relatively small field o f scientific activity, and...one needs a social
context supporting it” (Stichweh, 2001, p. 13728). Stichweh, therefore, equated the growth o f
disciplines in the nineteenth century with the emergence o f scientific communities. Scientific
communities are bounded social systems and “function as the infrastructure o f communication
systems” (Stichweh, 2001, p. 13728). It is a discipline’s publications, which build on and
incorporate prior publications and encourage reactions and more publications, through which the
disciplinary communication process sustains and maintains the discipline.

48

Metaphors o f Disciplinarity
The concept o f boundaries is often associated with the nature o f disciplines. Star and
Griesemer (1989) asserted that boundaries act as interfaces that allow for communication and
exchange between communities and across different social worlds. Galison (1997) considered
these boundaries as “trading zones" where people within disciplines can exchange knowledge
and mutual understanding. G alison’s research focused on how' different types o f physicists
collaborate on large projects. Galison (1997) explains:
My question is not how different scientific communities pass like ships in the night. It is
rather how, given extraordinary diversity o f the participants in physics - cryogenic
engineers, radio chemists, algebraic topologists, prototype tinkerers, com puter wizards,
quantum field theories - they speak to each other at all. And the picture... is one o f
different areas changing over time with complex border zones that sometimes vanish,
coalesce, and even burgeon into quasi-autonomous regions in their own right, (p. 63)
Galison’s trading zone metaphor was inspired by the work o f linguistic anthropologists who
study the cultural use o f pidgins and creoles. These boundaries between sub-disciplines are
regions o f collaboration, communication, and interaction.
Other research, however, has viewed boundaries not as means o f communication and
knowledge production but as disciplinary divisions. Disciplinary divisions define academic
behaviors, intellectual and knowledge domains, and worldviews. These divisions act as
boundaries that are constructed to facilitate the expansion o f knowledge domains,
monopolization o f authority and resources, and protection o f autonomy over professional
activities. “The boundaries o f the discipline are protected by a more or less codified, strict and

49

high cost o f entry; they are more or less sharply defined, and sometimes at issue in struggles with
the neighboring disciplines” (Bourdieu, 2001/2004, p. 65).
Gieryn (1983) introduced the term “boundary-work" to help articulate efforts to
demarcate science from nonscience. Boundary-work is the intentional characterization o f
science as distinctive and “constructing a social boundary that distinguishes some intellectual
activities as non-science” (Gieryn, 1983, p. 782). However, the concept o f boundary-work is not
limited to the differentiation o f science from non-science and has been appropriated into other
discussions, including theories o f disciplinarity.
When the point is to establish or protect a discipline, boundaries mark it as a territory to
be possessed by its owners, not appropriated by others, and they indicate the relations it
may have with other disciplines. But these same boundaries may be redefined if the
discipline is attempting to expand into new territory. When the point is to regulate
disciplinary practitioners, boundary-work determines which methods and theories are
included, which should be excluded, and which may be imported. (Shumway & MesserDavidow, 1991, p. 209)
The notion o f boundaries can be used to construct community and identity by creating an insider
that is different from an outsider and reinforcing exclusion (Li, 2009, p. 94).
Becher and Trowler developed the metaphor o f culture throughout their research on
academic disciplines (Becher, 1981; Becher, 1987; Becher, 1994; Becher & Trowler, 2001).
Borrowing concepts and a cultural perspective from anthropology, Becher and Trowler
expressed disciplines as the relationship between academic “tribes,” the “distinctive cultures
within academic communities,” and their disciplinary “territories,” academic ideas and
knowledge (Becher & Trowler, 2001, p.3). Disciplines have “recognizable identities and

50

particular cultural attributes" (Becher & Trowler, 2001, p. 44). These cultural attributes include
boundaries, communication, and power and social structures. Disciplines are made up o f internal
boundaries separating subspecialties, and external boundaries separating disciplines from each
other. Each discipline has unique power and social structures that include department and
university standings, gatekeepers, publications, recognition, social networks, and tenure. There
exists formal and information communication, and modes o f interaction including publication
and research collaboration. For Becher and Trowler (2001), “academic cultures and disciplinary
epistemology are inseparably intertwined...disciplinary knowledge forms are to a large extent
constituted and instantiated socially...their constitution has a reciprocal effect in the culture from
which they spring" (p. 23). Becher and Trowler define culture as “sets o f taken-for-granted
values, attitudes and ways o f behaving, which are articulated through and reinforced by recurrent
practices among a group o f people in a given context" (p. 23). Disciplinary behavior,
knowledge, and values are contextualized within the disciplinary community.
Frameworks for Studying Disciplinary Differences
Within the literature, there is a variety o f conceptual frameworks for classifying the
variation among disciplines. Academic disciplines differ markedly in their intellectual,
organizational, and social structure. The intent o f these frameworks is to articulate and account
for the distinctions o f administration, culture, departmental organization, faculty instruction and
research, socialization, student learning, and worldview among the diverse academic disciplines.
Researchers have developed frameworks o f disciplinary variation, which include continuums,
descriptive typologies, and models, based on an array o f dimensions. Examples o f these include
typologies based on Biglan’s hard and soft schema (Storer, 1967; Bigian, 1973a; Biglan, 1973b),
the Elolland Theory o f Occupational Classification (Smart, Feldman, & Ethington, 2000),

51

learning styles (Kolb, 1981), and organizational structure (Collins, 1975; Whitely, 1984; Fuchs,
1992); and models developed to classify disciplinary differences in terms o f their level o f
codification (Zuckerman & Merton, 1971), consensus (Hagstrom, 1964; Hargens, 1975), and
paradigm development (Lodahl & Gordon, 1972). These conceptual frameworks, and others,
have been used extensively in the literature to investigate difference among disciplines such as
department administration and organization; faculty publication trends, research practices, and
teaching; and socialization.
In 1996, Braxton and Hargens conducted a comprehensive review o f research on
frameworks for analyzing disciplinary differences. In their book chapter, the authors identify
eleven analytical frameworks and provide a thorough review o f the five that earned the most
attention by other researchers. A 2011 article by Jones updated the work o f Braxton and
Hargens; one additional framework was identified and relevant literature since their publication
was reviewed. The findings o f the Braxton and Hargens review, echoed by Jones, led them to
conclude that “differences among academic disciplines are profound and extensive. Their
manifestation range from global characteristics, such as disciplinary structural patterns, to
individual scholars’ everyday teaching and research experience” (Braxton & Hargens, 1996, p.
35).
As Braxton and Hargens (1996) convey, the classification o f academic disciplines has
existed as long as disciplines have existed and disciplinary differences between researchers and
practitioners have often been noted. Early efforts o f classification centered on creating a
hierarchy o f disciplines. Efforts in the early twentieth century focused on understanding and
comparing the differences o f progress in disciplines. Beginning in the 1960s, research in this

52

area grew and more dynamic classification frameworks were developed, with an emphasis on the
sociological.
Most o f these conceptual frameworks are discussed in relation to the tenets that Kuhn sets
forth in 1962 in The Structure o f Scientific Revolutions about progress in scientific fields
(Braxton & Hargens, 1996). Kuhn argued that scientific progress occurs when an “anomaly" is
discovered that is irreconcilable within the current “paradigm” in a period o f “normal science”;
this causes a period o f “crisis,” which leads to a “revolution” in which there is a change from the
former paradigm to a new paradigm that can account for the anomaly; normal science is then
resumed under the new paradigm. A classic example o f this paradigm shift is Copernicus's
model o f a heliocentric universe displacing Ptolemy’s model o f a geocentric universe in the
1500s (Kuhn, 1970).
Fleshing out Kuhn’s paradigm model reveals how it applies to conceptual frameworks for
understanding disciplinary variation. Kuhn defined paradigms as “universally recognized
scientific achievements that for a time provide model problems and solutions to a community o f
practitioners” (Kuhn, 1970, p. viii). A paradigm can be understood as a shared set o f beliefs,
facts, methods, theories, taxonomy, and values that a community o f scientists agrees
satisfactorily describe their understanding o f the world. “Men whose research is based on shared
paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice. That
commitment and the apparent consensus it produces are prerequisites for normal science, i.e., for
the genesis and continuation o f a particular research tradition” (Kuhn, 1970, p. 11).
In Kuhn’s model, a scientific discipline progresses through a pre-paradigm period, and
cycles through a stable normal science period and a crisis period. The pre-paradigm period
exhibit paradigms but there is not yet consensus about disciplinary taxonomy, techniques, and

53

theories and the period “is regularly marked by frequent and deep debates over legitimate
methods, problems, and standards o f solution, though these serve rather to define schools than to
produce agreement" (Kuhn, 1970, p.47-48). The period o f normal science is the usual state o f
scientific research operating under a shared paradigm and taxonomy; it is “research firmly based
upon one or more past scientific achievements, achievements that some particular scientific
community acknowledges for a time as supplying the foundation for its further practice" (Kuhn,
1970, p. 10). An anomaly occurs when there is a deviation or inconsistency from what is
expected based on the current paradigm that explains normal science (Kuhn, 1970). The
discovery that the current paradigm and taxonomy does not adequately explain a phenomenon
can lead to a crisis, which is a period o f exploration, experimentation, and the emergence o f new
scientific theories. This crisis culminates in scientific revolution “in which an older paradigm is
replaced in whole or in part by an incompatible new one” (Kuhn, 1970, p. 92) and normal
science resumes under the new paradigm and taxonomy.
Shifting from understanding progress in scientific disciplines, Lodahl and Gordon (1972)
applied K uhn’s concepts to exploring the academic behaviors o f research and teaching in higher
education. Lodahl and Gordon suggested that Kuhn’s concept o f paradigm could be understood
as the “degree o f consensus or sharing o f beliefs within a scientific field about theory,
methodology, techniques, and problems” (Lodahl & Gordon, 1972, p. 58) and that disciplines
with high paradigm development have greater consensus. They further contended that the level
o f paradigm development o f an academic discipline is predictive o f particular activities,
attitudes, and characteristics, and specifically “that the greater consensus o f fields with high
paradigm development would facilitate teaching and research activities as compared to fields
with low paradigm development" (Lodahl & Gordon, 1972, p. 68). Faculty from 80 university

54

departments, representing the disciplines o f chemistry, physics, political science, and sociology,
responded to a survey in which they ranked the disciplines “ in terms o f consensus over theory,
methodology, and training” (p. 58). Lodahl and Gordon concluded “that the structure o f
knowledge lends predictability to teaching and research, and that scientific fields with more
developed paradigms have more structure and thus more predictability than fields with less
developed paradigms” (p. 66).
While the paradigm development model focuses on behavior dimensions o f scholarly
activities, codification describes variation o f disciplines’ body o f knowledge. Introduced by
Zuckerman and Merton (1971, 1972), codification is “the consolidation o f empirical knowledge
into succinct and interdependent theoretical formulations” (1972, p. 303). Zuckerman and
Merton (1972) explained:
In [less codified disciplines], scientists must get command o f a mass o f descriptive facts
and o f low-level theories whose implications are not well understood. The
comprehensive and more precise theoretical structures o f the more codified field not only
allow empirical particulars to be derived from them but also provide more clearly defined
criteria for assessing the importance o f new problems, (p. 303)
The first study that Zuckerman and Merton conducted to advance the concept o f codification is
concerned with journal rejection rates across disciplines. They concluded that the degree o f
variation is in part due to differences in codification o f knowledge. Disciplines that are highly
codified, such as the physical sciences, have lower average rejection rates, whereas disciplines
that are less codified, such as humanities, have much higher average rejection rates (Zuckerman
& Merton, 1971). In a second study, they argued that because o f the compact structure o f
knowledge in highly codified disciplines, researchers are able to make significant contributions

55

earlier in their career than researchers in less codified fields (Zuckerman & Merton, 1972).
Codification can be further expressed as “the extent o f agreement on standards o f scholarship"
(Zuckerman & Merton, 1971, p. 77) with highly codified fields displaying more agreement or
consensus.
One o f the more influential frameworks is B iglan's three-dimensional model based on the
hard/soft typology which incorporates both knowledge and behavior domains. According to
Braxton and Hargens, Storer (1967) was among the first to argue the potential use o f the
hard/soft classification to explain disciplinary variation. Storer was “ interested in the differences
in the qualities o f social relationships in the different sciences [and) in the ‘atmospheres’ or
‘m oods’ that characterize different fields o f science, and with how such differences produce
visible consequences” (p. 75). Storer explained that “our use o f the terms ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ is
somehow related to these aspects o f scientific disciplines, and that these are in turn related to the
organization o f knowledge within these different fields” (Storer, 1967, p. 75). However his work
did not garner much attention outside o f his own field o f sociology o f science (Braxton &
Hargens, 1996, p.3). It was Biglan who, in two seminal articles (1973a, 1973b), took up the
hard-soft dimensions and produced the schema with which most are familiar (Braxton &
Hargens, 1996). In fact, Jones (2011) found it to be the most used classification schema for
examining disciplinary differences since Braxton and Hargens’ review in 1996 (p. 16).
Biglan found that three dimensions adequately characterized academic subject matter and
the structure and output o f university departments: hard/soft, pure/applied, and life/nonlife
systems. Using faculty perception o f the similarities and difference o f disciplines, Biglan
(1973a) distinguished the important characteristics, or dimensions, that characterize academic
subject matter. In a corresponding study, Biglan (1973b) employed the results o f the first

56

analysis to explore the relationship between subject matter and department organization. The
strongest correlation was found in the hard/soft dimension, or “the degree to which a paradigm
exists” (Biglan, 1973a, p. 204). The second strongest correlation was the pure/applied dimension
or ‘th e degree o f concern with application” to practical problems over theory (Biglan. 1973a, p.
204). The third dimension, which is rarely used (Nelson Laird, Schwartz, Shoup, & Kuh, 2005),
is the life/nonlife, or the “concern with life systems” or inanimate objects (Biglan, 1973a, p.
204). Biglan concluded from these studies that these three dimensions effectively classify
academic disciplines according to faculty perception o f subject matter, as well as other aspects o f
academic behavior and organization such as social connectedness, commitment to teaching and
research, and scholarly output.
Becher and Trowler expanded on Biglan’s hard/soft and pure/applied cognitive
dimensions, adding the social dimensions o f urban/rural and convergent/divergent. Becher and
Trowler’s research was based on multiple studies o f in-depth interviews with academics in 12
disciplines (Becher, 1981; Becher, 1987; Becher, 1994; Becher & Trowler, 2001). Through this
research, Becher and Trowler refined their four-dimensional taxonomy for mapping the patterns
found in academic tribes and territories and explored the connection between disciplinary culture
and the culture o f higher education organizations (Becher & Trowler, 2001). Becher and
Trowler explained that researchers characterized as urban “select a narrow area o f study,
containing discrete and separable problems, where their rural counterparts typically cover a
broader stretch o f intellectual territory in which the problems are not sharply demarcated or
delineated” (p. 106). They explained that disciplines that are convergent tend to be “tightly knit
in terms o f their fundamental ideologies, their common values, their shared judgm ents o f quality,
their awareness o f belonging to a unique tradition and the level o f their agreement about what

57

counts as appropriate disciplinary content and how it should be organized," while disciplines that
are divergent tend to “lack a clear sense o f mutual cohesion and identity” (p. 59).
An undercurrent o f the conceptual frameworks discussed above is the concept o f
consensus, or the level o f agreement among researchers. Consensus as a framework for
disciplinary variation was initially taken up by Hagstrom (1964, 1965), who focused on attitudes
about, and degree of, collaboration and corroboration in research. Ten years later Hargens
(1975) built on Hagstrom’s approach focusing on dimensions o f social solidarity, with one
dimension being the level o f agreement about beliefs, norms, and values with respect to research
within their discipline. High level o f consensus is associated with disciplines with more
developed paradigms while low consensus fields have less developed paradigms. Del Favero
(2003) suggested that the use o f paradigm development and consensus are “ interchangeable as
they describe a common dimension o f disciplinary fields - the extent o f agreement on structure
o f inquiry and the knowledge it produces” (p. 11).

She also indicated that the model o f high

and low consensus has for the most part displaced codification because consensus “has been
determined to be a function o f codification” (Del Favero, 2003, p. 10). Biglan’s hard/soft model
is based on the degree to which a paradigm exists and is supported by research that sought
consensus among faculty. There is clearly a correlation between Becher and Trowler’s
convergent /divergent dimension and high/low consensus. Additionally, in a Postscript for the
1970 reprint o f The Structure o f Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn, influenced by the work o f
Hagstrom (1965), wrote: “ If this book were being rewritten, it w ould... open with a discussion o f
the community structure o f science” (p. 176).
To appreciate the relationship between some o f these models, Figure 3.1 provides a
visual comparison o f four o f the conceptual frameworks for understanding disciplinary variation

58

presented in this chapter. High consensus disciplines correlates with Biglan's hard typology,
existence o f a developed paradigm, and highly codified disciplines. This suggests that these
disciplines, often described as the natural and physical sciences, would have structured
knowledge bases with clearly developed high-level theory and agreement o f the disciplines
models, problems, techniques, and values. On the other hand, low consensus correlates with
Biglan’s soft typology, less developed paradigms, and less codified disciplines. These
disciplines, often described as the social sciences and humanities, exhibit less agreement on the
knowledge base, methods, and theories that define their discipline. Characteristically, high
consensus disciplines would have, for example, higher journal acceptance rates, more co­
authorship o f articles, and increased use o f teaching and research assistants than low consensus
disciplines.

Emerging Disciplines
The emergence o f new disciplines and fragmentation o f current disciplines into
subdisciplines are complex processes involving intellectual, organizational, and social changes.
Early investigations attributed disciplinary differentiation and specialization to changes in the
social and organization structure o f science (Wray, 2005). Ben-David and Collins (1966) argued
that the desire to establish a new occupational and social role, and the benefits from that role,
significantly influenced specialization. Other research argued that as the growth o f knowledge
increases exponentially, for effective research to occur researchers must carve out a manageable
area in which to focus their attention. Later studies considered the impact o f new scientific
instruments and technology on specialization (Wray, 2005). For example, Law (1973) argued
that X-ray crystallography was established in part due to the development o f new
instrumentation for studying the molecular structure o f crystals. Researchers also began to
understand the complexity o f specialization and take into account the effects o f conceptual and
epistemic changes in addition to organizational and social changes (Lemaine, MacLeod, Mulkay,
& Weingart, 1976; Wray, 2005).
Kuhn’s model o f disciplinary specialization privileges conceptual and epistemic changes.
In response to criticisms o f his work and changes in his own thinking, Kuhn further developed
his model. Kuhn (1990) allowed that:
After a revolution there are usually (perhaps always) more cognitive specialties or fields
o f knowledge than there were before. Either a new branch has split o ff from the parent
trunk, as scientific specialties have repeatedly split o ff in the past from philosophy and
from medicine. O r else a new specialty has been bom at an area o f apparent overlap
between two preexisting specialties, (p. 8)

60

K uhn's original model o f scientific progress noted that a discipline progresses through a pre­
paradigm period, and cycles through periods o f stable normal science with a shared paradigm
and periods o f crisis when the paradigm is inadequate to address current problems; after a
revolution the old paradigm is replaced with a new paradigm. Kuhn refined the concept o f
paradigm, first by introducing the more encompassing term “disciplinary matrix" and later
replacing the term paradigm with the concept o f lexicon changes (Kuhn, 1970, p. 182; Kuhn,
1990). A result o f this development included the mitigation o f the punctuated nature o f scientific
revolutions by allowing for more gradual and subtle changes and specialization.
Law (1973) categorized disciplinary specialties in three types: subject matter, technique
or methods based, and theory based. Subject matter specialties are research activities around a
particular set o f problems or topical areas in which a variety o f methods and theories may be
applied. Technique or methods based specialties employ a particular research methodology or
use o f particular scientific equipment or a specific practice to address any range o f problems.
Law categorizes X-ray crystallography as a technique-based specialism. Theory-based
specialties focus on theory development as their main research activity and subdisciplinary
concern (Law, 1973). Clark (1983) summarized the labyrinth o f specialization within
disciplines;
The major disciplines are extensively subdivided. For example, physics is broken down
into such major subdisciplines as optics, mechanics, fluids, nuclear physics, and
elementary particle physics - the latter dividing still further into cosmic ray physicist,
who study natural particles, and high-energy physicist, who use accelerators. These
major subfields, in turn, contain more specialties...The division o f labor accounts for
large differences in originality and type and degree o f competition, (p. 35-36)

61

Abbott (2001) developed a conceptual framework for the growth w ithin disciplines based
on patterns o f change. Abbott used his discipline o f sociology as a case study to illustrate that
disciplines differentiate in fractal-like patterns. Fractals are repeating geometric patterns.
Abbott explained that conflict between existing dichotomies within disciplines, such as pure vs.
applied or qualitative vs. quantitative, causes a split with the dominant group persisting. These
dichotomies, however, repeat themselves at each level o f differentiation and throughout the
discipline in space and time. Abbott (2001) explained:
On the one hand, [the fractal cycle] generates perpetual change. Old ideas are always
being thrown out. Intellectual autocracy is perpetually overthrown. On the other, it
produces perpetual stability. The new ideas are always the old ideas under new labels.
The new people are always the old people in new roles, (p. 26)
Although Abbott’s central concern was the development o f social sciences, these fractal
distinctions also explain specialization within a discipline and its differentiation into
subdisciplines or new disciplines, but this only occurs when the size o f the discipline and
resources allow for it (Abbott, 2001).
Metzger (1987) developed a process he termed “subject parturition” to illustrate the
differentiation and fragmentation o f disciplines. Subject parturition occurs when a new field
develops from an older discipline or disciplines. The new field gradually achieves independence
as a new or sub discipline. The new discipline or specialty integrates into higher education
curriculum through a process M etzger called “program affiliation” and becomes accepted and
valued through “subject dignification.” Lastly, “subject dispersion” occurs as the new academic
discipline or specialty continues to grow and spreads beyond its original location o f acceptance
(p. 128-131).

62

Clark (1983) reasoned that external factors, namely the heterogeneity o f students and the
diversity o f labor markets, work in conjunction with the effects o f research and scholarship in
higher education to lead to differentiation within disciplines and the creation o f organizational
structures to support them. He provides several generalizations to explain the process and
impact o f differentiation: Because universities have historically been organized based on
disciplines as a means o f grouping academic work and interest, differentiation can cause
significant changes to the organizational structure o f higher education. When groupings o f
different or specialized interests are formed, disciplines are divided between those who want
stability through the maintenance o f old interests and those who introduce the new interests.
There are power struggles between those vested in the old structure and those seeking change;
the outcome o f the struggle is determined by which group has more influence, legitimacy, and
power. Influence, legitimacy, and power depend on recognition by the wider community that
there is value in the activities and ideologies o f the group. Clark contended that “subject
fragmentation has arguably become the source o f ever-growing system complexity” and further
noted that it has a larger impact than external factors such as employment outlook (Clark, 2002,
p. 326).
In a comparative case study o f the development o f six academic disciplines, Hashem
(2007) elaborates on four factors that facilitate their emergence and independence. The model
involves the interaction o f the external factors, namely “societal pressures in the form o f public
demands, including crises that call for specialized expertise” and “state intervention through
funding and legislation;” and internal pressures, namely “the academic resourcefulness o f the
field that is aspiring to become independent” and “the institutional dynamics o f the field,
including competition, organizational expansion, and professional consolidation” ( p i97).

63

Hashem concluded, based on the patterns that emerged from the case studies, that academic
resourcefulness was the most predictive factor o f the field's successful independence.
Criteria in the Literature
In a 1978 article, Thornton discussed the disciplinary nature and potential o f the field o f
American Indian studies. Since Thornton was unable to locate any set o f published criteria for
assessing disciplinarity, he based his analysis on the four general criticisms found in the
literature about the “disciplinary shortcomings” o f American Indian studies (Thornton, 1978, p.
11). He categorized these criticisms as lacking a distinct methodology, abstract concepts, a
unique area o f concern, and scholarly traditions. Some argue that disciplines have a
characteristic methodology associated with research: for example ethnography is a methodology
particular to anthropology. Disciplines are often concerned with abstract concepts, such as
gravity, force, and mass in physics. Disciplines are often bounded areas o f study with minimal
overlap with other fields: American Indian studies is often a subject in anthropology and other
social science. Thornton found the requirement o f scholarly traditions and a unique area o f
research and teaching to be the most essential component o f a discipline.
Thornton (1978) explained that the typical pattern o f an emerging discipline is for the
intellectual qualities to emerge, such as an area o f interest or new problem, followed by the
structural elements, such as courses, faculty, and programs o f study, needed to support them (p.
10). However, he argued that American Indian studies took the opposite approach. American
Indian studies programs were created in university departments to meet political and social
mandates. The intellectual structure continued to take shape and mature, but was typically
contained within the boundaries o f other existing disciplines. Thornton viewed the lack o f
unique intellectual and scholarly areas o f research in American Indian studies to be the most

64

valid criticism keeping it from achieving disciplinary status but provided the beginning o f a
research agenda to help remedy this.
Some research on the disciplinary nature o f a field uses criteria established for identifying
professions. While published criteria for gauging academic disciplinary status are limited, the
literature on accepted criteria for classifying professions has a long history (Chatterjee &
Stevenson, 2008; Flexner, 1915; Goode, 1957; Greenwood, 1957; Roberts & Donahue, 2000).
There are examples in the literature o f using the criteria for defining a profession to also define
disciplinarity (Bird, Welsch, Astrachan, & Pistrui, 2002). Although some features o f disciplines
and professions seem to overlap, disciplinarity and professionalization are two distinctive
phenomena.
Richardson (2008) analyzed the development o f accounting history as a discipline in the
context o f a “professional project.” Professional project is a conceptual model for understanding
the actions that shape the professionalization o f an occupation or “an attempt to translate one
order o f scarce resources - special knowledge and skills - into another - social and economic
rewards” (Larson, 1977, p. xvii). Richardson adapted the concept o f professional project to
examine the disciplinary project o f accounting history by focusing on the strategies and activities
that, in retrospect, made possible its emergence as a discipline. He summarized the strategies as
“making history relevant” by connecting accounting history to other activities or disciplines
already considered legitimate; “making history visible/controversial” by defining boundaries
around the intellectual domain and identifying exemplars in accounting history; and
“institutionalizing accounting history” through the establishment o f associations and programs o f
study that provide the necessary support (p. 251).

65

For Richardson (2008), accounting history had emerged as an academic discipline
because it had an institutional structure identified “by the existence o f specialist journals and
academic associations," an intellectual structure identified “by the existence o f a bounded body
o f knowledge,” and a social structure identified “by the existence o f a critical mass o f academics
that self-identify as members o f the discipline" (p. 267). However, the disciplinary project, he
concluded, was weak in three areas: “ integrating accounting history into the curriculum; ensuring
that accounting history is recognized and validated in tenure and promotion standards; and,
demonstrating the relevance o f accounting history to the process o f accounting standard-setting"
(p. 268). He noted that providing courses and programs o f study in an area is a key factor in
emerging as a discipline.
Other research based the investigation o f disciplinary status on a definition o f discipline.
As noted above, and made evident in this discussion, the definition o f discipline is multifaceted
and comes in several varieties. Yet, the definitions often group defining elements o f a discipline
as intellectual, organizational, or social. This is illustrated in two different studies, one on the
disciplinarity o f consumer behavior (M aclnnis & Folkes, 2010) and the other on digital media
(Sterne, 2005). The studies used two different definitions o f discipline. M aclnnis and Folkes
established a definition that focused on the intellectual and social elements, while Sterne used a
definition that privileged organizational properties. However, both sets o f authors organized
their analysis to address the intellectual, organizational, and social properties o f their respective
field. Both studies concluded that neither o f their respective fields met the definition o f
discipline.

66

On Establishing Definitive Criteria
In the postscript to the 1970 reprint o f The Structure o f Scientific Revolutions , Kuhn
introduced the concept “disciplinary matrix" to replace his notion o f paradigm. Disciplinary
matrix is a more encompassing term used to distinguish a set o f group commitments, principles,
and practices that hold an academic community together and accounts for “the relative fullness
o f their professional communication and the relative unanimity o f their professional judgm ents"
(p. 182). Kuhn did not provide an exhaustive list o f the components that make up the
disciplinary matrix. He provided four components as examples: symbolic generalizations, or
scientific theories that can be expressed formulaically; metaphysical paradigms, or abstract
theories; values; and exemplars (p. 182-187). Kuhn drew his conceptual model from the field o f
physics and therefore applying the model to the humanities and social sciences reveals some
biases. As is typical in Kuhn’s work, the example components o f the disciplinary matrix focused
primarily on conceptual and intellectual aspects o f the discipline.
In their 1976 edited volume o f studies about the emergence o f new disciplines, Lemaine,
MacLeod, Mulkay, and W eingart presented six “problematic spheres” designed to provide areas
o f focus for research on the development o f new disciplines. The editors provided examples o f
questions that can be useful to explore each o f the six areas. They contended that “every sphere
can, at least in some instances, influence appreciably the course o f scientific development" (p.
14). More specifically, inquiry into these spheres assess the “rate o f scientific development” or
the rate at which information increases in a field; the “direction o f scientific development” or the
particular area o f intellectual investigation as opposed to another area; and the “content o f
scientific development” or findings, principles, and theories (Lemaine, MacLeod, Mulkay, and
Weingart, 1976, p. 14).

67

The problematic spheres can be summarized as internal intellectual processes, internal
social processes, external intellectual factors, immediate institutional context, specific economic
and political factors, and diffuse social influence. New fields typically develop from previous
research or advances o f scientific or technical knowledge. The internal intellectual and social
processes spheres map the intellectual origins o f an emerging field. The editors recommended
questions about research methods, problems, and techniques and questions about
communication, dissimilation o f research, research community, and social position o f actors. The
communication o f new scientific or technical knowledge is not always an internal process within
a research community, but can be influenced by external intellectual factors as well as the
immediate institutional context in which the research is produced. To address these spheres, the
editors provided questions about the relationship between the external community groups, the
institution, and the research community and questions about the economic, organizational, and
social structure o f the research institution. Although the editors argued that it is “unsatisfactory
to claim broad changes in the structure o f society have determined the course o f scientific
development in any simple, direct, or uniform fashion” (Lemaine, MacLeod, Mulkay, &
Weingart, 1976, p. II), there is merit in understanding the indirect impact o f economic or
political factors on research, including policy, research problems, and support. The final
problematic sphere that the editors presented was concerned with the reception o f the emerging
field on social interest and values. The editors recommended questions that addressed the
relationship between researchers and the community, including recruitment and the moral and
social value o f the field (Lemaine, MacLeod, Mulkay, & Weingart, 1976).

68

Institutionalization is a key element in establishing a new discipline. It is through higher
education that the discipline perpetuates itself. Krishnan (2009) provided a list o f six
characteristics o f academic disciplines:
1) disciplines have a particular object o f research (e.g. law, society, politics), though the
object o f research may be shared with another discipline; 2) disciplines have a body o f
accumulated specialist knowledge referring to their object o f research, which is specific
to them and not generally shared with another discipline; 3) disciplines have theories and
concepts that can organize the accumulated specialist knowledge effectively; 4)
disciplines use specific terminologies or a specific technical language adjusted to their
research object; 5) disciplines have developed specific research methods according to
their specific research requirements; and maybe most crucially; 6) disciplines must have
some institutional manifestation in the form o f subjects taught at universities or colleges,
respective academic departments and professional associations connected to it. (p.9)
Krishnan noted that not all disciplines will demonstrate all six o f these characteristics; however
the more that the discipline has, the more successful it is likely to be at growing and sustaining
itself.
In a presentation that explored the designation o f emergency management as a discipline,
Phillips (2003) outlined nine elements “representative o f areas and issues commonly found
within disciplines” which “also reflect core issues often found in accreditation” (para. 5). To
explore these elements o f disciplinarity, Phillips posed several questions related to each key
element; examples o f the some o f the questions she proposed are presented in Table 3.1. Phillips
developed the criteria from her experiences creating new programs in both wom en’s studies and
emergency medicine. Although strikingly different fields, Phillips contended that “both are

69

breaking new ground in new ways, both face similar questions o f content, terminology, student
markets and outcomes, and faculty roles - not to mention questions o f what we should teach and
how we should teach it" (para. 4).

Conceptual Framework for this Research
From a synthesis o f the literature, D ’Agostino (2012) derived the most comprehensive
list o f elements and corresponding criteria that compose and are supported by a discipline.

70

D ’Agostino (2012) views a discipline as a cultural system: the interaction o f elements that
characterize a discipline interpreted within a framework o f “shallow consensus” (p. 334).
Additionally, interpretation o f the disciplinary elements needs to be situated within the context o f
the development o f the field. The historical context illuminates how and why the elements o f a
discipline came to be organized and represented as they are. Discipline as a cultural system is
reminiscent o f other theorists who have described disciplines in terms o f a cultural metaphor
(Geertz, 1983; Bauer, 1990; Becher & Trowler, 2001). D ’Agostino’s notion o f shallow
consensus supports not only theories o f disciplinary variation but also growth and specialization
o f disciplines (Hagstrom, 1964; Kuhn, 1970; Lodahl & Gordon, 1972; Hargens, 1975).
D ’Agostino divided the elements that constitute a discipline into institutional aspects and
intellectual aspects. Distinguishing between these two broad categories is common. Abbott
(2001) differentiated between the social structure between disciplines, which includes
institutional organization, and the cultural structure within disciplines, which includes
intellectual structures. Becher and Trowler (2001) used the metaphors tribes, for academic
culture, and territories, for their intellectual domain. During (2006) identified these two aspects
o f disciplines as “subdivisions o f knowledge and institutional forms o f life” (p. 266). A
summary o f the ten elements D ’Agostino compiled is presented in Table 3.2. The disciplinary
elements each contain more granular observable criteria that further define and refine the
element (see Table 1.1 in Chapter 1).

D ’Agostino (2012) argued, however, that these elements that constitute a discipline have
to be understood within the framework o f shallow consensus. D 'A gostino contended that
although we can define a discipline in terms o f it meeting the criteria, we must accept that
members o f the discipline may have different understandings o f what embody the individual
elements. D ’Agostino termed the latter shallow consensus:
It is actually this kind o f consensus or agreement in commitments or values that will
characterize the disciplinary communities, 1 believe. While there may be agreement in the
philosophical community that Plato is a significant figure, or that Wittgenstein is, what
Plato and Wittgenstein mean to different individuals in the community will vary widely,
( p .341)
72

However, it is this varying level o f detail in agreement on intellectual and institutional aspects o f
disciplines that facilitate the growth o f knowledge, through discourse, innovation, and new ideas.
D ’Agostino's shallow consensus permits a definition o f disciplines using rigid criteria and still
tolerates internal variation within the discipline.
Summary
In this chapter I reviewed relevant literature from several fields that explores the nature o f
academic disciplines. Academic disciplines are often defined in terms o f their intellectual,
organizational, and social structure, invoking the use o f terms such as community, institutional
organization, organized body o f knowledge, as well as power relations and social control.
Because disciplines have layers o f interrelated structures, they negotiate a range o f relationships
which have been explored using cultural and social theories and explained using metaphors.
Researchers tend to agree that disciplines are different in codifiable and predictable ways.
Researchers have created classification systems in an attempt to explain these disciplinary
variations. The modem classification frameworks reviewed in this chapter are not hierarchical;
they do not suggest one discipline is superior to another, rather they indicate that disciplines exist
on a continuum o f variation.
The development o f the modem higher education system in the nineteenth century
supported disciplinary growth and specialization. The process o f differentiation, fragmentation,
and specialization o f disciplines into subdisciplines or new disciplines is a complex processes
involving intellectual, organizational, and social changes. Criteria for identifying that a field has
emerged as a new discipline are not well-established; however several researchers have put
forward useful sets o f criteria. Although the criteria vary in presentation, they provide similar

73

elements o f assessment that take into account institutional and intellectual aspects that aim to get
at the dynamic qualities o f a discipline.
In the next chapter I provide a narrative o f the development o f the area o f digital curation.
The narrative provides an historical context for understanding the circumstances o f competing
and shared interests in the emergence o f the area o f digital curation. The function o f the
narrative is to provide context for the findings o f this study.

CHAPTER 4: CONTEXTUALIZING DIGITAL CURATION
In this chapter 1 present an historical perspective on the emergence o f the area o f digital
curation. The function o f this chapter is to provide context for the findings o f this study. In
accordance with the conceptual framework and numerous other models o f disciplinarity, this
chapter provides an historical context for understanding the circumstances o f competing and
shared interests in the emergence o f the area o f digital curation. An awareness o f how an area
developed is essential for understanding how the elements o f a discipline, as defined by the
conceptual framework, came to be organized as they are.
This chapter is organized in two main sections. The first section, Foundations o f Digital
Curation, provides a brief historical narrative o f the development o f this area. The section is
divided into three subsections that depict the growth o f automation and digital archiving in the
archival, library and information science (LIS), and research communities. The second section,
Preservation and Curation Communities, focuses on how the archival, LIS, and research
communities begin to overlap to form a preservation community, and the early emergence o f
digital curation as a term for articulating something broader than preservation.
Foundations o f Digital Curation
The emergence o f area o f digital curation as the lifecycle approach to managing and
preserving digital assets evolved from a history o f uncertainties about the longevity and
sustainability o f data and efforts for addressing these concerns. Technology progressed rapidly
during the Second World War and onward, and consequently the use o f computers in business
and research increased. These advancements in technology brought great changes, but also with
them came large amounts o f data threatened by obsolescence, poor management, and our
evolving understanding o f the digital environment. In response to these new formats o f data and

records, research and professional communities responded. Collaborative and cooperative
initiatives were a central part o f this response.
Interest in the stewardship o f digital assets was evident early on in the development o f
computers. There have been a number o f stakeholders interested in the archiving and
preservation o f digital assets. Many o f the earliest endeavors to manage digital assets came from
within the research communities themselves, dealing with mounting quantities o f data in digital
formats. The archive and LIS professions have seen their practice transform: not only has
technology changed how they conduct their work, but also the materials they work with are
increasingly digital.
Archival Community
In the archival community, initial reflection about machine-readable records focused on
appraisal issues and the “recordness” o f this form o f media. The National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) in the United States determined as early as 1936 that punch cards, from
the Bureau o f Census, were not records. Satisfied with archiving the original questionnaires,
summaries, and final processed data, punch cards were always not retained (Fishbein, 1972;
Brown, 1987). Schellenberg disagreed on the grounds that machine-readable records were in
fact records, defining records as any “documentary material, regardless o f physical form or
characteristic” (Schellenberg, 1956/2003, p. 16). However, in his influential 1956 internal
bulletin, The Appraisal o f Modern Public Records , Schellenberg agreed with the conclusion that,
for the most part, machine-readable records need not be retained in the archives. He concluded
that “punchcards and tape recordings are commonly unusable without resort to expensive
equipment” and to be preserved in an archive records should be in a form that makes them easily
accessible to users without the need o f specialized equipment. NARA routinely opted for

76

conventional forms o f media for permanent archival retention (Rieger, 1966; Fishbein, 1972;
Brown, 1987).
In his 1956 bulletin, Schellenberg also made an important comment about the treatment
o f research data. He noted that, in most instances, raw scientific data does not meet the
prerequisites to be maintained in the archive. He states:
They are usually quite voluminous. Often they have attributes that make their further use
impracticable. They may be intelligible only to the persons who recorded the data. Like
punchcards produced in statistical work, they may be in a form that is difficult to interpret
without resort to mechanical or electronic devices. (Applying Tests o f Informational
Values, Records Relating to Phenomena section, para. 23)
He continues by noting that controlled laboratory research is repeatable and therefore does not
have secondary value. Schellenberg makes a notable exception o f archiving raw data with
geosciences observational data, but otherwise favors retaining records that possess value to more
typical archival researchers, such as historians.
Views about the appraisal o f electronic records began to change in the 1960s. An
impetus for change began with a 1965 report by the Committee on the Preservation and Use o f
Economic Data submitted to the Social Science Research Council. The report, coined the
“Ruggles Report” after Yale University economics professor Richard Ruggles, the chairman o f
the committee, made recommendations for maintaining economic data for preservation and reuse
in a centralized government data center (Ruggles, Miller, Kuh, Lebergott, Orcutt, & Pechman,
1965). Following the Ruggles Report, the Archivist o f the United States o f America established
a four-person Committee on the Disposition o f Machine-Readable Records to investigate current
practices and recommendations for future policies. This committee, led by Meyer Fishbein,

77

agreed with the conclusions o f the Ruggles Report, acknow ledging that electronic media are
records, and that NARA has the responsibility to treat them as such. In late 1968, the Data
Archives section was established at NARA. NARA received its first electronic record transfer in
1970 (Navale & Cameron, n.d.) and in 1972 issued its first General Records Disposition
Schedule for automated records (Brown. 1987). However, funding and commitment to the
electronic records program and staffing was tumultuous over the decades that followed (Brown,
1987; Brown 2003).
Slow progress was made by the archival community' during the 1970s and 1980s in their
approach to managing electronic media. In the literature the debate about appraisal continued,
ignited by Dollar’s Appraising Machine-Readable Records published in 1978, and evolved into
discussions about the applicability o f archival principles to electronic media and best practices
for their preservation. By the mid-1980s, the first comprehensive appraisal guidelines and
practical manual were published for archivists working with electronic media (Naugler, 1984;
Hedstrom, 1984). However, a 1994 study on the archival profession in North American
concluded that “the archival profession in the United States has not done well in structuring itself
to manage electronic records” (Cox, 1994, p. 24). It continued that “despite three decades o f
activity, few archival institutions have developed programs to administer and preserve these
special records” (Cox, 1994, p. 24).
This early discourse laid the conceptual foundation for and shaped the application o f
archival thinking to approaches to digital media that is evident today. Cook (1991) affirmed that
the archival community was moving into a new generation o f electronic records archivists,
noting that the earlier generation was characterized by being isolated from traditional archivists
and focused only on the records o f those also interested in the preservation o f electronic media,

78

such as social science researchers. This new generation o f archivist recognized that electronic
records were becoming an alternative to traditional archival media, ‘i t was no longer a matter o f
a few records being rendered ‘machine-readable,' but all traditional media being rendered
‘electronic,’ the media lines being blurred thereby, and the paper backups either disappearing or
not even being produced” (Cook, 1991, p. 206). Hedstrom outlined the argument for an
electronic records research agenda and the areas that needed to be explored, adding that
“consultation and collaboration with experts in other fields will be essential elements o f
successful research” (Hedstrom, 1991, p. 335). Dollar saw the archival profession and records
manager professions reuniting around shared concerns about electronic records, hinting at a
lifecycle approach to managing this form o f media. He identified three key concerns about
electronic records: ensuring integrity and authenticity; early intervention by the archivist in the
records lifecycle; and maintaining accessibility and overcoming technological obsolescence
(Dollar, 1993).
Library and Information Science Community
Prior to the 1990s, libraries focused their efforts on using computers for bibliographic
control o f their holdings and automation o f library catalogs using online public access catalogs
(OPACs). In the early 1960s, the Library o f Congress conducted a study to determine the
feasibility o f automation for cataloging, searching, indexing, and retrieving library materials, and
the interoperability between library catalogs (King et al., 1963). As a result o f the
recommendation and positive outlook o f this study, in 1966 the Library o f Congress introduced
the Machine Readable Cataloging (M ARC) format for their own use and use in other libraries
(Arms, 2012;A vram , 1975).

79

Following the introduction o f the MARC format, several consortia were formed to help
improve access and share resources through integrated library catalogs. In 1967, a group o f Ohio
university presidents and library directors established the Online Computer Library Center, Inc
(OCLC, founded as Ohio College Library Center) and began work on an online integrated library
catalog using MARC records. The first library began using online cataloging in 1971; soon
OCLC began providing its services to libraries outside o f Ohio (Gray, 2013; OCLC, 2012).
Another consortium, the Research Libraries Group (RLG), was founded in 1974 by Columbia,
Harvard, and Yale Universities and the New York Public Library with a similar vision as OCLC,
but RLG expanded their catalog beyond libraries to include archives, museums, and other
cultural heritage institutions (Martinez, 1998).
With the formation o f integrated catalogs, support for information retrieval among
distributed information systems became necessary. In the early 1970s work began on what
would become the Z39.50 protocol for cross-database searching. The protocol was designed to
address the challenge o f interoperability between different systems. Later iterations o f the
protocol were highly extensible and saw implementation in search and retrieval for abstracting,
indexing, and full text databases. Z39.50 became an ISO standard for information retrieval in
1988 (Lynch, 1997; litis, 1995).
As social science data archives developed distinctively from traditional information
services, gaining control o f data files became increasingly important; however the role o f
libraries remained ambiguous. In fact, a 1967 study by the National Research
Council/Committee on Information in the Behavorial Sciences commented:
Some years ago it appeared plausible that maintenance o f repositories o f behavioral
science research data would gradually be brought under the umbrella o f the conventional

80

research library in matters o f personnel and financing, after the initial innovation phase.
Such a possibility is not, o f course, to be ruled out completely for the future, but it is
already clear that such a future remains distant, (p. 37)
One pioneer in advocating for increased bibliographic identification and control o f social science
data files in libraries was Sue Dodd, data librarian at the Inter-university Consortium for Political
and Social Research (ICPSR), and active in the International Association for Social Science
Information Services & Technology (IASSIST) and the American Library Association (ALA).
Dodd advanced a concept o f cataloging data files and published manuals for the practical
application o f these cataloging rules for librarians. One author noted that Dodd “was almost
unique in her support o f libraries as important resources for data. She believed that libraries
wanted to be involved in data services and that they should be involved” (Gray, 2013, p. 17).
With Dodd’s input, the second edition o f the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (1978) included
standards describing machine-readable data files and creating bibliographic records for electronic
media (Dodd, 1982; Gray, 2013; Stephenson, 2013). Well into the 1980s, however, library
involvement in maintaining research data remained unresolved (Dennis, 1970; Gray, 2013).
Attention shifted from automating library catalogs to confronting a changing information
environment, and technology’s impact on how libraries provide services to researchers. By the
late 1980s and early 1990s, catalog automation was well established, membership to a library
consortium allowed for resources sharing, and online journal indexing and abstracting services
become more affordable. Demand for digitally available content followed. Outside o f the
library purview, Michael Hart demonstrated that digitized content was achievable. Project
Gutenberg found its ambitious, but gradual, beginnings in 1971 with the Declaration o f

Independence becoming the first e-book (Hart, 1992; Hane, 2004).

81

The digital libraries movement began to address some o f the challenges and opportunities
libraries faced. The earliest efforts o f electronic libraries, as they were first called, focused on
access to digitized journal articles. Three o f the earliest implementations were the Mercury
Electronic Library project at Carnegie Mellon University (1989-1992), which provided local
access to computer science journals; the collaborative Chemistry Online Retrieval Experiment
(CORE) (1991-1995), which digitized articles from journals published by the American
Chemical Society; and the University Licensing Service (TULIP) through Elsevier Science
(1991-1995), an online delivery service (Tedd & Large, 2005). JSTOR originated as a Mellon
grant-funded project at the University o f Michigan to determine whether it was feasible to
replace print back issues o f journals with digitized versions. The successful pilot project was
launched in 1995 and soon established a self-sustainable economic model (Guthrie, 2000;
Schonfeld, 2003).
In the United States, the major digital libraries initiative focused more on computer
science research and technology solutions, such as systems architecture, interoperability, and
information retrieval. In 1994, the first phase o f the Digital Libraries Initiative (DLI-1) that
funded six projects was launched in the United States by the National Science Foundation, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) (Tedd & Large, 2005). In fact, DLI is attributed as having
popularized the phrase digital libraries, after some debate about whether it should be plural or
singular and putting aside other popular terms at the time such as electronic library (Arms, 2007;
Griffin, 1998). DLI-1 was more interested in developments in computer science and progress in
discipline-specific communities, and only tangentially interested in models for improving library
services (Dempsey, 2006; Lynch, 2000). Thirty-six more projects were funded by phase 2 o f the

82

Initiative which began in 1998 and included additional funding sponsorship from the National
Library o f Medicine (NLM), the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the
Library o f Congress (Tedd & Large, 2005). With funding sources coming from within the
library community, projects began to address issues facing the library.
Several program-based funding activities across the globe set out to facilitate change in
libraries. In 1990 the European Commission launched the Telematics for Libraries Programme.
The goals o f the funding program were to automate library catalogs, network services between
libraries, promote innovation, and produce technological tools and services for the library
community (European Commission, n.d.; Raitt, 2000; Dempsey, 2006 ). In 1993, a review o f
libraries in the United Kingdom was initiated to determine how library teaching and learning
services were being impacted by an increase in undergraduates, and how library research
services were being impacted by rapidly evolving technologies. One o f the key conclusions o f
the resulting report, known as the Follett Report, was that “the exploitation o f IT is essential to
create the effective library service o f the future” (Follett, 1993, Chapter 1). Based on the
recommendations o f the report, the Electronic Libraries Programme (eLib) was established and
funded 59 collaborative projects in the United Kingdom that were intended to advance the role o f
libraries and support the use o f information technology in teaching and research in higher
education (Electronic Libraries Programme, n.d; Raitt, 2000; Dempsey, 2006; Duke & Jordan,
Ltd, 2006). The National Digital Library Federation (now DLF) in the United States was
established in 1995 as a program o f the Council on Library and Information Resources. DLF
began as an agreement between the Commission on Preservation and Access, and fifteen
research libraries and archives. The primary goal o f the DLF was to support library
developments and implement a networked, digital library over the Internet, through the adoption

83

o f standards and best practice to support interoperability (Commission on Preservation and
Access, 1995).
Interest in and research on digital libraries continued to increase, spanning the fields o f
computer science, and library and information science. However, the desired outcomes for the
fields were different: LIS wanted to improve services with technology, while computer science
sought to improve and develop more advanced tools. By the mid-1990s, journals were launched
dedicated to publishing research and developments in digital libraries, including D-Lib Magazine
in 1995, Ariadne in 1996, and the International Journal o f Digital Libraries in 1997. Several
conferences began in the mid-1990s too, including the International Conference on Asian Digital
Libraries, ACM Conferences on Digital Libraries, IEEE-CS Conferences on Advances in Digital
Libraries, and European Conference on Digital Libraries.
Research Communities
Some o f the earliest efforts for preserving, sharing, and making accessible digital assets
were the establishment o f social science data archives beginning in the early 1960s. With an
increase in interest and scholarship in the social sciences after the Second World War, coupled
with rapidly advancing technology that made processing data more attainable, researchers
encountered new data management challenges (Shankar et al., 2014; Dennis, 1970). In fact, the
Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, with a collection focused on commercial and news
media survey data, was founded as early as 1947 at Williams College in Williamstown, MA.
Now housed at the University o f Connecticut, it is the oldest social science archive for machinereadable data in the United States (Bisco, 1966; Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, n.d.).
A number o f the first social science data archives have proven to be sustainable. The
Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), founded as the Inter-

84

university Consortium for Political Research in 1962, was organized as a consortium o f twentytwo universities led by the University o f Michigan, to promote institutional-level social science
data archiving and research methods training for students and faculty. ICPSR now has more than
700 member institutions and continues to be a leader in data stewardship. Not only is ICPSR
committed to preservation o f and access to social science research, and data management and
research methodology education, it was also part o f early digitization efforts o f historical
materials for the archive (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, n.d.).
The Steinmetz Stichting at the University o f Amsterdam, established in 1964, is now merged into
the Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) o f the Netherlands. The Steinmetz
Stichting set out to collect, organize, and make internationally accessible social research from the
Netherlands and promote social science research and education (Bisco, 1966). DANS upholds
this objective by conducting research and training into sustainable digital stewardship,
encouraging “researchers to archive and reuse data in a sustained manner,” and providing the
infrastructure for them to do so (Data Archiving and Networking Services, n.d.). In response to
the growth o f social science research in the United Kingdom, the UK Data Archive was
established in 1967 as the Social Science Research Council Data Bank. The Archive set out to
address “the problem o f sharing information about social surveys and the data generated by
them” (UK Data Archive, 2007, p. 2). Changes in attitudes and policy about sharing research
data in the 1970s increased acquisition o f data for the Archive and today its collections continue
to grow.
The number o f both local and collaborative social science data archives increased. With
this increase came efforts to improve collaboration, communication, and interoperability among
repositories. Initiated by ICPSR and funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant, the

85

Council o f Social Science Data Archives (CSSDA) was formed in 1962 to support standards
development, and encourage collaboration and communication among data archives largely in
the United States. CSSDA eventually dissolved in the late 1960s due to changes in the United
States funding environment (Adams, 2006; Bisco, 1966). Also beginning in 1962, the
International Social Science Council sponsored several Conferences on Data Archives. These
conferences resulted in the formation o f the Standing Committee on Social Science Data
Archives (SCSSDA) whose membership overlapped with the CSSDA. Emerging from SCSSDA
meetings, 1ASSIST was established in 1974 as a professional association to unite the social
science research, information science, and computer science communities around data
management and use (Adams, 2006; International Association for Social Science Information
Services and Technology, n.d.). Following the creation o f IASSIST, in 1976 the Consortium o f
European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA) was established “to provide seamless access
to data across repositories, nations, languages and research purposes” and to “encourage
standardisation o f data and metadata, data sharing and knowledge mobility across Europe”
(Consortium o f European Social Science Data Archives, n.d.).
In addition to the data archiving activity in the social sciences, archives and curated
databases for research data in the biological and chemical sciences were also becoming
prevalent. The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) originated in the Department
o f Chemistry at the University o f Cambridge in the United Kingdom in 1965. Through its
curated Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) it provided data for the chemical and crystal
structures o f small molecules for academic and pharmaceutical research. Having garnered a
successful international reputation, it became an independent non-profit company in the late
1980s, although it still maintains a close relationship with the Department o f Chemistry

86

(Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, n.d). In the mid-1970s, collaboration between the
CCDC and Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York established the Protein Data Bank
archive. In the early years o f the archive, the structural biology community was so small that
requests for deposits occurred by way o f personal communication through existing relationships.
As technology advanced, so did the field which witnessed an increase in the amount o f available
data and shifts in attitudes about data sharing (Berman, 2008). Today, the Worldwide Protein
Data Bank (wwPDB) comprises organizations from Europe, Japan, and the United States to form
a single freely and publicly available archive o f macromolecular structural data (Worldwide
Protein Data Bank, n.d.). These early and successful curated databases facilitated international
collaborations such as the UniProt Consortium and the Human Genome Project.
The physical science community was influential on a national level at establishing data
centers. The establishment o f the World Data Centers (WDC) in 1957 played a role in initiating
a focus on the preservation and sharing o f raw data in discipline-specific data centers (Duerr,
Parsons, Marquis, Dichtl, & Mullins, 2004). In 1952, the International Council o f Scientific
Unions (ICSU) proposed conducting the International Geophysical Year, a coordinated initiative
for researchers around the world to take part in geophysical scientific observations. Fifty-two
World Data Centers were established to archive the collected data. Although this data was not
digital, Duerr, Parsons, Marquis, Dichtl, and Mullins (2004) argue that the Centers set a
precedent for distributed discipline-specific raw data stewardship and set the stage for a
disconnect from archival preservation and records management. Thirteen o f the WDCs were
established in the United States, many o f which are now housed in National Data Centers
(National Research Council, 2003; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, n.d.).
The National Space Science Data Center, for example, was established in 1966 as a long-term

87

archive for NASA space mission data, and also houses the World Data Center for Satellite
Information (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, n.d).
The increase in volume o f data had a significant impact on data storage, data processing,
and archival systems. With the rapid increase in the volume o f data as technology advanced,
NASA struggled early on with establishing sound data management practices and an effective
archival system (Holmes, Poland, & Demmerle, 1967; United States General Accounting Office,
1987). As early as 1964 N ASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center began work on an “archival
system which could handle the large volumes o f data at a substantial saving in cost and with
improved performance” (Holmes, Poland, & Demmerle, 1967, p. 2). Although the National
Space Science Data Center was established in 1966, in the late 1980s data management and
archiving practices at NASA were still insufficient (United States General Accounting Office,
1987). The Government Office o f Accountability concluded that “unless it continues to improve
its management o f space science data, NASA will be hard-pressed to effectively and efficiently
handle the massive volumes o f data expected from its future mission” (United States General
Accounting Office, 1990, p. 3). Working to address this insufficiency, NASA established
Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) to store data that were still in active use. These
were linked to a centralized search interface for accessing data remotely (Duerr, Parsons,
Marquis, Dichtl, & Mullins, 2004).
It was in this environment that NASA initiated a call for a standards development effort
for an archiving system reference model. The process began in 1994 with the objective o f
creating a functional model to improve the archiving and preservation o fN A S A ’s space science
data. The scope o f the project extended beyond its initial audience. In open forum discussions,
contributions came from the preservation community, including participants from the archives

88

and computer science fields. In 2000, a draft o f the Open Archival Information System
Reference Model (OAIS) was circulated and became an ISO standard in 2003. The OAIS
Reference Model provides a framework and shared vocabulary for discussing the functions o f a
preservation system and facilitates cross-disciplinary communication. The OAIS Reference
Model remains one o f the most important digital curation standards and models in use today
(Lee, 2010).
The research communities were also leaders in developing digital preprint and
institutional repository prototypes. Research communities have long shared findings both
through the formal channels o f publication, and informal channels o f copying and mailing
preprints. By the end o f the 1980s, emailing preprints was beginning to replace the postal
service (Ginsparg, 1994). Within the scholarly community, technology was changing
communication in a “remarkable new way that is not only incomparably more thorough and
systematic in its distribution, potentially global in scale, and almost instantaneous in speed, but
so unprecedentedly interactive that it will substantially restructure the pursuit o f knowledge”
(Harnad, 1990, p. 342). Physicist Paul Ginsparg initiated arXiv in 1991, an automated
distribution archive service for preprint abstracts and papers o f physics research. The purpose o f
the preprint archive was not to replace peer-review journals, but rather “to provide equal and
uniform global access to prepublication materials” (Ginsparg, 2004). Today, arXiv has
expanded to include more research fields and is hosted by Cornell University Library, and is just
one example o f a preprint repository. These discipline-specific and institutional repositories
were transforming scholarly communication, and provided a means o f scholars to share research
and manage, to some extent, their digital assets (Jones, 2006).

89

In the late 1990s, the Open Access Movement found strength with the growth o f the
World Wide Web and was coupled with the emergence o f the Open Source Initiative (OS I) and
the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). These informed the
development o f institutional repositories, and continue to inform the development o f
technologies in this area and cyberscholarship practices (Van de Sompel & Lagoze, 2000). Open
source and OAI-PMH compliant institutional repositories software began to emerge in the early
2000s: EPrints in 2000 out o f the University o f Southampton in the United Kingdom (Cervone,
2004), DSpace launched in 2002 out o f MIT (Smith et al., 2003), and the public release o f
Fedora in 2003 out o f Cornell University and the University o f Virginia (“History”, n.d).
The Preservation and Curation Communities
The landscape began to change rapidly in the mid-1990s. Technology was transforming
how people communicated, accessed information, and approached research. Computer
innovations advanced exponentially, coupled with the trend in technology to be faster, smaller,
and more affordable. The World Wide Web was conceived o f in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a
scientist at CERN; in 1993 it was released into the public domain and began to flourish. The key
concerns o f research communities that drove the early endeavors prior to the 1990s continued to
inform and propel the later efforts as interest began to increase. Attention in the archive and
library communities shifted from improving their traditional services to learning how to function
and stay relevant in this new environment.
The Preservation Community
A key 1996 report acted as a catalyst pushing the digital preservation agenda to the
forefront o f the discussion in archives and libraries. Previous conversations centered on issues,
such as improving access to library holdings, data archiving for scientific progress, and archival
90

appraisal o f electronic records.

In 1994, RLG and the Commission on Preservation and Access

(CPA) assembled the Task Force on Digital Archiving to investigate “continued access
indefinitely into the future o f records stored in digital electronic form" (W aters & Garrett, 1996,
p. iii). A draft o f the publication Preserving Digital Information was available for comment in
1995, and the final version o f the report was published in 1996. This significant report identified
the technological, strategic, and conceptual issues o f digital preservation. Importantly, it
differentiated between digital archives and digital libraries, stressing that digital libraries tended
to focus on access issues, not on the longevity o f digital content.
Australia forged ahead as leaders in digital preservation initiatives and research. The
National Library o f Australia (NLA) established one o f the first digital preservation sections in
1995. In 1996, NLA established the web archive, Preserving and Accessing Networked
Documentary Resources o f Australia (PANDORA), to archive online material relating to
Australia and Australians (Webb, 2002). That same year, Brewster Kahle founded the Internet
Archive in the United States with a less selective mission o f creating an internet library (Lyman
and Kahle, 1998). The following year, in 1997, the Preserving Access to Digital Information
Safekeeping project (PADI) was established to provide a gateway to digital preservation
resources to help the archive, library, and preservation communities remain up-to-date with best
practices, developments, and progress in the field (Webb, 2002; National Library o f Australia,
n.d.).
Developments in Australia informed early thinking about digital curation and
preservation in the international community. By the mid-1990s the concept o f the records
continuum rather than the traditional lifecycle approach to archives and records management
practices was formally articulated. In the Records Continuum, the boundary between records

91

manager and archivist is blurred because management o f a record is conceived o f as a continuous
process across space and time. The model provides an integrated framework for recordkeeping
systems in which the stages o f a record's activity, from creation to maintenance and use,
transition seamlessly or exist concurrently (Upward, 1994). This perspective informed lifecycle
approaches to digital curation, in which early intervention is critical to longevity and the cycle
perpetuates continuously with the reuse and transformation o f data. In 2002, the National
Archives o f Australia (NAA) published a Green Paper o f their approach to digital preservation.
In the paper, the authors outlined the Performance Model, an approach to digital records that
treats them as a dynamic action, or a performance, rather than a static object (Heslop, Davis, &
Wilson, 2002). The NLA also played the central role in writing UNESCO’s Guidelines fo r the

Preservation o f Digital Heritage in 2003.
With these new challenges and the drive for finding solutions came increased funding
opportunities for digital preservations projects. JISC was founded in 1993 as an advisory
committee to funding bodies in the United Kingdom with the mission “to provide vision and
leadership to universities, to stimulate innovation and fund research into technology
developments for the benefit o f all universities and colleges” (JISC, n.d.). JISC managed the
funding for the eLib program that funded research in digital libraries in the 1990s and also co­
funded the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) in 2004. In 1996, the Institute o f Museum and
Library Services (IMLS) was established by the Library and Museum Services Act, combining
the Institute o f Museum Services and the Library Programs Office. At the same time IMLS was
created, the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) was also enacted, earmarking grant
funds for technological innovations, resource sharing, and interoperability (United States 108th
Congress, 2003). As part o f this, the IMLS funded a large number o f cultural heritage

92

digitization projects in the late 1990s and early 2000s (Institute o f Museum and Library Services,
2003).
An early and influential funding body was the European Commission, which launched
their research and development framework programmes in the early 1980s to improve innovation
and collaboration among European researchers. As noted above, support for the library
community occurred as early as 1990, from the Third and Fourth Framework Programmes, with
the launch o f the Telematics for Libraries Programme. Funding continued to increase throughout
the later programmes, focusing on research and development projects for digital preservation.
Between 2001 and 2011 the European Commission awarded over 90 million Euros for projects
related to digital preservation (Strodl, Petrov, & Rauber, 2011; European Commission, 2001;
Johnson, 1996). These projects included ERPANET (Electronic Resource Preservation and
Access Network, 2001-2004), the DELOS Network o f Excellence on Digital Libraries (20042007), Digital Preservation Europe (DPE, 2006-2009), and Planets (Preservation and Long-term
Access through Networked Services, 2006-2010).
The increased recognition o f the potential benefits o f collaboration in the digital
preservation agenda, both nationally and internationally, was not only for research and
development but also for community and infrastructure building. In 2000, the Library o f
Congress entered the digital preservation conversation and launched the National Digital
Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP). NDIIPP was interested in
cooperative efforts to strengthen networks and community, build a national infrastructure for
digital preservation, and achieve shared solutions (Library o f Congress. 2002). The Digital
Preservation Coalition was established in the United Kingdom in 2001 as an institutional
membership organization, to foster partnerships and cooperative projects. With funding support

93

and expanding networks, collaborative and interdisciplinary projects, research, and best practices
for the preservation o f digital records increased through the 2000s.
The Curation Community
The phrase “digital curation” was originally coined from discussions about the long-term
management and preservation o f research data. The first use o f the phrase can be traced back to
an invitational seminar. Digital Curation: Digital Archives, Libraries and e-Science Seminar ,
sponsored by the Digital Preservation Coalition and the British National Space Centre, held in
London in October 2001 (Beagrie, 2006; Beagrie & Pothen, 2001). The term curation had
already been used in various contexts outside o f libraries and museums, including as a critical
component o f database management and publication in the biological sciences, and it had been
introduced as an aspect o f the information infrastructure for the United Kingdom E-Science
Programme (Taylor, 2001). Discussions about using the term curation in this context were
further advanced at a task force meeting in 2002 to discuss a strategy for establishing an
infrastructure for maintaining research data in the United Kingdom (Ray, 2012; MacDonald &
Lord, 2003).
These meetings culminated in the launch o f the United Kingdom’s Digital Curation
Centre (DCC) in 2004, jointly funded by JISC and the Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council’s e-Science Core Programme. The DCC is a collaborative research and
development initiative led by the University o f Edinburgh, HATH at the University o f Glasgow,
UKOLN at the University o f Bath, and the Science and Technology Facilities Council. The
DCC defines digital curation as “maintaining, preserving and adding value to digital research
data throughout its lifecycle” (Digital Curation Center, n.d.b). Although the DCC’s definition o f
digital curation still reflects a focus on research data, definitions used by other initiatives, such as

94

the University o f California Curation Center and the Digital Curation Unit at the Athens
Research Center, outwardly reflect a more comprehensive view o f digital assets.
Adopting the phrase digital curation was an effort to recognize that longevity and reuse o f
data combines the activities o f digital preservation and data curation, and is an ongoing process
influenced by complex cultural, organizational, and technical issues. The phrase attempts to
capture the position that caring for digital assets over time involves more than just the
technological aspects o f preservation or end-of-lifecycle disposition to an archive; and that
digital assets require active management from the point o f creation and throughout their
lifecycle, including adding value through annotation, contextual documentation, and metadata.
Digital curation, as a phenomenon, necessitates top-down organizational support and bottom-up
cultural changes influencing how individuals manage their data. By consolidating the activities
o f digital preservation and data curation, and their communities, the area o f digital curation
attempts to address shared problems and solutions across all digital content types and formats
(Beagrie, 2006; Dallas, 2007).
Summary
In this chapter I presented a narrative o f the historical developments leading up to the
emergence o f digital curation. Some o f the earliest efforts for preserving, sharing, and making
accessible digital assets began within the research communities, with social and physical science
data archives and curated databases in the biological sciences. Early reflections about machinereadable records at NARA in the United States focused on appraisal issues and the “recordncss"
o f this form o f media. Discussions about the preservation o f electronic records in the archival
literature gradually developed. NARA received its first electronic record transfer in 1970. Prior
to the 1990s, library communities focused their efforts on using computers for bibliographic

95

control o f their holdings and automation o f library catalogs using online public access catalogs
(OPACs). Interest and research in the digital library movement began in earnest in the 1990s.
More recently, the case for libraries, especially large research libraries, to play a role in data
archiving, curation, and management has been strongly argued.
A key 1996 report. Preserving Digital Information, acted as a catalyst for pushing the
digital preservation agenda to the forefront o f the discussion in archives and libraries. This
report identified the technological, strategic, and conceptual issues o f digital preservation. With
these new preservation challenges came increased funding opportunities for collaborative
research and development projects. Coining the phrase “digital curation’’ in 2001 was an effort
to recognize that longevity and reuse o f data combines the activities o f digital preservation and
data curation, and is an ongoing process influenced by complex cultural, organizational, and
technical issues. The term emerged from discussions about the long-term management and
preservation o f research data; however current use o f the term digital curation reflects a more
comprehensive view o f digital assets.
In the next chapter, I review relevant literature about education and curriculum
development in the area o f digital curation. Roles and responsibilities o f researchers and
information professionals have changed in response to activities related to digital curation and
these new responsibilities require new skills and competencies. The purpose o f this chapter is to
emphasize the function o f education in the discussion o f the potential emergence o f digital
curation as a discipline.

96

CHAPTER 5: DIGITAL CURATION IN THE LIS/ARCHIVE CURRICULA
In this chapter I review relevant literature about education and curriculum development in
the area o f digital curation. This chapter situates digital curation curriculum development within
higher education, specifically within LIS and archival programs. It also discusses continuing
education, professional development, and training in response to the changing roles and
responsibilities with regard to activities related to digital curation. The function o f this chapter is
to emphasize the role o f education as a key criterion for identifying an emerging discipline.
This chapter is organized in four main sections. The first section, Emerging Roles and
Responsibilities, provides an overview o f literature that addresses knowledge and skill gaps and
the need for professionals educated and trained in digital curation. The second section,
Identifying Core Competencies, is a review o f relevant literature that has identified knowledge
and skill requirements for activities related to digital curation. The third section, Curriculum
Development, examines curriculum development, professional training opportunities, and
pedagogical approaches in the area o f digital curation. The final section, Outlook, is a review o f
relevant literature that provides analysis o f the implementation and outcomes o f these curricular
developments.
Emerging Roles and Responsibilities
In 1997, the president o f the Commission on Preservation and Access and the Council on
Library Resources noted: “The role o f the librarian o f the twenty-first century will bear little
resemblance to that o f the typical librarian today - on this there is nearly universal agreement”
(Marcum, 1997, p. 35). We have increasingly witnessed new technology-focused
responsibilities and IT skills added to traditional roles, new data-eentered positions added to
library departments, and new specializations added to education programs (Xia & Wang, 2014;

97

Cox & Corrall, 2013; Goetsch, 2008; Khurshid, 2003). However, several authors have identified
gaps in the education o f LIS and archives curricula for skills and knowledge related to digital
curation. In their chapter on education in Aligning National Approaches to Digital Preservation ,
Davidson, Corrall, Coulboume, and Rauber (2012) observe that “ if education and professional
development training in the library and information science sector do not evolve to cover data
management and curation, there is a risk that librarians and other information specialists will not
be able to contribute appropriately to the management o f research data" (p. 276).
Advances in technology have not only influenced how archivists and librarians perform
their work but have created new roles and responsibilities that require a new knowledge and
skills base. In a comprehensive literature review and content analysis, Allard, Mack and FeltnerReichert (2005) identified six new requirements o f librarians working in institutional
repositories: understanding institutional repository software; project planning, management, and
implementation; defining collections; metadata guidance and standards; reviewing institutional
repository submissions; and training contributors and users o f the institutional repositories. The
researchers concluded that the role o f librarians is adapting to meet the needs o f this new
information environment. In a 2009 study that looked at job advertisements for positions in
academic libraries, Choi and Rasmussen confirmed that there has been a shift in staffing needs
towards qualifications in digital collections, services, and technology applications. The
researchers note:
While confirming many anecdotal discussions on new skills needed o f library
professionals in the digital environment, the result sheds light on the changing
requirements for library professionals who are equipped to meet these new challenges.

98

This change brings new demands for professional skills and expertise which must be met
by enhancing professional development, training, and education (p. 466).
Although the primary purpose o f the study centered on digital libraries, its scope included other
professional library positions with “digital” in the position title, department name, or duties and
qualifications (Choi & Rasmussen, 2009).
These emerging roles and responsibilities necessitate clear definitions. In a report
commissioned by JISC about career trajectories and education in data management and data
science in the United Kingdom, Swan and Brown (2008) identified four distinct roles: data
authors or creators, data scientists or specialists, data managers, and data librarians or archivists.
The authors recognized that responsibilities for these roles not only overlap but the descriptions
o f the roles are not consistent within the data community. The authors concluded that the role
and career trajectory for data librarians needs to be formalized and defined, along with
appropriate curricula (Swan & Brown, 2008). At present, a consensus study is being conducted
that delineates the diversity o f digital curation roles, career paths, and employment opportunities;
the variety o f skill sets required; and education and training models. The study, Future Career

Opportunities and Educational Requirements fo r Digital Curation, is funded by the Institute o f
Museum and Library Services (IMLS), National Science Foundation (NSF), and Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation (Board on Research Data and Information, n.d.). Although the report was due out
the first half o f 2014, as o f November 2014 it had yet to be made publically available.
Archives and libraries are also faced with establishing their role in the burgeoning
cyberinfrastructure, and adapting to changes in scholarship that places emphasis not just on
publication o f results, but on data as a core output o f research. For example, academic libraries
are increasingly involved in research data curation and e-science services. Hey and Hey (2006)

99

remarked that ‘th e e-Science revolution will put libraries and repositories centre stage in the
development o f the next generation research infrastructure” (p. 526). A number o f libraries have
expanded their instruction services to include data management training, in the form o f librarysponsored workshops as well as collaborative efforts for integrating data management skills into
the curriculum (Adamick, Reznik-Zellen, & Sheridan, 2012; Johnston. Lafferty, & Petsan, 2012;
Piorun et al„ 2012).
Several surveys to date have investigated the role o f the library in the institutional
repository landscape. A 2009 Australian study found that, for the most part, Australian
institutional repositories were the responsibility o f the institution’s library and in turn 71.1%
were headed by an individual with a library background (Kennan & Kingsley, 2009). A 2010
United Kingdom study found a similar result: 78.6% o f staff working in United Kingdom
repositories possessed a library and information science background (Wickham, 2010).
Although information professionals are taking on these new roles and responsibilities
related to digital curation, their contributions lack recognition within the wider research and
professional communities. A 2012 Italian study found that although the repository manager is
the most important role in Italian institutional repositories, the positions were often part-time,
highlighting a lack o f professional recognition. The study’s authors also note that the current
higher education curricula did not meet the needs o f this new role (Cassella & Morando, 2012).
In a 2012 German survey o f researchers from eleven disciplines reported by Osswald and
Strathmann (2012), the study’s investigators found that there was no clear role defined for library
involvement in curation and preservation o f research data, although there was a ‘‘broad
understanding that methodological expertise o f libraries and librarians would be helpful to
improve research data-related activities o f scientists and research institutions” (p. 8). The

100

authors o f the report concluded with a call to redesign LIS curricula to include competencies for
digital curation and preservation o f research data.
Indentifying Core Competencies
The improvement o f educational and training opportunities in this area involves
identifying the new knowledge and skills base required for information professionals engaged in
activities related to digital curation. A document published by the Securing a Hybrid
Environment for Research Preservation and Access (SHERPA) project in 2008, and updated in
2009 and 2011, was developed to assist writing jo b descriptions for institutional repositories
staff. The document identifies two key roles, repository managers and repository administrators,
and eight responsibility and skill areas: management; software; metadata and interoperability
standards; storage and preservation; content, including familiarity with intellectual property
rights; advocacy, training, and support; communication; and current awareness and professional
development. The document does not focus on any particular repository type or position within
a repository, but rather covers the spectrum o f abilities, knowledge, and skills needed for the
development and management o f any institutional repository, and therefore can be realized in a
combination o f various staff roles and external partners (Pryor & Donnelly, 2009; Robinson,
2009; Wickham, 2011).
At a 2008 meeting o f the Research Data M anagement Forum (RDMF) participants
identified a set o f core skills needed by people in the data management sector using the four roles
identified by Swan and Brown (2008) as a guide. RDMF is a United Kingdom-based group that
encourages dialogue among the diverse stakeholders engaged in data management activities and
is sponsored by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) and the Research Information Network
(RIN). Although the group acknowledged some responsibilities belonging uniquely to each role,

101

there existed a number o f essential core skills, including metadata, preservation, and standards
development that were needed by multiple roles (Pryor & Donnelly, 2009; Swan & Brown,
2008). This further illustrates that there are not yet clear boundaries between these positions.
Several studies have identified core competencies for professionals engaged in activities
related to digital curation in order to directly inform curriculum development. In a 2008 study,
researchers from the DigCCurr project team at the University o f North Carolina at Chapel Hill
conducted a survey o f information professionals working in the area o f digital curation and
preservation to help inform their curriculum development project. Survey respondents identified
a strong need to emphasize the functions o f preservation planning and implementation in a core
curriculum, followed by description, organization, and intellectual control. An emphasis on
administration planning, establishing policies and standards, and data management followed
closely. Respondents ranked technical skills, practical experience, and interpersonal skills
highest for desired professional competencies when filling a job vacancy (Tibbo, Hank, & Lee,
2008). An analysis o f job advertisements was undertaken as part o f the University o f North
Texas’ curriculum development project iCAMP (Information: Curate, Archive, Manage,
Preserve) to identify skills needed to perform essential jo b functions associated with digital
curation. The research identified seven core competency areas including communication and
interpersonal skills; curation and preservation skills; knowledge o f curation services,
technologies, and tools; management and planning; and familiarity o f systems and models (Kim,
Warga, & Moen, 2013).
In an effort to extend the data curation curriculum at the University o f Illinois at Urbana
Champaign to include humanities data, researchers conducted a study to better understand the
roles and skill sets o f information professionals working with digital humanities data.

102

Researchers conducted a series o f interviews with directors and senior staff o f digital humanities
centers. Skills relating to interoperability, markup, database design, and metadata were highly
ranked by all respondents, and most respondents gave a high rank to project management skills
and instruction. Researchers found a range o f desired skills with little consensus among
respondents (Munoz, Varvel, Renear, Trainor, & Dolan, 2011).
Other research has focused on identifying competencies for curriculum development for
eScience information professionals. Using a combination o f interviews and focus groups,
researchers at Syracuse University conducted a job analysis study focusing on the core
competencies o f eScience professionals. Researchers identified a range o f skills that centered on
three key functional areas: skills related to data such as data curation activities; skills related to
things such as maintaining hardware or managing budgets; and skills related to people such as
communication and interpersonal skills. These findings translated into ten recommended courses
for preparing eScience professionals (Kim, Addom, & Stanton, 2011; Stanton et al., 2011). In
2013 researchers at Wuhan University in China conducted a study designed to improve eScience
education in the Chinese LIS curriculum. From an analysis o f jo b advertisements, mostly from
the United States, the study found that the key functions o f eScience specialists included
consultation and reference services for data curation, instruction and training on data curation,
and creation o f metadata standards. The top required qualifications were soft skills, namely
teamwork, communication, and interpersonal skills, followed by familiarity with data curation
tools and technologies. The top preferred qualifications were a second advanced degree,
knowledge o f library and information science, and familiarity with metadata standards (Si,
Zhuang, Xing, & Guo, 2 0 13). Recommended coursework differed between the two studies;
however researchers from both studies recommended courses in research methods, database

103

management, introduction to data curation, and overview o f the cyberinfrastructure and eScience
environment.
Curriculum Development
The archival profession has long recognized the impact o f technology on archival records
and practice, and the need to diversify their skill sets and knowledge base and stay abreast o f the
changing technological landscape; however response in archival education has been slow. In
1993, at a time when archival education was still developing, Cox noted that although archivists
understood the impact o f electronic records and automated techniques on the profession, archival
educators were remiss in incorporating these areas into curriculum. Stielow (1993) questioned
whether the traditional skill set o f archivists, such as paleography and concepts o f intrinsic or
artifactual value, still applied to digital records that were “not fixed in time and place but
characterized by mutability” and could be “constantly updated or combined into new records” or
“written at diverse times and places by multiple authors” and “copied or transmitted without
differentiating them from the originals” (p. 61-62). Stielow advocated for a model o f archival
education that integrated information technology into the curriculum, rather than offering
separate and special courses.
The challenge remains how to establish an archival curriculum that provides core archival
knowledge and sufficiently incorporates information technology. Tibbo (2006) found that
although there are technology courses available as electives in archival programs, few students
arc able to take them because LIS core courses and archival requirements, including a practicum,
crowd their credit hours. Still, a 2012 Scandinavian study o f archivists working with electronic
records in local governments found that there is still a need for archival education to address new
competencies and increase technology requirements in the curriculum (Kallberg, 2012).

104

With the recognition o f new roles and responsibilities o f information professionals and
efforts to identify core competencies required for activities related to digital curation, graduatelevel and continuing education in these areas needed improvement. In their 2008 JISC report,
Swan and Brown note:
Library educators have an important role to play in planning for and delivering
appropriately skilled people to meet the latent demand for data librarians to manage the
libraries’ potential data curation role. Yet very few library' and information science
schools currently teach the skills that future data librarians will need (p. 25).
A 2011 study o f repository staff in Australia and New Zealand found that for the most part,
respondents reported that on-the-job training was their primary method o f acquiring needed
skills. Further, 83% o f respondents reported having never been exposed to digital repositories in
their formal education even though 54% had library and information science degrees and 15%
had information technology degrees (Simons & Richardson, 2012).
Several cooperative international initiatives were launched to address these curricular
concerns in higher education. The International Data Curation Education Action (IDEA)
Working Group held four meetings during 2008 - 2009. The working group, organized by the
DCC, IMLS, and the School o f Information and Library Science at the University o f North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, was formed to explore international collaboration for the development
and progress for data curation education and training curricula (Hank and Davidson, 2009; Ray,
2009).

In 2011, JISC sponsored the International Curation Education (ICE) Forum; in

attendance were many o f the same participants o f the IDEA Working Group. The questions that
guided the ICE Forum focused on forms o f digital curation education needed, current approaches

105

to education, the skill and knowledge gaps that need to be addressed, and ways that educators
and trainers can most effectively share resources (Kilbride & Molloy. 2011).
Several o f the efforts to develop higher education digital curation curriculum focused on
cooperative and shared outcomes. For example, the second phase o f the German project
Network o f Expertise in Long-Term Storage o f Digital Resources (NESTOR. 2006-2009),
identified the need for education and training in the area o f digital curation. Through
partnerships with higher education institutions, mostly in Germany, they provided training as
well as support for graduate-level curriculum development. The project partners maintained
their collaboration after the end o f the project phase and continue to provide education and
training opportunities (Schrimpf, 2009). DigCCurr (Preserving Access to Our Digital Future:
Building an International Digital Curation Curriculum, 2006-2013) was a two-phase IMLS grantfunded project at University o f North Carolina at Chapel Hill in collaboration with the National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The DigCCurr project set out to accomplish
several key tasks: create an openly accessible digital curation curricular framework; provide
doctoral education opportunities with the goal to prepare future faculty for research and teaching
in the area o f digital curation; extend education to the professional community through
professional institutes and training; and create an environment for educational networks and
community building through regular symposiums, meetings, and the Digital Curation Exchange
web portal (Tibbo, Hank, & Lee, 2008; Lee, Tibbo, & Schaefer, 2007; Hank, Tibbo, & Lee,
2010). The digital curation curriculum framework is designed as a six-dimensional matrix to aid
in the development o f curricula by endorsing core areas o f knowledge and skills. The six
dimensions, each detailed and supported by research, are: mandates, values, and principles;
functions and skills; professional, disciplinary, or institutional/organizational context; type o f

106

resource; prerequisite knowledge; and transition point in the information continuum. The
framework was created to be openly accessible, scalable, and extensible (Lee & Tibbo, 2011).
Other projects were designed for more local application, focusing on establishing
concentrations in specific masters-level program. One o f the earliest specializations within an
LIS curriculum emerged out o f the IMLS grant-funded Data Curation Education Program
(DCEP) at the Graduate School o f Library and Information Science at University o f Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. The program was awarded funding in 2006 to create a data curation
specialization and host annual professional summer institutes (Palmer, Thompson, Baker, &
Senseney, 2014). The specialization was later expanded to include coursework in digital
humanities data (Renear, Mufioz, & Trainor, 2010). Additional grant funding was obtained in
2011 to support Data Curation Education in Research Centers (DCERC), a program designed to
provide students with field experience. DCERC is a collaborative undertaking between the
University o f Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University o f Tennessee at Knoxville, and the
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) (Palmer, Allard, & Marlino, 2011). The
School o f Information at the University o f Michigan established a Preservation o f Information
specialization in 2007 to more directly attend to digital curation education. The specialization
assumes a holistic approach to preservation across all media and formats, rather than educating
for analog and digital materials separately (Yakel, Conway, Hedstrom, & Wallace, 2011; Yakel,
Conway, & Krause, 2009).
In the United Kingdom and Europe, the occurrence o f degree granting programs rather
than specializations is on the rise. Aberystwyth University in Wales, Kings College in London,
and Robert Gordon University in Scotland offer M aster’s degrees in Digital Curation. The
Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute (HATII) at the University o f

107

Glasgow, recognized for its leadership in digital curation and preservation education and
research since its establishment in 1997. offers a M aster’s degree in Information Management &
Preservation (Digital)/(Archives & Records M anagement). In Italy, a M aster in Education,
M anagement and Preservation o f Digital Archives (Formazione. gestione e conservazione degli

archivi digitalis FGCAD) is offered jointly by the University o f Macerata and the University o f
Padua. A recently established degree granting program at the University o f Turin focuses on
preparing information professionals for careers in digital curation, an area they approach as
encompassing multiple roles and shared responsibilities. The curriculum therefore highlights not
only competencies and skills for sustainable digital preservation, but also communication and
team-building with information technology specialists, computer scientists, and other
stakeholders (Vivarelli, Cassella, & Valacchi, 2013).
Several schools have launched post-graduate certificate programs to address the
knowledge and skills needed to supplement current LIS and archive curricula. For instance, the
School o f Information Studies at Syracuse University offers a Certificate o f Advanced Study in
Data Science, the School o f Library and Information Science at Simmons College offers an
online post-master’s Digital Stewardship Certificate, and the School o f Information and Library
Science at the University o f North Carolina at Chapel Hill offers a Graduate Certificate in Digital
Curation and a post-masters Certificate in Data Curation. Currently, in its last year o f IMLS
funding, the iCAMP project at the University o f North Texas seeks to develop a competencybased curriculum for their Digital Curation and Data M anagement Graduate Academic
Certificate. The certificate comprises four online courses aimed at three primary audiences:
current LIS students, post-m aster’s LIS professionals, and graduate students in any discipline

108

tasked with research data management (Halbert, 2013; Moen, Kim, Warga, Wakefield, &
Halbert, 2012; Moen, Kim & Halbert, 2011).
One o f the first such certificate programs was the IMLS grant-funded Digital Information
Management certificate program at the School o f Information Resources and Library Science
(SIRLS) at the University o f Arizona, in partnership with the Arizona State Library. Archives
and Public Records (ASLAPR). The program was designed to be interdisciplinary to reach a
diverse audience o f information professionals (Fulton, Botticelli, & Bradley, 2011; Botticelli,
Fulton, Pearce-Moses, Szuter, & Watters, 2011). In determining how to integrate digital curation
competencies into the curriculum, SIRLS opted for a certificate program to signal “its intention
to expand the boundaries o f a traditional library/archives education, but not to redefine or replace
the core elements o f the existing m aster’s degree” (Botticelli, Fulton, Pearce-Moses, Szuter, &
Watters, 2011, p. 156).
In addition to curriculum development projects resulting in specializations or post­
graduate certificates, a number o f existing LIS and archive programs have been adding courses
to address the gap in skills related to digital media. For example, both the Library Information
and Archive Sciences Department at the University o f M alta and the School o f Information
Management at Victoria University o f Wellington, New Zealand have added digital curation
courses to their existing curricula to accommodate local needs in their small countries (Dobreva
& Oliver, 2013). Further, Bastian and Yakel (2006) conducted a study to identify an archival
core curriculum in North America and found that preservation courses were consistently offered
throughout the programs evaluated; however, only one program offered a course on digital
preservation at that time (Bastian & Yakel, 2006; Bastian, Cloonan, & Harvey, 2011). Early
findings o f an unpublished update o f their curriculum study reported by Bastian, Cloonan, and

109

Harvey (2011) found that the number o f programs offering a course on digital preservation had
increased to eleven.
Continuing Education and Professional Training
Research supports the need for continuing education and training for professionals in all
areas related to digital curation, including digital preservation and data management. A needs
assessment survey was conducted in 2010 to define United States national training needs prior to
the launch o f the Digital Preservation Outreach and Education (DPOE) initiative by the Library
o f Congress. The survey found that although the majority o f respondents had some kind o f staff
member assigned to digital preservation, only 33% reported having dedicated full or part-time
professional staff, while 49% reported that duties were assigned as needed and 14% reported
having volunteers doing digital preservation. Twenty-two percent reported having no digital
preservation staff. When asked if there were funds available in their organization for
professional development or training, 34% reported that there were no funds available. Those
reporting that there were no funds available were more likely to be from organizations with small
staff sizes (Library o f Congress, 2010).
Results o f a 2012 survey conducted as a follow-up to the DPOE training webinar found
that training needs differed somewhat between research libraries and cultural heritage
institutions. The researcher who conducted the survey concluded that the results showed a need
for free or low-cost preservation training that focused on content type, specifically bom-digital
special collections, bom-digital records, and digitized collections (DcRidder, 2013). Research as
part o f the APARSEN (Alliance for Permanent Access to the Records o f Science in Europe
Netw ork) project in 2012 supported the results o f these needs assessments, finding that the key

challenges were limitations in the availability o f training in digital preservation and securing the
funding to attend (Kilbride. Cirinna, & McMeekin, 2012).
Continuing education and professional training has developed alongside efforts in
m aster’s level LIS and archive education. Not only is this reflected in the trend o f post-graduate
certificate programs but other training efforts, such as professional institutes, have been aspects
o f several higher education curriculum development projects including DigCCurr and DCEP.
Many o f the continuing education and professional training initiatives have come out o f
collaboration with professional communities. Opportunities have increased over the past several
years with training and workshops sponsored by the Digital Curation Centre, the Digital
Preservation Roadshow and the Advanced Practitioner Training course offered by the Digital
Preservation Coalition (DPC), the Digital Preservation Training Programme run by the
University o f London Computer Centre, the Digital Archives Specialist Certificate through the
Society o f the American Archivists, and the online MANTRA
( http: datalib.cdina.ac.uk m antra )

Research Data Management Training for researchers and

information professionals.
Several o f these continuing education and professional training programs have
established curriculum frameworks and instruction models. One o f the earliest professional
training initiatives was the Digital Preservation Management Workshop and Tutorial, initially
developed by the Cornell University Library through National Endowment for the Humanities
(NEH) grant funding in 2003 (http: \\ u \\ . d p u o r k s l i u p . m u ). Currently maintained by MIT
Libraries, the Digital Preservation Management Workshop is a series o f week-long workshops
and an accompanying online tutorial. The curriculum framework for the Workshop supports

developing a digital preservation program based on sustainable organizational, technological,
and resources infrastructures (Kenney & McGovern, 2003).
The Digital Preservation Outreach and Education (DPOE) program launched by the
Library o f Congress boasts a mission to “foster national outreach and education about digital
preservation by building a collaborative network o f instructors and partners to provide training to
individuals and organizations seeking to preserve their digital content” (Library o f Congress,
n.d.). In 2010, DPOE conducted a needs assessment to identify training requirements, and then
in 2011 held their first training session. In the DPOE model, the Library o f Congress trains
professionals to conduct workshops based on the DPOE Baseline Digital Preservation
Curriculum, creating a geographically dispersed network o f trainers. The Baseline Digital
Preservation Curriculum focuses on six central themes: identify types o f digital content; select
what will be preserved; store selected content for the long-term; protect content from threats;
manage stored content; and provide access over time (Library o f Congress, n.d.).
The Digital Curator Vocational Education Europe (DigCurV) was a project funded by the
European Commission from 2011-2013 to identify and assess training needs and current training
offerings, and to establish a curriculum framework from which training programs in digital
curation can be developed or compared. The curriculum framework identifies skills and
competencies in four categories: knowledge and intellectual abilities, personal qualities,
professional conduct, and management and quality assurance. The framework provides three
lenses based on types o f staff conducting curation activities: practitioners, managers, and
executives. The skills and competencies required for each lens differs, allowing training
curriculum to be tailored based on the needs o f the audience (Molloy, Gow, & Konstantelos,
2014; Moles, 2014; Moles & Ross, 2013).

112

Pedagogy'
The pedagogy for teaching digital curation in LIS and archive programs progressed in
conjunction with the development o f new courses and curriculum. Similar to efforts in digital
library education (Mitchell, 2014a; Mitchell, 2014b; Lin & Abels, 2010; Pomerantz, Abbas, &
Mostafa. 2009). digital curation curriculum has sought to integrate technology into the
curriculum through hands-on use o f applications and tools or project-based assignments in a
laboratory setting. At the University o f Texas at Austin, the Digital Archiving and Preservation
course has incorporated hands-on assignments and project-based assignments since 2000,
providing students with direct exposure to digital materials. The learning model established by
Galloway has evolved and now the digital archiving program has a dedicated laboratory
(Galloway, 2011).
Virtual laboratories have also been established to accommodate online learning and
facilitate sharing instructional material among educators. In 2010 the School o f Library and
Information Science at Simmons College and the Department o f Information Technology and
M edia at Mid Sweden University joined together to create the Digital Curriculum Laboratory
(DCL) (Bastian, Cloonan, & Harvey, 2011; Anderson, Bastian, Harvey, Plum, & Samuclsson,
2011; Bastian, Harvey, Mahard, & Plum, 2010). The DCL contains exercises, teaching
scenarios, and digital repository applications to form a virtual workspace or “sandbox” in which
students can “ learn about and experiment with digital tools and materials in digital
environments” (Harvey & Bastian, 2012, p. 2). At Simmons, the DCL is used to enhance
teaching and learning in several o f the courses, most notably in the Preservation Management
and Cultural I Ieritage tracks and the range o f digital stewardship courses (Bastian, Cloonan, &
Harvey, 2011; Bastian, Harvey, Mahard, & Plum, 2010). The iCAMP project at the University

o f North Texas also has created a virtual laboratory for their digital curation and data
management curriculum. The virtual lab is a central part o f their vision to structure the digital
curation curriculum after the teaching hospital model, which is based on engagement, hands-on
training, and supervision (Moen, Kim, & Halbert, 2011; Helsing, Lewis, & Warga, 2013).
An internship requirement has played a central function in digital curation curriculum
development. The information disciplines have historically relied on internships to address the
application and relationship o f practical and scholarly aspects o f the field (Grogan, 2007). O f
archival education, Bastian and Webber (2008) note that “too great an emphasis on internships
may reduce archival education to mere training, but with no practical learning at all, students are
ill-equipped to enter a workplace that places a high value on experience” (p. 15). Library and
information science education programs, including archive and records management, continue to
rely on practicum or internship components as part o f their curriculum.
Several programs require internships specific to their digital curation specializations.
Internships provide the basis for DCERC. DCERC provides graduate students specializing in
data curation field experience (Palmer, Allard, & Marlino, 2011). The Preservation o f
Information specialization at the School o f Information at University o f M ichigan has always
required field experience through the School’s Practical Engagement Program. However,
identifying internships for digital curation and preservation students in an area that is still
maturing is challenging. To adapt to these challenges, faculty at the University o f Michigan
combined internships with a cognitive apprenticeship model, allowing instructors to co-mentor
students while in the field (Yakel, Conway, & Krause, 2009). San Jose State University in
California and Victoria University o f Wellington in New Zealand have piloted a virtual
internship project to support digital curation education and promote an international community

114

o f practice. San Jose State University offers an online m aster's degree with an internship option.
The virtual internship model opens up new opportunities for students in the digital curation
career path (Franks & Oliver, 2012).
Outlook
Archival and LIS higher education curricula and continuing education have responded to
the new roles and responsibilities o f information professionals, and the gap in competencies
related to digital curation in the workforce that has been identified. The studies o f graduates
from new programs related to digital curation, although limited, have provided positive
comments about experiences and preparation for employment, and valuable feedback for
continued improvements (Palmer, Thompson, Baker, & Senseney, 2014; Gregory & Guss,
2011). However, there is a diversity o f potential roles in the digital arena, and the LIS and
archive curricula in the area o f digital curation are still maturing. A 2012 CLIR report noted that
LIS students “must be committed to constructing a data-intensive education for them selves.. .in
order to come out o f most existing United States LIS programs with the skills and knowledge
necessary to support the needs o f data-intensive research” (Keralis, 2012, p. 35).
Apprehension remains as to whether LIS and archive educational programs are
responding adequately and quickly enough to prepare professionals for managing digital assets.
In a study o f course catalogs from 26 iSchools in 2009, only one third offered a digital
preservation course. An analysis o f the syllabi from those course showed that the focus was on
theoretical concepts rather than technology skills (Costello, 2010). A 2012 study that looked at
52 LIS schools in North American found that only one-third offered data or digital curation
courses. A closer look at the syllabi showed that topics varied significantly, and no two courses
were alike (Harris-Pierce & Liu, 2012). A 2012 study by researchers at the University o f Illinois

115

at Urbana-Champaign examined data curation at 55 iSchools or other LIS schools at the program
level, for instance, those that offer advanced certificates. M aster’s degrees, or specializations. O f
those schools, 11 institutions offered programs that focused exclusively on data curation, data
management, or data science; 12 offered programs that had components related to data topics;
and 15 institutions offered programs with an emphasis on digital topics, not necessarily research
data, relevant to data professionals. O f note, the terminology used to identify and define these
different programs varied significantly (Varvel, Bammerlin, & Palmer, 2012). These studies
illustrate that there is not yet consistency across higher education curricula for course offerings
or course content in the area o f digital curation.
There are concerns that functions and practices o f libraries and archives are not evolving
as quickly as the needs o f researchers and users working in the digital environment. These
concerns impact the potential roles o f information professionals working with digital materials.
For example, a 2012 CL1R report found that researchers have a different perception o f the
library’s role than does the library. The authors o f the report observe that “ few researchers see
the library as a partner, and most o f the researchers ... regard the library as a dispensary o f goods
rather than a locus for badly needed, real-time professional support” (Jahnkc & Asher, 2012, p.
16). Additionally, in an article about the function o f libraries in e-Science, Heidorn (2011)
contends that “if libraries do not actively engage in the task, then society may choose to create a
new type o f institution to curate digital data” (p. 670). Information professionals view
themselves as a central component o f the multifaceted digital landscape providing a significant
and unique expertise and perspective. Effective education and training is a key factor for
archives and libraries to remain relevant in the changing technological landscape.

116

Summary
In this chapter I reviewed relevant literature related to the growth o f educational and
training opportunities in the area o f digital curation. Advances in technology have not only
influenced how information professionals perform their work and the materials they work with,
but have also created new roles and responsibilities that require new competencies. Gaps in the
knowledge and skills base related to the area o f digital curation have been observed. In response,
several grant-funded projects have aimed to identify core competencies and develop graduatelevel curricula. As a result o f these efforts, there has been an increase in courses and programs
related to digital curation, including post-graduate certificates and specializations in archival or
LIS degrees, as well as professional training opportunities. However, concern remains about
whether the fields o f archival studies and LIS will be able to keep pace with the rapidly
expanding area o f digital curation.
The next three chapters comprise the findings and discussion. Five major themes
emerged from the data analysis. Part one explores the themes o f terminology and collaboration;
part two explores the themes o f multiple discipline engagement and education; and part three
explores the theme o f areas o f professional and scholarly focus and provides a summary o f all
five themes.

117

CHAPTER 6: FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: PART I
This research was designed to investigate whether the area o f digital curation is emerging
as an autonomous discipline. The purpose o f this study was to explore the character,
development, and education o f digital curation by conducting an in-depth analysis o f how this
area is evolving. This dissertation employed a qualitative multimethod research design. Data
were collected from scoping the literature, content analysis o f published literature in the area o f
digital curation, and semi-structured interviews with individuals engaged in the area. This study
focused on identifying themes that emerged from the practical and scholarly discourse, and
understanding the level o f consensus among educators, practitioners, and researchers about how
they view this domain.
The findings and discussion are presented thematically in Chapters Six, Seven, and Eight.
Five major themes emerged from the data analysis:
•

Terminology. Defined as words or phrases used to identify the area o f practice and
research related to digital curation.

•

Collaboration. Defined as any instance or mention o f two or more people or
institutions cooperating, sharing resources, or working together for mutual benefit or
to achieve shared goals.

•

Multiple discipline engagement. Defined as any instance or mention o f two or more
people or institutions from different disciplines or fields working together, or the
combination and application o f concepts, methods, practices, or theories from two or
more distinct disciplines or fields.

•

Education. Defined as any comment about educating or training professionals for
activities and employment related to digital curation.

118

•

Areas ofprofessional and scholarly focus. Defined as a descriptive summary o f the
main subject matters that characterize the area o f digital curation represented in the
sample o f published literature analyzed in this study.

Table 6.1 shows how these themes were mapped to the elements o f a discipline that were defined
by the conceptual framework.

This chapter is Part I o f the findings and discussion and is organized in two main
sections. In the first section, I convey in detail the findings and discussion for the theme o f
terminology. In the second section, I present the findings and discussion for the theme o f
collaboration.
119

Theme One: Terminology
Terminology was the first theme that emerged from the data analysis. The theme o f
terminology was defined as words or phrases used to identity the area o f practice and research
related to digital curation. The theme was derived from codes for definitions o f relevant terms,
language used for collaborative initiatives and educational programs, and terms used to refer to
the field, subareas, and related areas.
The terminology theme mapped to the “discursive com munity'’ element from the
conceptual framework. A discursive community is a group o f people who advance and perform
common practices o f communication such as patterns o f citation, norms for scholarly writing,
approaches to knowledge claims, and shared terminology. Through socialization within a
discipline and assimilation by faculty and graduate students o f these common practices, “a
discipline becomes a ‘discursive community’ in which participants converse with each other in a
common language in the hope o f recognition” by others from w ithin the same community (Post,
2009, p. 766)
One criterion o f the discursive community element is having shared “field-specific jargon
or terminologies” (D ’Agostino, 2012, p. 336). Learning “discipline-specific terminologies”
assists to indoctrinate faculty and students into a discipline (Embree, 2010, p. 8) and, in turn,
sustain the discursive community or discipline. However, shared terminology serves to do more
than facilitate communication and enhance disciplinary socialization. Krishnan (2009) contends
that “ in academia, disciplinary languages are developed at least in part with the goal o f
protecting knowledge and disciplinary identity from outside infringement” (p. 23). Therefore, a
shared terminology creates a sense o f community and suggests a unified means o f
communication and a collective disciplinary identity, and asserts ownership o f a subject area.

120

Terminology: Scoping the Literature
Scoping the literature provided an in-depth look at the use o f eight key search terms (data

archiving, data curation, data preservation, data stewardship, digital archiving, digital curation,
digital preservation, and digital stewardship) in published literature from 2001-2012. Table 6.2
shows the number o f articles retrieved per search term and the percentage o f the total for which
those articles account. The table includes the year in which the search term first appeared in an
article from the sample and how many articles occurred before 2001. O f note, the scoping the

A closer look at the results o f the literature survey reveals trends in the use o f each term
by year. T he findings from scoping the literature clearly convey digital preservation as the most
frequently used term in the sample from 2001-2012. This trend continued with digital

preservation making up over half o f the sample each year from 2001 through 2010. In 2011 the
combination o f the other keywords began to outnumber the use o f digital preservation. Over the
twelve-year time period the findings show data curation and digital curation rise in use; data

archiving, data preservation, and digital archiving remain somewhat consistent; data
stewardship and digital preservation begin to dip in use; and digital stewardship having little
impact.
Figure 6.1 shows the cumulative number o f articles per search term retrieved by year.
Overall, the figure shows an obvious increase o f articles being published in this area and an
increase in the diversity o f terms used. Figure 6.2 shows the same data, but normalized as
percentages to present the relative changes in use. Overall, the figure shows a relative decrease in
the use o f digital preservation and a relative increase in the use o f data as a qualifier.

The Digital Curation Centre (DCC) in the United Kingdom was pivotal in the adoption
and diffusion o f digital curation as a phrase to express the lifecycle approach to long-term access,
management, and preservation o f both digital cultural heritage and research data. The findings
clearly show the term digital curation emerge in 2001. After two years with no articles in the
sample, it appeared again in 2004, the year that the DCC was established, and has since showed a
steady increase in use. Until 2006, all o f the articles retrieved using digital curation as a search
term were either briefs that discussed the launch o f the DCC or were authored by people directly
involved with the DCC. One exception was a life science article published in 2005 that used an
alternative definition o f digital curation as meaning the curation o f web content such as social
media and personal digital information. In 2006, the sample shows authorship slowly began to
diversify beyond DCC-associated authors and use o f the term expand. Additional support o f the
phrase digital curation came in 2005 when the Institute o f Museum and Library Services (IMLS)
in the United States announced a call for grant proposals to support the development o f digital
curation education programs. Soon after that, in 2007 the Digital Curation Unit (DCU) was
launched as a research, development, and education center in Greece.
The findings from scoping the literature also show that the use o f data as the qualifier
appears to increase over the sample period in relation to digital as the qualifier. Data curation ,
in particular, has increased at roughly the same pace as digital curation. The five items
identified that occurred before 2001 comprised three articles on data curation and interoperability
o f curated databases in the life sciences, and two about data curation and data management for
museums. The increased use o f data as a qualifier implies a growing interest in the management
o f digital research data, which is not surprising. The research community has long been
responsive to the value o f data archiving. As early as 2000, a draft o f the Open Archival

124

Information System (OAIS) Reference Model was circulated. It was originally developed to
address the swelling amounts o f space science data. In 2003, the National Institutes o f Health
(NIH) published a statement on data sharing and began requiring a data sharing plan with
research grant applications. Also in 2003, the National Science Foundation (NSF) Blue Ribbon
Advisory Panel on Cyberinfrastructure released their report on the curation, management, and
preservation o f large data sets in engineering and sciences. Two years later, several multi­
disciplinary teams were assembled to draft a vision for cyberinfrastructure which was published
in 2007 (National Science Foundation, 2007a). Also in 2007, the NSF announced Sustainable
Digital Data Preservation and Access Network Partners (DataNet), a solicitation for grant
proposals “to develop the new methods, management structures and technologies to manage the
diversity, size, and complexity o f current and future data sets and data streams” that “will
integrate library and archival sciences, cyberinfrastructure, computer and information sciences,
and domain science expertise” (National Science Foundation, 2007b). By 2011, the NSF began
requiring data management plans with all research grant applications.
The largest increases in articles from year to year over the sample period occurred in
2004, 2006, and 2008. Several events can be detected from scoping the literature, which likely
influenced the use o f specific terminology or increased attention to certain topics. For example,
in 2003, the NIH, a large funder for biomedical research, began requiring data sharing plans with
grant applications. The following year, the largest increases in articles were seen in the search
terms data archiving, digital archiving, and digital preservation, all practices and concepts
germane to data sharing. There was also an increase in the search term digital curation due to
the launch o f the DCC in 2004. In 2005, the IMLS announced a call for grant proposals for
digital curation education programming. The following year, the most noticeable increases were

125

seen in the search terms digital curation and digital preservation , coinciding with a number o f
grant-funded educational programs in the area o f digital curation. In 2007, the NSF announced
the DataNet program. The increases in 2008 were observed in all o f the search terms except

digital curation and digital stewardship , which are more commonly associated with the
information fields than the domain sciences (life sciences, physical sciences, and social
sciences). The increase included all terms that use data as a qualifier. Also, the main activity for
the search term digital stewardship is in 2010 when the Library o f Congress launched the
National Digital Stewardship Alliance.
Terminology: Interviews
When asked about what and how terms are used in the area o f digital curation, many
interviewees initially remarked about the general lack o f consensus within the community. For
example:

Interviewee 01: I actually think that’s an area o f some confusion, generally,
professionally.
Interviewee 08: Okay, that is quite complicated, really.
Interviewee 11: They are all problematic.
Interviewee 13: It is very much in flux.
Interviewees addressed two key properties o f the theme o f terminology. First, all o f the
interviewees acknowledged that the different terms used to describe this area or related areas had
at least subtle differences in meaning. Many interviewees described digital curation as a blanket
or umbrella term that encompasses related terms and subareas. For example:

Interviewee 05: Often curation has been used as a way o f expressing something that is
slightly richer than preservation.

126

Interviewee 07: [Data management isj part o f [digital curation], very definitely part o f it.
I am o f the opinion that everything is data as w ell.. .If it's on the computer, [it comes
under] digital curation basically.
Interviewee 08: Digital curation is a wider term in my opinion, and implies managed
activities, a large array o f different managed activities in the human and technical
interfaces. Whereas digital preservation is a much narrower term. Digital preservation is
much more specific - technical activities or metadata activities that one might undertake
on the data to ensure the long-term preservation.
Interviewee 11: 1 use curation, both digital curation and data curation, and by curation, I
mean the enhancement o f materials so that they can be understood and used by people
both now and in the future...I think digital curation encompasses data curation...Data
curation is a very specific term.
Interviewee 12: I think digital curation has been used as an umbrella term to encompass
a lot o f these different concepts together.
Interviewees also distinguished terms by the type and scope o f the content being
preserved. For instance, one interviewee distinguished specific terminology when working with
research data:

Interviewee 08: I think research data management or data curation is a kind o f a subset o f
digital curation. I mean research data management is looking out for a particular type o f
data - research data.
Another interviewee limited the use o f digital archiving to the context o f electronic records and
digital archival material:

Interviewee 12: Digital appears to have a broader scope than the electronic record does,
and so [the term I use] also depends on the scope o f the materials that we are
discussing.... [Digital archiving and digital curation] are different in terms o f the nature
o f the creation o f the material and the nature o f the secondary use o f the material.
Some interviewees acknowledged that they oflen used terms as relatively equivalent
expressions, although fully aware that the meaning o f the terms are distinct:

127

Interviewee 04: Usually [I use] digital preservation and digital curation and, although 1
am aware that curation is a bit more general than digital preservation, I use those two
quite interchangeably, as tradition terms.
Interviewee 14: When 1 am talking about the area, I use the word preservation sometimes,
and sometimes 1 use the word curation. I am probably a little loose about which term 1
use, but 1 should probably be a little more precise because I do believe there are, in other
words, subtle differences between the two - that preservation is one aspect o f curation
and curation is the much broader term.
Second, eight o f the interviewees commented on using terms that were the most
meaningful to their audience. Comments included observations about the use o f communityspecific jargon and the need to more thoroughly explain concepts in laymen terms for audiences
outside o f the community. For example:

Interviewee 02: Recently, we have been writing some documents where we have not been
talking in digital preservation terms, because it seems to me that other people [outside o f
the community] just hear us talking in a foreign language sometimes. So. we have been
using different language to make our concepts easier to understand
Most comments focused on using terms that presented a meaningful and targeted
message that fit the needs o f the audience. In these instances, it was less about the denotations o f
the terms and more about the connotations as perceived or understood by the specific
community. For example:

Interviewee 04: The other area where we got interested in recently.. .preserving science
data, or preserving entire scientific processes and business processes and in that
community we use a bit more community-specific term s...S o it really has to do a lot with
which community we are talking to and what the focus o f our conversation is.
Interviewee 05: I tend to use whatever term speaks best to the audience 1 am dealing with
at the present tim e .. .But again it is a matter o f what the word means to particular people.
I don’t get hung up on it, really.

128

Interviewee II: So it depends on the audience, right. If I am [talking to information
professionals I] describe it [one] way. If I am talking to you as a researcher or someone
who is preparing the data, then I describe it a little bit differently.. .We frame things or try
to tailor the message to the audience, and 1 think that is important because if you just
have one generic message, it doesn’t hit home.
Terminology’ Explored
Although many o f the terms related to the area o f digital curation are used somewhat
interchangeably, at least informally or conversationally, each characterizes a distinct concept or
group o f concepts. “Digital curation” was originally coined to capture the concept o f the
lifecycle management and preservation o f all types o f digital assets including processes and
workflows, dynamic and static content, and research data and cultural heritage materials.
Indeed, most interviewees explained digital curation as broad in scope and encompassing the
actions implied by the other terms. Although digital curation remains comprehensive in its
meaning and inclusive o f research data, it has not yet been extensively adopted within the
research communities. The findings from the literature survey suggested that its use is most
commonly found within the information fields, or in connection with the DCC. Digital
stewardship is conceptually broader than digital curation and takes into account long-term
preservation at the ethical, policy, and social levels; however it has minimal impact at present.
Data curation, on the other hand, was described by interviewees as representing a
narrower conceptual terrain than digital curation, and was often viewed as a component o f digital
curation. For the most part, as used among the domain sciences and from the digital curation
perspective, data curation is a fundamental set o f ongoing activities for the management and
long-term preservation o f research data to ensure its quality, understandability, and reusability.
Specifically, it involves adding value to and ensuring the integrity o f data through annotation,
metadata, and associated information integral to the sharing and reuse o f data into the future

129

(example from content analysis sample: Wang et al., 2009). In this sense, data curation is also
viewed as a vital aspect o f data stewardship, which is a comprehensive concept used largely in
the domain sciences to denote the overall long-term care, management, and responsibility o f
research data. However there are some, mostly within the information fields, that define data
curation more holisticaliy, suggesting only a subtle distinction from digital curation. That
distinction narrows the content focus o f data curation to the lifecycle management o f research
data with an emphasis on the reuse o f data for scholarly pursuits (example from content analysis
sample: Palmer, Heidom, Wright, & Cragin, 2007). The former definition applies to specific
essential activities within the lifecycle o f data, while the latter definition comprises the entire
lifecycle.

Archive and its derivatives are contentious terms because they have been co-opted from
archival studies and now carry a variety o f superficial meanings. For example, in the technology
field the word archive is used synonymously with backing-up data. Conventionally speaking,
digital archiving and data archiving represent two separate, yet related, and established practices.
Cunningham (2008) describes digital archiving as digital curation for electronic archival records.
The only distinction between archives and digital archives are the format o f the records. Both
are complex practices driven by the same archival policies and based on archival theory. Data
archiving, on the other hand, is part o f a data management strategy, and is associated with the
publication, reuse, and sharing o f research data. Data archiving involves the long-term
preservation and storage o f research data for future use, and has become a core principle for
scholarly communication in the digital era. Data archives provide professional services to
support ingest, preservation, storage, and access o f data. Alternatively, the term data archiving
is also used to refer to extended storage within a data collection software or instrumentation, and

130

digital archiving is also used as equivalent to collection and storage o f digital assets without
regard to long-term preservation.
Although digital preservation , in particular, was most often used interchangeably by
interviewees with digital curation , its narrow denotation and the activities to which it pertains
were well articulated. Both digital preservation and data preservation are technical terms to
describe a set o f managed activities to impede obsolescence and keep digital assets accessible,
renderable, and usable into the future. Digital preservation applies to all forms o f digital assets
while data preservation is most commonly used to refer to research data. Digital preservation,
like data curation, is considered a set o f essential activities within the lifecycle approach o f
digital curation.

Digital preservation is at the crux o f the discussion o f terminology for this area.
Preservation in general and the issues surrounding technology in particular are o f keen interest to
the community. Although the limitations o f the term ’s definition were widely acknowledged,

digital preservation has been broadly interpreted and widely employed as evidenced by it being
the most commonly used search term in the literature survey sample. This does not necessarily
mean that that the community is most interested in the set o f activities and technology solutions
that are characterized by the phrase digital preservation. But rather it highlights the significance
o f the emergence o f digital curation as a broader conceptual phrase.
Prior to 2001, there was no single term that captured the holistic approach required for
the long-term care and sustainability o f digital assets. Although the principles o f preservation
remain largely unchanged between analog and digital materials, the nature o f the materials is
different and therefore the approach to preservation is different. Digital curation not only
provided a term to guide this discussion but also provided a focal point for multi-disciplinary

13!

collaboration and discussion about the sameness that underlies the preservation o f all digital
assets. In turn, with more accurate terminology available and understandable to diverse
audiences, the community was able to more articulately engage in discussion and the
development o f this evolving practical and research area. Hence, the overall use o f digital

preservation as a catchall phrase begins to decrease as it is eclipsed by more descriptive and
precise terminology.
The decision to use one term over another is not strictly determined by definition alone
but rather is based on a combination o f factors. The findings from the interviews and content
analysis suggest that the primary factor for selecting terminology is the audience. Speakers
select terms that will be most meaningful and most impactful to their audiences. This
underscores the disciplinary differences the findings show in terminology use. Audiences have
different backgrounds and worldviews, work with different content type and formats, and have
different goals or objectives. With this in mind, audiences project different connotations on
terms and those connotations can influence how an audience will respond to concepts, ideas, and
practices. Expressing concepts related to digital curation in language that the audience will
identify with and that relate directly to the needs o f the audience, even if imprecise, appears to be
more valuable to the interviewees than promoting a standardized lexicon.
Considering the extent and variety o f disciplines that have an interest in concepts and
practices related to digital curation, it is not altogether surprising that a common terminology has
yet to be established. Each term carries distinctive connotations and denotations, which evoke
interpretations that reflect the audiences’ and speakers’ backgrounds. In terms o f emerging
disciplines, and for that matter even a cohesive field, an agreed upon set o f conceptual terms is
foundational. What we have seen is a shift from passive archiving o f data or preservation o f

132

digital cultural heritage to active lifecycle management o f digital assets, from creation to
preservation to access and use. The terminology that has emerged reflects these changes, and
suggests that at a conceptual level there is consistency across domains even if that consistency is
not yet evidenced by a shared vocabulary.
Theme Two: Collaboration
Collaboration was the second theme that emerged from data analysis o f the interviews
and content analysis. The theme o f collaboration was defined as any instance or mention o f two
or more people or institutions cooperating, sharing resources, or working together for mutual
benefit or to achieve shared goals. The theme was derived from codes for authorship,
collaborative networks and projects, participation in alliances and consortia, and pooling
resources.
The collaboration theme aligns with the “social networks” element from the conceptual
framework. Networks are supported through formal means such as professional associations,
academic departments, or collaborative research initiatives and projects. These promote
networks for financial and social support, and the control o f access to opportunities. Social
networks also include the “audiences for the dissemination o f work” (D ’Agostino, 2012, p. 335)
and informal channels for communication and social interaction.
Social networks preserve formal and informal channels o f communication and social
interaction within and among disciplines. These networks link people and ideas. Becher and
Trowler (2001) explain: “Social interaction, communication o f all sorts and the partly socially
constructed nature o f disciplines that is associated with them are the forces that bind together the
sociological and the epistemological, giving shape and substance to the links between knowledge
forms and knowledge communities” (p. 104). Social networks build a scaffold for mutual

133

understanding o f concepts, practices, and values through the promotion o f community,
collaboration, and resource sharing.
Collaboration: Content Analysis
Patterns o f authorship in the published literature provide information about collaboration
among members o f the community. For the content analysis, 460 published articles and
conference presentations were coded for number o f authors and geographic location o f authors.
Seventy-two percent o f articles in the sample were authored by two or more people. O f the 128
articles that had single authors, 15 were editorial introductions to IJDC issues. Figure 6.3 shows
the breakdown o f articles by number o f authors.

Figure 6.4. Content analysis sample: Multi-authored articles by type o f collaboration.

Identifying the disciplinary home o f authors was not always feasible because o f the lack
o f biographical data included with the articles. Although place o f employment and geographic
location were almost always included, the author’s role and more detailed background
information were sporadic and inconsistent. The latter information was needed to identify the
discipline o f the author: for example, there are a range o f positions that an individual can hold
within a library or data archive setting. The most that could be accomplished was to identify the
domain in which each author held a jo b post. With this in mind, o f the 332 collaborative articles

135

only 63 could be tentatively identified as being authored by multi-discipline teams based on the
disciplinary setting o f the author’s job post. This was determined by the department or
institution o f employment for each author, additional metadata provided with the article such as
position title when available, and targeted internet searches if necessary. Table 6.3 presents how
many o f these apparent multi-discipline teams had representation from authors who held
positions in an information field, technology field, both, or no representation.

Patterns and practices o f collaboration vary among the disciplines, between subfields, and
even from journal to journal. Traditionally, the life sciences and physical sciences tend to
collaborate more than the social sciences and the humanities, with the technology fields falling
toward the middle o f the spectrum. The occurrence o f collaboration is rising in the social
sciences and humanities including library and information science, and international
collaboration is rising across all disciplines (Cronin, Shaw, & La Barre, 2003; Sin, 2011;
Franceschet, 2011). Reasons for or against collaboration are embedded into the culture o f each
discipline and underscore beliefs about competition, scholarship, and knowledge and theory
136

production. Collaboration is also influenced by funding opportunities and policies, growing
international social networks, and grand challenges that cross disciplinary boundaries.
A cursory survey o f the literature shows how this level o f collaboration compares to other
areas. In a 2011 study o f six top ranked, high prestige LIS journals, the researchers found that
64% o f published articles had two or more authors. O f the multi-authored papers, 16% were
international collaborations (Sin, 2011). An unpublished study that focused on an international
selection o f archival journals found that only 25% were authored by two or more authors
(Conway, Condon, Dorey, Garcia, Lenstra, & Song, 2012). Research looking at authorship
patterns in bioinformatics found that 90% o f articles were written by two or more people. This is
not surprising considering the high level o f collaboration found in the life sciences and the
interdisciplinarity o f the bioinformatics field (Amsaveni, Manikandan, & Manjula, 2013).
In a 2011 study o f collaborative authorship in computer science, researchers found that
77% o f the journal articles and conference papers were multi-authored. The researchers
observed that conference papers were more collaborative. Analyzed separately, 81% o f the
conference papers and 70% o f journal articles had two or more authors (Franceschet, 2011). A
co-authorship network analysis o f conference proceedings in digital library research community
found that 80% o f conference papers had two or more authors, with the majority having two and
three authors, 29% and 24% respectively. International collaboration accounted for 7% o f the
multi-authored conference papers (Liu, Bollen, Nelson, & Van de Sompel, 2005). For
comparison, in the present study, analyzing the conference presentations from the content
analysis in isolation there were 86% that had two or more authors, and 17% o f those were
international collaborations.

137

The findings suggest that the patterns o f collaboration in the area o f digital curation are
similar to those in the LIS field and computer science field. They are not as high as those found
in the life or physical sciences, or as low as in the archives field or other humanities-oriented
disciplines. Analyzing the subsamples individually did not show any stark differences in
collaboration practices: the findings suggest a higher percentage o f collaborative partnerships in
conference presentations, which is a trend found in other fields. Only considering the data for
the International Journal o f Digital Curation, the findings show' that 72% o f articles had two or
more authors (67% if you include the 15 single-authored editorial journal issue introductions)
and 15% o f the multi-authored articles were international collaborations. For the top 5% most
frequently cited subsample, 75% had two or more authors, and o f those multi-authored articles,
22% were international collaborations. The content analysis sample included articles from a
wide range o f disciplines, and therefore comprises a mixture o f collaboration practices.
Collaboration: Interviews
The frequent occurrence and value o f collaboration are assertions often cited within the
digital curation community. The level o f collaboration suggested from the findings o f the
content analysis supports the assertions that collaboration occurs frequently in this area.
Interview data provided insight on how people within the community articulate the value o f
collaboration. There was little indication that collaboration was founded on competition as
witnessed in other areas (Becher & Trowler, 2001). Rather it exists to produce more effective
practical and research outcomes, and cultivate knowledge and social networks.
Interviewees approached the theme o f collaboration from two main perspectives. First,
collaboration was talked about as the definitive approach to successful and sustainable digital

138

curation, particularly with respect to the magnitude o f the undertaking.

In a follow-up email

after one interview, the interviewee wrote:

Interviewee 06: I'm not sure we talked much about ‘collaboration’ which is certainly a
principle that the [digital preservation] community has always talked about. There is an
often-stated principle that preservation is too big a task for organizations to do on their
own. That collaboration - at all levels - including internationally - is a sine qua non for
effective preservation o f the cultural and scientific record.
Another interviewee focused comments on pooling resources for effective technological
infrastructure:

Interviewee 13: So if you think o f libraries and archives working individually, our
capacity to develop new technology is quite limited, and in a way, we kind o f have to
work together collaboratively to pool our resources in order to get better systems in place,
to get a better infrastructure.
Although both examples illustrate recognition o f the value o f collaboration, interviewees also
addressed concerns and limitations o f collaboration in practice. Interviewee 06 observed: “The
politics and the practicalities o f collaboration can be difficult.” Interviewee 13 believed that “at a
content or a collection level, there is still going to be a difference. Things will still break down
along collection lines or disciplinary lines.”
In turn, communication and interpersonal skills were highlighted as essential in the area
o f digital curation, in large part to facilitate collaboration. For example:

Interviewee 04: But I guess something that people would need as a kind o f common
denominator is first an understanding and appreciation o f long-term stability and all those
concepts that are the motivation for digital preservation.. .On the other hand, since the
data and the objects that we are talking about is digital it requires basic understandings o f
IT sk ills... and to be able to talk to the respective domain specialists across discipline
boundaries.

139

Interviewee 05: You need to be able to communicate at least with people who run IT
services, and that ability to communicate with people in many different backgrounds and
be able to translate requirements and needs between them, I think is. was really
significant, for lots o f people in those roles.
Interviewee OS: 1 think knowing how to talk to IT people as well actually, because, and I
have discussed this already how !T people and trained information professionals don’t
necessarily understand the same thing. 1 think if you curate data and you do understand
database structures and have some understanding o f how the internet works and so on,
then you are more likely to be able to talk to the IT people and more able to be taken
seriously.
The second perspective interviewees presented on collaboration addressed building
communication and social networks with others working in the area. Most comments about
collaboration and network building in the area o f digital curation highlighted it as an
international activity. Some interviewees focused on cultivating informal relationships to
sustain channels for collective learning and information exchange. For example:

Interviewee 01: And talking to people o f course, which is crucial. Because I have a lot o f
colleagues in the US and Europe, I have been involved in lots o f things over the years, so
I have a lot o f contacts and friends in the UK and US, I stay in touch with them.
Interviewee 02: From that perspective we have international colleagues, which we stay in
touch with through workgroups and listservs. You have a network o f people that you
know. You try and keep an eye on blogs and listservs and things like that.
Several interviewees discussed the collaborative projects as channels for staying engaged
in the broader digital curation community:

Interviewee 04: There are research projects with regular meetings, there are conferences.
So, I think meeting and talking to people all the time, that is pretty much what I am
doing, hardly anything else...W e have a whole bunch o f [collaborative] projects running
currently...It is a big global community I would say.
Interviewee 07: And then o f course, there is pretty much all the projects that I've worked
on that are externally funded have been collaborative projects with people outside the
organization and also outside the country as well.

140

Practice and research related to digital curation requires a range o f skills and therefore
involves individuals with different expertise collaborating for more productive outcomes.

It was

common for interviewees to comment that no single entity or set o f skills could effectively
address the practical and research concerns o f the area o f digital curation. It requires multiple
perspectives and shared resources to be sustainable. This point o f view is also reflected in the
themes o f multiple discipline engagement and education. The findings from the interviews
suggest that the community views collaboration as the most effective way for integrating diverse
knowledge and skills bases. At the institutional level, collaboration is seen as a means o f
combining resources and a prerequisite for stronger infrastructure, interoperability, and shared
solutions.
Because o f the multiple and distinct communities that converge to form the digital
curation community, collaboration or participating in collaborative research initiatives also
serves as a means o f building social networks, and staying informed with current practice and
research. Collaboration was cited alongside social media and attending conferences as a notable
method for engagement with the diverse digital curation community. In the absence o f
professional associations and academic departments, collaborative research initiatives serve as
channels for cultivating social networks in digital curation and related areas.
The findings suggest that not only is collaboration a frequent occurrence in digital
curation practice and research, but it is highly valued by the community. Specifically,
collaborative research initiatives and projects were mentioned as core building blocks for the
development o f the area, promoting sustainable practical outcomes, and cultivating knowledge
and social networks. Although the structure o f the social network was not analyzed in this
research, patterns o f interdisciplinary co-authorship and cited references suggest that information

141

exchange across disciplinary boundaries is restricted. Further research is warranted to better
understand the role that collaboration has in cultivating knowledge and social networks across
disciplines.
Summary
In this chapter, I explored the first two themes that emerged from data. The theme o f
terminology is aligned with the element "discursive community" from the conceptual
framework. The findings suggest that although there is generally a shared understanding o f most
field-specific jargon in the area o f digital curation, a common language has not fully coalesced.
In terms o f emerging disciplines, and for that matter even a cohesive field, an agreed upon set o f
conceptual terms is foundational. The theme o f collaboration aligns with the “social networks"
element o f the conceptual framework. The findings suggest that there are well-established social
networks in place within the digital curation and related communities.
In the next chapter, I present the second part o f the findings and discussion. In Part II,
the themes o f multiple discipline engagement and education are explored in detail. Part III
presents the final theme, areas o f professional and scholarly focus, and provides a summary o f
the findings and discussion.

142

CHAPTER 7: FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: PART II
This chapter is Part II o f the findings and discussion. The chapter is organized in two
main sections. In the first section, I explore the theme o f multiple discipline engagement. In the
second section, I convey in detail the findings and discussion o f the theme o f education.
Theme Three: M ultiple Discipline Engagement
Multiple discipline engagement was the third theme that emerged from the data analysis.
Multiple discipline engagement was defined as any instance or mention o f two or more people or
institutions from different disciplines or fields working together, or the combination or
application o f concepts, methods, practices, or theories from two or more distinct disciplines or
fields. The theme was derived from codes for discipline-specific discourse, interdisciplinarity
and multidisciplinarity, relationships between fields, shared solutions, and required education,
skills, and training.
The multiple discipline engagement theme was mapped to the “styles o f subjectivity”
element o f a discipline from the conceptual framework (During, 2006, p. 266; D ’Agostino, 2012,
p. 335). Subjectivity is the “expression o f self and the representation o f a speaker's
[disciplinary] perspective or point o f view in discourse” (Stein & Wright, 1995, p. I). Members
o f a discipline are indoctrinated into that discipline’s culture, which includes norms for behaviors
and established research practices that identify individuals as members o f the discipline. These
accepted behaviors and research practices become characteristic o f that discipline, and are
maintained through discourse and sense o f identity o f members.
Styles o f subjectivity, or unique disciplinary perspectives, are embodied in the written
discourse o f a discipline. Each discipline has accepted criteria for assessing the quality and value
o f work in terms o f student academic success, professional performance, and faculty research

143

and teaching. A discipline engenders a style o f written communication "that identities its user as
a member o f the disciplinary community and so makes their contributions visible to others in the
community” (D ’Agostino, 2012, p. 336). Disciplines also possess a concept o f rigor as
demonstrated by a shared understanding about establishing the reliability, validity, and
trustworthiness o f research.
Multiple Discipline Engagement: Content Analysis Subset
An in-depth probe into a subsample o f the content analysis provides evidence o f the
multiple stakeholders engaged in this area. Looking at only the data from the subsample o f the
content analysis for the top 5% most frequently cited articles in Scopus and Web o f Science
(n=170; 2001-2012; search terms: data archiving, data curation, data preservation, data

stewardship, digital archiving, digital curation, digital preservation, and digital stewardship)
provides evidence o f the multiple stakeholders engaged in this area: 3 1% o f articles from the
sample were published in journals from the information fields, 28% from the life sciences, 19%
from technology fields, 12% from the physical sciences, and 7% from the social sciences. Figure
7.1 shows the breakdown o f the articles by field o f the journal in which they were published.
This chart is not intended to be representative o f all articles, but rather conveys a story about the
competing and shared interests.

Table 7.1 focuses on the 53 articles (31% o f the subsampie) published in journals from
the information fields. Within the information fields, the majority o f articles were published in
LIS journals. Table 7.1 displays the publication titles and the number o f article from each
publication in archival studies, LIS, or museum studies journals.
As previously addressed, establishing the discipline o f authors was not always feasible
based on the information provided with the articles; however, identifying the domain in which
they held a jo b post was. For the articles presented in Table 7.1, first authors for all five articles
published in archival studies journals held positions in the archives field, and first authors from
both articles published in museum studies journals were from the museum field. For articles
published in LIS journals, six first authors held positions in the archives, 15 first authors held
positions in technology, and 25 first authors held positions in the library and information science.

The data for the subsample o f the top 5% most frequently cited articles also shows how'
often publications from archival studies, digital curation, LIS, and technology fields are cited by
articles in journals from other fields. Tabie 7.2 shows the number o f articles that cited references
from publications o f different fields o f study. For example, o f the five articles published in

146

archival studies publications, tour included at least one reference to a digital curation
publication, four included at least one reference to articles published in LIS journals, one
included at least one reference to an article in a technology publication, and none o f them
referenced articles from museum studies. O f particular note, 60 o f the 84 articles published in
any o f the domain sciences journals did not reference any articles from archival, digital curation,
LIS, or technology publications.

Digital curation literature most commonly cited included the OAIS Reference Model
standard, followed by articles from the International Journal o f Digital Curation and DCC
publications. The most common LIS publications cited in articles outside o f the LIS field
included articles published in D-Lib , Library Trends, and the proceedings o f the Joint

Conference on Digital Libraries. The most common technology publications cited in articles
outside o f technology fields included Communications o f A C M and Lectures in Computer

Science. There was little consistency regarding the citation o f archival publications; however,
recurrent citations included items from the IS&T Archiving conference proceedings and the 1996

Preserving Digital Information, Report o f the Task Force on Archiving o f Digital Information.
Multiple Discipline Engagement: Interviews
Similar to the theme o f collaboration, interviewees view the involvement o f multiple
disciplines as a key to effective and sustainable digital curation. One interviewee noted:

Interviewee 06: I think that it's kind o f a cross disciplinary collision, hopefully not a
collision, it's much more than that. It's sort o f a nice productive coming together o f skills
where preservation works best.
Interviewees discussed engagement by multiple disciplines in the area o f digital curation
in relation to two fundamental areas. First, interviewees commented on the diverse knowledge
and skills base needed to do activities related to digital curation. For example:

Interviewee 02: So you need to have or understand computer skills, you also need to
understand collections. And you need to understand both, because guys that just deal
with the computer stuff don’t necessarily understand the collections sid e...I don’t
necessarily see digital preservation as being particularly special in terms o f the skills, but
it is how you are applying them and how you are drawing all these other skills sets into
one area, I think which is actually important.
Interviewee 05: So I think there is no question... it is o f relevance to many o f [the
information] disciplines, not necessarily to one, and many o f those disciplines have a
view on curation....B ut 1 think you can't do preservation properly unless you pick up
something from the areas o f the organization and the management o f knowledge. Where
I think there is a risk, is that there are lots o f other things that come to bear on this. So a
great deal is about quite fundamental computer science, for instance...I think there are
[many] different set o f skills.

148

Interviewee 14: So, I think a basic technical knowledge is important, a knowledge o f the
relevant models and theories in preservation, a really solid understanding o f risk, and an
ability to think extremely logically for example when you want to do preservation
planning or something like that, and an appreciation o f .. .what kinds o f preservation
approaches you might use in different context. Those are extremely important. But then
there are going to have to be people who are actually able on the ground to do the really
hard core technical work.
Interviewees also discussed how the diversity o f research challenges in the area requires
approaches and perspectives from a range o f disciplines. For example:

Interviewee 04: I think that digital curation research, it is basically interdisciplinary, and
so we need people from a diversity o f backgrounds. I would say there are definitely a
number o f questions and research challenges in digital preservation/curation that are core
computer science challenges and that surely need to be solved by computer sciences.
There are other questions and changes that are more related to archival and library
science, information science. And there are lots o f challenges that are completely domain
specific, you know, specific data formats, usage o f data.
Second, although interviewees discussed the role o f the domain sciences in digital
curation education, practice, and research, the two main fields predominantly discussed as
having the most influence in the area were the information fields and the technology fields.

Interviewee 02: So you’re either coming from the collection side, or you are coming from
the computer side. And logically the discipline fits somewhere in betw een... We are a
hybrid. [We are] in between. So I think it is going to be watered down within any one o f
the camps. I think you really do have to sit in the middle, but acknowledge that you are
in the middle and that you are taking skills from two different sides.
Interviewee 05: So it touches on lots and lots o f different areas. But it is the nature o f the
universities that things have to have a home, they have to sit in a faculty or school or
college or something like th at... I think that is true, the discipline would happily sit
within the information disciplines [or within computer science]. ..except that if you [see]
it exclusively as one or the other you’re missing h alf o f what it was all about.
Interviewee 08: I think we have to start working more closely with computer scientists as
well. There are kind o f two strands in the professional world [related to digital curation]:
The ones who have done libraries and archives and the ones who have done computer
science.
149

The data also show how the themes o f terminology, collaboration, and multiple discipline
engagement are interconnected. As one interviewee noted:

Interviewee 14: The one thing that is extremely important is that anyone working in
digital curation has an appreciation o f the languages o f communication that are involved
in preservation and curation, and the languages that are used in disciplines like
information management, computer science, so that they can actually communicate with
other practitioners, because preservation is very much a collaborative activity and you
must be able to communicate across communities.
Again, taking a closer look at the content analysis subsample o f the top 5% most frequently cited
articles, there are disciplinary differences in the use o f terminology. Table 7.3 shows the number
o f articles retrieved by search term used and the field o f the journal in which the article was
published. The table indicates that digital preservation shows up more frequently as a search
term in the information and technology fields, and data archiving found more often in the
domain sciences and the technology fields. Data curation mostly retrieved articles published in
journals from the life sciences and the information fields. These disciplinary differences
highlight a preference in terminology, and also highlight a distinction in conceptual and practical
interests among the fields.

Multiple Discipline Engagement Explored
Multiple disciplines working in the same problem space is not uncommon. Some
problems intersect the boundaries that separate domains or are too complex for a single
discipline to address. In many cases, collaboration yields more productive and valuable
outcomes. These shared problem spaces may continue to draw resources or occupy space in
multiple disciplines, and necessitate long-term collaboration and facilitate the transfer o f
knowledge between fields. In some instances, these collaborations can result in the formation o f
a subdiscipline or new discipline that combines elements o f the collaborating fields, or the
problem space may be subsumed into one o f the collaborating disciplines as a new
specialization.
151

There are different forms and levels o f multiple discipline engagement, and an extensive
body o f research that addresses the dynamics, function, and impact o f multiple discipline
engagement exists. Multidisciplinary , interdisciplinary , and transdisciplinary are ju st three o f
the more common terms applied when professionals and researchers work across the boundaries
o f their home discipline. To complicate the matter, the definitions o f these terms are often
debated and some are used interchangeably (Petrisor, 2013; Krishnan, 2009; Barry, Bom, &
Weszkalnys, 2008; Choi & Pak, 2006; Strober, 2006; Stember, 1991). Each term implies some
extent o f integration or supplementation o f the concepts, methods, and theories from more than
one field for achieving outcomes or addressing problems.

Multidisciplinary is used as a general description for multiple discipline engagement, and
as a more precise term that differentiates it from interdisciplinary. More precisely,
multidisciplinarity refers to two or more disciplines working in the same problem space but
retaining unique disciplinary perspective and respecting the boundaries o f each discipline.
“M ultidisciplinary research draws on knowledge from different disciplines, but stays within the
boundary o f one primary field” (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council o f Canada,
2012). The term does not imply integration o f the disciplinary knowledge, but rather suggests
that the contributions from other domains are supplemental or additive (Stember, 1991; Choi &
Pak, 2006; Strober 2006).

Interdisciplinary is also used as a general description for multiple discipline engagement
but more specifically refers to the integration o f two or more disciplines. Interdisciplinarity
implies a synergy o f disciplinary knowledge from multiple domains, blurring yet preserving the
boundaries between disciplines (Stember, 1991; Choi & Pak, 2006; Strober 2006). This
convergence and integration o f disciplinary approaches and perspectives brings to the problem

152

space “defamiliarization, fresh insights, land] skills from one area of expertise enriching another
and making up for another’s limitations” (Torgovnick, 1996. p. 282). Through the synthesis o f
content, methods, perspectives, or theories from multiple disciplines, interdisciplinary practice
and research creates a “coordinated and coherent whole” (Choi & Park, 2006, p. 359).

Transdisciplinary, on the other hand, is not used as a general description o f multiple
discipline engagement but does have two distinct meanings in the literature. The first meaning

o f transdisciplinary suggests a higher level o f integration than interdisciplinarity by way o f a
holistic view o f disciplinary knowledge bases and a comprehensive approach to the problem
space (Choi & Pak, 2006; Strober, 2006, Stember, 1991). Individuals from multiple disciplines
“work closely together on a common problem over an extended period but also create a shared
conceptual model o f the problem that integrates and transcends each o f their separate
disciplinary perspectives” (Rosenfield, 1992, p.55). The second meaning o f transdisciplinary
suggests a shift toward problem-oriented research, rather than discipline-oriented research. In
transdisciplinary research, a problem space occurs beyond disciplinary boundaries, and involves
participation by relevant fields and stakeholders outside o f the academy. It is less about the
disciplines that are involved in addressing the problem and more about involving a combination
o f expertise that can effectively find a shared solution (Ylijoki, 2000;). In both instances, the
outcomes transcend disciplinary boundaries, and function both across and within the disciplines.
When referring to multiple discipline engagement in the area o f digital curation, it was
common among interviewees and in the literature to apply the term interdisciplinary to describe
it. Interest in practice and research related to digital curation cuts across disciplinary boundaries.
The rapid growth and adoption o f computer technology has had an impact on the communication
and research practices in the academy. In the domain sciences, research data management,

153

digital preservation, and data sharing, as well as new ways o f conducting research in the digital
environment necessitate forward thinking about the creation and maintenance o f digital data. In
the information fields, digital cultural heritage, digital formats o f information and publication,
and new ways o f searching and using data have changed traditional practices and services. All
the while, the technology fields continue to advance more quickly than our understanding o f how
to secure the longevity o f digital materials. This is an area o f concern for anyone working with
digital content.
However, a closer look at the findings suggests that the area o f digital curation is not
altogether interdisciplinary. Although multiple disciplines are engaged in the discourse, the data
indicates that there is a lack o f integration o f disciplinary knowledge. Analysis o f the references
o f the subsampie o f the content analysis for the top 5% most frequently cited articles show that
60 o f the 84 articles published in the domain sciences journals did not reference any articles
outside o f their general area, and specifically not any from archival, digital curation, LIS, or
technology publications. However, articles published in archival, LIS, and technology journals
regularly cited journals from other fields.
The data o f this subsample also shows that there are differences between terminology
used and the field o f journal in which an article is published. This supports findings from the
terminology theme: the language in this area is not uniform, and speakers select terms that will
be most meaningful to their audiences. It also highlights that the fields have fundamentally
different interests that drive their practice and research in the area o f digital curation. The
findings show an emphasis on data archiving and data curation in the domain fields (life
sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences), and digital preservation in the information and
technology fields.

154

The findings suggest that concepts related to digital curation viewed through the lens o f
the information fields are approached as an interdisciplinary endeavor. It is not surprising that
the data shows that articles published in journals representing the information fields display the
most diversity in their references. Library and information science and related areas are
inherently interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, drawing on a variety o f fields (Prebor. 2010;
Saracevic, 2009). The findings also suggest that the technology fields not only incorporate
literature from the information fields, but also view the information fields as part o f their
audience for the dissemination o f work.
From the viewpoint o f the domain sciences the data show little indication o f an
interdisciplinary approach to concepts related to digital curation. However, these articles are
multidisciplinary; the subject matter is intrinsically about technology and information
management. Although technology publications were referenced in 16 out o f the 24 articles that
cited outside o f their general domain, overall there was little diversity or apparent integration o f
disciplinary knowledge. The apparent lack o f integration does not preclude the use o f concepts
from other disciplines to address problem spaces within the boundaries o f the home discipline.
Taking this into consideration, the area o f digital curation is to some degree both
interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary; which, depends on the disciplinary perspective o f the
individual. Practices related to digital curation are widely applied across disciplinary boundaries
and advancing this area is important to diverse stakeholders. Many o f the domain fields provide
additive disciplinary knowledge to address unique concerns specific to those disciplines. But the
disciplinary knowledge that has been integrated for the development o f concepts related to
digital curation, including best practices and conceptual models, is limited. The bulk o f
interdisciplinary collaboration appears to come from the information and technology fields.

155

Theme Four: Education
Education was the fourth theme that emerged from the data analysis. The theme o f
education was defined as any commentary about educating or training professionals for activities
and employment related to digital curation. The theme was derived from codes for career paths,
curriculum development, educational programs, professional training, and required
competencies.
The education theme aligned with two o f the elements that comprise a discipline
according to the conceptual framework: “an academic organizational unit” and a higher
educational “curriculum.” These two elements account for two o f the six institutional aspects o f
a discipline and are the elements that expressly embed the discipline into higher education.
These institutionalization components are essential factors in disciplinarity because it is this
embeddedness in higher education that differentiates the definition o f academic disciplines from
those o f professions and communities o f practice.
An academic organizational unit is frequently embodied in a department, research center,
or some other kind o f organizing and political unit within the university system in which
teaching and research takes place. These organizing and political units are responsible for hiring
and promoting faculty according to accepted criteria within the discipline; allocating
administrative, research, and teaching responsibilities; and “the reproduction o f the discipline via
the training o f postgraduate students” (D ’Agostino, 2012, p. 335). “Disciplines are thus in part
identified by the existence o f relevant departments: but it does not follow that every department
represents a discipline” (Becher & Trowier, 2001, p. 41). Although the academic department is
the most visible organizational unit, this is only one potential organizing structure and within any
organizing unit there may be more than one discipline represented.

156

An academic discipline is also comprised o f a core curriculum. A curriculum provides a
coherent and teachable body o f disciplinary knowledge (D ’Agostino. 2012). “Disciplines
provide the comfort o f some stability in curricula and provide some general structure for the
organisation o f teaching, especially at an undergraduate level” (Krishnan, 2009, p. 43). The
curriculum supports and is supported by identifying and teaching graduate attributes consisting
o f disciplinary-specific learning outcomes and skills relevant to real world application (Barrie,
2004); threshold concepts which are prerequisite principles, and tenets that function as a gateway
to the discipline (Meyer & Land, 2003); and signature pedagogies defined as “characteristic
forms o f teaching and learning” aimed at preparing professionals “to think, to perform, and to act

with integrity” within their field (Shulman, 2005, p. 52).
Education: Interviews
Interviewees engaged with the theme o f education in three key ways. First, interviewees
commented on the kinds o f skills that are needed for professionals in this area. Most
interviewees viewed the area o f digital curation as requiring a combination o f knowledge and
skills from the information fieids and the technology fields. However, from their particular
vantage point, interviewees often considered skills related to digital curation as add-ons to
existing curricula. In reference to biocuration, for instance, an interviewee commented:

Interviewee 03: For most groups that I am aware o f you can just be a very good biologist
and that is fine. It is nice to be able to hav e...a big picture view, and make sure you don’t
get drawn on too many details when you have to process so much inform ation.. .also
having the mind to understand how a database is structured, even if you don’t need to
design the database yourself.
Interviewees from the LIS and archival fields posited being information professionals first. For
example:

157

Interviewee 01: I don't think that you need to make archivists or librarians also IT
professionals. But I think there are IT skills that you have to have.
Interviewee 10: Skills, I think it is really important for people to understand how systems
are built and how systems are evaluated and how requirements are developed for
system s.. .So, I think those are some o f the areas and skill sets that are sometimes not
there in terms o f beyond a traditional library or archive skill set knowledge base and that
kind o f goes without saying.
Interviewee 12: Okay, first and foremost, they need the archival theory. They need to
know what we are doing and why we are doing it. Second to that is an understanding o f
the way technology works.
Some interviewees expressed concern that there was too much focus on technology
which put traditional skills at jeopardy o f being displaced. For example:

Interviewee 0 1 : 1 think it has, for some time, that the whole area o f digital curation/digital
archiving is becoming much more focused on IT solutions and not information
management solutions. And I think that's the wrong em phasis.. .Because if you don't
have some understanding o f what you are actually trying to do conceptually then you are
not going to get the IT solution to do it.
Interviewee 1 3 : 1 think there has been too much focus on technology for its own sake and
not enough understanding o f how technology has developed over tim e... It’s a danger I
think for us to be just technology obsessed - all we need is more and better, just lots o f
technology. Libraries, archives, museums are always going to be content focused or
collection focused, so managing a collection as opposed to managing a technology
infrastructure, that's what's important.
Second, interviewees commented on how digital curation education is related to the
academic disciplines. For the most part, interviewees identified the area o f digital curation as
existing on the boundary between the information fields and the technology fields. Interviewees
also commented on educational opportunities needed across disciplines. For example:

Interviewee 04: M inding that the core focus definitely will be in the archival/library
sciences and computer sciences as those are the two core disciplines that will have to
tackle the problem, but I would think, yes that most other disciplines would highly
benefit from at least an offering into those aspects.

158

interviewee 11: Yeah, so I think curation really spans disciplines and dom ains... But 1
think curation should be built into all domain training in the future, and certainly we are
seeing that in the data w orld...Y ou have people from physics and astronomy and biology,
and there are sciences really taking a lead on curation-type activities and curation
advocacy. So it really fits within all disciplines, but 1 think the information discipline is
taking the lead on training and teaching and growing young professionals.
Several interviewees questioned the potential interest o f computer science departments
wanting to take responsibility for education related to digital curation. They tended to focus their
observations on the types o f students attracted to computer science, who are not necessarily
interested in careers related to digital curation. For example,
Interviewee 02: I think generally computer science courses would see this as being
probably a bit boutique. 1 would have to say it probably has to come from the library,
museums, archives and galleries kind o f world.
Interviewee 04: I am not aware o f any masters program that builds on top o f computer
science degree to teach digital preservation or digital curation as concepts, the reason
probably being that candidates in, or people who have a degree in computer science have
such a big selection o f jo b offers on the market and preservation/curation, archives and
libraries are not amongst the first target employers that come to mind for them.
Third, interviewees discussed the responsibility o f digital curation as falling on multiple
people with diverse skills sets, not a single professional who possessed all o f the required skills.
For example:

Interviewee 06: I guess one o f the things I like about the area and one o f the things that I
like about the community is that it welcomes all sorts o f people with all sorts o f skills,
including educators and trainers. You can work with somebody at different levels, and it
actually needs people with so many different skill sets and the mindsets to make the
community and this activity fully functional.
Interviewee 07: So there are two main blocks I think o f doing data management. There is
the technical side o f things which involves managing servers and moving files around
and checking file formats or building databases or building metadata models. ..and it's
software developers and technical types you need to be able to do those sort o f
things...That's important, but 1 also think that it's really important that you have the, I
159

don't know the softer more social skills as well. That would include things like going out
and talking to the researchers and engaging with them so that they feel like they are being
valued but also engaging with them to get that information out o f them for the metadata
and encourage them, reward them, make them feel like they are part o f the team when it
comes to actually submitting data.

Interviewee 14: There is no single person who is going to have all the skills you need in a
digital preservation person.
The theme o f education echoes many o f the same observations as the theme o f multiple
discipline engagement. In both themes, the data analysis indicates a diversity o f stakeholders
invested in this area. The principal academic and research communities engaged in the area o f
digital curation appear to be those from within the information fields and the technology fields.
Several perspectives on the transmission o f the knowledge and skills base related to
digital curation became apparent when interviewees talked about education. For the most part,
the findings indicated that the knowledge and skills base for the area o f digital curation come
from a combination o f the information and technology fields. Some interviewees viewed the
area as an interdisciplinary domain that is related but distinct from its originating fields,
underscoring a nascent disciplinary perspective. Others view this domain as additional
competences required for traditional degree programs or professions. For example, data on this
surfaced in discussions with interviewees in the archives field and in biocuration. In both cases,
the primary objective was described as the education o f archivists or biologists who also possess
other skills required to address activities related to digital curation. Still others perceive digital
curation as a set o f practices that need to be widely adopted, embedded in research practice and
within the information fields, and valued as part o f the institutional structure. The emphasis is
not to distinguish the practices as something different, but rather as accepted conventions.

160

Education Explored
Whether emerging as an academic field or a set o f professional practices, the education
and training o f professionals equipped to address skill gaps has been acknowledged as a
significant challenge in the area o f digital curation. Digital curation remains broad in scope, and
has widespread implications for application and implementation. General competencies have
been identified, but specific skill sets reflect narrower professional roles. Because o f the scope
o f the area and lack o f core curriculum, courses related to digital curation “are somewhat o f a
moving target, not only in the ways and frequency in which they are offered, but in the ways they
are named and presented in the curriculum” (Bastian, Cloonan, & Harvey, 2011, p. 614).
Table 7.4 offers a selection o f program names for degree-granting programs,
specializations, and post-graduate certificates. This selection highlights the variety o f names
used in this area. The choice o f program name is indicative o f the originating discipline, learning
objectives, the intended audience, the date the program was developed, and the influence o f the
creators o f the program. The program name and curriculum also needs to be relevant to students
and future employers. Unless otherwise noted, these programs are offered through the library
and information science department. Further analysis into ways in which digital curation and
preservation concepts are presented or integrated across LIS, computer science, and within the
domain sciences curricula is warranted.

There has been considerable growth in educational and training opportunities in the area
o f digital curation, namely curriculum development, continuing education and professional
training opportunities, and research data management instruction. Although core competencies
and curriculum development have been addressed (see Tibbo, Hank, & Lee, 2008; Kim, Addom,
& Stanton, 2011; Kim, Warga, & Moen. 2013), the administrative, organizational, and political
unit o f this area within higher education is yet undecided. For the most part, the themes o f
multiple discipline engagement and education suggest that digital curation intersects the
boundaries o f information fields and the technology fields. Currently, programs tend to originate
in LIS or archival programs, but the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary nature o f the area
makes it relevant for many disciplines. The theme o f education also highlights the multiplicity
o f terminology used in this area, and in turn the multiplicity o f the conceptual and practical
domains which each o f those terms represent.
Summary
In this chapter, 1 presented the findings and discussion for the themes multiple discipline
engagement and education. The theme o f multiple discipline engagement that emerged from
data analysis corresponds with the disciplinary element “styles o f subjectivity.” The findings
suggest that practice and research related to digital curation involves individuals with different
expertise, knowledge, and perspective. This translates to stakeholders from different disciplinary
backgrounds merging diverse interests and perspectives. At present in the area o f digital
curation, each discipline appears to bring its own style o f subjectivity. The theme o f education
directly aligns with the academic organizational unit and higher educational curriculum
elements. The findings suggest that education and training for areas related to digital curation
are stili developing and a higher education core curriculum still evolving. Although the skill sets

163

come from both the information and technology fields, currently programs in this area are mostly
offered through library and information science departments, or as individual courses in other
domains.
In the next chapter, 1 present the third part o f the findings and discussion. The theme o f
areas o f professional and scholarly focus is explored in detail and 1 provide a summary o f the
findings and discussion chapters.

164

CHAPTER 8: FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: PART III
This chapter is Part III o f the findings and discussion. The chapter is organized in two
main sections. In the first section I explore the findings and discussion for the final theme, areas
o f professional and scholarly focus. In the second section, I provide a comprehensive summary
o f the findings and discussions that have been explored in Chapters Six, Seven, and Eight.
Theme Five: Areas o f Professional and Scholarly Focus
The final theme addressed in the findings and discussion was developed from a set o f
open codes from the content analysis. This theme, areas o f professional and scholarly focus, is
defined as a descriptive summary o f the main subject matters that characterize the area o f digital
curation as represented in the sample o f published literature in this study, including informative
articles, commentary, reports, and research. Each o f the articles coded for the content analysis
can be categorized into one o f these six areas. The six areas o f professional and scholarly focus
identified in this study are: Development o f the Field, Implementation, Functions, Preservation,
Research Data, and Infrastructure.
The areas are described as follows:
1. Development o f the Field.
This area o f focus includes commentary and research about education in the area o f
digital curation; roles and responsibilities o f professionals in practice; and theory
building and model development. It also contains calls to action; surveys o f the
area’s historical development including commentary on exemplar or pivotal projects;
and research agenda setting. This area o f focus is both reflective in nature and
represents a relevant object o f research, exemplified by this study.

165

2. Implementation.
This area o f focus is wholly about digital curation in practice and best practices. It
encompasses practical case studies and reports o f activities; program descriptions and
commentary on the implementation o f digital curation/preservation programs;
application o f tools or workflows; and digitization efforts and technology. Also
within this focus are ethical and legal concerns. This area o f focus is indicative o f the
applied and practical orientation o f the area reinforced by the influence o f
collaborative initiatives and exemplar implementation projects.
3. Functions.
This area o f focus represents commentary and research on the major actions,
functions, and processes o f digital curation. In the sample, these tended to be
clustered around the Ingest, Access, and Archival Storage functional entities o f the
Open Archival Information System Reference Model. However, this area o f focus
also includes, for example, acquisition, appraisal and selection, and instruction and
outreach, as well as general repository administrative and management issues.
4. Preservation.
Although preservation could be grouped within the Functions category, it has its own
area o f focus because it was one o f the more prevalent subject matters in the
literature. This area o f focus is concerned with such subjects as preservation
strategies, risk assessment, threats to longevity, and web archiving. It contains four
subareas: Pol icy/Planning, preservation o f specific Content Types, preservation o f
specific Media Types, and Technology Solutions.

166

5. Research Data.
Research data is another subject matter that was assigned its own area o f focus
because o f its prevalence in the literature, especially from within the domain sciences.
This area o f focus encompasses commentary and research specific to any field o f
research data as a particular type o f content. Topics such as curated databases, data
annotation, data management, data publication, and data sharing are included in this
focus.
6. Infrastructure.
This area o f focus pertains to commentary and research about building sustainable
infrastructure for activities related to digital curation. It contains two subareas. First,

Cyberinfrastructure: topics related to infrastructure for research activities, which
includes data archives, e-Research activities, and scholarly communication. Second,

Digital Infrastructure: topics related to infrastructure for digital preservation, which
includes digital archives and digital libraries, interoperability, and standards.

The

Infrastructure area o f focus addresses big picture interoperability and sustainability
issues, and new ways o f conducting research in the digital environment.
For each o f the 460 items in the content analysis, codes were recorded for the subject o f
the article (focus) and for the topic o f the article (locus). The subject is the broad general
category about which the article was written. The topic is the narrower issue o f investigation
which falls into the subject category. For example, the focus o f an article was preservation and
the locus was the challenge o f technological obsolescence; the purposes o f the articles and their
supporting material within a single area o f focus were quite variable. The focus and locus codes
were explored, aggregated into categories, and then refined into six areas o f professional and

167

scholarly focus. Figure 8.1 provides a visual representation o f the six areas o f professional and
scholarly focus and ways in which they relate to one another. The figure includes the number o f
articles from the sample (n) that were categorized into each area.

Figure 8.1. Content analysis sample: The six areas o f professional and scholarly focus and their
relationships.

There are evident relationships between the areas o f professional and scholarly focus,
represented by dotted lines in Figure 8.1. For instance, Research Data is associated with the
Preservation subarea o f Content Type. Also, the Preservation subareas o f Policy/Planning and
Technology Solutions are associated with the development o f a sustainable infrastructure for

168

digital preservation. Implementation, as noted by its multiple relationship lines, has far-reaching
implications. Additionally, commentary and research on the topic o f use and users show up in
areas such as access (Functions) and data reuse (Research Data); and the topic o f metadata is
everywhere and categorized based on the core subject matter, such as metadata at ingest
(Functions) or metadata standards (Infrastructure).
Two o f the areas o f focus deserve special attention, namely Preservation and Research
Data. Articles in these two subject categories comprised over half o f the sample. Because
preservation is a central activity o f digital curation, articles concerning this subject could be
categorized in the Functions category. The Functions category represents literature about the key
activities and processes o f digital curation. This subject category can be broadly understood as
including articles about topics related to the functions o f the OAIS Reference Model or the
actions o f the DCC Curation Lifecycle model. However, the literature that focuses on
preservation issues was more extensive than other subjects. This is in part because preservation
has been at the center o f research agendas for more than 20 years and is at the core o f digital
curation. Long-term preservation, which ensures accessibility and counters obsolescence, is the
main response that drives the area. For this reason, reservation constitutes its own subject area
unique from other functions o f digital curation.
Research data is the only specific content type that warranted its own subject area
category in this study. Research data is the critical junction between the domain sciences and the
information and technology fields in discussions about concepts and practices related to digital
curation. Although the underlying practice and concepts for the long-term preservation and
stewardship o f research data are the same as other types o f digital objects, the issues that
surround research data constitute its own problem space and stimulate research questions specific

169

to the management, reuse, and sharing o f scientific data. As Figure 8.1 shows Research Data is
associated with the subject category Implementation, the Preservation subarea o f Content Type,
and the Infrastructure subarea Cyberinfrastructure. These relationships are significant because
they link the stewardship o f research data with other activities related to digital curation rather
than isolate this content type from ongoing research and expertise.

Research Agendas
The theme o f areas o f professional and scholarly focus that was derived from the content
analysis is mapped to the disciplinary element o f “body o f accumulated knowledge and skills"
from the conceptual framework. A discipline is founded on an object or phenomenon o f study
which constitutes the agreed domain o f practice, research, and teaching. Underpinning this body
o f knowledge and skills are characteristic methodologies; conceptual frameworks and
explanatory theories; and a critical mass o f disciplinary assumptions, definitions, explanations,
and facts about the domain. The discipline gains institutional and social control over the
knowledge and research o f that particular phenomenon o f study and in turn establishes
boundaries around the domain.
The body o f accumulated knowledge embraces an agenda for research, which identifies
and prioritizes research problems and gaps in our understanding. In the area o f digital curation
there have been several efforts to outline a research agenda and codify past initiatives in an
attempt at a more systematic approach to research. Since the early 1990s these research agendas
have articulated the imperative for improved understanding and implementation o f digital
preservation practices, the value o f digital curation and preservation research, and key challenges
and problem spaces to address (Hedstrom, 1991; Bennett, 1997; Hedstrom et al„ 2003;
Workshop on Research Challenges in Digital Archiving and Long-term Preservation, 2003;

170

Digital Preservation Europe, 2007; Chanod, Dobreva, Rauber, Ross. & Casarosa, 2010;
PARSE.Insight Consortium, 2010; Faniel & Zimmerman, 2011). Additionally, they have
emphasized the need for a concerted effort across disciplines through cooperation and
coordination, and the essential role o f collaboration.
Research agendas also serve to identify areas for disciplinary growth. They not only
identify gaps in the research, but are also used as a gauge for measuring the progress o f the field.
For example, in Digital Preservation Research Roadmap (2007), a report prepared by Digital
Preservation Europe (DPE), researchers conducted a both an online Delphi study and a crosswalk
analysis o f 12 published research agendas from the previous 16 years. The researchers
concluded that “after 16 years o f research and the continuous refinement o f a research agenda,
very little progress has actually been made during this time.’" The result o f this study was the
identification o f 10 core areas for research: restoration; conservation; management; risk;
significant properties o f digital objects; interoperability; automation; context; storage; and
experimentation. The report further observed that there has yet to be many successful shared
solutions to the challenges faced by digital preservation: “The theoretical basis o f digital
preservation research is sound. Now the shift in focus needs to return to resolving the
fundamental issues and apply the results in practice” (Digital Preservation Europe, 2007).
This lack o f progress in the area o f digital curation has been echoed repeatedly. Seamus
Ross concluded in his keynote address in 2007 at the 11th European Conference on Digital
Libraries that “research in digital preservation must in general be more rigorous,
methodologically founded, repeatable, verifiable, contextualised, and more effectively reported;
that is, it could conform better to the ‘scientific paradigm .’ It needs to be more ‘experimental’

171

than it has been up to now” (p. 18). In a 2011 plenary address at a symposium on preservation
education hosted by the University o f Michigan, Anne Gilliland noted:
If high-impact research will be fostered and sustained, then preservation must become an
established presence in the academy. At the same time, it must remain embedded in
practice— in undertaking preservation-centric research, and in preparing future
professionals and academics who can undertake rigorous research in the field and in the
academy. There must be a holistic conceptualization o f preservation as a field (Gilliland,
2014, p. 54).
Research is essential for the development o f a discipline and the area o f digital curation
in general. Research builds the knowledge base and refines the domain, establishes societal
importance o f the area, provides for evidence-based practice, and encourages critical analysis o f
the extant practice and research. Most recently, the 2015 National Agenda fo r Digital

Stewardship report called attention to “the limited amount o f empirical evidence available.”
The report further observed that “the digital preservation community is beginning to develop a
shared evidence base; however, studies must be broadened and repeated over time to establish a
robust evidence base from which generalizable guidance can be drawn” (National Digital
Stewardship Alliance Coordinating Committee and Working Group, 2014, p. 7).
The six areas o f professional and scholarly focus noted in this chapter are not defined as
research areas, but rather suggest areas o f community interest observed in the published
literature. The extant body o f accumulated knowledge and skills does include research, but the
literature is underpinned by professional and scholarly commentary, reports o f collaborative
research initiatives, exemplars o f implementations, and conceptual model development. The
content analysis sample did not focus only on research, but on any form o f published material as

172

it appeared in the content analysis sample. The area o f digital curation and preservation as a
research field is emergent. As it emerges and as the area differentiates and refines itself, the
literature reflects priorities in the developing domain, as well as problem spaces, research
questions, and topics o f interest.
These areas o f focus do align with some o f the problem spaces and research questions
advanced in the published research agendas. For example, DPE’s Digital Preservation

Research Roadmap (2007) largely focused on preservation issues, but also highlighted
interoperability and storage as two areas for further research activity. These two topics are
included in the areas o f professional and scholarly focus within the Infrastructure and Functions
categories, respectively. Faniel and Zimmerman (2011) target the research data sharing and
reuse problem space, which is contained in the Research Data category in this study.
The accumulated body o f knowledge and skills, and more specifically research in the area
o f digital curation, is emerging and maturing. Attempts at a more systematic approach to
growing the area have been made and continue to be made. It is clear that some progress has
been made; we are more aware o f pressing research questions, the need for more rigorous
research, and evidenced-based practice. There is an audience for the dissemination o f this
research, and conferences and journals for presenting findings. However, the challenge o f
communicating across disciplinary boundaries in a common language and to a variety o f
stakeholders needs to be overcome so that the progress can augment, application o f research can
be comprehensive, and shared solutions do not develop in isolation.
Summary o f Findings and Discussion
In Chapters Six, Seven, and Eight, I presented and discussed the key findings from the
analysis o f the data. Qualitative and quantitative data from scoping the literature, content

173

analysis, and interviews were explored together and provided corresponding findings. Five
major themes emerged from the data analysis: terminology, collaboration, multiple discipline
engagement, education, and areas o f professional and scholarly focus.
The first theme that emerged from the data analysis was terminology which aligns with
the “discursive community" element from the conceptual framework. The theme o f terminology
was defined as words or phrases used to identify the area o f practice and research related to
digital curation. The Findings suggest that although there is generally a shared understanding o f
most field-specific jargon in the area o f digital curation, a common language has not fully
coalesced. Choice o f terminology is descriptive and situational, largely determined by what is
most meaningful to the audience, rather than prescriptive and harmonized. The findings also
indicate that there are disciplinary differences in the choice o f terms employed. The examination
o f terminology also arises recurrently in the literature. The purpose o f these discussions are
often to specify the evolution o f how a term came into use, identify the distinction between
terms, or address why one term is used by the authors rather than another (Yakel, 2007; Dallas,
2007; Baker & Yarmey, 2009; Bastian, Cloonan, & Harvey, 2011; Flanders & Munoz, 2011;
Palmer, Weber, Munoz, & Renear, 2013).
The theme o f collaboration aligns with the “social networks" disciplinary element. The
theme o f collaboration was defined as any instance or mention o f two or more people or
institutions cooperating, sharing resources, or working together for mutual benefit or to achieve
shared goals. The findings suggest that there are well-established social networks in place within
the digital curation and related communities. These networks are cultivated through
collaboration, and a conviction within the community o f the necessity and value o f collaboration.
Interviewees approached the theme o f collaboration from two main perspectives. First,

174

collaboration was observed to be necessary for successful and sustainable digital curation in
practice. Second, interviewees associated collaborative projects with building communication
and social networks with others working in the area. The data provided nominal detail as to the
degree to which these social networks extend across disciplinary boundaries; while it is evident
that some disciplines interact more than others, it appears that there is a level o f disciplinary
isolation.
The theme o f multiple discipline engagement that emerged from data analysis
corresponds with the disciplinary element “styles o f subjectivity.” This theme was defined as
any instance or mention o f two or more people or institutions from different disciplines or fields
working together, or the combination and application o f concepts, methods, practices, or theories
from two or more distinct disciplines or fields. The findings suggest that practice and research
related to digital curation involves individuals with different expertise, knowledge, and
perspective. This translates to stakeholders from different disciplinary backgrounds merging
diverse interests and perspectives. When working in multi-discipline settings, styles o f
subjectivity are placed in conflict with each other. For instance, collaboration between multiple
disciplines “requires rigor, b u t...it also requires... willful suspension o f [one’s] own concepts o f
rigor” (Strober, 2006, p. 322). At present in the area o f digital curation, each discipline appears
to bring its own style o f subjectivity. However, a nascent digital curation perspective
characteristic o f the area was discernible in some o f the data.
The theme o f education directly aligns with the “academic organizational unit” and a
higher educational “curriculum” elements o f the conceptual framework. The theme o f education
was defined as any comment about educating or training o f professionals for activities and
employment related to digital curation. Gaps in skills have been identified in the area, and are

175

being addressed by an increase in opportunities for professional development training and
through higher education curriculum development projects. The findings suggest that education
and training for areas related to digital curation are still developing and a higher education core
curriculum is still evolving. Although the knowledge and skills base comes from both the
information and technology fields, currently programs in this area are mostly offered through
library and information science departments or as individual courses across domains.
The theme o f areas o f professional and scholarly focus is mapped to the “body o f
accumulated knowledge and skills1’ disciplinary element. This theme is defined as a descriptive
summary o f the main subject matters that characterize the area o f digital curation represented in
the sample o f published literature in this study, including informative articles, commentary,
reports, and research. There were six areas o f professional and scholarly focus identified in this
study: Development o f the Field, Implementation, Functions, Preservation, Research Data, and
Infrastructure. Each o f the articles coded for the content analysis were categorized into one o f
these six areas. The findings suggest that there exists a considerable body o f professional and
scholarly knowledge in the area o f digital curation, which is increasing and still evolving.
However, because o f the area’s interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary nature the domain is large
in scope and unsettled. The interface and transmission o f knowledge between the realms o f
education, practice, research, and theory within the area o f digital curation continues to mature.
In the next chapter, I attend directly to the research questions and offer conclusions to this
study. I discuss implications o f the study, review limitations, and provide direction for future
research. The aim o f the concluding chapter is to pull together the evidence that has been
presented in the previous chapters to provide a cohesive summary.

176

CHAPTER 9: CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH
In this chapter I discuss the research questions and offer conclusions to this study. The
chapter is organized in four main sections. In the first section, I supply a summary o f this
research. In the second section, 1 consider the research questions in detail and discuss
implications o f the findings. I also review the limitations o f the study. In the third section, I
offer a conclusion to this dissertation. In the last section, I present areas o f future research.
Summary o f Research
This dissertation research was designed to investigate whether digital curation, defined
broadly in this study as the active lifecycle management o f data for current and future use, is
emerging as a distinct discipline. The purpose o f this study was to explore the character,
development, and education o f the area o f digital curation by conducting an in-depth analysis o f
how this area is evolving. The conceptual framework employed in this research positions the
findings relative to elements that characterize it as an academic discipline.
The research questions addressed in this study were:
RQ1: Is digital curation emerging as an autonomous discipline?
a

In what ways do interviewees describe the relationship o f digital curation to
areas within the information disciplines?

b

Are there indicators that suggest digital curation is emerging as a discipline in
its own right?

RQ2: Where does digital curation fit within the educational landscape?
a

To what extent and in what ways do interviewees express the role o f
education in the knowledge transfer o f digital curation practices, skills, and
theories?

This dissertation employed a qualitative multimethod research design. The methodology
used was scoping the literature, content analysis o f published literature in the area o f digital
curation (n=460), and interviews with people engaged in this area (n=14), This study focused on
identifying themes that emerge from the academic discourse and scholarly communication, and
understanding the level o f consensus among educators, practitioners, and researchers about how
they view this domain.
In Chapter Three, I provided a context for understanding the nature and development o f
academic disciplines. This chapter also provided support for the conceptual framework used in
this study. In this dissertation, I used the conceptual model put forth by D 'A gostino (2012) that
views a discipline as a cultural system, which is the interaction o f ten elements that characterize
a discipline interpreted within a framework o f shallow consensus. D 'A gostino contends that
although we can define a discipline in terms o f it meeting certain criteria, we must also
contextualize the development o f a discipline historically and accept that members o f a discipline
may have varying interpretations o f what each element embodies.
In Chapter Four, I presented an historical perspective o f the development o f the area o f
digital curation. The narrative outlines the contributions o f the archival, LIS, and research
communities in the evolution o f a digital preservation community and the eventual emergence o f
digital curation in 2001. Adopting the phrase digital curation was an effort to recognize an area
o f shared concern across all domains, and that longevity and reuse o f data is an ongoing process
influenced by complex cultural, organizational, and technical issues. In Chapter Five, I extended
this narrative to address the growth o f higher education curriculum and professional training in
the area o f digital curation.

178

In Chapters Six, Seven, and Eight, I presented the key findings and discussion. Five
major themes emerged from the data analysis: terminology, collaboration, multiple discipline
engagement, education, and areas o f professional and scholarly focus. The five themes were
mapped to the elements o f the conceptual framework, and were used to support the conclusions
presented in this chapter.
Research Questions
In this section I address each o f the research questions and subquestions drawing from
data I collected, the framework I used, and the analysis I conducted. In short, digital curation has
not emerged as an autonomous discipline, but does meet several o f the criteria to indicate its
potential for emergence. Currently, it intersects the boundary between the information fields and
the technology fields. Importantly, a nascent perspective characteristic o f the area o f digital
curation was discernible in the data that differentiated it from the disciplinary perspectives o f its
originating fields. Education for this area fits well in coordination with archive and LIS higher
education; however, there are many interested stakeholders and skill development is important
across the domain fields.
RQ1: Is digital curation emerging as an autonomous discipline?
Observed in the area o f digital curation are the reducibility o f concepts to their
originating discipline, and a lack o f cohesiveness across the broad social network and intellectual
domain. Digital curation comprises archival theory, information management, and technological
innovation, among other concepts and skills borrowed from extant disciplinary knowledge bases.
At present, these aspects have not been integrated to a point where they form their own body o f
knowledge that is developing autonomously. As such, digital curation is not the jurisdiction o f a
single discipline, but the result o f a shared need across disciplines.
179

The first subquestion asked: In what ways do interviewees describe the relationship o f
digital curation to areas within the information disciplines? The aim o f this question was to
understand how the digital curation community articulates the roles o f the fields o f archival
studies, and library and information science in relation to the area o f digital curation. This was
ascertained to gain a better appreciation for which fields influence the area o f digital curation and
to counter any bias arising from my perspective from within the information fields.
For the most part, interview participants viewed the area o f digital curation as existing on
the boundary between the information fields and the technology fields. Digital curation is
fundamentally about information management and preservation. It borrows concepts from
archival studies such as authenticity and provenance. The area extends to research areas that
investigate how people access, search, and use/reuse digital information. This all occurs
intrinsically within the confines o f technology.
However, the role o f domain knowledge for areas related to digital curation cannot be
underrepresented. For the curation o f domain-specific data and databases, expertise in the
domain is essential for providing accurate annotations and metadata. In fact, many within these
areas see this as a technology problem not an information problem. This is clearly evident in the
findings that show domain specialists routinely using information management practices to
enhance research possibilities without consulting information management experts. Again, these
new research possibilities exist bounded by technological innovations.
This incongruity between the information fields and the domain fields creates a
dichotomy between the treatment o f digital cultural heritage, including library materials, and
research data. This is observed in the use o f the term digital curation more frequently in
publications relating to archival studies, LIS, and museum studies, and the more accepted use o f

180

the term data curation in domain sciences publications. This dichotomy is not only perpetuated
by differences in terminology and a distinction o f type o f digital asset, but also by the more
systemic lack o f cohesion and harmony across digital curation and related areas.
The second subquestion asked: Are there indicators that suggest digital curation is
emerging as a discipline in its own right? This question gets to the core o f the analysis o f the
data. Its objective was to identify what elements, as defined by the conceptual framework, were
observed in the area o f digital curation. Table 9.1 outlines which disciplinary' elements are
observed for the area o f digital curation and provides markers that illustrate progress.
D 'A gostino (2012) contends that although we can begin to define a discipline in terms o f
it meeting the certain criteria, we must also contextualize the development o f the discipline
historically and accept that members o f the discipline may have varying interpretations o f what
each element embodies. By acknowledging the elements that comprise a discipline in the
context o f the development o f the area we can better realize how the discipline came to be
constituted by those elements. D ’Agostino argued that the elements that constitute a discipline
have to be understood within the framework o f '"shallow consensus” (p. 341). Shallow
consensus is the varying degrees o f agreement that members o f the same discipline share about
their discipline or aspects o f their discipline, it is this shallow consensus that is necessary to feed
the exploration o f new ideas, innovation, and growth o f the discipline, or conversely divide the
discipline.

Digital curation has a complex history with many actors and as such requires a narrative
that represents the involvement and progress o f all stakeholders. The area o f digital curation has
evolved alongside computer technology, only at a slower pace, with concepts and practices that
have emerged from within a variety o f disciplines. These disciplinary-specific concepts and
practices, from the archival, LIS, and research communities, developed parallel to each other
without much integration. The confluence began as a digital preservation community emerged
and was reinforced with the emergence o f digital curation, which conceptually captured the set
o f practices and accompanying models for the lifecycle management and preservation o f all data.
There are clear markers that demonstrate progress has been achieved in the area o f digital
curation; however, there are several aspects that impede its emergence as an academic discipline.
In particular, these aspects revolve around the absence o f a digital curation identity. Identity is
“a sense o f shared understandings and skills, experiences, common way o f perceiving problems
and their possible solutions. This identity is formed and reproduced through a shared and
common educational background and professional training, work practice and memberships in
professional associations” (Kallberg, 2012, p. 99). A commonly held sense o f identity heips
unify a community o f people with shared interests and goals.
First, there is not yet consensus on the name o f the field or how the fieid is defined. As
noted in the findings and discussion, academic programs exhibit a variety o f names for this area
o f study and we see even more diversity o f terminology in publications. There is consensus that
the area is about the lifecycle management o f digital assets, and involves both adding value and
preservation. However, there are distinctions drawn between types o f digital assets. These
distinctions influence not only how the area is referenced and the conceptual terms employed,
but also influence problem spaces for research and areas for practical implementation.

183

This leads to the second aspect, which is that the domain o f digital curation is broad
spanning across disciplinary, practical, and research boundaries and there is not yet consensus on
the direction o f the field. There are calls for more research and evidence-based practice, more
implementation o f shared solutions including establishing a robust infrastructure, and more
educational and training opportunities. But digital curation faces similar obstacles as other
applied and professional fields in higher education, such as library and information science,
nursing, and information technology. These obstacles include proving their legitimacy as a
research and theoretical field as well as gaining acceptance from the established disciplines.
Consensus on the direction o f the field would concentrate efforts and resources according to the
goals o f the community.
From the interviews 1 gieaned three primary underlying points o f view about the direction
o f digital curation. From the first perspective, which included that o f the archivists, the domain
o f digital curation was a set o f competencies, practices, and skills that is additional to current
roles and responsibilities but not fundamentally different. Another perspective also approached
the domain as practical, but not from within a particular field, rather as an advocate for digital
curation as an integrated set o f practices. A primary goal from this perspective was to embed
activities related to digital curation into the research practice for improving data management,
replication o f findings, and data sharing; and into the practice o f information professionals who
work with digital materials in archives, libraries, and museums. The third perspective viewed
the domain as having the potential to become differentiated as an autonomous specialization or
eventual discipline, although the disciplinary knowledge and skills base that support the area are
currently embedded in existing disciplines. Most o f the interview participants provided
commentary that corresponded to one o f these first two perspectives.

184

Lastly, there is not yet a professional organization that advocates for the community and
the profession, and provides a venue for collaboration. In addressing archival identity and the
role o f forming professional associations to centralize efforts, Shepherd (2012) contends that
"working together, forging our common identity and self-belief, has brought us a success which
we would never have won as a scattered handful o f individual scholars" (Shepherd, 2012, p.
176). Part o f the problem is that currently there are professionals who take on roles and
responsibilities associated with digital curation, but a position for a digital curator is uncommon.
It is partly in the name. There are archivists who work with electronic records, librarians who
manage institutional repositories, biologists who curate databases, and so on. So, the question
remains: are there digital curation professionals or are there professionals who use digital
curation practices?
RQ2: Where does digital curation fit within the educational landscape?
The education and training for skills related to digital curation occurs across disciplinary
boundaries; however, current certificate programs and specialization tend to emerge within
library and information science schools. This positioning is filled with both promise and
uncertainty: promise that the new digital curation professionals will possess an education that
supports interdisciplinarity and a holistic view o f information; uncertainty about the level o f
technological skills these professionals will emerge with and the stigma o f outmoded archive and
library fields.
The subquestion asked: To what extent and in what ways do interviewees express the role
o f education in the knowledge transfer o f digital curation practices, skills, and theories? This
question directly addressed issues o f education and training in the area o f digital curation.
Specifically, it attempted to differentiate higher education programs in digital curation and

185

practical training tor professional development. Additionally, it was intended to get at the state
o f current educational offerings in this area and how interviewees envision education in this area
in the future.
For the most part, courses for digital curation and related areas are additive rather than
integrated into the core LIS or archival curriculum. This indicates that digital curation
competencies are not, at present, considered core knowledge areas for information professionals.
There are some specialization tracks w ithin LIS programs that focus on the curation,
management, and preservation o f research data or digital assets. Curriculum expansion in this
area began and persists as post-graduate or additional credit certificate programs, which
illustrates the notion that these complementary skills sets supplement traditional disciplinary
education.
The value o f taking coursework in digital curation and related areas was also addressed.
The two key concerns discussed were not about the value o f the skilis gained or the value o f
digital curation as a set o f concepts and practices, but about the value o f investing in this career
path. The first concern addressed was about the accreditation o f digital curation programs,
which currently does not exist. When the coursework is supplementary to computer science,
LIS, or museum degrees, then it is the degree-granting program that carries the accreditation.
This is observed in archival studies programs offered through LIS schools, which fall under the
American Library Association accreditation for LIS degree-granting programs. The concern is
that if students are investing in an education, they are more inclined to invest in an accredited
program. The second comment on value focused on the interest o f computer science students
pursuing this area. Several interviewees commented that digital curation and related areas are
not prevalent career paths for computer science students. As such, computer science

186

departments are more likely to invest in other opportunities more aligned with future employer
and student goals.
There is also the notion o f the convergence o f professional education for archives,
libraries, and museums for working with materials in the digital environment. Each profession
comes from different disciplinary traditions and works with different types o f collections:
however, the competencies and skills related to digital curation for the long-term care o f these
digital assets are not different. Jennifer Trant, a leading researcher in this area, wrote that “while
the traditions and historical areas o f expertise in archives, libraries, and museums may differ, the
new challenges facing all collecting cultural institutions are best addressed in concert, in an
interdisciplinary forum that explores multiple solutions and takes advantage o f many skills”
(Trant, 2009, p. 377). Digital curation reflects this convergence with its holistic view o f digital
assets, conceptual models, and technology skills. The divergence, once again, focuses on the
collection or content type. The challenge is how to reconcile the way that individuals view their
digital materials uniquely with the fact that the underlying practices and principles for the long­
term care o f all digital materials is the same.
Implications o f Findings
This study has provided markers for gauging future progress o f the area o f digital
curation. At present, digital curation has not emerged as an autonomous discipline, although
there are observable indicators that the area is maturing. This study has outlined those indicators
and delineated barriers for future progress. But this study does not necessarily chart a path for
digital curation towards becoming an academic discipline: rather it guides the area to become a
more cohesive and harmonized field o f practice and research. Emerging academic disciplines
require both institutionalization within higher education, and recognition o f their autonomy and

187

legitimacy by other disciplines. The community must come to a consensus about the direction o f
digital curation.
Yet, a nascent digital curation-oriented perspective is now becoming visible. It is
distinctive from the domains from which the area borrows and integrates. In fact, it emerges as
not being within the boundaries o f an identifiable discipline. The perspective assumes a holistic
view o f data that includes all forms and types o f digital asset, regardless o f content or context.
The perspective is grounded in the lifecycle approach to digital information and is inclusive o f
access and use, preservation, and technology. The perspective advocates for competencies,
knowledge, and skills related to digital curation to be embedded across disciplines in practice
and research. This perspective has been perpetuated on the job, within the community, and is
gradually being reproduced via the developing curriculum emerging in higher education.
The findings from this study confirm many o f the commonly held assumptions about this
area, namely that it is collaborative and engages multiple disciplines, and that the area o f
professional and scholarly interest is broad in scope. But the study also identifies lines o f
demarcation between types o f collections and content that reinforces the parallel growth o f
similar areas, rather than encouraging shared solutions.
Discussion o f Limitations
As discussed in Chapter One, there are four main limitations to this study. The
limitations that have the greatest potential impact to this study are the purposive sampling
method; the availability o f material for the content analysis; the publishing trends o f academics
and practitioners; and language restrictions on the samples selection. In this section, 1 elaborate
on the potential impact o f each limitation.

188

The use o f purposive sampling rather than a randomized sampling method is common in
qualitative research designs. Non-probability sampling restricts generalization o f the findings
because the sample is not representative o f the population. Purposive sampling was used in
order to select a group o f participants who would be able to speak to the overall objectives o f this
research. As such, the sample over-represented the fields o f archival studies, and library and
information science. Additionally, the interviewees came from within the digital curation or
preservation community and therefore already possess some shared acceptance and
understanding o f concepts, roles, and terminology.
Additionally, the sample for the content analysis is limited by the materials available.
Discourse in the area o f digital curation includes community-based publications and grey
literature. They are more difficult to locate via conventional searching methods and are not
always accessible in citation databases. The availability o f databases for searching and the
selection o f the sample, although deliberate and methodical, also apply limitations on scoping the
literature and content analysis sample.
Publishing trends differ between scholars and practitioners in the U S fields, and they
differ between disciplines (Schlogl & Stock, 2008; Haddow & Klobas, 2004; Powell, Baker, &
Mika. 2002). This difference is present in publications related to digital curation. These trends
not only include frequency o f publication and type o f articles but also number o f authors, citation
practices, and how abstracts are structured. Because the area o f digital curation engages multipie
disciplines, these differences likely have a subtle impact on the content analysis findings.
Lastiy, ail interviews were conducted in English and samples for the content analysis
were limited to articles or presentations written in English. Very few foreign language articles
were retrieved in scoping the iiterature or the content analysis searches. The area o f digital

189

curation is an international venture, and although publishing in English is common for European
countries and China, this limitation at least minimally restricted the sample.
Conclusion
Perspective is important. From the perspective o f archival studies, digital curation is
about digital archiving. For library and information science, it is about digital information
management and preservation. For the technology fields, it is about finding technical solutions.
For the domain sciences, it is about research data management. However, all share a similar
objective: to ensure the authenticity and longevity o f digital assets that are o f value to a
designated community.
The phrase “digital curation” was originally coined as an umbrella term to represent the
sameness o f the underlying concepts and processes for the ongoing lifecycle care o f all types o f
digital materials. The heterogeneity observed in the area o f digital curation does not preclude it
from being or becoming a discipline. All disciplines are in fact heterogeneous to some extent
when considering the various specializations and shallow consensus. This heterogeneity
encourages improved communication, healthy debate, and rigorous research, which in turn
supports growth o f the field intellectually, institutionally, and in size and consequence.
T he interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary nature o f digital curation will evolve into a
more coordinated and cohesive field; however, I do not anticipate the area emerging as an
autonomous academic discipline within the next decade. There has been considerable growth in
educational and training opportunities in this area, namely curriculum development, continuing
education and professional training opportunities, and research data management instruction.
How ever, the community requires a single set o f conceptual terms that is extensible and enables
effective communication: an association or organization to advocate for the fieid. build social

New directions for research suggested in the findings largely focus on improving current
practice. Notably, there was a discernible gap in the data in activities and research related to
digital curation in the business sector that I plan to examine more closely. An exception is the
grant-funded European project Timeless Business Processes and Services (TUMBUS, 20112014). whose vision is “to bring digital preservation into the realm o f Business Continuity
M anagement” (Timeless Business Processes and Services, n.d.). I plan to conduct an initial
exploratory study to get a better sense o f needs and current practices in this arena, and determine
whether there is indeed a gap in our current understanding and practice.
