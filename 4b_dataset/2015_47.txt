ABSTRACT
A majority of the previous research on older adults and their use of technology has focused on
computers and the Internet. Most of the eReader-specific research examined younger
participants in an academic setting. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to describe
the perspectives of Georgia senior adults in their adoption of eReaders. The adoption of an
eReader was generally defined as the acquisition of an eReader, followed by the selecting,
downloading, navigating, and reading of eBooks using an eReader. This study took place in a
public library and was designed to answer 3 research questions: (a) What are contributing
factors in senior adults’ decisions to use eBooks? (b) How do senior adults describe their
eReader experiences? (c) What are the challenges and benefits of senior adults regarding the use
of eReaders? Data were collected from questionnaires completed by 29 eReader owners age 50
and over. From this group, 8 individuals were interviewed and 6 participated in a focus group.
The data were analyzed and 4 themes emerged: Passion for eReader and eBook Selection; Sense
of Economic Value; Comfort with Technology; and Interest in Future Direction of Technology.
The intended use of the eReader influenced whether a single- or multi-function device was
purchased. Costs associated with ownership included an initial outlay for an eReader, the price
for eBooks, which were sometimes free, and for some participants, membership in Amazon
Prime. The participants were involved in technology from an early age, whether at home,
school, or work and maintained a keen interest not only in the state of current technology, but
also in the future direction that technology was headed. The themes represented a snapshot in
time for participants from a community with above average income and education levels.
Keywords: senior adults, eReader, eBook, technology, phenomenological, library

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
Adults learn based on their need to know, their self-concept, their own experience, their
readiness to learn, their orientation to learning, and their motivation (Knowles, 1980; Knowles,
Holton, & Swanson, 1998). These andragogical assumptions provide details about how adults
learn differently than children. This study focused on adults, and specifically older adults as they
described the process of adopting and learning to use an electronic reading device or eReader. I
used the term eReader generically while conducting this study and intended for it to include
devices (e.g., Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, Barnes & Noble NOOK GlowLight, etc.)
manufactured for the specific purpose of reading electronic books or eBooks. Also, the term was
used to describe other electronic devices, including computers, laptops, iPads, tablets or cellular
phones when participants used these devices in conjunction with an app downloaded for the
purpose of reading eBooks. The following sections provide details about the background,
purpose, significance and other important aspects of this investigation into the phenomenon of
eReader adoption.
Background
According to the Social Learning Theory, humans learn by watching (Bandura, 1977).
The abundance of technology has increased the opportunity for individuals to observe
technology in use. Even with these increased opportunities, Bean (2003) found aging adults
failed to adopt technology because of physical problems, attentional processes, and cognitive
slowing. According to the Technology Acceptance Model, individuals adopt technology based
on perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU; Davis, 1989). A vast majority
of technology-related research that I uncovered during the literature review focused on computer
use and the Internet. Some of the research included older adults as subjects or participants

13
(Wagner, Hassanein, & Head, 2010; Youn-Min, 2008). When studies included the use of
eReaders, like those conducted by Larson (2010) and Shen (2011), the setting was typically an
academic one and the participants tended to be younger. The relative newness of eReaders
greatly limited the amount of available research. Studies like those by Smith (2014) and Zickukr
and Madden (2012) mentioned the ownership of eReaders by senior adults, but did not delve into
the issue of eReader use. The rarity and lack of depth in the existing studies provided an opening
for further research. This study sought to investigate the adoption of eReader technology by
senior adults in an effort to close this gap in the literature.
Situation to Self
As a professional librarian and teacher, my interests have included not only traditional
library research subjects related to books and reading, but also the influence of technology on
how libraries run and how librarians interact with patrons. My interest in the subject of eReaders
ignited when the local library acquired an eBook lending library and I purchased my own
eReader. As I provided eReader assistance to library patrons, I noticed most of the questions
originated from older adults. I started examining the older adult use of eReaders not only from a
practical point of view, but also from a theoretical one. As my practical experience in the subject
grew, so did my desire to review and conduct research on this topic.
Research in the qualitative realm is based on certain philosophical assumptions or beliefs.
Creswell (2013) labeled these beliefs as “ontology (the nature of reality), epistemology (what
counts as knowledge and how knowledge claims are justified), axiology (the role of values in
research), and methodology (the process of research)” (p. 20). The ontological assumption
inherent in this research was that multiple realities were present over time and that individual
participants within the study may have different experiences. The epistemological assumption

14
was that there existed a close relationship between librarians and patrons that facilitated the
conduct of this research. As an owner and adopter of an eReader and being over 50 years old
myself, I took on the additional role of being among the participants or “being one of them.”
The axiological assumption was that my background as a professional librarian influenced the
values that I projected onto this study. Specifically these values included the use of the library,
the act of reading, the adoption of technology and the provision of quality service to patrons.
The methodological assumption was that inductive procedures would be used to sort through the
data to form narratives that described the phenomenon. The framework that best captured these
qualitative assumptions was constructivism, and this study was developed around this paradigm.
Problem Statement
Henricksen and Stephens (2010) found that older adults intentionally pursued activities
that led to fulfilling or happiness-enhancing lives and that older adults engaged in entertainment
and relaxation activities including reading. However, the introduction of eReaders and eBooks is
changing how reading is being done. Companies are introducing electronics and are gearing
their marketing toward a younger audience because these companies seek to build lifetime
loyalties among younger consumers (Spero & Stone, 2004). However, older adults need to have
the same access as younger adults to technological tools (O’Connell & Haven, 2013; Selwyn,
Gorard, Furlong, & Madden, 2003). Simply having access may not be enough because older
adults have higher levels of technophobia (Hogan, 2009). For some older adults, their social
representations “can be summarized as follows: the computer and the internet are useless and
risky ‘tools and things’ that threaten one’s freedom, lifestyle, health and security as well as
create differences between users and non-users” (Hakkarainen, 2012, p. 1212). This extreme
position is counterbalanced by adults that are early adopters of technology. There are also older

15
adults, positioned somewhere in the middle, that believe computers are relevant, but are
uncertain as to how to fit this form of technology into their lives (Sourbati, 2009).
Most research regarding older adults and technology focused on computer use and the
Internet. Studies on eReaders have focused more on a comparison of the different devices
(Richardson & Mahmood, 2011) or on eReader use in academic libraries (Tees, 2010). To date,
there have been few studies conducted on older adults and their adoption of eReader technology.
This study sought to address this gap.
Purpose Statement
I used convenience sampling at a public library in Georgia to collect data and turned to
snowball sampling to identify other potential participants age 50 and over. The purpose of this
phenomenological study was to describe the perspectives of Georgia senior adults in their
adoption of eReaders. The adoption of an eReader was generally defined as the acquisition of an
eReader, followed by the selecting, downloading, navigating, and reading of eBooks using an
eReader.
Significance of the Study
This study endeavored to add to the knowledge base on senior adults, learning, and the
adoption of technology. Even with the increasing prevalence of smartphones, Smith (2014)
found that older adults (age 65 or older) were more likely to own a tablet or an eReader than a
smartphone. The apparent preference by older adults made the topic of eReader adoption an
appropriate subject worthy of further research. Print books have not gone away but eReaders
give older adults additional options for reading. Smith found that 27% of older adults owned a
tablet, an eReader, or both. A focus on the phenomenon surrounding the adoption of eReaders
allowed me to capitalize on this interest shown by older adults.

16
This study identified the factors associated with the acquisition of an eReader, and
examined the perspectives of older adults as they selected, downloaded, navigated, and read
eBooks using an eReader. To date, there has been very little research conducted on the topic.
Most studies involving the subject of senior adults and eReaders have focused on quantifying
device ownership (Smith, 2014; Zickuhr & Madden, 2012). A deeper understanding of the
phenomenon required a qualitative approach to the research, something that I set out to explore
in this study. Specifically, I sought to provide stakeholders in the field of senior adult eReader
users with a more in-depth look at how and why eReaders were used and laid the groundwork for
future qualitative and quantitative studies. This study provided librarians, educators, and
caregivers with some of the intricacies associated with working with older adults and informed
all parties on the experiences of adopting an eReader.
Research Questions
Gall, Gall, and Borg (2007) detailed how research questions were used to frame a study.
I designed this study as a qualitative one. The research questions were broader in nature, and I
developed them after reading literature relevant to the topic. Specifically, Aberton’s (2006) use
of a holistic look at participants (with ages ranging from early-50s to mid-80s) learning new
Information Technology (IT) skills in the sociocultural context of previous life experiences,
provided insight into the formation of research questions. Similarly, the Broady, Chan, and
Caputi (2010) study that compared older and younger adult computer learners enhanced my view
on appropriate and relevant questions. For this study, I used inductive reasoning to build
generalizations about senior adults and their adoption of eReaders. The research questions were:


What are contributing factors in senior adults’ decisions to use eBooks?

17
Senior adults may be the new recipients of a gift in the form of an eReader. Other senior adults
may feel societal force or peer pressure to use eBooks. Once engaged in this new format, some
older adults may prefer the convenience associated with the use of eBooks. This question sought
to ascertain the essence of these decisions.


How do senior adults describe their eReader experiences?

The intent of this question was to develop a description of how senior adults related their
eReader experience with other life experiences. These life experiences included ones garnered in
library-related and non-library-related practices.


What are the challenges and benefits of senior adults regarding the use of
eReaders?

This question addressed the issues associated with eReader use. The problems or challenges
may be manifested at any stage of the process including the acquisition of an eReader, followed
by the selecting, downloading, navigating, and reading of eBooks. Problems may also be
realized in terms of physical disabilities or declining cognitive abilities. This question also
addressed the benefits associated with eReader use for seniors who may or may not experience
problems with their device.
Research Plan
According to Creswell (2013), “Qualitative research begins with assumptions and the use
of interpretive/theoretical frameworks that inform the study of research problems addressing the
meaning individuals or groups ascribe to a social or human problem” (p. 44). Neuman (1994)
stated that reports of a qualitative nature “often contain rich description, colorful detail, and
unusual characters” (p. 317). “Phenomenology is the study of the world as it appears to
individuals when they lay aside the prevailing understandings of those phenomena and revisit

18
their immediate experience of the phenomena” (Gall et al., 2007, p. 495). Creswell (2013)
defined phenomenological research as that which “describes the common meaning for several
individuals of their lived experiences of a concept or a phenomenon” (p. 76). This qualitative
study employed a phenomenological research design to describe the similar experiences of senior
adults adopting and learning to use eReaders. Senior adults in Georgia, age 50 and over,
completed questionnaires as part of the initial sample. I set the initial sample size at 15 to 20, so
that approximately eight participants remained after possible attrition. I screened the
questionnaires to find the best potential candidates and used interviews as another strategy to
produce rich, thick data. The interviews continued until the data appeared to reach a saturation
point. I employed a focus group as my final strategy. This strategy allowed participants to feed
off of comments made by other members of the group and provided an opportunity to reinforce
interview findings or to delve into issues that resulted from the group discussion. After the data
were collected, I used the Moustakas (1994) techniques as simplified by Creswell (2013) to
analyze the “what” and the “how” of the experience.
Delimitations
The purposeful decisions or delimitations I made in designing this study included the use
of participants age 50 and over and the use of phenomenological research. I selected the age of
50 for several reasons. Age 50 defines the minimum age for full membership in the American
Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the Association of Mature American Citizens
(AMAC). This study did not focus specifically on retired participants, but the retirement
perception associated with these organizations lent credence to the notion that an older phase of
life had begun at age 50. Granted, as people have both lived longer and worked longer, the age
of 50 may not represent a true retirement age. However, many researchers cited the age of 50 in

19
their studies (e.g., Bartsch, 2012; Hogan, 2009; Pan & Jordan-Marsh, 2010). Additionally, in
2014, the youngest members of the Baby Boom generation, representing Americans born
between 1946 and 1964, turned 50 (Decker, 2010). In the study of adults and technology,
Heaggans (2012) chose to use the terms seniors and older adults interchangeably. This study
used the same convention while also including a combination of the two terms, senior adults.
I selected a phenomenological study over an ethnographic study because the narrative
focused on the essence of the experience of the phenomenon rather than on the culture of the
elderly participants. I selected participants age 50 and over to limit the scope or boundaries of
the study to a population that was more likely to have problems with technology adoption and
thus more likely to yield meaningful results from a phenomenological standpoint (Juznic, Blazic,
Mercun, Plestenjak, & Majcenovic, 2006; Smith, 2012).
I required all participants to own an eReader, a third delimitation placed on the study.
This allowed me to focus part of this research on the aspects of why senior adults selected and
adopted certain forms of technology. It also allowed me to investigate how the specific use of an
eReader evolved over the course of time associated with ownership.
Definitions
Definitions for pertinent terms in this study are found below:
1. Adult Learning Theory – Education theory, also known as andragogy, that is based on six
assumptions and posits that adults learn differently than children (Knowles, 1980).
2. Chaffin-Harlow Model of Cognitive Learning – Learning model that outlines how life
experiences with art, culture, and technology initiate cognitive learning in older adults
(Chaffin and Harlow, 2005).

20
3. Connectivism – Education theory that explores how networking of the world is changing
how individuals learn and acquire knowledge (Siemens, 2004).
4. Corroborating evidence – Data pulled from multiple sources to assist with triangulation
(Creswell, 2013).
5. E Ink – One of the patented forms of technology for an eReader that generates the words
on the screen. The technology replaces the standard liquid crystal display, reduces the
negative impact of ambient light, and provides a similar reading experience to that of a
print book. Another advantage of this monochromatic technology is that it allows
eReaders to run at reduced power (Siegenthaler, Wurtz, & Groner, 2010). Though color
E Ink technology exists, it is not marketable for a variety of reasons.
6. eBook – Short for electronic book, the eBook represents a relatively young medium,
following behind the audio book, that uses digital publication capable of being read on an
electronic device (Suarez & Woudhuysen, 2010).
7. eReader (also known as electronic reader, e-reader, electronic reading device or other
forms of these words and word-letter combinations, as well as proprietary names) – The
digital platform upon which an eBook is delivered in a fast, technologically flexible and
inexpensive manner, brought to initial popularity by Amazon’s introduction of the
Kindle, but spurred on by competition from other vendors (Brady, 2012). The term
eReader is used generically throughout this study and is meant to include a device (e.g.,
Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, Barnes & Noble NOOK GlowLight, etc.) manufactured for
the specific purpose of reading an eBook. The term eReader also describes a device like
a computer, laptop, iPad, tablet or cellular phone used in conjunction with an app
downloaded for the purpose of reading an eBook.

21
8. Performance-centered or problem-centered – Refers to the way adults use their real-life
situation to orient their learning, as contrasted with the subject-centered orientation
associated with pedagogy (Knowles, 1980).
9. Seniors or older adults – Interchangeable terms used to describe adults age 50 and over
(Heaggans, 2012). For this study, a form representing a combination of the two terms,
senior adults, is also used.
10. Social Learning Theory – The theory that advances the concept that people learn by
observing others (Bandura, 1977).
11. Socioemotional Selectivity Theory – Theory on time and the role it plays on the social
motives of knowledge and emotion (Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999).
12. Technology Acceptance Model – Model that describes how PU and PEOU drive
technology use (Davis, 1989).
13. Theoretical saturation – The point at which no new codes or themes emerge from
subsequent data (Creswell, 2013).
14. Triangulation – Use of different measures or techniques to examine the same variable
(Neuman, 1994).
Summary
Bandura’s (1977) Social Learning Theory describes how individuals are influenced by
other individuals. I set up this study to explore how Bandura’s theory applied to technology. As
a former reference librarian in a public library setting, I received many requests from patrons for
eReader assistance. A majority of the questions came from patrons that appeared to be over age
50. In designing this study investigating the experiences of eReader owners age 50 and over, my
own age and device ownership placed me in a similar situation to those individuals that

22
participated in the study. The lack of research on older adults and eReaders illuminated a gap in
the literature worthy of further investigation. The purpose of this phenomenological study was
to describe the perspectives of Georgia senior adults in their adoption of eReaders. The adoption
of an eReader was generally defined as the acquisition of an eReader, followed by the selecting,
downloading, navigating, and reading of eBooks using an eReader.
Smith (2014) found that older adults were more likely to own eReaders than
smartphones. Armed with this information about the habits of older adults, I collected data and
used Creswell’s (2013) analysis techniques to sift through information collected from
questionnaires, interviews, and a focus group. I used the results to explore the phenomenon of
eReader use and to inform stakeholders about the adoption behaviors of older adults.

23
CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
An eReader may provide its owner with added convenience. However, an eReader is
convenient only if the user understands how to use it: “As aspects of daily life continue to
become increasingly reliant on IT, it is important that older adults be able and willing to use IT”
(White & Weatherall, 2000, p. 385). I based this study around the experiences of senior adults
and their use of technology. I built the literature review with a theoretical framework that
supported how adults used technology to learn. The review delved into the characteristics of
learning for older adults, a discussion of how technology and learning are both connected and
intertwined, and a synthesis of previous research about senior adults and their use of technology.
The synthesis noted how learning had evolved with the development of technology. The
literature review concludes with a summary of what is known about senior adults and eReaders
and illuminates a gap in the literature worthy of further research.
Theoretical Framework
I based the framework for this study on the works of three theorists. First, Knowles’
(1980) Adult Learning Theory describes how adult learning differs from how children learn.
Second, Bandura’s (1977) Social Learning Theory posits that individuals learn by watching other
people. Finally, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by Davis (1985) describes the
influences of adults and their use of technology.
Adult Learning Theory
This study sought to examine the experiences of older adults as they used eReader
technology. Thus, the theoretical framework includes studies involving adults. Knowles (1980)
developed and Knowles et al. (1998) updated the Andragogical or Adult Learning Theory based
on six assumptions that defined how adults learned differently from children. In the first

24
assumption, Knowles (1980) described the role of self-concept as the most critical difference
between adults and children. In this assumption, adults outgrew the passive model associated
with pedagogical learning and took responsibility for the direction of their own education and
studies. This requirement for self-direction was so prominent that adults dropped out of training
programs if they felt like they had no control over their own education. From the perspective of
eReader technology, the lack of control may have begun as soon as a son or daughter presented
an aging parent with the gift of an eReader. The son or daughter may have thought that he or she
was doing the right thing by assisting the parent. However, if the well-intentioned family
member presented the gift with no instructions or assistance, the older adult may have felt that
the eReader was being forced upon him or her. In short, the gift robbed the adult of the ability to
self-direct. The assumption of self-concept may be influenced by the role of time as outlined in
the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (Carstensen et al., 1999). In this theory, knowledge
played a greater role when time was perceived to be unlimited.
The second assumption addressed by Knowles (1980) involved the role of learners’
experiences. Learners acquire a collection of lifelong experiences that provide an “increasingly
rich resource for learning––for themselves and for others” (p. 44), especially since adults have
the tendency to identify themselves by what they do or what they have done. Because adults
have more experiences than children from which to draw, they have more to contribute to their
own education. However, the benefits of more experience may be offset by habits or biases that
keep an older adult from trying something new or trying something old in a new way (Knowles,
1980). For senior adults learning about eReaders, previous work with other forms of technology
or experience in a problem-solving job may prove invaluable. On the other hand, individuals

25
without this type of background may be at a disadvantage when learning a new skill involving
technology.
In the third assumption associated with the Adult Learning Theory, Knowles (1980)
described how adults display a readiness to learn (Knowles, 1980). Barnard, Bradley, Hodgson,
and Lloyd (2013) based their Technology Acceptance and Rejection Model on two
characteristics: intention to use technology and technology’s usability. Life situations may force
or encourage someone to learn. For instance, learning how to use eReaders may be dictated by
an event like the onset of dwindling vision. In this case, an eReader may provide the platform
for both reading and learning, allowing the reader to adjust both the font size and the screen
brightness to accommodate for a loss in vision.
The fourth assumption presented by Knowles (1980) describes how adults require an
orientation to learning focused on real-life situations. Adults learn based on what is applicable to
their lives and “enter an educational activity in a problem-centered or performance-centered
frame of mind” (p.53). Technology adds an additional dimension to this concept, and led
Siemens (2004) to develop the Theory of Connectivism “because the most common educational
theories of behaviorism, cognitivism and constructivism did not completely explain the
relationship between learning and the use of technology” (Conclusion section, para. 1).
Dunaway (2011) stated it this way: “Learning occurs when connections are made” (p. 676).
These real-life connections may encourage older adults to use eReaders because eReaders assist
adults with a function that they enjoy––pleasure reading.
The fifth assumption about how adults learn differently than children describes how
adults are more likely to be motivated by “internal pressures (the desire for increased job

26
satisfaction, self-esteem, quality of life, and the like)” (Knowles et al., 1998, p. 68). These
internal pressures may drive a person’s desire to learn and to be successful.
The final assumption describes how adults desire to know why they need to learn
something before they will expend effort to actually learn it (Knowles et al., 1998). Adults place
a certain value on learning and this value competes with other resources like time. For adults
adopting and learning to use an eReader, the “why” aspect may include the appreciation of
reading at some level, the accessibility to an eReader, and the value associated with learning to
read on an electronic device.
The six assumptions advanced by Knowles have continued to be refined as the theory of
andragogy has evolved. Holton, Swanson, and Naquin (2001) advanced their own expanded
model by:
(a) conceptually separating the goals and purposes of learning from the core andragogical
principles of the learning transaction so the interactions and adaptations can be more
clearly defined, and
(b) explicitly accounting for individual, situational, and subject matter differences in the
learning situation. (pp. 138, 140)
These refinements show that andragogy is not a stagnant concept, but rather a complex and
changing subject worthy of additional study.
Social Learning Theory
In the Social Learning Theory, Bandura (1977) described the “prominent roles played by
vicarious, symbolic, and self-regulatory processes in psychological functioning” (p. vii).
According to Bandura, the vicarious process includes the influence of thoughts, affects, and
behavior. Watching and learning from the actions of other people help individuals to avoid the

27
time-consuming trial and error alternative. In the symbolic process, individuals store and
process information for future analysis and use. Bandura believed that “humans would be
incapable of reflective thought” (p. 13) were it not for symbolizing powers. The self-regulatory
process describes how an individual chooses whether or not to copy the observed behavior. In
short, this process describes the ability individuals have to exercise control over their own
actions. In addition, Bandura used the term reciprocal determination to describe the interaction
between the cognitive (or personal) factors, environmental factors, and behavioral factors
associated with the psychological functions. In a synthesis of literature prepared by Wagner et
al. (2010), environmental and behavioral factors dominated the Social Cognitive Theory research
involving senior adults and their computer use.
Bandura (1977) found that individuals learned by watching and that “learning would be
exceedingly laborious, not to mention hazardous, if people had to rely solely on the effects of
their own actions to inform them what to do” (p. 22). Bandura’s theory described modeling or
learning by observing in a four-step process: attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation.
Modeling and observer characteristics are important factors in the first step of the process. An
individual’s attention may either be drawn in or cast aside based on how an individual reacts or
responds to what is observed. When attention is drawn to a particular issue or to a particular
demonstration, modeling is more likely to take place. The converse was also true; if a
presentation turned a person off or if there were other outside distractions that diverted the
attention away, the observer was less likely to imitate what was being demonstrated. Bandura
highlighted the modeling behavior of individuals, while Siemens described the behavioral
changes by pointing to the “tectonic shifts in society where learning is no longer an internal,
individualistic activity” (2004, Conclusion section, para. 1).

28
In the second modeling step, Bandura (1977) described how retention impacted the
ability to recreate an observed action. Information may be retained in one of two ways; the
image may be stored as a visual image, picture, or symbol depicting the action to be modeled.
Alternately, the information may be stored in the form of words. These words provided a
description of the action that was witnessed, similar to those actions represented by symbols.
The words or symbols essentially laid in storage in an individual’s memory, awaiting retrieval,
and reminding the individual of the initial action. The entire process involved symbolic doing,
cognitive organization, symbolic rehearsal, and motor rehearsal (Bandura, 1977).
In the third modeling step, Bandura (1977) described how individuals practiced what they
observed. In terms of learning, this step represented a reproduction of the act that was originally
observed. As the individual began to complete the action, the repetition of observed behavior led
to improved ability or skill. The considerations associated with this process included physical
capabilities, availability of component responses, self-observation of reproductions and accuracy
feedback.
Bandura (1977) characterized the fourth step as motivation. The processes occurring in
this stage included external reinforcement, vicarious reinforcement, and self-reinforcement. An
individual was influenced to imitate or not to imitate an observed action based on several
motives. The motives may be positive in nature meaning that an individual’s action may be
rewarded by some form of positive reinforcement. Also, the motives may be negative in nature
and associated with a punishment. Both reinforcement and punishment may be viewed through
the lens of what has happened in the past, what has been promised for the future, or what may be
visualized through a vicarious process.

29
Technology Acceptance Model
A model represented the third theoretical framework upon which this study was based.
Davis (1985) proposed the TAM as a way of describing how computer use depended on user
perceptions. According to the model, potential computer users adopt technology based on PU
and PEOU. Davis’ model proposed that the characteristics of PU and PEOU (cognitive
responses) reflected an attitude that welcomed technology (affective response) and this led to
system use (behavioral response). Continuing his work, this time in an office environment of
working adults and in a lab setting with graduate students, Davis (1989) found a positive
correlation between an individual’s PU of a computer and the individual’s self-reported
computer use; a similar correlation, though less strong, between an individual’s PEOU of
computers and their self-reported computer use; and that two variables, PU and PEOU, were
significantly correlated with both current usage and future-predicted usage, with PU having a
higher correlation. More research confirmed related findings regarding adults and computers; In
an office environment, managers used computer systems primarily if the PU was high, followed
by PEOU (Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989). For adults age 50 to 81, Pan and Jordan-Marsh
(2010) found that PU and PEOU directly affected Internet adoption and that PEOU made a
greater contribution toward intention to use the Internet for older seniors (above age 60) than for
younger seniors (age 50 to 60). Additional research supported the TAM (Hernández-Encuentra,
Pousada, & Gómez-Zúñiga, 2009; Mitzner, et al., 2010). Davis et al. (1989) found “people's
computer use can be predicted reasonably well from their intentions” (p. 997). As the research
around the theory developed, Wang, Rau, and Salvendy (2011) found four factors that affected
older adults’ acceptance of information technology: needs satisfaction (similar to PU), perceived
usability (similar to PEOU), public acceptance, and support availability. The first two factors

30
(i.e., the ones that matched up with Davis’s theory) were concerned with the effects on
technology, while the other two factors were related to external influences.
Chung, Park, Wang, Fulk, and McLaughlin (2010) used the TAM as a starting point to
advance the concept that PU was a factor in the behavioral intention to participate in online
communities. The TAM modeled the behavior of the over-50 crowd, but it did not address the
gender gap among seniors (Ramón-Jerónimo, Peral-Peral, & Arenas-Gaitán, 2013). Males had
higher PEOU and more PU concerning the Internet, but many unanswered remained on the use
of the TAM in describing how technology was accepted.
Researchers and theorists have continued to build upon the original version of the TAM.
For instance, Venkatesh and Davis (2000) found that “using TAM as the starting point, TAM2
incorporates additional theoretical constructs spanning social influence processes (subjective
norm, voluntariness, and image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output
quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use)” (p. 187).
Davis et al. (1989) found that intentions to use the computer were a good predictor of
computer use, that PU was a primary determinant, and that PEOU was a “significant secondary
determinant of people's intentions to use computers” (p. 997). However, Davis (1989) described
an important factor in another study: “Although difficulty of use can discourage adoption of an
otherwise useful system, no amount of ease of use can compensate for a system that does not
perform a useful function” (pp. 333-334). For the purposes of this research, the TAM provided a
framework to describe why senior adults may have chosen to adopt an eReader.
Review of the Literature
After grounding the study within the theoretical framework, I examined previous research
on the characteristics of older adult learners. From there, I reviewed articles about the learning

31
aspect of technology instruction. Studies on adults and their use of computers and the Internet
dominated this realm of the literature review. The computer-centric nature of most articles not
only highlighted this popular choice for technology research, but also illuminated a void or lack
of research about newer technological devices and their associated impact on adult learners.
Finally, I researched how models had been used by researchers to describe the learning process
associated with adults and computers.
Characteristics of Older Adult Learners
The literature provided details on the sharp contrast between child learning theories and
adult learning theories (Knowles, 1980). However, no specific theories were uncovered
concerning the difference between adult learners and senior adult learners. A lack of theories on
this subject has not kept researchers from studying characteristics and issues associated with
older learners. Most researchers discussed senior adult learning as a subcategory of adult
learning, with various and sometimes arbitrary age ranges chosen for studies. Gust (2006)
described seniors as individuals age 50 and over, but the ensuing discussion often treated adult
learning and senior adult learning synonymously. I selected the same age of 50 to designate
senior adults, but have identified ages in cited references when researchers reported the specific
ages of adults in their studies.
Technology has changed the way learning occurs and how learning is analyzed.
“Learning theories are concerned with the actual process of learning, not with the value of what
is being learned. In a networked world, the very manner of information that we acquire is worth
exploring” (Siemens, 2004, Limitations of Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Constructivism
section, para. 2). Children are growing up in a world where technology is an integral part of
their learning process. In many cases, the technology may not be separable from the learning

32
environment. However older adults lived in a time when the world of technology did not exist as
it does today. The use of technology provided an interesting aspect to study within the field of
andragogy. “That andragogy does not speak to all possible goals and purposes of learning is not
a weakness but a strength because andragogy can then transcend arenas of application” (Holton
et al., 2001, p. 126). When individuals with a limited background in technology attempt to learn
while using technology, they may be forced to divide their time between learning the subject and
learning the technology. The division of time may be educational, but it may also lead to
frustration. This section reviews the literature on the characteristics of adult learners,
particularly in relation to the aspects of learning involving technology.
Life follows a natural progression after birth. Growth during childhood and young adult
years prepares individuals for a transition to the independent stage of adulthood. This final stage
may last for decades, but a lack of mobility and a setback from other issues later in life may limit
a senior’s independence. In other words, the mind and body are not constants; instead they
continue to change over time. Chaffin and Harlow put it this way: “As we age, maintaining
control over hard-earned autonomy is constantly challenged by age related physical, cognitive,
and environmental changes” (2005, p. 301). The challenges may be found in all aspects of life,
particularly when technology is involved. Charness and Holley (2004) investigated the problems
that were manifested when technology was introduced and identified the following issues:
psychomotor function, vision, hearing, and cognitive ability. Barnard et al. (2013) identified
age-related issues involving technology including reduced vision and reduced dexterity, and
issues caused by the use of touchscreen technology calibrated to younger users.
In spite of challenges, technology continues to be adopted by senior adults. Wagner et al.
(2010) surveyed adults age 60 to 75 and found that the technological devices with the highest

33
reported use were digital cameras, telephones, desktop computers, mobile phones, and printers.
When senior adults learn to use newer technologies, they may offset some of the negative aspects
of growing old. “Computer skills and use of the Internet give them control over one of the
primary threats to their physical and psychological well-being: social isolation” (Chaffin &
Harlow, 2005, p. 302). Social isolation represented a negative consequence associated with
becoming independent. Smith (2012) studied adults age 74 to 98 and found the following:
(1) Loneliness has been associated with old age because of multiple losses that may
occur.
(2) Findings from this study revealed that many participants experienced loneliness as a
result of disrupted meaningful engagement with others due to different age-related
changes.
(3) Loneliness as an embodied experience can be expressed through the body in several
ways, including fatigue, tension, withdrawal, and emptiness. (p. 61)
Smith found that caregivers like nurses served in key positions for identifying cases of
loneliness. Li and Perkins (2007) found that as loneliness was treated by “taking an initiative to
gain technological knowledge, the elderly became more socially interactive and less isolated. As
their level of technological knowledge increases, their enjoyment and confidence with learning
and using these skills will also increase” (p. 365). On the other hand, Youn-Min (2008)
confirmed that older adults feared the use of the Internet would cause more social exclusion.
Salthouse (1996) recommended looking at factors earlier in life to pinpoint causes for
differences in cognition speed for older adults. Tielen (1998) lamented the lack of public
funding for senior adults in the post-retirement or third phase of life. This investment in the lives
of senior adults may help individuals to overcome some of the complications associated with

34
growing old. Chaffin and Harlow (2005) found that “aging causes physiological changes that
slow the learning process” (p. 302). The Chaffin-Harlow Model of Cognitive Learning outlined
how art, culture, and technology initiated cognitive learning in older adults. This model of
learning capitalizes on various aspects of a person’s life experiences, and allows him or her to
actively participate and grow. However, the decline in the learning process or the decrease in
cognitive ability may lend itself to a form of discrimination. Ageism or the discrimination of the
elderly is the focus on negative aspects like the physical and cognitive decline associated with
growing old instead of focusing on the learning potential and other positive attributes of the
elderly (Chaffin & Harlow, 2005). Yet, older adults possessed a unique perspective on the
subject of time. Russell (2011) described how seniors were closer to death (limiting the amount
of time left in life) and yet had more time in their post-retirement years.
Challenges and support. There are many challenges associated with growing old and
support networks may assist in dealing with these issues. Gatto and Tak (2008) recommended
that caregivers become familiar with the characteristics of older adult computer users and for the
caregivers to encourage the seniors to become proficient with technology. Ng (2008)
emphasized the importance of social support, especially support from family members, when
older adults were learning about technology. Erickson and Johnson (2011) summarized the
importance of support in this manner: “An aging population is best served by social, personal,
and health support focused on maintaining and maximizing personal independence” (p. 198).
One way to provide support is through the use of email, because older adults that use email are
more likely to live independent lives (Stark-Wroblewski, Edelbaum, & Ryan, 2007). But what
makes a senior adult accept and use technology? Wang et al. (2011) found senior adults selfreported needs satisfaction and support availability as the most important factors for technology

35
acceptance; however, in terms of support availability, “older adults have more difficulties and
less confidence when they use information technology” (p. 1094). White and Weatherall (2000)
recommended, “If, in an increasingly technological world, we wish older adults to use up-to-date
technology (e.g., in their banking, shopping, health care, or communication), then we need to
identify ways of positively introducing the technology, both theoretically and practically” (p.
384).
Lee, Chen, and Hewitt (2011) studied computer users grouped as pre-seniors (age 50-64),
young-olds (age 65-74), and older-olds (age 75 and older) and found that more challenges were
reported in the older group. Carpenter and Buday (2007) found computer users were more likely
to be younger, better educated, in better health, less physically impaired, more likely exposed to
technology at an earlier age, better connected with social networks, and more likely to have had
access to computer support. In a similar finding, Cresci, Yarandi, and Morrell (2010)
characterized adults age 60 and over that used the Internet (identified as Pro-Nets in the study) as
younger, better educated, more active, better paid and healthier than individuals who did not use
the Internet (identified as No-Nets in the study). In looking at older adults, education was the
most important factor in determining computer use (DeOllos & Morris, 2003-2004). Li and
Perkins (2007) found that adults age 65 and over considered technology as beneficial, even if
individuals were not presently using it. For senior adults age 59 to 77 with moderate or higher
computer proficiency, five themes emerged:
(1) Computer technology was connected with other interests and hobbies. In particular,
genealogy appeared frequently as an important interest, and use of the computer
facilitated this pursuit.

36
(2) Mental and social stimulation were seen as important for positive aging. Although
such stimulation was discussed with reference to other aspects of older adults’ lives,
computer-mediated communication seemed to play an important role in this stimulation.
(3) Cost had an impact on the use and ownership of computer technology for older adults.
(4) The computer was viewed as a tool. All of the participants appeared to use the
computer to assist them in a variety of ways (e.g., databases for music collections,
spreadsheets for finances, e-mail). This theme is related to the first regarding computer
technology and other interests.
(5) Communication with family and friends using the computer, especially grandchildren,
was very important. (White & Weatherall, 2000, pp. 366-377)
However, the challenges and support associated with higher proficiency computer users in the
White and Weatherall study may differ from issues identified in studies of less proficient
computer users.
Importance of communication. As mentioned in the preceding paragraph,
communication is another aspect of adult learning that has been influenced by technology. Oral
communication has traditionally been thought of as face-to-face communication. But even that
definition has changed as technology has advanced. Face-to-face conversations have given way
to phone calls. Now cellular phones permit conversations to occur outside the confines of the
home or office. Tools like Skype allow for communications to proceed, but with an additional
feature––visual images of the communicators. Written communication has followed a similar
path, albeit with the use of email and instant messaging replacing letter mail. Charness and
Holley (2004) found that computers and the Internet allow additional communication outlets for
older adults. “Findings suggest that the ways the Internet is used differ greatly according to each

37
user’s economic, social, and cultural resources, including their roles and relationships with other
people and systems in society” (Youn-Min, 2008, p. 108). Stark-Wroblewski et al. (2007)
studied email users age 65 and older and found that they self-reported fewer health limitations
than email non-users. Communication continues to be one of the most important aspects of
technology. In fact, Carpenter and Buday (2007) found the most common use for the computer
was to communicate with family. Youn-Min (2008) found that “older citizens often will not use
the Internet in ‘beneficial’ ways, that is, ways that improve seniors’ social opportunities they
desire. Nor will they necessarily perceive benefits from Internet use they perceive important” (p.
111). Additionally, the study indicated that email communications were dependent upon preexisting relationships with friends and families. Older adults used computers and the Internet
less frequently, yet were prime candidates for computer use as mobility limited their ability to
get out and get away. Other reasons limited the ability to communicate. Carpenter and Buday
(2007) found current computer non-users cited cost as the reason why they were not using
computers. Wang et al. (2011) found that “information technology’s own attributes determine
whether or not older adults have intention to use it” (p. 1094). Meanwhile, computer users cited
their own reasons for being hampered in their ability to use technology: difficulty with computer
complexity, functional impairments, ergonomic barriers and lack of computer assistance
(Carpenter & Buday, 2007).
Attitudes and influences. In a convenience sample of those age 60 and over, “responses
to the open-ended questions indicated that the positive aspects of Internet use included
connectedness, satisfaction, utility, and positive learning experience. Negative aspects of
Internet use were frustration, limitations, mistrust, and time issues” (Gatto & Tak, 2008, p. 805).
Mitzner et al. (2010) found that older adults (age 65 to 85) had positive attitudes about

38
technology and its use in their home life, work life, and health-related areas. They found
technology was liked because it supported activities, provided convenience, and contained useful
features. A positive or negative attitude may depend on the actual type of technology used.
Barnard et al. (2013) found:
Most of the participants thought it would not be very difficult to learn how to use the
tablet; they had the feeling that it was easier than a computer. One of the reasons may be
that they saw it demonstrated in a calm and friendly atmosphere without any pressure on
them. The size of the tablet may also be an advantage, big enough to see things well, in
comparison with a phone, and small enough not to look like a complex system. Being
able to hold it, pick it up and touch it in different ways may make the system less
daunting. (p. 1720)
Sometimes the positive attributes of technology were offset by negative ones. Negative
attributes were associated with inconvenience, features, security and reliability (Mitzner, et at.,
2010).
Lee et al. (2011) identified four constraints among senior adult computer users:
intrapersonal, interpersonal, structural, and functional. “Intrapersonal and functional appeared to
be internal factors referring to an individual’s perception and ability in handling new
technologies; while structural and interpersonal dimensions were external factors that refer to
living conditions beyond their physical and mental status” (Lee et al., 2011, p. 1235). Li and
Perkins (2007) found that “the attitudes of the older adult population toward new technology and
their willingness to learn are greatly influenced by factors such as familiarity, enjoyment,
feelings of convenience, level of technological knowledge, and a basic understanding of
computer terminology” (p. 364). In a survey of adults over 60, Erickson and Johnson (2011)

39
found a significant correlation between Internet use and self-efficacy. Meanwhile, Lunn and
Harper (2011) developed an Internet assistance tool for participants age 55 to 80 and provided a
cautionary finding that seniors perceived that they were better at using the Internet than they
actually were.
Dark side of technology. Vulnerability is an issue commonly associated with the elderly
and the Internet has added another dimension for which the elderly must be cautious: “Whilst
older people have considerable life skills to resolve their own difficulties the contexts in which
they are seeking answers to problems or making difficult decisions, often occur at points of
vulnerability” (Godfrey & Johnson, 2008, p. 636). Older adults know less about computers and
are more vulnerable to Internet scams, frauds, and hazards. However, older adults with more
education display characteristics closer to their younger adult counterparts (Grimes, Hough,
Mazur, & Signorella, 2010).
Avoidance is another negative element associated with technology. Avoidance is a
natural human reaction in certain types of situations and two particular types were mentioned in
the literature. Hawthorn (2007) found that “in their own computer use older computer users
typically avoid errors by restricting what they attempt” (p. 341). In a different form of
avoidance, Broady et al. (2010) compared younger adults with older adults and found older
adults avoided technology because they lacked knowledge about the latest technology and how
to use it. These cases of avoidance were in line with what Barnard et al. (2013) reported
regarding participants that had retired early just to avoid having to learn a new technology.
Indirectly associated with the characteristic of avoidance was lag time. “Despite the potential
good that computers, the Internet, and e-mail might bring older adults, a lag seems to exist in
technology adoption by older adults” (Carpenter & Buday, 2007, p. 3013). The lag time

40
associated with technology adoption may keep older adults from ever catching up to their
younger counterparts.
In a survey for participants age 70 and over, Purdie and Boulton-Lewis (2003) found
technology was the least important need and the respondents felt uncomfortable with their
knowledge on this subject. This discomfort may have led to cases of avoidance discussed in the
previous paragraph. Though the seniors perceived their knowledge level to be low, they still
desired to learn about computers (Purdie & Boulton-Lewis, 2003).
Changes in information-seeking behavior. Ryan, Anas, Beamer, and Bajorek (2003)
found that reading did not decrease with later life vision loss. However, more fiction and less
news material were read. Godfrey and Johnson (2008) found older adults sought information in
three key contexts: life course transitions (like retirement), life events (like bereavement) and
daily hassles. Russell (2011) found that older adults in their mid-70s to early-90s post-retirement
phase of life had time to do things like continue with lifelong learning in their subject of choice,
and preferred learning at their own pace. “Computer usage in late adulthood has considerable
potential as a resource of health-related information, alternative means of shopping for
homebound people, opportunities of lifelong learning, maintaining or developing social
interactions, and enjoying hobbies” (Kim, 2008, p. 731). The potential for learning later in life
and for having the time available to learn may provide important considerations regarding the
characteristics of older adult learners.
Technology and Learning
Dunaway (2011) stated, “Knowledge emerges from an individual’s learning network as
she recognizes connections between concepts, opinions, and perspectives” (p. 676). Learning
may occur in a variety of settings ranging from self-paced study to a formal classroom. This

41
study sought to draw upon lessons learned in the teaching of older adults and upon lessons
learned in the design of technology courses to investigate the use of eReaders by older adults.
Schwender and Köhler (2006) recommended a three-phase strategy for introducing new media
technology to seniors: 1) find and identify the problems, 2) address the problems that are
identified, and 3) test the results. Barnard et al. (2013) discussed three learning styles
participants used to learn about technology: through step by step instructions while someone
watched over a shoulder, by trial and error, and by reading the instructions. Mayhorn, Stronge,
McLaughlin, and Rogers (2004) recommended a systems approach that began with a needs
assessment to better design computer classes specifically targeted for older adults.
Course considerations and design. Health was a popular research topic for older adults.
When it came to learning about health issues online, Xie (2011) found that collaborative learning
improved e-health literacy. In their research on healthcare websites, McBride and Napier-Tibere
(2004) discussed the importance of knowing the target audience. Lunn and Harper (2011) stated,
“Designers must also ensure that they provide users with functionality that they need, in a
manner that entices them, rather than creating something that users believe they want” (p. 2104).
Conditions associated with growing older affect the target audience. For instance,
Salthouse (1996) emphasized the slowing of cognitive functions associated with age. However,
Kooij, de Lange, Jansen, and Dikkers (2008) discussed how age may be defined in ways other
than chronologically. In their research on the acceptance of information technology by older
adults, Wang et al. (2011) found that “enjoyment, connecting to others, and accessing
information are the most important needs for the older adults” (p. 1094). Classes filled with
older adults succeed when the focus is on the issues, learning methods, and teaching strategies
deemed best for seniors: “If designers are aware of the age-related changes that occur

42
normatively in the population, they can configure systems that will enhance the probability of
successful use by older adults” (Charness and Holley, 2004, p. 429). Githens (2007)
recommended that e-learning courses take older adults into account when designing the
platforms. Meanwhile, Rosenthal (2008) recommended further studies on technology use by
older women since they live longer (statistically) than men.
Hawthorn (2007) made several recommendations for designing an interactive computer
tutorial including involving older adults in the process and making use of small groups to discuss
possible solutions. Dunaway (2011) highlighted the importance of connectivism. As the name
implies, connectivism derives from the connections made by learners between various
information resources, especially technology-related resources. In dealing with older adults,
simplicity may be a key factor. Mead, Batsakes, Fisk, and Mykityshyn (1999) found that older
adults produced similar results to those of younger adults when asked to do web searches
requiring two or fewer moves. However, older adults experienced problems when tasks required
three or more moves. Meanwhile, searches performed by older adults in library online catalogs
produced similar results to those of younger adults, most likely because online catalogs are
organized hierarchically as opposed to the network file structure of the web (Mead et al., 1999).
Laguna and Babcock (1997) found older adults (age 55 to 82) made more mistakes and had
higher anxiety than younger adults (age 18 to 27) on computer tests. The anxiety may have
resulted from directions that emphasized both accuracy and speed in making decisions.
Social aspects of learning. Aberton (2006) realized the significance of a different
approach for older adults: “The importance of the social nature of learning and motivation in this
study, demonstrates the need for a more holistic approach to older computer beginners’

43
instruction” (p.44). White and Weatherall (2000) described the importance of the social aspect
of learning for older adults:
Associating IT with modern life, grandchildren, and the future and feeling positive about
this association was necessary for them to recognize the potential of the technology and
become involved with it. Once involved, positive attitudes toward the technology
developed and was maintained by the use of and involvement with IT. (p. 383)
Holistic approaches and attitude are two of the social factors that may be considered for
designing courses. Carpenter and Buday (2007) recommended that course developers take the
following into account: addressing the issue of complexity and terminology, providing more
frequent and accessible support, addressing the user’s insecurities with technology and the user’s
wariness of how computers work, establishing better marketing to describe what computers and
training can do, and using a self-assessment aimed at steering users toward their own computer
needs. On the subject of older adults, Wang et al. (2011) made three suggestions about the use
of IT: 1) make needs satisfaction the highest priority in the early design phase; 2) design IT with
senior adults in mind; and 3) provide appropriate support for the technology. These suggestions
may alleviate problems that senior adults associate with technology.
Problems with Technology. Youn-Min (2008) found that seniors used computers for
browsing websites for “entertainment, downloading pictures, and repeating the class
curriculums” (p. 110). However, Slegers, van Boxtel, and Jolles (2007) studied adults age 64 to
75 with no computer experience and found that they were unable to transfer their computer skills
to other technological devices after the completion of a training course. Connell, Bayliss, and
Farmer (2012) found “exposure to the iPad and Kindle increased participants' desire to purchase
a tablet for recreational reading, while only exposure to the iPad increased participants' desire to

44
purchase a tablet for academic reading” (p. 137). Learning in a technological environment is not
without issues. Barnard et al. (2013) found older adults learning to use new technologies have
both generic problems (associated with manipulating the touchscreen, moving the cursor, or
understanding the difference between backspace and back) and specific problems (associated
with powering up a device, entering a password, sending an email, using a keyboard, searching
the Internet, setting the alarm, activating the standby mode or powering off a device).
Technology access and programing. Bertera, Bertera, Morgan, Wuertz, and Attey
(2007) described a health information program that was successful because the training was
relevant to the audience of older adults, the trainer was familiar with the community and
explained the subject in a way that the older students could understand, and peer navigators were
used to provide assistance to the students as needed. Hawthorn (2007) used an informal manner
while serving as a tutor in an effort to down-play his researcher role. Delahaye and Ehrich
(2008) found that older adult learners preferred a traditional structured format and liked selfpaced group learning. These preferences are consistent with the findings of Callahan, Kiker, and
Cross (2003): “For decades, three instructional methods have dominated the training literature:
lecture, modeling and active participation in the training process” (p. 665). Callahan et al. found
“training that integrates multiple methods could be useful when training older learners” (p. 675).
In other words, using various methods to teach senior adults capitalizes on the existence of
different learning styles.
Aberton (2006) found that relationships between and among learners provided positive
synergy to the learning environment. In particular, students in a computer class found it
important to begin classes with introductions. Classes that did not use introductions left the
students with uncertainty as to how each student compared to others in the program and made the

45
students afraid to ask questions. Friendships that formed during break times increased the
amount of sharing that occurred in the classroom. This led to identification of individuals as part
of the group (based on age, ability, belief system, and confidence level; Aberton, 2006). This
same concept of belonging to a group applied to other learning conditions. Older adults learning
to use eReaders wanted to know that they had something in common with other people learning
to use new technology. Hernández-Encuentra et al. (2009) found computer users age 65 to 70
not only needed to know how to use a variety of technology tools, but also needed to be provided
with a way to instill confidence and a basic level of support. The senior adults needed assurance
that the technology would allow them to continue functioning on their own. The concept of
learning was somewhat narrowed because older adults viewed the individual types of technology
as single function devices (Hernández-Encuentra et al., 2009).
Access to technology is a complicated issue. Purdie & Boulton-Lewis, (2003) found
physical disabilities associated with age are the greatest barriers. Sometimes, the design of
technology creates the barrier that discriminates against older adults. Smaller keyboards, smaller
keypads, and touch screens may hamper senior adults, creating a barrier to learning. For devices
that are small to start with, the problems are even worse. Ling (2008) found a need for
technology to address issues experienced by the elderly, such as the inability to read the small
screens on a cellular phone. Court-Jackson (2011) studied technology as it related to music and
found that adults over 55 had problems associated with dexterity and hearing loss. Finally,
Broady et al. (2010) found older students in a classroom environment needed to be given ample
time to complete assignments and they needed to be treated in a positive manner so that they
built confidence in their own abilities.

46
Technology classes give students the opportunity to learn new skills or to take up
alternate activities based on a changing lifestyle (Aberton, 2006). This does not mean that the
technology is always adopted, with text messaging serving as a case in point. Ling (2008)
investigated why seniors did not send text messages and found that the young users stereotyped
the older users in this way and thus reinforced the belief. Another finding was that individuals
exercised self-exclusion based on the later development of texting devices. Ling recommended
training as a way of overcoming this barrier. Morris (1994) recommended a similar treatment
(i.e., more training and more research on training seniors) because the adults over 60 had a
favorable view of technology when offered an introductory computer course. Schwender and
Köhler (2006) put together a group that worked on revamping the text messaging section of a
cell phone operator’s manual to improve comprehensibility, clarity, organization, manual format,
print size, and use of overly-technical vocabulary. Given a task of sending a text message having
little or no previous experience, seniors that used the revised manual completed the task in
approximately half the time of those that used the original manual. In a separate study, Shepherd
and Aagard (2011) found certain limitations with online journaling including sporadic activity
due to feelings of isolation, physical barriers, and access issues. O’Hara (2004) suggested the
way to address physical and access issues was to investigate how similar issues were addressed
by members of the disabled community as they sought to overcome their own barriers. Seals,
Clanton, Agarwal, Doswell, and Thomas (2008) found that educating seniors involved
convincing senior adults of what computers may be able to do for them.
Relationships and support. Relationships may influence how adults learn. However,
learning about technology from an expert reinforces the notion that computers are for experts
(Barnard et al., 2013). Meanwhile, social interaction helps an individual determine if he or she

47
fits into the group and whether the group supports the learning goals. For learners in their early
50s to middle 80s, Aberton (2006) found “support is an affordance for learning and [an] enabler
for developing self-confidence” (p.42). As students solve problems, not just learn content, they
feel empowered by their computer training and the Internet (Bertera, et al., 2007). For instance,
there were occasions in Aberton’s (2006) computer class in which a learner’s confidence was
boosted when the learner was able to identify with another student. This finding was consistent
with the power of observation discussed in Bandura’s (1977) Social Learning Theory. In an
example with a throwback to the days of elementary school learning, Aberton (2006) found that
adults evidenced a boost of confidence when their personal work was displayed on the classroom
walls. However, White and Weatherall (2000) cautioned against patronizing or threatening older
adults as they attempted to learn about technology. Meanwhile, Lai (2011) identified an issue in
the local library and recommended a solution:
Library patrons were not effectively searching information due to lack of sufficient
Internet searching skills and this problem greatly reduced their IL [Information Literacy]
abilities. Public libraries, as IL providers, should pay more attention to this issue by
providing IL training in the search techniques of using various search engines and
databases. (p. 84)
Lunn and Harper (2011) found that their “research has helped to further solidify ongoing work in
the area––which suggests that experience and knowledge are better differentiators of barriers to
Web interaction than is age” (p. 2106). Experience and knowledge tie back to Knowles (1980)
Adult Learning Theory.
The role of support in learning is well documented. Based on work by Schilderman
(2002), Gomez, Fawcett, and Turner (2012) classified the three main functions of infomediaries

48
as the ability to share information, help users, and build relationships. Thus, libraries were
labeled as infomediaries. Duncan (2011) stated:
The time is ripe for all libraries to analyse [sic] and implement ebook and eAudiobook
solutions tailored to their communities. Indeed, if library managers delay in this area, the
explosion of ereaders, and related electronic resources will overtake the community’s
patience for libraries to deliver such services. The possible decrease in demand for library
services may threaten their continued relevance and ultimately the level of funding
received. (p. 192)
According to Evjen and Audunson (2009), the library was still viewed, especially by non-users,
in its more traditional sense of “promoting literature, offering services to everyone, promoting
democracy, and representing a non-commercial space” (p. 168). Non-users valued the free
meeting space and the library’s social aspect. One potential service that libraries or the
community may offer relates to learning about technology. For example, Lunn and Harper
(2011) discussed the value of human intervention especially when novices were trying to
develop computer skills. This intervention may be supported from certain organizations within
the community defined by the following:


Their capacity to provide information in an accessible format;



Their willingness to share information rather than hold on to it;



Their ability to get hold of information and adapt it to a local context;



Their experience, education, knowledge and reliability;



Their accessibility, proximity and helpfulness;



Their social sensitivity and capacity to involve residents;

49


Their leadership qualities, influence and moral authority. (Schilderman, 2002, p.
28)

In a practical view of support, Hallberg and Sipos-Zackrisson (2010) found that libraries could
benefit from employees with retail experience because they were observed “actively talking to
the customers, asking questions about customer library experience and expectations, [and]
especially focusing on the unknown users” (p. 94). In other words, businesses use concepts from
other businesses, so why can’t libraries?
Support is essential for older adults when they are using technology: “As a first step in
becoming e-literate, older learners need support of other people who can identify with or
understand as they confront initial inhibitions and technological unknowns” (Aberton, 2006,
p.45). Support from experts is not the only type of support. There was also support to be
garnered from family members. For instance, married couples drew support from each other in a
class and once they got home, they were able to provide additional assistance to each other
(Aberton, 2006). Older adults with family support have better communication, higher Internet
self-efficacy and a higher perception of e-learning (Chu, 2009). In studies providing additional
credence to the value of support, Cody, Dunn, Hoppin, and Wendt (1999) found adults with an
average age of 80 had more positive attitudes when they learned to surf the web in computer
classes and these adults had higher perceived social support levels. Lunn and Harper (2011)
found “there may be a social aspect to learning to use computers, with some participants
spending more time chatting after the study than it took them to complete the study; this valuable
social engagement should not be ignored” (p. 2106). Smith (2012) stated, “Meaningful social
contracts are an integral part of successful aging; without these older adults may experience
social isolation and loneliness” (p. 46). In short, social engagement wards off isolation.

50
Youn-Min (2008) found that communications via email were less likely to occur unless a
relationship existed prior to the commencement of computer classes for older adults.
Meanwhile, Pan and Jordan-Marsh (2010) discovered that facilitating conditions were a
significant indicator of Internet use intention, but not Internet adoption. Well-designed
information solutions provided older adults with multiple access points or what Godfrey and
Johnson (2008) referred to as digital circles of support. These solutions fostered success when
older adults were trained as mediators to provide information assistance and retrieval. However,
Bertera et al. (2007) found that the digital divide kept senior adults from gathering health
information (a popular subject researched by senior adults) from sources like the Internet.
These discussions of acceptance, support, and models focused primarily on adults and
their use of computers. Numerous struggles, problems, and issues were identified in terms of
how adults learned. The element of technology added one more dimension to the concerns
associated with the education of older adults. Analyzing the use of eReaders may provide
similar or contrasting issues specific to this form of technology.
eReader Adoption and Use
Adoption and use of an eReader may depend on several factors. For instance: “How
difficult it is to learn a new technology is not only dependent on the perceptions and experiences
of the users. The characteristics of the technology itself also determine how difficult it is”
(Barnard et al., 2013, p. 1723). The Barnard et al. research, like so much other research
published on new technology did not specifically mention eReaders. A few exceptions to the
trend are discussed below. Tees (2010) found that eReaders were “not yet suitable for university
students to use as a textbook replacement” (p. 184) and that the eReaders were better suited for
reading fiction, their original design function. When looking at the perceptions experienced by

51
graduate students, Aharony (2013) described the students as users of “textbooks that contain text
with embedded links, multi-media books that might contain sound and images, reference books
such as dictionaries and encyclopedias, directories, and digitized versions of ‘out of print’
books” (p. 69). This academic definition was typical because most studies on eReaders involved
students in an educational setting. Connell et al. (2012) compared undergraduate students that
used print materials (in a reading packet), tablets and eReaders. The format did not affect
reading comprehension, but students using print materials read significantly faster. For usability,
students rated the tablet as the easiest to use, followed by the eReader and then the printed
material.
Dunaway (2011) described how older theories of learning were being replaced by ones
that included an aspect of technology. Ratten (2011) found “a link between a person’s
entrepreneurial orientation and their intention to adopt an e-book device” (p. 320), but found no
such relationship with other factors like a person’s learning or ethical orientation. The Ratten
study, like so many others, did not discuss older adults, but rather described university students,
in this case with age ranging from 18 to 29. Duncan’s (2010) library study is one of the few
articles discussing eReaders outside of the academic environment. Libraries were considered
unique because they served everyone and the service they provided was information (Gomez et
al., 2012).
The limited amount of research on eReaders caused Richardson and Mahmood (2011) to
include a disclaimer noting that their reference citations came from popular literature instead of
from traditional research journals. Ashcroft (2011) found that “users want to be able to access
the same ebooks but at their convenience on a variety of devices” (p. 401), a finding consistent
with the technological acuity of the younger generation, but a potential concern for an older

52
generation in search of a simpler and less complex solution. Additionally, Ashcroft
recommended that libraries heed a lesson from industry and do a better job of marketing their
library eBook collections. These recommendations would be in line with the purposes of this
study.
Summary
The theoretical framework upon which this research was based included the Adult
Learning Theory proposed by Knowles (1980), Bandura’s (1977) Social Learning Theory, and
the Technology Acceptance Model proposed by Davis (1985). The Adult Learning Theory
described how adults have different motivations and learn differently than children. Bandura’s
theory described how individuals learned by watching other individuals and Davis’s theory
postulated how adults were influenced by technology and their own perceptions of technology.
Research documented cases like William: “William, another participant with impaired
vision, could no longer read the newspaper print. He reported feeling isolated because his
impaired vision reduced his ability to remain connected to his world via the daily news” (Smith,
2012, p. 48). Added to this mix was an interesting perspective that senior adults have on the
subject of time: “The paradox of time felt by the participants—that they have all the time in the
world and yet very little time left—lies at the heart of the uniqueness of time in later life”
(Russell, 2011, pp. 561-562).
There are many studies on the teaching of older adults and on the characteristics
associated with learning experienced by these adults. In addition, there are many studies
discussing the use of technology. The topic of computers dominated the technology research,
but studies on other forms of technology were found in the literature. For the limited number of
studies on eReaders, younger participants in an academic setting provided the common theme:

53
Mobile eReaders were currently being used in the K-12 environment (Larson, 2010; Pacino &
Noftle, 2011) and on college campuses (Shen, 2011; Kemp, Lutz, & Nurnberger, 2012;
Martinez-Estrada & Conaway, 2012). Studies about older adults and their experiences with
eReaders were almost non-existent in the literature and this study sought to explore the gap.
Results from the study may inform librarians, caregivers, and family members about the reading
habits and electronic use of senior adults.

54
CHAPTER THREE: METHODS
The purpose of this study was to ascertain how senior adults described their eReader
experiences including the contributing factors in their decisions to use eBooks. This study was
designed to build upon the base of literature associated with senior adults and technology and
was constructed to focus on the specific aspects surrounding the use of eReaders. The following
sections describe the design, setting, procedures, and other pertinent aspects of the methodology
chosen for this study.
Design
I selected a transcendental phenomenological design for this qualitative study because
this form represented an inward reflection on shared experiences. Moustakas (1994) defined
transcendental phenomenology as “a scientific study of the appearance of things, of phenomena
just as we see them and as they appear to us in consciousness” (p. 49). Giorgi (2009) described
this transcendental consciousness as “pure, flowing, essential consciousness” (p. 88).
“Phenomenology aims at gaining a deeper understanding of the nature or meaning of our
everyday experiences” (Van Manen, 1990, p. 9). Participants in a phenomenological study are
distinguished by a common phenomenon that they experience (Creswell, 2013), and the
phenomenon or everyday experience examined in this study was the acquisition of an eReader,
followed by the selecting, downloading, navigating, and reading of eBooks using an eReader.
Older adults from Georgia that used eReaders volunteered as participants. I designed this study
with the intent of adding to the body of current knowlege with an in-depth reflection and analysis
of the lived experience of eReader adoption among seniors.
Research Questions
The purpose of this study was to answer the following research questions:

55


What are contributing factors in senior adults’ decisions to use eBooks?



How do senior adults describe their eReader experiences?



What are the challenges and benefits of senior adults regarding the use of
eReaders?
Setting

This study took place both within and near the Hometown Library (a pseudonym), with
volunteers recruited from the library, the Hometown Senior Center (a pseudonym), and through
snowball sampling. The Hometown Library is located in one of the 25 largest cities in Georgia
(U.S. Department of Commerce, 2013). The community’s number of college graduates and the
community’s median household income were significantly higher than the state average (U.S.
Department of Commerce, 2014). Additionally, the male/female ratio was reported as
48.3%/51.7% and the ethnic makeup of the community was reported as 82.3% White, 7.4%
Black, 5.3% Asian, and 2.4% with two or more races (totaling nearly 100%) and 7.1% reporting
Hispanic descent across various races. Comparing the 2010 Census with the 2000 Census at the
national and state level, “the 65 years and over population grew at a faster rate than the total
population” (Werner, 2011, p. 3). The percentage of Hometown’s residents age 65 and over was
higher than that found at the state level (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2014). Hometown
Library ranks in the top 25 libraries in the state for annual print book circulations (Georgia
Public Library Service, 2014). The library’s eBook collection was small but growing after being
introduced approximately five years ago. The concentration of older residents and the popularity
of the library indicated that Hometown Library would be a suitable location to conduct this
study. In addition, the higher income levels and corresponding higher disposable income levels

56
potentially increased the probability of eReader ownership and the likelihood of being able to
recruit volunteers meeting the study requirements.
Participants
This study sought to describe the experiences of eReader users age 50 and over. As
envisioned, advertisements were expected to inform individuals about a request to participate in
this study. I picked the Hometown Library and the Hometown Senior Center to serve as initial
recruiting territories for a convenience sample. Unfortunately, according to Gall et al. (2007),
sampling based strictly on ease or convenience (i.e., convenience sampling) was the least
desirable of sampling techniques. Walliman (2006) preferred to use the term accidental
sampling instead of convenience sampling because the method focused on what was immediately
available. Likening the negative aspect of convenience sampling to an accident may be enough
of a reason to avoid the technique if any other sampling options are available. However, in this
case, convenience sampling was used, but only to the extent necessary to identify initial
participants for the study. Subsequent participants were expected to hear about this study from
other individuals aware of the research. Cavanaugh and Robbins (2012) described this word-ofmouth technique for growing the number of participants as incremental or snowball sampling. I
chose snowball sampling because it “identifies cases of interest from people who know people
who know what cases are information-rich” (Creswell, 2013, p. 158). Noy (2008) observed that
snowball sampling relied on the dynamics of social networks and argued that snowball sampling
deserved to be used as a primary procedure and not as a fallback plan. I used the combination of
sampling techniques (convenience and snowball) to collect data from a total of 29 volunteers.
Eight of these participants volunteered for in-depth interviews and six of the individuals agreed
to participate in a follow-up focus group. The eight volunteers that participated in the additional

57
rounds of data collection are listed in Table 1 under their pseudonyms and in the order in which
they submitted their questionnaires.

Procedures
After receiving Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval (Appendix A), I sought out
four people that were similarly situated to the group that I planned to study and requested their
assistance with a pilot study. After getting individuals to sign consent forms for the pilot study
(Appendix B), I presented them with a questionnaire and had them answer the questions as
originally written. Following this step, I asked for oral feedback. I took notes and used these
suggestions to improve the questionnaire (Appendix C) that I used for this study. With a refined
questionnaire in hand, I began implementing my plan for data collection.
I contacted the directors of the Hometown Library and the Hometown Senior Center and
made several specific requests regarding their support for this study. Directors were asked if I
could place a recruiting poster (Appendix D) within their facility to notify the public of a request
to take part in this study. An abbreviated version (Appendix E) was also provided to the
directors for use when the amount of space available for posters or other publications was
insufficient to adequately display the extended version of the information. The director of the
Hometown Library posted the full-size version and also allowed smaller versions to be placed in
clear plastic frames in several locations within the library including the circulation desk and the
reference desk. An advertisement was also run on the television slideshow program viewable at
the library’s circulation desk. At the Hometown Senior Center, the director placed the notice
requesting volunteers in the center’s informational newsletter distributed by email. I had planned
on using several other recruiting strategies, like requesting a posting on the library website or
running an advertisement in the local newspaper, if there were problems in gathering enough
questionnaires.

59
Potential participants were directed to the library reference desk where copies of the
consent form (Appendix F) and questionnaire were available. Self-addressed stamped envelopes
were made available to encourage the return of the questionnaires. Alternately, potential
participants were instructed to contact me via email or via phone to obtain an electronic version
of the questionnaire. All individuals were provided with information about the study and were
advised of their right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.
When I acknowledged the receipt of a questionnaire, I highlighted the fact that I was
employing the use of snowball sampling and I sent electronic copies to individuals that requested
a questionnaire after hearing about the study from other participants. Even with snowball
sampling, the collection of questionnaires progressed slower than I expected or wanted. I was
giving serious consideration to my backup advertising strategies when the library director invited
me to participate in a library patron appreciation day, where I manned a table, handing out
questionnaires to patrons that inquired about the study. This event was a key reason for the surge
in returned questionnaires.
As questionnaires arrived in person, in the mail, and via email, I combed through them,
looking for evidence that the theoretical saturation point had been reached and that no new
relevant data were being collected (Gall et al., 2007). After the library patron appreciation day,
questionnaires flowed in much faster and it became evident that the data had not only reached the
saturation point, but also had exceeded this level. Taking into account what I had learned from
the questionnaires, I began preparing for the interviews. I contacted several similarly-situated
individuals and asked if they would participate in a pilot study. These participants answered my
proposed interview questions and provided feedback on how to improve the interview questions
and process. I made the recommended changes to my interview guide (Appendix G) and

60
incorporated the feedback into future interviews. While preparing for the interviews, I screened
the questionnaires, confirming that all potential participants owned an eReader and were age 50
or older. Also, I analyzed the questionnaires in an attempt to identify participants that would
make good candidates for an interview and for a focus group. Good candidates in this context
meant ones that would provide rich data. I had planned to continue the snowball sampling until I
had collected questionnaires from 15 to 20 potential volunteers. This number was larger than
Creswell’s (2013) suggestion (3 to 15 individuals for a heterogeneous group of
phenomenological research participants), but was chosen to allow for attrition. I anticipated
approximately eight to 10 participants being selected for the interviews and the focus group.
This number of participants was consistent with values suggested by others in phenomenological
research (Guest, Bunce, & Johnson, 2006; Mason, 2010).
Shortly after the library patron appreciation day, I removed all recruiting posters, signs
and electronic equivalents. Questionnaires continued to come in, slowed to a trickle, and finally
stopped arriving, but not before I received a total of 29. Data analysis, starting with the creation
of spreadsheets and matrices, began soon after receiving the first questionnaire and continued up
until I completed writing Chapter Five. After my initial analysis of the data, I invited 11 people
to a one-on-one interview and eight individuals agreed to participate. I conducted all of the
interviews in or near the Hometown Library and digitally recorded the interviews in an audio
format. I transcribed the conversations within a few days of each scheduled interview. I
analyzed the data after each transcription and realized that I was approaching the saturation point
after six or seven interviews. I had already scheduled the eighth interview, so I went ahead and
conducted that one as planned. Shortly after the interviews were completed, I placed the data in

61
several color-coded matrices to organize my thoughts for the upcoming focus group. These
matrices served as the outline for the themes that surfaced in the analysis.
I scheduled the focus group to be held at a time that was convenient for a majority of the
individuals that had participated in an interview. I invited several people that did not get
interviewed to participate in the focus group, but none of those individuals took me up on this
offer. Six of the eight participants that I interviewed attended the focus group. Discussion
prompts for the focus group (Appendix H) were developed based on the literature and on what I
learned after analyzing the questionnaires and interviews. Unlike the interviews, I opted to
video-record the event. I chose this method to aid in transcription because of the potential for
more than one person to speak at a time. Creswell’s (2013) technique was used to analyze the
data in search of themes.
The Researcher’s Role
I, as the researcher and human instrument for this study, previously worked as the
reference librarian at Hometown Library. During that term of employment, I provided reference
services and eReader assistance to patrons after eBooks were added to the collection
approximately five years prior to the study. My experience with eBook assistance ranged from
answering quick questions to spending an hour with patrons, getting them comfortable with
downloading a library book on their own eReader. My interest in the subject of senior adults and
eReaders was piqued during that period of service. I had more than 25 years of experience in
public service (though not all of it was in a library) and had always taken pride in serving others.
The ethics of working hard had been based on the philosophy of serving others because (1) as a
public servant, my pay originated from taxpayers and I wanted the citizens to get their money’s
worth and (2) I served God by serving others.

62
One potential bias that I brought to the study was the possibility of interpreting the
narratives of the participants instead of letting the participants’ own voices be heard (Creswell,
2013). I tried my best to eliminate this bias so as not to give the study a librarian slant instead of
the library patron or eReader user focus for which the study was designed. Another potential
(and related) bias that I tried to guard against was reporting the results in a way that placed the
library and me in a better light than what the patrons actually experienced because of my own
previous investment of time in the library’s eReader program. The findings reported in the next
chapter are longer than what may be considered “typical,” but I used the length as a way of
guaranteeing that the voice of the participants was truly heard.
Data Collection
One way to increase the trustworthiness of qualitative studies is to insure that there are at
least three methods of data collection used. The concept of triangulation involves using multiple
data collection measures for the same variable (Neuman, 1994). The three methods used in this
study were questionnaires, interviews, and a focus group, in that order. Questionnaires were
used to gather data and to identify potential participants for interviews. Interviews were
conducted to generate additional information and were discontinued when a saturation point was
reached. The interview participants were asked and six of them agreed to take part in a focus
group. Information attained from the focus group allowed me to triangulate or confirm the data
collected from the questionnaires and from the interviews.
Questionnaires
Gall et al. (2007) defined questionnaires as “printed forms that ask the same questions of
all individuals in the sample” (p. 228). Neuman (1994) stated that questionnaires were especially
appropriate for self-reporting issues and were more effective among those participants that were

63
well-educated or extremely interested in the research topic. Based on the demographics in the
vicinity of Hometown Library (an older population with higher income and education levels) and
the potential for interest in the research topic (based on data collection in a highly used library;
Georgia Public Library Service, 2014), questionnaires were deemed to be an appropriate method
for gathering data. I designed the questionnaire for this study to identify preliminary information
about individuals that would lead to data worthy of further inquiry as part of a phenomenological
study. Answers to questions one through three of the questionnaire provided basic demographic
and contact information about the participants (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2014; Werner,
2011). Questions four and five provided information on the eReaders used by the participants
(Smith, 2014; Zickuhr & Madden, 2012). Questions six through 10 provided information on
how eReaders were being used and on the ability levels of the participants (Cavanagh &
Robbins, 2012; Connell et al., 2012; Decker, 2010; Duncan, 2010; Kemp et al., 2012; Larson,
2010; Martinez-Estrada & Conaway, 2012). Question 11 focused on the problems associated
with the use of eReaders (Court-Jackson, 2011; Githens, 2007; Grimes et al., 2010). The intent
of questions 12 through 14 was to gather information on the previous and present use of
technology (Bean, 2003; Broady et al., 2010; Kim, 2008).
The original questions were modified based on results from a pilot study conducted ahead
of the questionnaire rollout. Initially, I debated about whether a pilot study was necessary, and
then sided with recommendations to use participants to levy criticisms and make suggestions for
improving the questionnaire (Gall et al., 2007). I ran the pilot study by providing a consent form
and a copy of the questionnaire to four similarly-situated acquaintances. I asked participants to
complete the questionnaires and provide feedback regarding the wording of the questions.
Finally, I gave the individuals additional details about this study to see if they had any

64
suggestions about questions that needed to be added to strengthen the questionnaire. After I
edited the questionnaire, I left copies at the reference desk of the Hometown Library. I posted
signs requesting participants for the study at the Hometown Library and had an electronic
announcement sent to recipients on the email distribution list of the Hometown Senior Center.
Signs and announcements directed potential participants to the library reference desk to pick up a
consent form along with a questionnaire. Participants that completed questionnaires were
handed a self-addressed stamped envelope for mailing. This kept the library staff from being
responsible for the completed questionnaires and also provided privacy for participants. I made
an electronic version of the questionnaire available by email upon request. I planned to continue
data collection until a saturation point was reached in the approximate range of 15 to 20
questionnaires, but a surge of returned questionnaires left me with a total of 29 before I
successfully shut down the flow of forms.
Interviews
Interviews represent the typical approach for acquiring data in phenomenological
research (Moustakas, 1994). Neuman (1994) described the field interview as an informal sharing
of conversation between the researcher and individuals being interviewed. Creswell (2013)
described the steps in the interview process including identifying interviewees, determining the
interview type, recording interviews, and designing the interview protocol. I used the Creswell
process as follows: First, I identified interviewees based on their responses to initial
questionnaires. I looked for participants that had the potential to add the most to this field of
research. Though informal interviews may have allowed the participants the least restrictive
opportunity to relate their personal story, I was concerned that the interviews may have lost focus
if some form of structure was not put in place. This concern was a reflection of my own ability

65
(or lack of ability) in conducting interviews. Therefore, for the next step in the process, I
selected as an interview type, the general interview guide approach. Gall et al. (2007) described
this approach as one that used outlined topics instead of using predetermined questions. I
modified the interview guide to include a few sample questions to give a better understanding of
what was covered under each of the topics listed. At this point, I immersed myself in the process
and prepared diligently for the interviews. Turner (2010) listed interview preparation as the most
important part of the interview process. After getting prepared, I began the face-to-face
interviews and audio-recorded the sessions to allow an opportunity for transcription of data after
the interviews were complete. I opted to personally transcribe the data as a way of becoming
more familiar with the data.
For the interview guide, questions one through five were representative of questions
asked to ascertain basic demographic information about the participants (Smith, 2014; U.S.
Department of Commerce, 2014; Werner, 2011). Questions similar to six through 10 provided
information on comfort, experience levels, and challenges of participants (Aberton, 2006;
Barnard et al., 2013; Martinez-Estrada & Conaway, 2012; Smith, 2014; Zickuhr & Madden,
2012). Questions like 11 and 12 were aimed at determining the support level of participants
(Carpenter & Buday, 2007; Erickson & Johnson, 2011; Ng, 2008). Questions similar to 13
through 16 focused on the motivations of adult learners (Knowles et al., 1998). Question 17 was
used to discuss items of importance that may not have been previously covered. Prior to
conducting interviews, I developed and refined the categories for the general interview guide
based on what I learned from the questionnaires. Also, I interviewed two similarly-situated
individuals and solicited their recommendations as part of a pilot study prior to the
commencement of interviews. For these initial interviews, I used three different devices to

66
insure that I captured a digital copy of the event. I received feedback that the number of devices
was intimidating. I eliminated the use of a laptop and went with a small USB microphone and a
digital recorder for the remaining sessions.
The location used for most of the interviews was the Hometown Library. A few other
locations close to the library were used as a convenience to individual participants. I conducted
interviews in a respectful manner. I began the interviews by using a prepared script, and as the
interviews progressed, I followed the lead of the interviewees. I incorporated strategies for
constructing effective research questions, developing follow up questions, and avoiding
embedded assumptions (Turner, 2010). Probing questions were used to exude additional detail.
All interviews lasted between 50 and 60 minutes and interviews continued until a data saturation
point was reached (Guest, et al., 2006). Saturation occurred around the sixth or seventh
interview, but I went ahead and kept the appointment with the previously scheduled eighth
interviewee.
Focus Group
Neuman (1994) described a focus group as a one to two hour session where six to 12
participants discuss an issue with a moderator. Morgan (1997) provided a reason why this
choice was advantageous: “The hallmark of focus groups is their explicit use of group interaction
to produce data and insights that would be less accessible without the interaction found in a
group” (p. 2). Following the completion of the individual interviews, I invited 11 volunteers to
participate in a focus group based on their willingness to participate and on the likelihood that
their individual comments would provide rich data. Of these 11, eight had participated in the
interview phase and three had not. Only those individuals that interviewed voiced an interest in

67
focus group participation. I looked at scheduling options convenient to a majority of the group
members and selected a time and date that worked for six of the individuals.
The focus group was scheduled when the interview data reached a saturation point. If
new concepts were introduced during the focus group, I was prepared to schedule a second focus
group to ensure data saturation. However, I was able to adequately address issues that came up
during the initial focus group and did not need to schedule an additional session.
The focus group was conducted in a private meeting room at the Hometown Library.
Like the interviews, the focus group session was recorded for later transcription, except that I
used a digital video recording. A few times during the focus group, several people spoke at
once. The digital video copy of the session was invaluable in helping me go back and figure out
what was said and by whom. I conducted a 90-minute session using prompts that I had
developed. Prompts one and two provided basic demographic information (U.S. Department of
Commerce, 2014; Werner, 2011). Prompts three through six provided information about support
given to the participants (Carpenter & Buday, 2007; Erickson & Johnson, 2011; Ng, 2008).
Prompts seven through nine examined observation and modeling (Bandura, 1977). Prompts 10
and 11 looked at perceptions of adult eReader users (Davis, 1985; Davis, 1989; Davis et al.,
1989). Question 12 was a catch-all to cover anything that may have been missed.
Data Analysis
After collecting information, I began analyzing the data. Neuman (1994) described
qualitative data as “text, written words, phrases, or symbols describing or representing people,
actions, and events in social life” (p. 404). Creswell (2013) stated that data analysis “involves
organizing the data, conducting a preliminary read-through of the database, coding and
organizing themes, representing the data, and forming an interpretation of them” (p. 179).

68
Questionnaires were analyzed to identify participants that met the criteria for continued inclusion
in the study. The data from the questionnaires provided a likely starting point for the interviews
and for the focus group.
I treated the transcription of the interviews and the focus group as an exercise in
familiarizing myself with the data. Moustakas (1994) detailed a technique for performing data
analysis, but I used Creswell’s (2013) simplified version to perform the analysis. This technique
involved disclosing the researcher’s previous experience in the subject area, developing a list of
significant statements, grouping statements into meaning units, developing textural descriptions
about what was experienced and structural descriptions about how the experience occurred, and
finally writing about the essence of the experience (Creswell, 2013). In an abbreviated fashion,
the analysis process involved bracketing, coding, and identifying themes. Bracketing is “the act
of suspending one’s beliefs in the reality of the natural world in order to study the essential
structures of the world” (Van Manen, 1990, p. 175). Coding involves aggregating the data into
25 or 30 categories using codes to label data that contain similar information (Creswell, 2013).
Next, Creswell recommended identifying five or six themes and placing the coded information
within the appropriate theme. Initially, I identified six themes, but during the ensuing analysis, I
merged several themes and was left with a total of four. At this stage, the narrative or two-fold
description was generated: a textural description, defined as “an account of individuals’ intuitive,
prereflective perceptions of a phenomenon from various perspectives” (Gall et al., 2007, p. 656)
and a structural description, defined as “an account of the regularities of thought, judgment,
imagination, and recollection that underlie the experience of a phenomenon and give meaning to
it” (p. 654). In layman’s terms, the textural description was written using actual text and
examples from the participants. The structural description was derived from a look at the setting

69
in which the phenomenon occurred. Then individual descriptions were grouped into a composite
form called the essence the experience and the open codes were organized into themes.
Trustworthiness
Gall et al. (2007) defined validity as the “appropriateness, meaningfulness, and usefulness
of specific inferences made from test scores” (p. 657) and reliability as the repeatability or the
“amount of measurement error in the scores yielded by a test” (p. 651). The concept of
trustworthiness was developed as the qualitative counterpart to these quantitative terms.
According to Lincoln and Guba (1985), trustworthiness involves establishing credibility,
transferability, dependability, and confirmability.
Credibility
Neuman (1994) described internal validity as the lack of internal design errors that may
contribute to alternative explanations. The scientific term internal validity is equated with the
naturalistic term credibility, as both terms speak to the aspect of truth value (Lincoln and Guba,
1985). Guba expounded, “In establishing truth value, then, naturalistic inquirers are most
concerned with testing the credibility of their findings and interpretations with the various
sources (audiences or groups) from which data were drawn” (1981, p. 80). Lincoln and Guba
(1985) recommended the use of triangulation during the research to increase “the probability that
credible findings will be produced” (p.301). Neuman (1994) defined triangulation as “using
different types of measures, or data collection techniques, in order to examine the same variable”
(p. 141). Creswell (2013) used the term corroborating evidence to describe the concept of
triangulation. The corroborating evidence that I used during the data collection portion of the
study included the use of three different measures in the form of questionnaires, interviews, and
a focus group.

70
Transferability
Neuman (1994) defines external validity as the “ability to generalize experimental
findings to events and settings outside the experiment itself” (p. 185). Lincoln and Guba (1985)
linked the scientific concepts of external validity and generalizability to the naturalistic term
transferability. Generalizability and transferability occur as an aspect of applicability when the
findings transcend time and are thus context-free (Guba, 1981). To increase transferability,
Lincoln and Guba (1985) recommended the use of thick descriptive data. Neuman (1994)
described this concept as using data that are “rich in detailed description and limited in
abstraction” (p. 64). Guba (1981) broke the concept down into two components: collecting thick
data and developing thick descriptions. For the former concept and to achieve transferability
during this study, I collected data from three sources: questionnaires, interviews, and a focus
group. In particular, the transferability of the study was aided by the length of the one-on-one
interviews. For the latter concept, Creswell (2013) recommended the use of strong action verbs
and quotes, a concept that I applied when I reported the findings.
Dependability
According to Lincoln and Guba (1985), the aspect of consistency relates the scientific
term reliability with the naturalistic term dependability. Guba (1981) described dependability as
a “concept that embraces elements both of the stability implied by the rationalistic term reliable
and of the trackability required by explainable changes in instrumentation” (p. 81). To assess the
dependability, Lincoln and Guba (1985) proposed the use of an external inquiry audit to examine
the process. I incorporated an external audit into this study and prepared for the audit by
building two 3-ring binders. The first binder contained a current copy of the study. The second
binder contained a table of contents, printed copies of the transcribed data collected during the

71
course of the research, matrices representing how the data were synthesized into themes, and an
audit trail log detailing steps that I took along the way. The audit for this study was performed
by a research librarian with background and experience dealing with library patrons and their use
of eReaders. When I initially met with the auditor, I spent 90 minutes going over both binders,
providing additional details to clarify the process that I went through in reporting my findings
and arriving at my conclusions. The auditor used her expertise, including 20 years of experience
in the field of librarianship, to point out meaningful additions and to highlight possible nuances
to what I had found.
Confirmability
The aspect of neutrality is known as objectivity in the rationalist paradigm: “Objectivity
is presumably guaranteed by methodology; If the methods are explicated, open to public
scrutiny, replicable, and at least one step removed from direct investigator-subject contact, then
objectivity is assured” (Guba, 1981, p. 80). The naturalistic counterpart to objectivity is
confirmability (Lincoln and Guba, 1985). Guba (1981) associated objectivity with the
investigator and confirmability with the data. To improve confirmability, Lincoln and Guba
(1985) recommended the use of triangulation and the use of an external audit, this time from the
product aspect. Creswell and Miller (2000) defined triangulation as “a validity procedure where
researchers search for convergence among multiple and different sources of information to form
themes or categories in a study” (p. 126). Data collected from questionnaires, interviews, and a
focus group were analyzed using matrices and other tools to determine common themes. At that
point, I submitted this study to the external auditor. During an external audit, “the auditor
examines whether or not the findings, interpretations, and conclusions are supported by the data”
(Creswell, 2013, p. 252). To aid the external auditor in this endeavor, I provided her with copies

72
of raw transcribed data, data summaries, themed matrices, and a current copy of the dissertation
to analyze the product aspect of the research.
Ethical Considerations
There were several ethical considerations that were taken into account while conducting
this study. First, negative results may impact the Hometown Library, the Hometown Public
Relations Department and funding from the City Council. I took several steps to minimize this
issue. I briefed the library director in advance about this study and its potential impact and kept
the director up to date on the status. Pseudonyms for participants and for the library were used to
conceal identities and to minimize the risk. Also, I conducted the study in a professional
manner, required the signing of consent forms, and allowed participants the opportunity to quit at
any time.
Second, data were protected by placing printed copies in a locked filing cabinet. Digital
copies were stored in password-protected files.
Finally, all potential ethical issues were addressed in the application to the Institutional
Review Board (IRB). No research was conducted prior to receiving an approval from the IRB.
Summary
This research on the use of eReaders by senior adults in Georgia was designed as a
phenomenological study. The important aspect of this type of qualitative study is that
participants must experience the same phenomenon, which in this case was the use of an
eReader. Data collection took place in and around a public library in a Georgia community with
above average education and income levels. The three methods selected for data collection were
questionnaires, interviews, and a focus group. I received a total of 29 questionnaires. Eight
participants agreed to a 50 to 60 minute interview and six participated in a 90-minute focus

73
group. I analyzed the data using the steps outlined by Creswell (2013). Findings from the
research follow in the next chapter.

74
CHAPTER FOUR: FINDINGS
The purpose of this phenomenological study was to describe the perspectives of Georgia
senior adults in their adoption of eReaders. This study was guided by the following questions:
(a) What are contributing factors in senior adults’ decisions to use eBooks? (b) How do senior
adults describe their eReader experiences? (c) What are the challenges and benefits of senior
adults regarding the use of eReaders? In this chapter, I provided extensive descriptions of the
individual participants in this study followed by a discussion of the themes that were present,
relying heavily on the actual words used (either written or spoken) by the participants. The
themes that emerged were related back to the original research questions that drove the study.
This chapter concludes with a summary of important findings.
Participants
As part of the initial data collection phase for this study, a total of 29 people submitted
questionnaires. Out of this group, 11 members were invited to participate in a 50- to 60-minute
interview and/or a 90-minute focus group. The eight people that signed up to participate are
shown in Table 2 under pseudonyms in the order that they turned in their consent forms and
questionnaires. I used the analysis steps laid out by Creswell (2013) and developed a textural
description for each participant. I followed each detailed textural description with a structural
description of the individual before continuing with a similar process for the next participant.
This method of both introducing a participant and creating individual textural and structural
descriptions resulted in a longer, but also more thorough discussion of each participant. This
option made the individual descriptions flow more gracefully and increased the understanding of
the “what” and the “how” (Moustakas, 1994) of participants’ perspectives of the eReader

phenomenon. This section on individual participants concludes with a composite description
detailing the essence of the experience.
James
Textural. James is a 70-year-old white male. He is a retired USAF officer with degrees
in physics and engineering. At the time of this study, he was a member of the IEEE and kept “up
with what they’re doing at the Scientific American level” (Personal communication with
interviewee, January 30, 2015). In relating his background, he stated, “I’ve been using
computers for a long, long time and certainly I ain’t scared of them. Every once in a while, I get
angry with them, but I’m not scared of them” (Personal communication with interviewee,
January 30, 2015). He described himself as “Retired, OCD” (Personal communication with
interviewee, January 30, 2015) and has loved to read all of his life. James was active in his
community and stated, “I believe the library is the best enemy of dishonest politicians and I think

76
it is a critical part of the community” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30,
2015). James declared that his “biggest hobby, outside the library, is writing” (Personal
communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015), and in this endeavor, he published a book,
and was working on another one. James commented that his amount of available reading time
had increased since he was given an eReader four years ago.
James’s eReader of choice was an iPad and he read “at least an hour, sometimes two or
three hours a day” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015). James
described his ability level with his eReader as “very high” and gave an account of his current
collection of eBooks as “60 books on my Kindle app––all purchased. I purchased some books
from iBooks––I’ve got 18 purchased books on iBooks and I’ve got 80 of their free old books––
the classics” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015). In contrast to
James’s interest and involvement in the library, he was not a fan of the library’s eBook
collection. “They don’t have much that I want because most of what I’m doing is research and
the Georgia Download Destination is pretty much geared toward fiction, biography. I’m not
doing that kind of research. I’m doing technical research” (Personal communication with
interviewee, January 30, 2015). True to his point, James read “very little fiction” (Personal
communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015), and instead listed nonfiction, history, and
science as the types of books he accessed on his eReader. James’s reading choices also blended
over into the area of philosophy. He was a member of two discussion groups or book clubs that
focused on the Enlightenment and the history of the Enlightenment and he read “an awful lot of
that on the eReader” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015). When asked
whether he had ever lent electronic copies of books to other people, he commented about
Amazon:

77
Now they do have some deal that allows you to lend Kindle books to other people
somehow, but I’ve never used that because nobody I know reads the same kind of stuff I
do except members of the book club and they all buy their own. (Personal
communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015)
James traced his technology roots back to his use of the FORTRAN computer language
in 1964 and his use of DOS in 1986. He described his technology ability level as “shy of a geek,
but I’ve got a little bit of Luddite in me. I don’t adapt quickly to new technology and I am just
having fits right now with Apple and their Yosemite operating system” (Personal communication
with interviewee, January 30, 2015). James “moved to Apple from Microsoft Windows” and
had been “very, very happy––until last month” (Personal communication with interviewee,
January 30, 2015) when he experienced this recent problem. James owned multiple Apple
devices in addition to his iPad, including an iMac, a MacBook Pro, and an iPhone. As a general
rule, he used bigger machines for his research and writing, and then used the iPad for reading.
He did not synchronize (sync) his devices because he did not switch between them to do his
reading. His iPhone was too small for use as an eReader because as he explained, “If it was big
enough to easily read from, I would be changing pages too fast” (Personal communication with
interviewee, January 30, 2015). The iMac provided a much larger screen, but for reading, the
convenience of the iPad was unbeatable. The iPad was convenient because it was “light, easy to
carry, [and came] with a battery that lasts six or eight hours” (Personal communication with
interviewee, January 30, 2015). James appreciated the search function that enhanced his
research capabilities. The iPad had the added capability to store notes and highlights. However,
James commented that his note taking was not without problems: “Right now, I’m rereading the
King James Bible and the Quran and I’m highlighting and noting both of them and I managed to

78
slow it down quite a bit because I’ve got so many notes” (Personal communication with
interviewee, January 30, 2015). James mentioned the current trend to share notes with other
interested parties online, but then indicated, “I don’t do that. I don’t think anybody else needs to
know what I’m annotating or the notes I’m writing” (Personal communication with interviewee,
January 30, 2015).
James used his iMac at home to order most of his eBooks via Amazon. James described
how he ordered eBooks on one machine, but then read and took notes on another. In describing
his research steps, he expounded:
When I find something that is a table of contents that’s linked, I can go straight to a
particular chapter if I want to. If I see something in here that interests me and I want to
save it, then I touch it and swipe it and it highlights it. And then if I want to, I can touch
it and a menu comes up that will allow me to change the highlighting color or to add a
note and I can type the note with the keyboard and then when I’m done, I save the note.
(Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015)
James’s iPad received considerable use. He pointed out that his To Read list was so long
“that if I get to read all those books before I die, I will be immortal” (Personal communication
with interviewee, January 30, 2015). He received recommendations for other books either from
his book club or from recommended sources that he discovered during his research. These books
came at a price, but as an author, he was well-versed in this aspect and he had a vested interest in
royalty payments. About this issue he remarked:
One thing that frustrates me is the price of the books. I think they are ripping us off, both
Amazon and Apple, because electrons are really, really cheap. And yes, you’ve got to
give the author some royalties, but I get 2 dollars and 82 cents from Amazon when

79
somebody buys my book on the Kindle. They get 7 dollars and that’s a little much I
think. (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015)
James’s discussion of prices continued with more comments about eBooks purchased by libraries
to circulate among their patrons and eBooks purchased by consumers for personal use and he
outlined the need for resolution. He stated:
The price of books has got to come under control. It’s going to shake out. The industry
is going to shake out . . . if the consumers get after them or if somebody proves again
there’s collusion––I think they’ve already done that once––and I got 11 cents in a class
action settlement and the lawyers made 500,000 dollars. (Personal communication with
interviewee, January 30, 2015)
James believed that the physical inability of older people to hold large print copies of sizable
works upright, suggested the need for an alternative: “You can put a large print copy of War and
Peace on this [iPad] and anyone can hold it. I think the changing demographic is going to drive
the market” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015). James’s own
advance in age was accompanied by an increased number of doctor’s appointments and
additional time spent in places like waiting rooms. His eReader, in the form of an iPad, was
there to keep him company.
Structural. As one of the older participants in the study, James may be realizing that life
was passing him by; and therefore, he had no time for fiction. He gravitated to nonfiction and
sought the meaning of life through his participation in philosophical book discussion clubs and
through his research involving classical religious texts. His thirst for knowledge was more
pronounced than anyone else’s in the study, and this was what kept him away from most fiction
titles. For clarification, James did read a small amount of fiction, but it was typically done in an

80
investigative fashion as he looked at the classics on his eReader for reference material to provide
a historical context for the research that he was conducting. The same skill set that made him
successful as an Air Force Missile Officer––his technical background and his methodical
nature––explained how he had adapted so easily to an eReader, as evidenced by his detailed and
thorough description of how eBooks were downloaded onto his iPad. His comfort around
electronics was aided by his exposure to technology at work, and was complemented by his math
and science educational background. James’s self-described OCD behavior, his education as an
engineer, and the rigid training required of a military officer, particularly a missile officer, had
combined in a way to make James appreciate the value of his iPad for the efficiencies that it
provided him. His iPad had allowed him to continue his research, reading, and studies even
when he left home for a multitude of medical appointments. Prior to a medical procedure, he
was presented with an iPad as a gift. As an owner, he had grasped it whole-heartedly.
Something that he perceived as unnecessary and that he would not have bought for himself was
now something that he took everywhere and he could not live without. James’s continued use of
an iPad was very much a function of “how” he used it. The iPad served not only as James’s
primary eReader, but also as James’s secondary source for computer-type functions at home and
his primary source when away from home. A dichotomy arose regarding James’s volunteer
library service and his library use. James was active as a library volunteer, but did not take
advantage of the free eBooks available for lending at the local library. Part of the reason was
that the library did not have eBook titles that interested him. Even if the library had what he
wanted, it was questionable whether the short two-week lending period would have served the
needs of a patron who read almost exclusively for research purposes. If nothing else, James

81
realized the value of his local library, even if the eBooks were not the ones that he used
personally.
Mike
Textural. Mike, a married, 51-year-old male, retired from the USAF and at the time of
this study worked as an airline pilot. He described himself as an avid reader and said, “I actually
love to read and that takes up a good portion of my free time” (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 8, 2015). Mike immersed himself in technology:
I would say that I use technology as much or more than probably my peers. As a pilot,
I’m flying––well currently––the airplane I’m flying––is probably state of the art, if not,
just a little off the edge. It’s the most advanced airplane I’ve flown. [My airline] has
now switched us over to––we are going toward paperless cockpits, so we are using
Microsoft Surface 2 tablets for all of our approach plates and our flying publications. It’s
fantastic! I’m really enjoying that, you know, between that and carrying my eReader
when I go on trips––because I’ll have like 50 books on there––because I don’t want to
haul . . . all my books around. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 8,
2015)
Not only did Mike immerse himself in technology, but also he exuded confidence in this area:
I’ve always had the ability to pick up technology quickly. When I would help start a
church, I was the soundboard guy; I had never worked sound before. But I’m not afraid
of technology so I like to dive right into it and learn it and use it to its maximum
advantage. I’m not really doing anything right now that requires that, but in the past,
when I have, I’ve excelled in that area. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 8, 2015)

82
At another point, Mike related more about his technical ability:
Well, I’ve always embraced technology and I’ve just had a knack for figuring out things.
Hand me some piece of equipment and I figure out how to use it rather quickly. So I
guess that would be part of it. I guess that I was always that way. I don’t know why.
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 8, 2015)
Mike’s comments during the interview showed that he was current with the latest advances in
eReader technology. He was both conversant and experienced with the Calibre library system
software, having downloaded it for use on his eReader as an alternative, but not a full
replacement, for Amazon’s system.
When Mike filled out his questionnaire, he listed his eReader as “Kindle Keyboard––the
only one I’ve ever had” (Personal communication with interviewee, November 16, 2014).
However, in the 3-month window between the time the questionnaire was submitted and the time
the interview took place, the device that he had owned for many years experienced problems and
Mike was forced to purchase a new eReader. He considered all options including his budget
before making a decision. He debated about the older version of the Kindle, but opted for the
upgraded Paperwhite that included the backlight feature. Mike was satisfied with the purchase,
but the new device was not perfect. There was still something that Mike would like to change.
My only complaint about it is––it doesn’t have the separate page-turning buttons like the
old version did, so I inadvertently change the page a lot and I’ve got to flip back to it––
that’s something I would have liked to have had––the old version with the backlit feature
and keep the buttons that I can’t inadvertently change. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 8, 2015)
When prodded, Mike provided an even more in-depth comparison of his two Kindle devices:

83
You know the older one was larger, taller. It has a bigger footprint than the Paperwhite.
They had the keyboard exposed on it, which I never really used, so it was interesting to
see them get rid of that because a lot of people said, “I don’t need a keyboard.” I did like
the buttons, the page turning differences on the old one versus the new one. I like the
lighting on the new one versus the old one. With that touch screen you can inadvertently
change pages––I’ve knocked it. You’ve got to be careful with that thing. I have to make
sure to turn it off before I set it down or something because [if you are not careful] you
grab it and [touch] it and now you’re turning pages. I find that to be a bad human factors
issue for the reader. But I do like it. It’s nice and small. I think the old one didn’t feel
quite as substantial. It was thinner and I think that’s why my cases––I had three different
cases for my Kindle and each one caused issues. One was causing it to short out and turn
pages and do all kinds of things and eventually wouldn’t stay in and got bent in my
suitcase which is what I think happened. My new one is smaller. It shouldn’t bend, but I
do need to get a case for it. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 8, 2015)
All in all though, Mike was happy with his newest device. He continued by describing how the
new device was easier on the eyes and did not require the use of a book light when reading at
night in bed.
Mike downloaded his eBooks from two primary sources. Approximately 75% of Mike’s
eBooks came from a memory stick pre-loaded with titles provided to him by his son. The other
25% came from Amazon, where Mike was a Prime member. The eBooks downloaded from the
memory stick worked outside the Amazon domain, so those books were not available for syncing
to the Amazon cloud and thus were not visible across multiple platforms. Mike took advantage
of the Amazon Prime benefits including the free book per month from the Kindle Owners’

84
Lending Library, but described the process as somewhat painful and used the following strategy
as a way of making an inefficient process slightly more efficient:
I actually will go upstairs on my laptop, find the book I want and then go on to my Kindle
and find it in there and download [it] because you have to be on the eReader to get that
Prime book on your reader. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 8,
2015)
Mike took advantage of the Amazon website and the Amazon emails that he received to find the
free classics or the best deals on eBooks and sometimes went with the Amazon suggestions.
Other sources for Mike’s downloaded content included eBooks recommended to him by his son
and by his co-workers. One unique technique for choosing eBooks to read involved visiting a
bookstore. Mike used his phone to snap a picture of the cover of potentially interesting print
books, and then did additional research on the Internet at home before he purchased the eBook
via Amazon.
About his reading preferences, Mike exclaimed, “I don’t discriminate,” and “I read it all”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 8, 2015), and usually had two books going
at the same time, one fiction and one nonfiction. Mike set a goal in 1988 and promised himself
that he “would read at least one novel a month. . . . I read generally a novel or more a week and
the Kindle has just made that so much easier” (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 8, 2015). Mike had not downloaded any eBooks from the local library, primarily
because he had so many books that were downloadable from his pre-loaded memory stick. For
the books he purchased from Amazon, he took advantage of the program that allowed him to
download additional copies if he thought the eBooks would be of interest to other family

85
members. He was emphatic about never having a problem with his device. When asked if he
had contacted Amazon about a problem, he replied:
Haven’t needed to––you know sometimes the book downloads immediately and
sometimes it takes an hour. I don’t know why. I’ve never needed to call Amazon and
say, “Hey, where in the world is my book?” They’ve always come through for me.
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 8, 2015)
Mike described a list of places he would call if he had problems with services like cable TV or
cellular phones. He also had a “go to” person for IT issues, but Amazon did not fall into the
problem category. He mentioned one time when his Kindle Paperwhite refused to recognize the
swiping motion made by his finger. He was a bit irritated and attributed the problem to either a
cold or wet hand. He reminisced about his older model and said the Kindle Keyboard would
have allowed him to bypass this problem. He laughed and explained, “So I think sometimes . . .
in an effort to make it cleaner and all this kind of stuff . . . , [I] think it lost some capability in
that regard. But you know, it’s not going to make me put it down” (Personal communication
with interviewee, February 8, 2015).
Mike preferred his Kindle Paperwhite for most books, with a specific exception for the
Bible. This was the one book that he routinely read more than once and he preferred
old-fashioned paper books when it comes to things that I want to go back and look at––
you know I like to highlight them, write notes in them or something like that. . . . And
that’s where I find the Kindle kind of lacking. You can certainly highlight and you can
make some notes, but it’s just not the same as having good old-fashioned paper in that
regard. You know, otherwise, I’m thinking technology. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 8, 2015)

86
He did read the Bible on his eReader when he traveled though. However, when he was in the
comfort of his own home, he read and studied a print version of his Bible. Then, when he went
to church, he turned to the Bible on his phone, the one time that he purposely planned to read on
that device. Otherwise, use of his phone as an eReader was what he called an “emergency
procedure. I would do that if I am on a layover, my Kindle lost its charge, I have no ability to
charge it, and I want to read my book. That would be my spare tire” (Personal communication
with interviewee, February 8, 2015). After additional consideration, he realized that his phone
was even further down the list and that his real backup plan would be the Kindle app on the
tablet issued to him by his employer. Mike mentioned that he also preferred print copies for
other types of reference books, even fiction books, if they required frequent use of a map. “So
more likely, with the Paperwhite, I would have said to myself, ‘It sure would be nice to see that
map right now, but I’m not going to go look for it. I’m just going to push on’” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 8, 2015).
Mike gave short details about features that he liked including the backlight, the
dictionary, battery life, and the wireless capability for downloading, and then turned to an
exhaustive description about the font and type:
I prefer to read with my cheater glasses rather than making giant font size––you know the
more you change the page, the quicker the battery runs down and so that E Ink or
whatever they call it––my understanding is that it writes the page, now it is not using any
juice. It’s just that each time it writes the page, it burns juice. Since I read so much, I
want my battery to last. So I’d rather wear the cheaters and have smaller font and change
the page less––and I do read pretty fast––so if I made the font as big as my wife does, I
would be going click, click, click, click. So okay, yeah, I’ve done the font and on the

87
new one you can even change––well the font is different than the type case––so you can
change the font. There are like five different fonts on the new one whereas the old you
didn’t have––you just had one to choose from, but you could change the size. So I’ve
looked at that and I’ve thought––I like the way it came––the default setting––so it’s in
the default setting now. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 8, 2015)
Mike liked the fact that the Kindle was compact and capable of being used anywhere: “I feel like
I am reading a book. Once again it comes down to the eyestrain and it’s just great” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 8, 2015). The E Ink technology and backlight feature
allowed Mike to read his Kindle in the dark (e.g., in bed at night), in the bright sunlight (e.g., on
the family’s typical beach and cruise vacations), or in a hotel room (e.g., during business travel).
However, Mike was equally forthcoming about where to draw the line for eReader functionality:
It’s not a tablet, no matter how many little goofy things like that they try to put on
there––it’s just too clumsy. . . . Any capability that it has on it, outside of just reading,
I’m not going to use. To me, it’s a reader. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 8, 2015)
That being said, Mike predicted and expected big changes in the future:
I’m real interested in where [technology] is headed. What’s the next generation reader
going to look like? I suspect it will have color. I look forward to that. I suspect the
eReader will become even more like a real book. I’m sure that is their intention, and I
look forward to that. That’s something that I look forward to. . . . Amazon has these
books called Whispernet something or other, so I think you can even do audio books on
your Kindle which I have not looked into. That might be something that I want to look at
because once again driving and having an audio book is lots of fun. . . . I read an article a

88
week or so ago. It talked about how the Internet is going to fade into the background. It
will become so pervasive that you won’t even think about it, but everything you’re doing
will be on the Internet. We are just going to be awash. Everything, every appliance, you
turn on, everything you do in your house––you’re going to be tapping the Internet. So I
suspect that the Kindle––one day––the eReaders are going to tap into that kind of stuff. I
think it’s going to be––that is going to be interesting. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 8, 2015)
Mike expected his technical background and interests would keep him abreast of and involved
with those changes.
Structural. As the youngest male participant, Mike was as comfortable and as confident
with his technical abilities as anyone else in this study. He was knowledgeable about
technology, knew what he was looking for, and knew what he was not looking for in a device. In
the case of an eReader, he wanted a stand-alone device. He was not interested in the multifunction capability of a tablet when it came to reading. How he used the device dictated why he
had chosen that path. He read in three primary locations: in bed, on beach vacations, and in his
hotel room during business trips. The Paperwhite adjusted to the different lighting conditions
associated with each of these circumstances. Mike appreciated the device for its compact size
and storage capacity, and praised it for its long battery life and adaptability for travel. Mike’s
preference for the print copy of a study Bible showed that he had drawn boundaries for what
worked and what did not work for him and his eReader. That being said, though he did not
prefer the electronic edition of the Bible, he accessed the Bible using a smartphone when he was
at church. He disliked the small screen on the phone, but made an exception for the case in
which the convenience of the situation outweighed the disadvantage of the small screen. Mike’s

89
interview was sprinkled with aviation and military terms like “bad human factors issue” and
“emergency procedure” that highlighted a mindset dominated and perhaps indoctrinated to the
methodical approaches associated with his past and present careers. Mike’s mindset was seen
and heard in the descriptions of how he came to own an eReader, how he went about purchasing
a replacement eReader, and how he downloaded new library software and eBooks onto his
device. Cost played a factor in his choice to purchase a replacement Kindle and in his decision
to maintain an Amazon Prime membership. Though the Prime membership did cost something,
Mike more than offset this expense by taking advantage of benefits like the Kindle Owners’
Lending Library and special offers emailed to members. He also saved money by allowing his
family to share eBooks that he had downloaded, but Mike had not taken advantage of the public
library’s collection of eBooks. Mike also read for free the classics and other books given to him
on a memory stick. Mike was as passionate as they come regarding the use of an eReader, but
did not forcibly push this viewpoint on to others. He felt as though he was truly maximizing the
functionality of his eReader and appreciated the ability to hold multiple books on one device. He
looked forward to the future when E Ink is mass-marketed in color and eReaders tap the Internet
in new ways.
Rob
Textural. As the oldest participant in the study, Rob was a 73-year-old male active in his
church and community. After retiring from the USAF, he went back to school to “beef up on
technology courses and then taught at a community college for five and a half years” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015). He listed his eReader ability level as
“expert” and attributed this to his previous experience with DOS and Microsoft Windows
products, though he had switched over to an Apple iPad and an iPhone. Commenting on his

90
ability with the iPad, Rob said he was “about four years behind” his 13-year-old granddaughter,
but that he was ahead of his peers since “I don’t see too many of them using an iPad” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015). Outside his family, he estimated that only
10% of his peers used an eReader. His wife was amazed at what Rob did with computers, but
Rob shrugged this off and explained, “Once you’ve done it, it sort of sticks with you” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015). Rob had owned his eReader of choice, the
iPad, for about three years. Though some people appreciated the iPad for its computer-like and
tablet-like functions, and Rob is definitely in that category, Rob was also as quick as anyone to
share the fact that he used the iPad first and foremost as an eReader. Here are the comments he
offered about the subject:
I really do enjoy my eReader––actually what it is––is an iPad and I have basically four
different apps that I can use for reading. There’s Overdrive where I get my library books
from [the public library] and then I have NOOK and what is Amazon’s? I have the
Amazon one and then I have a general one for which you can get all of the old classics
which are free. So I have, oh, all of them, I have probably read several hundred books
since I’ve got my iPad––almost to the point where I can’t get too many more on there––
that’s okay. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015)
Rob did not own a dedicated eReader because the iPad “just handles everything” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015). Rob really understood the nuances of the
different eReader apps and coaxed the most possible out of each app. Frequently, Rob checked
Amazon for classic books and courtesy of his Prime account, he was provided with Amazon
offers for “free books sometime during the month” with the added benefit that “you can
download those––they’re in your library forever, if you want” (Personal communication with

91
interviewee, February 3, 2015). Though Rob spent a couple of hours a day using his iPad as an
eReader, he used the device for other functions as well. After all, he reasoned, “If I wanted to
just read, I would have bought a NOOK or a Kindle or what have you” (Personal communication
with interviewee, February 3, 2015). He used the iPad for messaging, web surfing, GPS,
Facebook, Skype, travel, and news. “I spend much less time on the other apps. Most of it is on
the eReader” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015). In an effort to cut
down on his costs, he initially read only copies of eBooks checked out from the local library’s
collection. These eBooks had the advantage of being free, being accessible 24 hours a day, and
being available without having to make a visit to the physical library. When Rob first got his
iPad, he came to the library: “They helped me set up the Overdrive system which has evolved
quite a bit since that time––eight or nine versions and about eight or nine versions of each
version” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015). Rob went into
exhaustive detail describing the problems associated with the search function that seemed to loop
him back to where he started, causing a tremendous increase in time required to complete the
search and subsequent download. However, Rob sang the praises of the current system. As one
of the original users of the library’s eReader checkout system, he persevered through numerous
software updates and was rewarded with a better product even as other patrons gave up along the
way.
The library eBooks were capable of being downloaded into a variety of apps, but Rob
preferred Overdrive:
I’ve just gotten used to it and [it] keeps me updated. I know exactly where I’m at page
wise, and maybe it does it with the others too, but also it gives me the amount of time that

92
I’ve got left before it has to be returned. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 3, 2015)
Rob liked the versatility of the Overdrive function:
I can go to the library. I can see what books they have there. I can also see how many
people are signed up ahead of me and that’s good because if I see a book that I want, I
can selectively put it on there and then I can get an estimate of how much time it’s going
to take before I’ll get it. I can look for it by any type of thing. I can have fiction,
nonfiction. Under fiction, I can have by type––fiction that it is. I like mysteries and
suspense and then I go in and see each individual [book] there. I can see how many
people are signed up for it and if I want to, I can go in and punch a certain period and it
will tell me ones that are available today. So that’s real good too. (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015)
After exhausting the supply of books available from the library system, Rob moved on to other
options.
Rob said that he was on a budget, but that he did not have a specific limit on the price he
would pay for a book. What he was willing to spend depended on the situation:
I don’t really put a price limit on it. If I really want it, I’ll go up to 12 dollars and 99
cents because sometimes whenever you’ve got 84 people waiting on two copies within
the Georgia system, you ain’t going to get it for a while. But I still watch what I spend.
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015)
One way he saved money was through an Amazon Prime program called Kindle First, that
allowed him to download one (out of a choice of four) free book per month. Another way that he
saved money was by sharing books with his wife who received an iPad mini for Christmas.

93
Amazon allowed Rob to download extra copies of purchased eBooks to other devices of family
members listed on the same account. What Rob really liked about this feature was that he and
his wife could read the same book at the same time.
Rob related how the iPad was changing how things were done in the Air Force now as
compared to the days when he was in the service. Technical manuals could be updated without
having to go through an extensive paper distribution system and every airman could then have
instant access to the latest edition without being concerned whether an update was missed
somewhere along the way. His iPad allowed him to take advantage of the same seamless
process. He explained:
I log onto Amazon. I go to Kindle Books and find the one I want. See the price, and if
it’s [not] a decent price––I still have a lot of books here that I haven’t finished reading so
I don’t have to hurry. And I know it’s always going to be there and they do go down in
price. So if I want to download it, I click on it and say I want to buy this here. And it
goes in and it opens up my charge account to check and make sure they have the right
credit card. They do. I go ahead and say check out and it automatically comes to my
eReader right then and there. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 3,
2015)
This process worked anywhere that he had access to Wi-Fi. “If you want to go back and check
into [certain books] or finish reading them, it keeps an index of where you were at and it will
also sync that to my iPhone” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015).
Rob only used his iPhone for reading about once every two weeks, but had that capability
available when he needed it, especially when he was in a situation where he did not want to get
his iPad out. “I can use my iPhone and it will sync to the exact page that I was furthest on and

94
then I start reading there” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015).
Though many people like to order Amazon products from a bigger computer so they can either
see better or so they can order in a more secure environment, Rob opted to order directly from
his iPad about 95% of the time.
Rob had never used the Amazon chat room to inquire about the solution to a problem and
could not remember actually having a problem with his Amazon account or the Kindle app. Rob
stated that if he had a problem with a particular app, he would probably just delete the app and
reinstall it. If he could not solve the problem, he admitted that his next step would be to ask his
granddaughter.
Rob got his ideas for books from the Sunday paper, from Overdrive and from Amazon.
He had very little time for reading prior to reaching retirement age. In a discussion of what his
reading experience was like, he offered this:
I was always interested in history, geography, maps––you can only find maps in books
really and I really enjoy that. And whenever you read about something, then you can sort
of imagine what it’s like. You can take a map and look at it. And it doesn’t show you
the mountains or the plains or the cornfields and things like that. And a lot of authors do
describe that so in detail, that you just can’t do anything but exactly visualize what it’s
about. So yeah, I’ve always enjoyed reading. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 3, 2015)
Rob envisioned big changes in store for the future. Here was his take on what is to come:
I think that if a person doesn’t embrace technology, they’re leaving themselves behind.
There [are] only so many resources. There’s only so much time of the day, which is a
resource. And why spend time taking two hours to do something when technology can

95
frequently allow you to do it in just a matter of minutes? So, the retired generation,
whatever that happens to be today, needs to really know technology and embrace it
because everything is moving in technology and you’ve got to keep up with it. Ten years
ago, there was nothing like this [pointing to his iPad]. I doubt there was an iPhone 10
years ago. And see what it can do today––in things like Skype, things like FaceTime.
Dick Tracy had a watch where he could communicate with people. That was a laughable
thing when I was young. Today, it’s there––it’s there. So, you are going to have to live
with technology. It won’t be long before IP addresses will be expanded to billions and
billions as opposed to millions we have today. Our coffeepot, our refrigerators, our air
conditioners, our heat, they’re all going to have an IP address assigned to them that will
phase in over time and you set everything up with your iPhone from wherever you’re at,
to do certain things. It will be amazing. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 3, 2015)
Structural. Rob mentioned that his wife grew up poor and that his family adhered to a
very strict budget. Rob’s background (as influenced by his wife) was a factor that made him
pursue a more economical path. In this regard, as far as this study could ascertain, Rob was the
most knowledgeable and biggest user of the library’s downloadable eBooks. That being said,
there were times when Rob appeared to have splurged on a particular book that he bought from
Amazon, but not before he checked the availability and length of the waiting list for the public
library copy. In the “time is money” scenario, Rob seemed to base his decision for purchases on
reasonable assumptions about how long it would take for the eBooks to become available. Rob’s
purchase of an Amazon Prime membership also appeared to be based on the assumption that he
would get more in return than he paid in annual fees. Rob was a big proponent of eBooks and

96
got enjoyment out of sharing this experience with his wife. This joy was enhanced by the ability
to lend eBooks and to download the same copies purchased from Amazon to multiple devices
within the same family. Rob felt closer to his wife by sharing the experience of reading the same
book at the same time. In many regards, Rob was a trailblazer for technology and for eReaders.
As the oldest participant in the study, he was passionate about his iPad. He was bothered that
such a low percentage of his peers had adopted technology and particularly eReaders. He
predicted that his peers would struggle in the future if they did not learn to adapt.
Rick
Textural. Rick, age 69, came from a divided and mixed family. He grew up on the West
Coast, served in Viet Nam, and recently retired from his career as an aviation professional. As a
child, he was an avid reader. He focused on The Book of Knowledge and other works of
nonfiction to support his fondness for trivia. He “didn’t get into fiction until six or seven years
ago” and stated, “[I have] been trying to catch up ever since, so I’ve just been hooked on fiction”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 2, 2015). In particular, Rick read
“romance and romance fiction. I like a happy ending, and it just suits me, so that’s about where
I’m at right now” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 2, 2015). Rick loved to
write and publish reviews online and would love to do this professionally, perhaps in the form of
a blog, “because I’ll pat myself on the back. I’m good at it. I am! I’m good at it” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 2, 2015).
Rick believed in the idiom about teaching an old dog, new tricks. “I’m 70 years old this
year and I just got this [new iPhone 4] only about 5 or 6 months ago and I am devouring this
thing. It’s fun. So I keep up in technology as much as I can” (Personal communication with

97
interviewee, February 2, 2015). Rick’s passion for his new phone was similar to the passion he
voiced for his eReader:
It doesn’t seem like it’s only been three years. It seems a lot longer than that––but I went
onto Amazon. I have the first [eReader]––the basic [eReader], the Kindle that Amazon
sells. This is the rock bottom bare bones [eReader] Kindle. And I got that about, I
suppose, three and a half years ago and it was just a revolution to me. It was amazing. I
was working you know. I was kind of a road warrior, so I did a lot. I flew into probably
200 airports in the United States over the last 6 or 7 years. I was on the road a lot flying
around and this [Kindle] was a lifesaver––this one little thing––a couple of pounds of
this. I keep 20 or 30 books in here at one time and anywhere I was going, this eReader
went with me and when I didn’t have this eReader, I had withdrawal symptoms. I didn’t
know what I was going to do with myself. Every opportunity I got, this thing was opened
up and I was reading something. You know I was waiting in line. I would take it
everywhere. You know I would go to the motor vehicle department and stand in line––
wait, wait, wait––you know there was my [eReader]. I’d open it up and I was reading.
And I probably overdo it. I read a lot. I mean I just read constantly. (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 2, 2015)
Rick’s admiration did not stop there: “I love this thing. I can’t tell you how much this means to
me. This is an amazing tool––I don’t know what it is––fantastic” (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 2, 2015). Rick read at least two hours per day and had read an average of
two novels a week over the past three and one half years, giving him a grand total of 350 eBooks
read in that time period. He read so much that he quipped:

98
Every moment I get I’m reading, I’m reading something. You know if I’m wasting time
and have nothing else to think of that I can do or household chores or something, I’m
reading. So I’d say at least two hours a day––maybe more sometimes––sometimes less,
but quite a bit. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 2, 2015)
Later, Rick reemphasized that even household chores could not stop him from reading, as he
carried the eReader around and performed chores simultaneously.
Recently, Rick’s Kindle wore out and the battery would no longer hold a charge. He
replaced the old unit with Amazon’s “new basic, bottom of the line” model and remarked, “I am
about to write a review because I don’t like it as well” (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 2, 2015). Amazon did not “sell this [old] model anymore––[the new
model] has some features that I do not like” (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 2, 2015). Specifically, he outlined the problems as follows:
This [new] one is a touch screen. And I don’t like it because––I read––when I’m reading,
I’m touching the screen and when I touch the screen [demonstrating], it did something
and that just annoys the daylights out of me. This [old] one, you can control it from
down here [pointing]. You can touch the screen and when I’m reading at night, I’m this
way [as he demonstrates]––good leverage––I don’t get cramped. That sounds trivial, but
it works. So anyway this [old one] was perfect for my needs. This was perfect. This
[new one] is not as good. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 2, 2015)
Even with features that Rick found less desirable, he was not slowing down with the number of
books that he was reading.
Rick made his original purchase of an eReader because his online friends offered
Advanced Reader Copies (ARCs) of their ePublished books that were only available

99
electronically. He noted that ePublishing was “changing the publishing industry dramatically”
and that authors were distributing electronic ARCs “so they can get reviews and promotions
from people” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 2, 2015). The ARC system
that Rick used was organized by Amazon and required an author to submit the Kindle email
addresses for individuals on the authorized distribution list. Amazon used this information to
download the ARC onto the users’ Kindle or Kindle app. The price was right on these ARCs, as
Rick summarized:
I made a living out of being cheap. And you have no idea how many books are in here
that are free. Good books! No money! You get them instantly. [If] you don’t like
them––[if] you read a few chapters and you don’t like that––get rid of it. Put it in the
cloud and go on––move to the next one. So a lot of these are free and wonderful free
books and a lot of authors will have series of novels that they write. They’ll pop a free
one in to pique your interest in the rest of the series and I like that. You read one of those
things and that’s one of the reasons [I like it]––the availability of the stuff you can’t get
in a library, [but that] you can get on an eReader. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 2, 2015)
Rick reported reading print books from the library perhaps 10 to 20% of the time. Rick settled
for this arrangement when eBooks were not available because the price was right. Rick never
read more than one print book at a time, but occasionally had more than one eBook in progress at
the same time.
Rick referred to his ability level with technology as better than his contemporaries, but
below that of his granddaughter. He made fun of those that belittled eReaders: “They give you
that, ‘Oh, I like the feel and smell of a nice physical book that you can tangibly touch and see

100
and feel.’ . . . Give me that [pointing to his Kindle]. I’m beyond that.” He claimed to be late to
the iPhone party, but was making up for lost ground. He actively embraced technology:
So it takes me a while, but I get it and I’m interested in it you know and I am not one of
those––I hope I am not one of those old people that [says], “Naaah, I don’t want to do
this, I don’t want to do that.” I’m interested in that stuff. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 2, 2015)
Rick kept book reviews and a list of Did Not Finishes on Goodreads, a website dedicated
to tracking and recommending books. Rick downloaded his books almost exclusively from
Amazon “because they are so easy to work with,” and continued,
It’s their product and [if] you’ve got problems––Amazon––I love [the] chat room. You
can go on chat help on Amazon and I’m a chatting fool. I can crank along at 60 words
per minute. I love to chat. I can just blather away. I get a lot of information on chat
from Amazon. If you have problems or questions or a book doesn’t download, or
something happens, it gets lost somehow, I use chat. I love chat. I use my laptop and
Amazon––again––they’re excellent. I can’t say enough about Amazon. A lot of people
hate them because they are so daggone big and they’re monolithic, but they suit my needs
just fine. I like them. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 2, 2015)
Rick also used BookBub to find good deals, Austenprose for information on the works of Jane
Austen, and similar sites for information on historical, regency, and western romances. Rick
looked at the reviews, both positive and negative, when he was decided on whether to download
a book. He applied certain criteria unique to his interests:
I’m looking for: “Is this a series? In other words, is this a stand-alone read? In other
words, is this book complete in its entirety? When you get done, it’s done. Can it stand

101
by itself? Is it resolved? Or do you have to go read another one?”––because that’s one of
my main gripes. I’ve read some really good books and the authors want you to read the
entire series to get resolution on the plot, on the crisis, and all that. I hate that. I hate
that! It has to stand alone. I’m not going to read five or six books in a series. (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 2, 2015)
Rick also looked at the cost and the author reputation before he decided to purchase, download,
and read an eBook.
When Rick used his eReader, he took advantage of the library at his fingertips, the
comfort level, the convenience, the suitable travel-size dimensions, the type size and font, the
dictionaries in Spanish, French, German, and English, the bookmark feature, note-taking
capabilities, and the search function. He had never used the Internet feature on the Kindle, but
instead ordered books from a computer and designated the Kindle as the eBook download
destination. Rick loved to cook, but was unreceptive to the thought of using cookbooks on an
eReader.
If Rick had a computer problem right now, he “would be lost.” He stated:
I’d probably have to take it in to somebody. Thankfully I don’t have any [problems], but
on [the Kindle], strictly Amazon. I go straight there and I’ve had a couple of times where
I’ve had to reboot. This thing has been amazingly accurate and just efficient and
bulletproof. I’ve never had a problem with these things. They’re incredible. But I go to
Amazon. I go to the chat line and occasionally I’ll get one that––I’ll get a book that
won’t download. It will get lost. [I] just will go in and I will type let’s say, “Can you
help me find this?” They’ll say, “Do you have the title of the book?” And they’ll say,
“Okay, I don’t see that.” And they are very forgiving and very liberal. Occasionally they

102
won’t even see it at all and they’ll just give it to you. They’ll just say, “Okay, it’s on
your list. Go ahead. You can download it now.” I like that. (Personal communication
with interviewee, February 2, 2015)
Rick had never had any hardware problems with his device, except for the battery and the
charger as both accessories grew older. He described his eReader as his “entertainment lifeline.”
Rick rendered some additional written praise: “My Kindle is the single most-loved and widely
used electronic product I have ever had the pleasure to use. A best bang for the buck. Not ‘old
school’ when it comes to eReaders!” (Personal communication with interviewee, December 3,
2014)
Rick always kept a sufficient number of eBooks on his device. He transferred the books
to the cloud when he was finished with them. With one click, he had the ability to transfer a
book from the cloud back to the Kindle. Rick used the Manage Your Content and Devices link
on Amazon to observe the complete list of books that he had read. He also used the link to loan
books (including ARCs) to other family members.
Structural. Rick used his eReader more than anyone else in the study, yet seemed to
hold the title of most economical as well. He purchased his Kindle as the bottom of the line
model, and made a similar purchase when the first unit died. Many of the books Rick read were
ARCs. Reading these books provided him not only with free entertainment, but also with a sense
of accomplishment, knowing that he was among the first to experience a particular book. Rick
did not belong to Amazon Prime because of the added cost and did not use the library’s eBook
collection, though he might have been able to save a little money that way. He liked to find free
or 99-cent copies available on Amazon. Rick did take advantage of lending books to other
family members via his Amazon account, a procedure that did not save him any money, but that

103
saved money for the recipients of his generosity. Rick’s use of a single-function eReader
allowed him to concentrate on his passion for reading. His pleasure reading tastes had swayed to
fiction over the last seven years or so, and Rick was left feeling like he had a lot of ground to
make up and a lot of eBooks that needed to be read. Rick was subject to some ridicule, including
some from his own family, based on his inkling for romantic novels, but did not feel the need to
justify himself to anyone concerning his reading preferences. Rick dreamed of making a decent
living by writing book reviews, hopeful of the assumption that reviews written by a man
regarding romance novels might give him a niche for a healthy following. Rick preferred decent
books that stood alone, or that were resolved without the need for a sequel. This preference may
have had its genesis in Rick’s attempt to resolve, understand, or come to terms with growing up
in a mixed family in a liberal part of the country. Rick was excited about reading romances on
the Kindle. However, he was equally disappointed with his attempts to access the Bible on the
Kindle as the electronic format worked well for reading, but not for studying. Rick’s expertise
with technology ranked him ahead of his peers. If asked, Rick was able to provide an extremely
long list of benefits of his eReader, including cost and convenience that proved in his mind, why
this was his “single most-loved” electronic product.
Linda
Textural. At the time this study was conducted, Linda was a 55-year-old female who
served as a school guidance counselor. She recalled that “DOS was never easy but I kind of
found my way around DOS” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015). She
was intrigued by computer programming in high school, but “couldn’t do it past a certain point”
(Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015). She experienced a steep, but
successful technology learning curve when she worked at a radio station and was asked to

104
digitize the entire music library. She remembered teaching herself how to use Microsoft
Windows when that product was developed. When she began working in a school setting, she
became responsible for the upkeep of the Apple machines. In terms of more recent technology,
she admitted to knowing very little about the developments surrounding apps and tablets. To be
more specific, the apps irritated her and she “could not understand how they function and why
they were different from having a driver and having a program. To me, that was short, sweet,
simple, to the point” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015). But
technology changed and Linda reported, “[I was] dragged kicking and screaming into the apps
age and I still don’t understand it” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30,
2015). She reasoned, “[I own] a two-in-one computer so that I can touch stuff when I want to
and I’m comfortable with it and I can go back to the regular computer when I feel most
comfortable doing that” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015). Linda
was the participant in the study that most embodied the stereotypical argument against eReaders
because of a love for the smell of books. She enhanced this description:
I love walking into an old bookstore: There’s one in Atlanta where I love to go. It’s an
old house. I love to go walking in there and smell the binders, the leather, and the
cardboard that they use now, and all that, just something fascinating about disappearing
into another world. (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015)
However, in spite of this love for print books, Linda investigated the use of an eReader:
So when eReaders came out, to me again, it was just flat and to me it was not a book––
the ability to turn pages, the ability to have the pictures and things in the book, the cover
of the book slick and shiny. All of that appealed to me quite a bit as an avid reader. And

105
then I guess, I thought, I’m going to give this a try. (Personal communication with
interviewee, January 30, 2015)
Linda went on to describe how her initial misgivings about eBooks gave way to an attitude that
promoted the exclusive use of eBooks. Then Linda explained how she had made the full
transformation from a “print-book”-centric view of the world to that of a fully convinced
eReader owner.
When Linda’s original Kindle needed to be replaced, she realized that reading eBooks on
an eReader was more than just a fad for her. She upgraded to a Kindle Paperwhite and reported
how the features supported her lifestyle:
I got a replacement Kindle because I love the Paperwhite, because I can read it in the sun,
[and] because the whole essence of my being was born to be on the beach, in the sun,
reading books. So that allows me to do that. So when I would take my phone or take
other computer devices, the backlighting was not good and you were fighting that all the
time. If you were wearing sunglasses in the sun, you can’t read any of the other stuff.
But the Kindle, especially when they came out with the Paperwhite, is the stark contrast
that I need to be able to read in the sun and that sold me. (Personal communication with
interviewee, January 30, 2015)
Linda continued raving about how she liked the touchscreen and the long battery life, going two
to three weeks on a charge. Though reluctant about the touchscreen when she bought her
original Kindle, she was ready to adopt this feature when she upgraded to a new Kindle.
Linda described her reasoning for a single-function eReader instead of a multi-function
tablet and related this to her former career in radio. When a part malfunctioned in a stereo
system, Linda changed the wayward component without having to replace the entire system. If

106
her single-function eReader died, she wanted the capability to replace the problem component
with another single-function component, another eReader, just like she used to do during her
stereo system days. In short, she preferred a single-function eReader like her Kindle, much like
the individual single-function components of a stereo system. She wanted a computer for
computing, a phone for calling and texting and “a book to read. It doesn’t need to tap dance. It
just needs to read” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015). She
reiterated, “I want the reader just to be a book. It’s a book in electronic form and I don’t want it
to do anything else” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015). Her habits
included reading approximately 17 hours per week at bedtime and on the weekends. She
anticipated that the hours would double or triple when school let out for the summer and would
increase even more once she was able to retire in 4.5 years. Linda did not like feeling the
pressure of having to return library eBooks. Therefore, she took advantage of the shopping
function on the Paperwhite and said, “I get almost everything off of Amazon because that’s the
Kindle home. There’s nothing that I’ve not been able to find that I’ve wanted” (Personal
communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015). She mostly read what she referred to as
cozy mysteries with an occasional comedy, particularly romantic comedy. She focused on light
reading to escape the burdens of her job as a counselor. Linda did not belong to a book club, in
part because she considered her selections to be ones that other people would not consider to be
deep and worthy of discussion. Linda said that she might recommend a book to someone,
but other than that, I get what I get out of it. I guess I feel like I’m smart enough that
when I read a book I get what I get out of it and I don’t need to chew it over with
somebody else. (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015)

107
Linda had a group of authors that she had grown to enjoy and looked for new books being
written by them. She also believed that Amazon had her figured out and made decent
recommendations on her behalf. She usually read only one book at a time, but if she was reading
a print book and left the copy somewhere, she would likely start another book in the meanwhile.
Linda took advantage of the settings on her Kindle to adjust the font size and the contrast
but did not use the brightness control or the experimental browser available on the device. She
really liked that she could
just slap that thing in [her] purse. I know I’ve got choices of books that I can read. If I
were doing just print books, I would have to fit the book in the purse or take it with me
and the eReader is just a slim volume and it never changes. You can download a 2000page book or you can download a 500-page book and it’s going to stay the same.
(Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015)
She tried to find low-cost books from good authors and typically downloaded via her phone, then
transferred the eBook to her eReader when she returned home. This meant that Linda could have
used her phone to read, but instead used it strictly as a back-up plan. Her phone represented a
potential platform for listening to audio books, but Linda did not do this because, as she stated,
books allow me to interject my own interpretations and if somebody else is reading it,
their inflection, their tone of voice, the sound of their voice interferes with that. To me,
that’s irritating. But then, I’m ADHD. So a lot of things are irritating that wouldn’t be to
a “normal” brained person. (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015)
Linda’s interview ended with a discussion about the future. Her training and career as a
school counselor gave her some interesting insights:

108
I say this because the analogy fits really, really well because technology is improving
almost at the speed of light. [The] human need to do things faster and more and better is
driven by that speed of light and we are going to spin so fast because of our humanness
versus what we’ve created in technology. We are going to go around and around and
around. We are going to spin ourselves to butter. I don’t know if you ever remember
that reference, but there was a book way back in the day called Little Black Sambo and,
whether that’s politically correct or not, it was a book and it did talk about the tigers
chasing each other around this tree faster and faster and faster and faster until they turn to
butter. And that’s what I feel like we are doing as a society because of technology. It’s
supposed to be helping us do what we already do. It’s not supposed to force more and
more and more on us because . . . the technology has not been making it easier, it’s just
making more choices, if that makes sense. It’s not so much that it is going to alleviate––
it’s just going to give us the ability to put something else in its place. So if we could go
back to the old way of doing things before technology existed and then use technology
just for those things, our lives would be much more. We would be much slower paced,
we would be probably much less stressed with ourselves and as a world in general. . . .
We would still have the beauty of the technology. But people think that’s okay
because . . . you can put everything in the computer now. You should have more free
time to do this, this, and this as well, so I’m going to give you that hat to wear and it
overwhelms us and I think that’s where we are. We’re overwhelmed. We’re an
overwhelmed nation trying to do all of this in the name of technology when I think we
need to take a step back and say, “Let’s just stop here and let’s just do this and use
technology to make it better, not make it pile more on us.” It was supposed to help us

109
with the workload that we had––not make the workload so that we could double it. That
didn’t accomplish anything except that now we are compressed. We’re working in a
compressed atmosphere. (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015)
Linda got to experience the pressure of society and got to hear about it from other people in her
job as a counselor. In Linda’s opinion, technology was both good and bad. Coming from this
viewpoint, Linda felt personally frustrated with seniors that refused to learn and she did not
understand this mentality. She hoped that she would never sour toward learning about new
technologies.
Structural. Linda grew up in a time when females were not encouraged to go into math
and science careers. She was intrigued by computer science and got some experience in the
field, but not as much experience, and definitely not as much encouragement, as her male
counterparts. She experienced just enough to get her feet wet, but in many regards, she was not
quite ready to jump in to the deep end. It was like an out-of-body experience or an outsidelooking-in experience that kept her almost up to date on technology, but leery of its excessive
influence. Linda’s former career at a radio station and present career as a school counselor had
provided her with a unique perspective toward the use of eReaders. Even though she mentioned
her love for the “smell of books,” she saw her friends using eReaders and was willing to give
eBooks fair shots instead of relying on any preconceived notions. Linda hedged her bets by
purchasing a bottom-end Kindle, but when she sought out a replacement, she was ready to pay a
little more for a Paperwhite, specifically for the features that gave her the ability to read
outdoors, a place where she spent a lot of time. The replacement Kindle represented her
continued preference toward a single-function device, much like the single-function components
of an old stereo system. Linda downplayed her technical ability, but seemed to know more than

110
she let on. For instance, she claimed that she bought the eReader as a stand-alone device, but she
was savvy enough to know how to sync between her devices. This allowed her to use the phone
as a backup reader if necessary. Linda’s choice of cozy mysteries and easy reads represented an
escape from the heavy burdens carried by those who hold positions such as guidance counselors.
The convenience of an eReader allowed Linda to immediately get started on a book when she
faced an obstacle like a long wait at the doctor’s office. Linda’s goal of retirement followed by
full-time beach reading was within her sights and she tried to ensure that she kept up, if only
somewhat, with the current technology. Linda stated that she was “not left-brained,” but that she
“gets left-brained stuff,” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015),
something that hinted at her ability as a counselor to relate to others. Linda’s most interesting
introspection related to how she envisioned the future. She felt that technology was out of
control and that it had begun to control people instead of people controlling it. Though she
would have liked to have seen some additions, like bringing color E Ink technology to the mass
market, she was worried about two things––seniors that refused to learn and her own self if she
got to that point. Her feelings were influenced while watching her own aging parents deal with
technology. Meanwhile, she continued to bide her time until her beach reading days could begin
in earnest.
Debbie
Textural. When this study occurred, Debbie was a 63-year-old retired archivist and
special librarian who worked under the title of independent scholar. She had a Master of Library
Science degree and volunteered at the local library one day a week. She read the local paper,
was active in the community, and had owned a home computer since 1983. While serving as a
college librarian, Debbie also ran an online book business. Debbie was a self-proclaimed

111
bibliophile and grew up in a home with thousands of print books. Even with all the books,
Debbie made a weekly trip to the library with her father. Debbie’s family members read to her
until she learned to read by herself.
Debbie’s first exposure to eBooks came when a book she wanted was available only in an
electronic format. She downloaded the Kindle app to her computer and purchased the eBook
from Amazon. She continued using eBooks as reference resources and at one point wrote a blog
post for her Georgia photographers’ documentation project with details “about eBooks that were
available for photo history research” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6,
2015). Debbie described the beauty of the Kindle app as a tool for gathering “all these reference
books together and . . . that’s sort of [the] key to not only my research, but also my writing”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015).
Debbie had the Kindle app on her desktop, Mac, iPad, and iTouch, and added a dedicated
eReader to her collection, a Kindle Paperwhite, about 1 year ago. She planned to upgrade from a
flip phone to an iPhone in the very near future.
Debbie owned a variety of electronic devices, but yet was a meticulous note taker, using
“good old paper in a notebook” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015).
She elaborated:
I’ve kept a list of everything I’ve read, since 1992. And this past year, using . . . my
Paperwhite, I’ve read 46 books as opposed to max 25 in years before. So I’m reading
twice as much probably––not always good things––I’m reading a lot of things that I
never would have picked up otherwise, but some things that I am pleased that I did.
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015)

112
Debbie read print books in addition to eBooks and alternated between the two options. Her
collection of hardbacks stored on a To Read bookshelf and acquired over the years left her with
an abundance of reading to do in the more traditional format.
Debbie’s bibliophile nature carried over to eBooks: “I am as bad about gathering eBooks
as I am about gathering hardbacks, which is a terrible vice. It really is. I mean I’ve been trying
to clear out things” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). After closing
her online book business, Debbie attempted to pare down not only her print book collection, but
also her eBook collection. She maintained 70 eBooks in folders with labels like Genealogy,
Photo History, and Books to Review, and had another folder labeled I’ll Never Read This with a
current total of three or four titles. Paring down her eBook collection was a relative term: It
really meant, “I send them back to the cloud. They’re not deleted. I mean they are not resident
on my Kindle, but they are still in the folder whether they are in the cloud, because I’m not
deleting anything” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). If there was a
book that Debbie remembered downloading, but she could not find it on her Kindle or in the
cloud, she checked her iPad under iBooks. The iPad served as the storage location of choice,
particularly for cookbooks. The larger screen on the iPad was handy for displaying recipes in the
kitchen when preparing food for a meal. Previously, Debbie and her husband checked out
certain hardcopy editions of cookbooks from the local library. They liked them so much that
they purchased the same books in electronic form for use on the iPad.
The type of reading dictated what device Debbie used: “The things that I will read on my
computer that are in the Kindle app are generally reference books. Otherwise if it is a novel or a
biography, or even nonfiction––general nonfictional––I’ll read it on the Paperwhite” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). For research, as an example, Debbie used

her iPad so that she could look at high resolution copies of archived newspapers of the Digital
Library of Georgia. For pleasure reading, Debbie occasionally had a fiction and a nonfiction
book going simultaneously, but she preferred fiction and usually read only one book at a time.
Debbie was addicted to reading in bed, but was concerned about the noise caused by pageturning and the distraction of a book light. The Kindle solved these problems and kept Debbie
from driving her “husband crazy” because, as she explained, “I would read far into the night and
sometimes if I’m not sleepy, I’d sit up and read again” (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 6, 2015). Debbie’s eBook reading in bed was initially done on an iPad,
but she had switched to the Paperwhite for the advantages it offered: “I love the Paperwhite
because, if you’re going to read in bed, which I generally do, it’s the best thing. You don’t have
all that ambient light,” and it was “better on the eyes” (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 6, 2015).
Debbie admitted to “lusting” after the eReader when she saw it in the stores and made
strong hints until her husband gave her one. “And this year I bought my husband one. You see
he gave me one and he kept borrowing it and he kept saying, ‘Oh, I don’t need one,’ and I said,
‘Yes you do, you keep borrowing mine’” (Personal communication with interviewee, February
6, 2015).
Debbie got her eBooks from several sources. She downloaded one eBook from Google
Play for her photographer research project because that was the only source in which the book
was available. She had also downloaded eBooks using an app for classic titles that she used on
her iTouch.
It’s this great little app called Classic Books and it’s got all these wonderful books, Jane
Austen and Mark Twain, and all the classics and it has this wonderful––you hit it and it

114
makes this page noise [makes page turning sound]. You can do it otherwise, but I just
thought this was so neat. And plus, you see the little books. So that was probably the
first thing I had outside the Kindle app on the computer that was actually the “touch”
kind of thing. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015)
Her iBook collection on the iPad stood at “10 or 15, fairly low, maybe 20 with cookbooks”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015), and Apple was her primary
source for eBooks until she was given a Kindle Paperwhite. The iPad, with the iBooks app and
the Kindle app, was still her viewer of choice for research, especially when there were maps,
photographs, or illustrations that needed to be enlarged to provide better detail. When Debbie
was reading for pleasure, the Paperwhite was what she used. Amazon was her primary source
for eBooks and her Kindle collection totaled between 150 and 200 titles. Debbie prided herself
in being cheap and said that she rarely purchased eBooks, but did pick up one or two titles per
week that were recommended by BookBub. She had a Twitter handle that referenced her
research interests and she picked up recommendations from this account that
basically revolve[d] around my research which involves genealogy to a great degree, so I
get ideas from other people. A lot of them have to do with books about family and often
an author will put their book out there for free for 24 hours or something and it’s
something that I wanted especially. And that’s where I find some of these books, the
reference books I use. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015)
Debbie only considered inexpensive options:
Free and you know I’d say I have been known to spend as much as 3 dollars and 99 cents
[laughing]. It goes from free to 3 dollars and 99 cents, although I am possibly going to
spend 5 dollars and 99 cents for something I want [laughing]. That’s something

115
practically unheard of––my husband just laughs at me every time because I am such a
tightwad. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015)
Another way that Debbie saved money was through her Amazon Prime membership, where she
took advantage of the Amazon Lending Library and the Kindle First program. In the Lending
Library, members borrow one free book per calendar month, but Debbie did not always
download an eBook every month. For purchases, Debbie did most of her ordering on her iPad,
and then transferred Amazon downloads to her Kindle at night. The one exception was with the
Lending Library because of the Amazon requirement to download directly to the intended
device. Debbie used Kindle First more because that program provided members with the
ownership rights to the digital copies of eBooks. Debbie reported that Amazon allowed her to
choose one of four Editors’ Picks per month, but that Amazon had increased the offer to two free
books for the preceding 2 months, “which is another reason my Books to Read collection
continues to grow––because I cannot refuse anything that’s free. But I do read the reviews. I
read all the reviews before I’ll download it” (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 6, 2015). Debbie had checked out audiobooks from the public library online collection,
but had never checked out an eBook there. Debbie downloaded sample books on occasion, and
pointed out that one of her eBooks advertised as a few free chapters, actually downloaded as the
entire copy of the book. She said that this saved her 2 dollars and 99 cents over the regularly
listed purchase price and allowed her to discard an older edition print copy of the reference book.
Debbie did not read magazines on her Kindle, but had friends that did.
Debbie described the download experience: “It couldn’t be easier. I generally do 1-Click
from Amazon because I’ve got everything set up” (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 6, 2015). That was what Debbie liked––the ease of ordering and reading. What she

116
disliked was the location of the power button on her Paperwhite. It was located on the bottom of
the device, and sometimes the button was depressed accidently when the Paperwhite was resting
in her lap. Another problem, as mentioned earlier, was the requirement to be logged in on the
receiving device before downloading a book from the Lending Library. If the book could be
returned via computer, Debbie questioned why the eBook could not be selected using another
device like her iPad. Debbie rated her technical ability as “beginning advanced.” She was “way
past beginner, but as I said, compared to younger people, who have been using it since they
learned to walk, I would say I am pre-advanced” (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 6, 2015). Compared to her peers, she was “more adept.” When Debbie bought her
iPad at a local store, the purchase included several free computer lessons. When Debbie had a
problem, she could go in for a lesson, but she was able to figure out most things on her own. As
an example of her abilities, the one time that she was unable to solve a Kindle problem, she went
to the Amazon chat room and found her solution because a similar question had already been
posted and answered.
Features that Debbie liked included the Change the Light option on the Kindle. She also
liked the long battery life. She had to charge the battery about “every other month, since I’m not
reading for hours on end like a lot of people do who use it. I’m just not in that situation”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). Debbie used the X-Ray function,
a feature in newer eBooks that helped her keep track of book characters. She discovered
highlighting and note taking by accident, but used the functions only rarely, say for an occasional
quote. She mentioned seeing faint highlights in eBooks representing what others had shared.
Debbie contemplated what this meant while formulating an answer during her interview and

117
wondered aloud about how she could use this function to more of her advantage in future
endeavors. Meanwhile, an obvious feature to point out was the ability to increase the font size:
I think it’s incredibly important the older you get. . . . I think it’s a huge advantage for
older people and for people with vision problems. I think that eReaders are the answer.
It makes it a big difference to people who otherwise couldn’t read. . . . It’s more than [a]
large print book; you can even be bigger than that [as she points]. (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015)
Of interest was the fact that Debbie did not see a problem with the use of a small screen device
like an iTouch: “It doesn’t bother me. It never has; it still doesn’t. And sometimes if I am not
sleepy, I will grab my iTouch” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015).
And the device was used for longer sessions too: “I have read entire books on flights on my
iTouch. It doesn’t bother me because I can bump the type up and everything else; it just never
bothered me” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015).
Debbie tried to convince her friends of the benefits of an eReader: “Although I talk it up
all the time . . . I also have a lot of friends that are even older than I am and are absolutely against
the idea” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). Some of her friends
were violently opposed to eReaders. Other acquaintances had adopted an approach of using
eReaders only when traveling. Debbie estimated that 10% of her friends used eReaders. “They
are pretty much all readers, but only a few of them are using eReaders––that I know of––I could
be wrong about that––that I’m aware of” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6,
2015). She concluded:
But, to me it’s a sort of all-around thing and I can’t see saving it for only travel or saving
it for only this or that. But you know, to me it is part of the whole package, since I do

118
sync everything and use it all somehow. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 6, 2015)
Structural. Debbie’s encounter with the world of eReaders and eBooks was approached from a
different background than that of others that participated in the study. Educated in the field of
librarianship, employed as a librarian, and self-employed as an online bookseller, one could
argue that Debbie had the most to lose from the eBook industry. However, Debbie had owned a
computer since 1983, had done some website design in HTML and had developed numerous
databases. As a result of this exposure to technology, Debbie had actively embraced the world of
eBooks. Her take on books had expanded beyond viewing them as physical objects in print form
only. Debbie saw the reference eBooks as valuable sources of information for her research and
received pleasure from reading fiction eBooks at bedtime. Debbie was able to borrow one book
per month for free from the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library, but her Amazon Prime
membership did require an annual fee. Her preference for Kindle First suggested that she desired
ownership and therefore lifetime use of the eBooks she downloaded. Debbie put her library
skills to use and had a more organized scheme than others in regards to how books were filed on
her Kindle. She even had a folder labeled I’ll Never Read This, backing up her claim that she
was a bibliophile and that she had a hard time letting go of books, even if they existed only as
electronic copies. As a librarian, Debbie knew libraries have limited space and that weeding an
old collection is required prior to the arrival of new books. However, Debbie was also trained as
an archivist, tasked with preserving books. It was this background that slowed Debbie down
from the outright purging of both books and eBooks. Debbie confessed that her hobbies fed her
bibliomania and that her book use was “already way out there” (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 6, 2015). Debbie claimed to purchase books rarely, but stated in the same

119
breath that she got one to two books per week from BookBub. From a librarian point-of-view,
she was correct. However, from a relative standpoint, she was adding books to her collection
faster than most of the other participants. Debbie did limit how much she spent, employed her
keen librarian skills, did a thorough review before purchasing, and was always on the lookout for
free books that were advertised during a short, sometimes 24-hour window. Debbie provided the
best example of how she used her various eReaders. The iPad was used for research––
particularly when she needed to look at photos or maps––and for a cooking reference when she
was in the kitchen. The iTouch was used as a matter of convenience, when lying in bed or when
on a plane flight. The Paperwhite served its purpose as a leisure reading device at bedtime. She
was disappointed that more of her friends did not share the same passion for eReader use that she
did. Debbie’s pending purchase of an iPhone signified that she was completely sold on the
advantages of technology. She felt that eReaders were “all-the-time” devices, not just for special
occasions like vacations. Even as she was interviewed, Debbie pondered aloud about how she
could better incorporate the highlighting and note taking functions of her eReader. Even
Debbie’s background as a librarian did not deter her from evaluating new technology for what it
was and for how it could be used to her full advantage.
Carol
Textural. At the time of this study, Carol was a 53-year-old stay-at-home mom, former
seamstress, and “do-it-yourselfer.” When asked how she fit into the community, she replied, “I
don’t––I don’t think I fit in terribly well here” (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 6, 2015), indicating that her political leanings made her different from other
community members. Technology-wise, she considered herself “above average” compared to
other individuals in her age group and more knowledgeable than most of her friends, but

120
“compared to the kids––my children and their friends––like I’m way behind the time” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). Carol said approximately 50% of her
friends used eReaders and she read less than some of them. She did not know how her friends
found the time to read so much. Carol seemed to have always adapted well to the latest
technology, as she listed electronic devices that she had owned over the years including
computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, mp3 players, PalmPilots and eReaders.
Carol’s original eReader was a Barnes & Noble NOOK. After it was damaged, she
settled on a Samsung Galaxy Tab, taking advantage of the NOOK app, though her preference for
this app has since been superseded by the Kindle app. She used the NOOK for 8 to 10 hours per
week. When Carol switched devices, the amount of time she used electronics remained the
same, but some of her reading time gave way to game-playing time. She downloaded one of
Diana Gabaldon’s eBooks onto her Kindle app and bought the whole series when she realized
that she liked being able to read a 3-pound book on a much lighter device. Carol’s eBooks
synced between her phone and her tablet, but she did not read on her phone, though she had
tested it. She had also tested the tethering of her Wi-Fi-only tablet and had gotten 4G access via
her cell phone plan.
Carol took advantage of the functions that allowed her to change the font size and the line
spacing in her NOOK, though she was not as certain about how to do this on her tablet. This
feature was particularly important because, as Carol explained,
I have Visual Field Deficits, and it makes it easier for me to read narrow columns. So
sometimes I’ll do that and I change from day to night mode [and] periodically adjust the
brightness and the text size. I’ve got it a little larger than normal for most folks.
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015)

121
The Reading mode was
supposed to make it easier to read text. It just says, “The screen is optimized for reading,
only available in selected applications.” And so far I haven’t found an application where
I see it makes a difference, but I haven’t tried very hard either. That’s something I should
do. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015)
She used the dictionary “a lot” and made use of the notes and highlight functions when reading
Gabaldon’s books “because she uses Gaelic terms that I don’t understand. So I’ll stop and look
them up and take a little note, so if I ever go back, I can have that translation there” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). She noted that the Gaelic words were
not in the built-in dictionary, so that’s something that bothers me about [the Galaxy Tab]
. . . . At least on the NOOK when I would look up something in their built-in dictionary––
if it didn’t have it––I had the option to go search on the web and in [the Galaxy Tab] I
have to get out of the program or go to a separate browser to do it rather than just click a
button within the program. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015)
The NOOK was better in this regard because if a word was not in the internal dictionary, the
NOOK would ask if the reader wanted to search the web. Carol liked the ability to have
access to tons of books without it taking up tons of space in the house. I don’t have to
dust all of that stuff and store all of that stuff and lug it around and move it. And I like
when you want to read something heavy, not to have to hold something that weighs, you
know like 6 pounds, whereas this weighs what?––16 ounces?––12 ounces?––something
like that. . . . It’s also nice that you don’t have to have a book light to read at night so I
don’t disturb my husband who’s lying in bed next to me. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 6, 2015)

122
Carol’s Visual Field Deficits led her to try the text-to-speech function called Kindle Read to
You, but she had not used this function except in a test with a children’s book. Her test
confirmed the audio was not robotic and actually sounded “pretty good. I remember hearing a
fairly decent woman’s voice. And I think every once in a while you get a word that’s a little
off––kind of like your GPS mispronounces things from time to time” (Personal communication
with interviewee, February 6, 2015). Carol was happy with the size of the device and the
convenience that it afforded. Carol described the disadvantage of the tablet as being “harder for
me to focus and I’m not quite sure why that is––maybe the glare. There are times I find it a little
harder to focus on words” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). When
asked if the Kindle Paperwhite might be a viable alternative to cut down on the glare, Carol
agreed, but then realized that she would lose the ability to do the other things (including games)
that she has grown to love.
In an effort to reduce clutter, Carol has discarded many of her crochet, knitting, and craft
books. In their place, she had stored the patterns and related instructions in her tablet, so that she
had constant access to what she needed:
Sometimes I feel like that’s not a good thing, because I don’t have to remember stuff so
much. And I feel like I’m losing my memory [laughing] as I get older and as my
hormones suggest. And I think I should be taxing it more and maybe you know along the
lines if you don’t use it, you lose it thing. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 6, 2015)
As part of her war on clutter, Carol exclaimed,

123
I’m just sick of having paper around. I’m inundated with it. It’s time to get rid of it, so I
read most everything on the eReader, on my laptop, and I don’t really read that much
paper stuff anymore. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015)
However, if given the choice between an eBook and a print book, Carol leaned toward a certain
preference:
I probably would pick up the book to read it unless it weighed a ton, because I just find
it’s easier on my eyes. But I keep [trudging] away and trying to get used to this thing,
and because I don’t want to have all the books around. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 6, 2015)
As a stay-at-home mom, active in her children’s activities at school, Carol had found little time
to read over the years. She reported the need for “quiet time to read and I didn’t have that either
when the kids were young” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015).
Since her children were grown now, she had extra time to dedicate to reading. Her current
interest was primarily fiction:
So I’ll read. I’ll try to keep up with one fiction book at a time. Fiction I like, historical
fiction is probably my favorite and if I need something really easy I might go for
historical romance. That doesn’t tax my brain too much. It’s good bedtime reading and
there’s some nonfiction that I pick up periodically, a self-help book or something.
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015)
Carol did not download eBooks from the public library because “I have a hard time
finishing reading them in the amount of time allotted and they don’t allow me to renew most of
the time” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). The Georgia
Download Destination library system, powered by Overdrive, required early NOOK users to

124
download software to a computer, download the eBook to the computer, connect the NOOK to a
computer using a wire, and then execute the transfer. The extra steps increased the odds of a
problem occurring and Carol saw more than her fair share of problems.
Carol did not belong to a book club. Ideas for books to read came from the public radio
station that she listened to in the mornings. When she volunteered at the library, she observed
what others were reading and kept a list of Books to Read on her phone. She also had tried to fill
her tablet with a collection of free books. Other book recommendations came from vendors like
Barnes & Noble and Amazon: “You know, once you get your eReader, they’ll say, ‘Well, you
know we have this free on this day,’ and then various websites mention things” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). She listed Good Books as one such source,
then stated: “Barnes & Noble has something, a free section or a free offering every Friday, that I
was very religious about going and checking and downloading whether I thought I’d read it or
not” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). And when Carol went onto
the Amazon website “to look for something––something always pops up” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). She obtained most of her books through
Amazon and Barnes & Noble.
Contrasting the problems associated with the library download website, Carol bragged
about the positive downloading experience on vendor websites:
It’s just gotten so easy. Type into the search bar what you’re looking for and up pops
your choices. And usually, if I find something I want to read on Amazon, I’ll go over to
Barnes & Noble and check the price there too, to see if they have it or if it’s on sale and
then I’ll make my decision. And just click buy and it automatically comes out of my
checking account and the next thing you know it pops up on the screen. It’s just easier

125
than, much easier than it used to be. (Personal communication with interviewee, February
6, 2015)
Carol had spent as much as 15 dollars on an eBook. She was willing to try sample chapters from
eBooks and would almost certainly elect to purchase the entire book “if it’s good, and it’s under
5 dollars. . . . If it’s under 10 [dollars], maybe I would most of the time wait for it to go on sale”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). Carol had the opportunity to read
in places like the doctor’s office, but did not seem as convincing about the amount of time that
she engaged in reading.
Carol’s husband had not adopted an eReader, so if Carol needed assistance, she would
turn to her son or to her daughter’s ex-boyfriend. After a software upgrade, Carol’s son had to
help her find which menu a particular function was listed under because Carol did not “always
understand what’s going to get filed under what heading” (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 6, 2015). She was reluctant to use chat room help sessions because of her
inability to type quickly. That being said, she was aware that she really had nothing to fear
because she realized “that these days, they’re so used to seeing people misspell and mess
everything up because I get lots of texts that way myself” (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 6, 2015).
Carol seemed to have experienced more problems than other participants in this study.
She had experimented with handwriting analysis programs with mixed results as she looked for
effective ways to take notes for the books she read. Pencil and paper still seemed to work better
and they helped to reduce her frustration. Her vision issues caused problems and Carol was
particularly affected by screen glare. Print books still worked better for her except when in dark
rooms, when the print size was too small, or when the printed columns were too wide. The

126
touchscreen on Carol’s tablet created a problem when it was tapped by accident because there
was no place to rest her thumb. Carol put her do-it-yourself sewing skills to good use and
designed a case for her tablet that she could slip her hand into. Carol came up with the idea
when she saw model cases online for other eReaders, but not one for her own.
Carol’s view of the future was shaped by her parents. She saw that her mom was unable
to remember how to do things on the computer unless she practiced some form of daily
repetition. Meanwhile, she felt her father could benefit from “more tactile entry keys. When
you get a completely flat screen and somebody happens to have a vision problem, that’s not
going to work for them as well as being able to feel some buttons” (Personal communication
with interviewee, February 6, 2015). She realized that “young kids would find them in the way,”
but wished that more electronic devices were made with seniors’ needs in mind:
Bigger buttons––more tactile stuff––better speakers––like this one has a little speaker on
the back that comes out the back and if you really want to hear––it’s not very loud––you
have to put headphones in to really hear it you know and that’s okay––it actually sounds
great with headphones. . . . You sort of have to dumb it down in a way and offer less
options. That’s a problem. My mom wants to learn how to do everything my sister does
on her smart phone but she can’t figure out how to use the most basic interface. So she
can’t do all the complicated stuff because she doesn’t want to learn all the basics yet,
because it just takes her so long, the poor lady. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 6, 2015)
Carol’s experiences made her more cognizant of the struggles others were going through.
Structural. Carol started her interview by stating that she did not fit into her community,
making her an outlier compared to other participants in this study. The community viewed her

127
differently and she viewed the community differently, both literally and figuratively. Carol was
resourceful and industrious and looked for ways to solve problems. When she touched the
screen by accident while reading, she realized that a form-fitted case would solve the problem.
When she could not purchase a case from the Internet, she made one herself. Therefore, Carol
was a problem solver, but she was unable to solve the problem she experienced with screen
glare. Carol experimented with the Kindle Read to You function as a way of addressing the
issue, but this had not worked and she was contemplating the purchase of a Kindle Paperwhite.
The problem with the Paperwhite was Carol developed an interest in games that were available
for tablets and she would miss out on the dual functionality of the device if she went with a
single-purpose eReader. Even if this one problem was solved, Carol was likely to remain as an
outlier because of the numerous problems she experienced, most of which were related to her
vision problem. Carol used the settings on her eReader like font size, column width, and line
spacing to compensate for her medical condition. Often she gave up on reading and used her
tablet to play games. When she did read, she was a frequent user of a Gaelic dictionary because
there were so many Gaelic terms used by her favorite author. For reading, she preferred a print
book because it was easier to view. Compared to others in this study, Carol had one of the
broader ranges of knowledge on various forms of technology. This broad knowledge was offset
by a limited depth of knowledge on specific devices. Carol put in an extreme amount of effort
and part of the problem that she experienced may have been a function of how early she adopted
technology. Beta-testers are especially aware of this phenomenon. NOOK owners like Carol
had a difficult time downloading library books through Georgia Download Destination,
especially in the early stages of the rollout. When Carol volunteered at the library once a week,
she saw what other patrons were checking out and added those book titles to a list that she kept

128
on her phone. Carol’s own medical condition made her more sympathetic to individuals with
struggles. Carol read less than other individuals in this study as a result of her Visual Field
Deficits condition and as a result of the distractions caused by the games on her tablet. Carol
viewed eReaders differently from most people and looked at issues from others’ points of view.
For her mom, she witnessed a need for repetition in learning computer technology. For her dad,
she saw a need for more tactile keys. Carol was aware of her own ailments and these issues
caused her to look at things with a more sympathetic heart, lessons that may apply to other
similarly situated seniors.
Mary
Textural. Mary, age 51, retired from the USAF Reserves and at the time of this study
was employed as a flight surgeon for the FAA. She reported, “I’m in a bunch of different
communities” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015), and described a
long and in-depth list: She worked in the aviation medicine field, volunteered as an assistant
scoutmaster and a crew advisor for the Boy Scouts, served as a district health supervisor,
remained active in her church, and served on a medical board certification panel. Mary reflected
on the arrival of technology:
I was actually in medicine when we did everything by paper and when I went to my
residencies––when I got back out of it, everything had gone electronic. So I’ve become
very accustomed to my life being that way––so that when I don’t have it, I feel naked.
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015)
Mary’s methodical approach to life and work was evident in how she described what made her
successful with technology:

129
Well certainly education helps and the ability to tell someone exactly what happened. So
being a good historian, something I learned through medical school in particular––you’ve
got to tell people exactly what you need, exactly what you’re seeing or they’re trying to
interpret what you mean, as opposed to being crystal clear. And I’ve had to use a fair
amount of technology through my career. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 1, 2015)
Mary described herself as
savvy with [the] basics. Don’t ask me to build a computer, but I expect it to work when I
turn it on. I’m certainly not a programmer by any stretch, but I use it in my daily life, a
lot. A fair amount of what I do is computer-based. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 1, 2015)
Mary’s introduction to eReaders came when she saw her first one in use.
I saw somebody using one at Karate. I started chatting with them. And they were telling
me, “Oh yeah, it’s great.” I think they were actually using one of the early versions of
Kindle. So I started looking at them and I am enough of a geek of electronic stuff that I
go get the Consumer Reports and I read and I research. Not being a huge fan of Apple
products, I wanted to go something more––well––just not Apple. And I found the Sony
Reader. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015)
Mary purchased a first-generation Sony and liked the ability to get most of the books that she
wanted. In particular, she liked the availability of free books, but she was a little discouraged
with the graphics, especially when she was trying to view pictures, maps, or charts. In that case,
she resorted to purchasing a hardcopy. Alternately, she viewed the images on the computer since

130
they were in color there as compared to the black and white images on her eReader. Mary has
had the Sony for about 5 years, but the system is no longer supported by Sony.
For the books I’ve got on there, it works great, but I can’t use that to download new
books any more, easily. There is a way to [download] it. In fact, they pulled the Sony
Reader library completely offline. You have to go through another one. I don’t
remember the name off the top of my head of that one. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 1, 2015)
Mary still used the Sony for certain older books that were already downloaded to the eReader,
but she purchased a replacement device approximately two and a half years ago.
Mary’s new eReader was a Nexus tablet. She liked the fact that it was a multi-function
device, and besides, “It’s got color images; it’s a touchpad; it’s a tablet; and I’ve more or less
gone completely away from my laptop and do everything on my tablet” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015). She continued, “There’s a way I can go in
and switch everything from my [Sony] to my Nexus. I just haven’t done it” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015). Mary had never downloaded a book to her
phone either. She stated, “I choose not to because I’m over the age of 40 and I need bifocals, but
I could” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015). The Nexus provided
Mary with the opportunity during job-related travel to carry a lot of books without the size and
weight burden associated with print books. Mary estimated that she had 80 to 100 eBooks on her
eReader and stated, “It’s lighter. And when you’re on an airplane it’s also less volume, so I’m
not impinging on people’s space” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015).
Mary’s primary source for books was Google Play. She made use of the link to Project
Gutenberg and offered these comments, “I’ve gone back and found some really wonderful older

131
texts that are free that way. I actually found a bunch of medical texts one day, books that I had
studied a while ago” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015). Mary had
used the Books-A-Million website for ordering eBooks several times, but had used the Amazon
Kindle app only once. She did not belong to a book club, but instead got ideas for books from
the Sunday paper. Also, she received suggestions for books from friends, and wandered around
bookstores looking for ideas. She did not take advantage of the library eBook lending program,
though she was aware that it existed:
I know you can [borrow books] and I know how to do it. My biggest fear is I’ll forget to
return it. I know most of them will do a return automatically and they will just disappear,
but I would be the one that was busy and would forget to do something and then I would
have a bill. I tend to buy my books. I pay up front. And then they’re mine and I like that.
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015)
She looked for additional books from favorite authors and she liked the ability under Google
Play to sample books:
That’s the nice thing about an eReader. You can, in the comfort of your own home, if
you’re looking to buy another book, you can usually read the first chapter or so, and if it
grabs you, you can purchase it. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1,
2015)
Mary estimated that after reading an excerpt, she followed up with a purchase about 25% of the
time. As far as what she reads, Mary commented, “I read a lot––always have––and my interests
are pretty varied” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015). But Mary did
not use her tablet as a cookbook:

132
I don’t like having the electronics in the kitchen, but I know people who do. I know
people whose entire cookbook repertoire is sitting on an iPad. I’m just not that lucky. It
would get splattered or dropped or whatever. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 1, 2015)
Mary read approximately 2 hours a day. She described her reading preferences: “science fiction,
fantasy, [a] little bit of romance, history, Bill Bryson’s travel books are a lot of fun, the recent
books written by past presidents––I haven’t read 41 yet––I’ve got it, but I haven’t read it yet”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015), plus a Tesla biography and one
on the beginning of Pixar Films. Every once in a while, Mary tried out a new genre, and
specifically pointed out that she was not a fan of horror books.
Once Mary was ready to purchase an eBook, she experienced the download process as
follows:
I have to be in a Wi-Fi-enabled area that my computer is talking to, or my Nexus is
talking to. And actually the same thing is true with my Sony Reader. [It] has to be
hooked up through my laptop through a Wi-Fi connection and then I have to go to––in
the Nexus to Google Play. I hit the Books link and then there’s a search function and I
type in what I’m looking for––hit enter––and it spits out “Is this the one you wanted?”
And look at it and go––yeah––buy––and then it asks me, “Do you really want to buy
this?”––buy––enter your password––enter––and then I’ve got it. It is really
straightforward. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015)
Mary’s description of her download experience made the process sound easy.
Once the eBook was downloaded, Mary enjoyed reading with some added capabilities.
Her Nexus was backlit, meaning that she no longer had to use the swing arm book light when she

133
was reading in bed. She turned up the variable brightness and switched the color to white on
black to make reading outdoors easier. Her children synced their smartphones with Mary’s
Nexus so that they had instant updates to their mom’s calendar. Mary understood the mechanics
of the process as it applied to not only calendars, but also eBooks, but did not own a smartphone
capable of syncing with her Nexus tablet. When Mary needed a break from reading she used her
Nexus as a gaming console: “My kids have me hooked on Candy Crush. It’s very sad”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015). Mary liked the Sony for “the
capability of marking and highlighting stuff. It was really easy. And I could write actually on
the margin and it would capture it. I haven’t figured out how to do that yet on the Nexus”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015). Mary claimed to drive her
husband nuts because I’ll read the first third of a book and then I’ll read the last 10 pages
and then I go back and finish the book. He thinks that is just the height of cheating I
guess, but I don’t tend to anymore with an eReader. I figured out how on both of them.
It was easy on the Sony Reader. It’s not as easy on the Nexus . . . [so] I’ll go through the
story page by page versus skipping around. Now that’s also a downside, because every
once in a while when you’re reading a book––you want to––now wait a minute––did I
remember that right? And if you’re in a printed copy, it’s usually pretty easy go back to
where that spot was. [It’s] not as easy on an eReader. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 1, 2015)
Both her old and new eReaders had dictionaries in multiple languages, but Mary liked how the
Nexus offered the ability to search the Internet for additional detail. This entailed leaving the
book, but Mary did not see this as a problem. Mary did speak of the problems associated with

134
magnifying a page on the Sony, but felt that the touchscreen capabilities of the Nexus adequately
addressed her concerns.
At one point, Mary had a problem when she tried to share electronic copies of the Harry
Potter series with boys from her Scouting Troop. The licensing agreement allowed her to share
the book with up to eight youths to encourage them to read and the lender was trusted to have
integrity in terms of with whom the books were shared. When Mary inquired about the problem
with the transfer to other devices, she was walked through the process while she had both the
sharing device and the receiving devices present. On another occasion, she received a book that
was missing the last 30 pages. She was advised to delete the book and then download it again,
using a code that was provided. Mary said that she was “pretty comfortable” with the process of
following support instructions over the phone, in email, or in a chat room. When she had an
advanced technology question, she consulted her teenage son. Mary had experienced problems
with “hiccups in the [eBook] websites, particularly in high volume times” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015), problems with touching the screen and
magnifying the page by accident, problems early on with the inability to get copies of texts that
were more than five years old, problems with Sony’s default for page turning set up in the
Japanese style, problems with poorly scanned copies of books from Project Gutenberg,
bandwidth issues with her own equipment resulting in an eBook not completely downloading
(this problem self-corrected the next time she connected to the network), and problems with taps
and double-taps on the touchscreen. Mary had never gotten the wrong book during a download,
but admitted to accidently getting one that she ordered, because it had the same title. She did not
ask for a refund: “I just bought the other one. Then I read the first one and said, ‘Wow, that’s
not a bad story’” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015). Mary had

135
learned the hard way that books she had not accessed in a while ended up on the cloud. Though
it downloaded the next time she connected to Wi-Fi, this was a quandary if she was not in a WiFi enabled area when the problem was discovered. One final problem that Mary experienced
was the difficulty with proof-reading books for friends of hers that were looking to publish. She
said it was easier to find discrepancies between two parts of the book in a print format, and found
that a similar task on an eReader was much more difficult. On the subject of print books, Mary
added, “I don’t see myself ever getting rid of print books in my house. It is funny though. I have
repurchased some of my printed books in electronic form, so I could have them with me”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015).
Mary mentioned the need for text-to-speech options and speculated about the capability:
“I bet you it’s out there––I just haven’t found it yet” (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 1, 2015), accurately foretelling and yet unaware that this feature was already present
for some books. She thought this would come in handy when she drove to work. She would
have liked to have seen a link between the text-to-speech version and any associated maps or
illustrations. But as she also stated, “I’d like to learn the capabilities that are in my Nexus with
the eReader function. I just have not gotten to the point where I have had the time to really play
with it” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015). Mary stated that she
would like to take better advantage of the library’s lending program and of other free sources for
eBooks. She already loved the freedom associated with shopping and downloading eBooks.
It makes me feel pretty good actually, because I can get an awful lot and not have to get
in the car and drive in the rain to the local bookstore or library. I am amazed at the
breadth of the books that are out there, and as time has gone on, more and more books
that were purely print are becoming electronic via one of the library projects or the

136
Gutenberg project or the Library of Congress. So, if I want to go back and read Chaucer,
I can go back and read Chaucer, download it to my eReader––Now who would want to
do that? But I could. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015)
Mary described a program that involved computerizing some of the functions associated
with her job. She saw an older worker quit because he was not willing to learn a new computer
program. She continued, “I do not want to be that person when I get to be 10 or 15 years older”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015). She contrasted the employee that
quit with a few of the older workers at her jobsite that were “just as computer savvy as the 13year-old kid” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015). According to
Mary, “Life is headed that way” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015).
Even classrooms are going to change.
My kids are boggled that I didn’t have computers or eReaders or anything like that when
I went to high school in the late 70s. And I don’t think you can go to school anymore as
a young person without a computer, even in high school. So it’s something that we are
going to have to get used to. Sometimes I think we go a bit far. (Personal communication
with interviewee, February 1, 2015)
Mary continued with her discussion:
I’m getting more and more into technology you know in the classrooms, particularly with
my kids, as I’ve got one who’s looking at colleges. And I think for senior adults that go
back to school, they’re going to have to become comfortable with electronic media
because that’s the way the classrooms in colleges are going. And if you are not
comfortable with that, it’s gonna be a real challenge. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 1, 2015)

137
Mary was already planning ahead as she discussed medical studies that had proven the benefits
of keeping the brain active:
I’m actively considering when my kids are out of the house, going back and getting
another degree––why I need one is beyond me, but I’m thinking about it because I think
you have to keep your mind active or you lose it. (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 1, 2015)
If Mary returned to school this time around, even her textbooks may be downloadable from an
online source, and her eReader would be there to store the books.
Structural. As a medical doctor, Mary had a unique perspective on this study. She
spoke of the importance of being a historian and a good communicator. She exemplified both
traits as she was able to recount many more examples of the process of using an eReader than her
counterparts in this study. In particular, she laid out quite a lengthy list of issues that she had
encountered along the way. The historian and communicator skills that she possessed allowed
her to be so methodical that in many instances, when a problem arose, she was able to walk
herself through a solution. She speculated about the need for eReader features like text-tospeech, and would probably know a lot about this option already if she was not so occupied with
her job and other activities. Mary mentioned her concern about library fines on eBooks, but was
unaware that fines were not assessed on eBooks. Given more time to investigate, she may have
laid this matter to rest, but her dedication to various clubs, committees, jobs, and leadership roles
limited her time. As a doctor and as a scholar, Mary saw the importance of keeping her brain
active and had specific plans for the present and tentative long range goals for the future. She
even had specific eReader goals like learning to use the public library eBook collection and
figuring out how to use the text-to-speech option. Her vocabulary was extensive and she rarely

138
used the English dictionary. As a challenge, she was more inclined to change the default
language for an eBook and read it in another language, though she claimed her language skills
were not as sharp as they once were. That being said, her commitments kept her so busy that she
used her eReader for books that were less taxing and for ones that would allow her to unwind. In
short, Mary’s process for using eBooks was easy and made her more efficient. All she needed
was more time.
Essence of the Experience
Rick was considered crazy by members of his own family because he read romance
novels. But like Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Rick had a method to his madness: Rick liked happy
endings. The other participants in this study were equally methodical, a common attribute
among this group composed of seniors, some still working and others retired, with titles like
doctor, pilot, librarian, engineer, and military officer. The same methodology, the same attention
to detail, that made this group successful in the treatment of patients, operation of sophisticated
aircraft, cataloging of special collection materials, design of products, or leadership in time of
war, was evident even from each individual’s earliest exposure to technology. This group spoke
of things like computer programming in high school, working with “FORTRAN in 1964,”
having a “personal computer at home since 1983,” digitizing a radio station’s “entire music
library into the computer system,” and using “DOS in 1986.” These participants may not have
understood every aspect of technology, but they were not scared to give it a try. With selfdescriptions like “geek of electronic stuff,” “expert,” “better than most,” “advanced,” and “very
accomplished,” these avid readers were prepared for the day that eReaders entered their lives.
Their methodical approach was apparent in their reasoning for choosing a specific eReader, their
process for selecting eBooks, and their discipline in tracking what they read. They had chosen

139
eReaders based on their individual needs and were passionate about their choices. Some
participants, especially those engaged in research like James and Debbie enjoyed the multifunction aspect of iPads and tablets that allowed them to do more than read. Meanwhile, Rob
described the capabilities of his iPad: “I got my travel, I got my news, I got my Bibles” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015), all while having access to four different
reading apps. Other participants were equally passionate about single-function devices like the
Kindle Basic and the Kindle Paperwhite, designed specifically for reading. They had comments
like Mike’s: “[My eReader] is one of the best technological advances that I am using to its
maximum. I really, really like it. It just satisfies all the desire” (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 8, 2015). Thus, passion may have been an understatement. Cost was an
important factor in the initial purchase, and in evaluating the actual life-cycle cost of the device.
The seniors, some retired, and others soon to be, approached economic decisions with the
caution associated with living on a fixed income. Though economics were important, most
participants had not downloaded a free book from the public library. However, a bad interface
and limited selection may have had a lot to do with that situation. On the other hand, all
participants had purchased something from Amazon and appreciated the ease with which eBooks
could be searched for, reviewed, ordered, downloaded and read. Deciding whether to become an
Amazon Prime member hinged on a cost-benefit analysis. For a participant like Rick that did not
join Amazon Prime, the annual membership fee represented an unnecessary cost, especially in
light of the number of free eBooks that were available on the market. Other participants like
Debbie saw the cost as small compared to the benefits that came with membership, including
opportunities to download free eBooks or to borrow from the Amazon Lending Library. The
participants appreciated the ability to search for titles and to search for certain words within a

140
text (James), the capability to change various settings dealing with readability (Carol), and the
convenience that their devices offered (Rick). This convenience allowed participants like
Debbie and Mike to read at home (in bed being the most frequently mentioned location) and
individuals like James, Rick, and Mary to read when away from home (as in day trips to the
doctor and overnight work trips or longer vacations). Adopters of eReaders looked for future
improvements in their products. They wanted to see things like the mass-marketing of color E
Ink, while not abandoning features like tactile keys that aided seniors in their use of eReaders.
They had a difficult time relating to seniors that refused to adopt technology and kept their minds
active to counteract this tendency. In short, they loved to read and they embraced technology
and used it for the efficiencies that it brought to their reading endeavors.
Results
I collected the questionnaires, entered the data in a spreadsheet, and selected individuals
for the interviews. After the interviews, I placed snippets of transcribed information in a matrix
and began using different colored markers to highlight related comments. I identified patterns
and created a second matrix that organized the data by open codes and by themes. I went back
and added data from the questionnaires and the focus group to both of the matrices. When the
matrices were completed, I ended up with 33 open codes and six themes. I continued to mull
things over in my head as I wrote the Findings section. After writing the Essence of the
Experience, I made another matrix, found some overlap, and narrowed the list from six themes
down to four: Passion for eReader and eBook Selection, Sense of Economic Value, Comfort with
Technology, and Interest in Future Direction of Technology. An enumeration table of the
themes can be found in Table 3, followed by a discussion of the themes and the answers to
research questions.

Theme One: Passion for eReader and eBook Selection
Participants in this study displayed a passion for their eReaders and for the eBooks that
they read. One of the indicators of this passion was the reasoning behind why owners chose
specific types of eReaders. Some participants opted for single-function devices that provided the
eReading capability as the only option. Rick loved his Kindle Basic model and used it to read so
many eBooks that he wore out the battery on his eReader. Three of the participants, Mike,
Linda, and Debbie owned Amazon Paperwhites. Even though Debbie used her Paperwhite
occasionally for research, she stated, “I primarily use my Paperwhite for leisure reading, so I use
it every night” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015). The owners of
Amazon Paperwhite models enjoyed the enhanced readability features on the screen that allowed
them to read in the dark of night as well as in the brightest light of day. On the other hand,
tablets and iPads provided added possibilities. The capability to handle multiple functions drove
the owners’ decisions to purchase these devices. Owners’ decisions were influenced by the
devices’ abilities to assist with research, surf the web and play games. Rob stated, “I can use
[the iPad] for just about anything and everything” (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 22, 2015). Six out of eight participants changed their eReaders of choice over the last
few years. Mary stated, “I did get to experience the obsolescence of my first one” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015), as she recalled how the Sony Reader was
no longer supported by the company and how this forced her to consider other options. The
multi-function capability of a tablet influenced Mary’s decision to upgrade when the time came.
On the other hand, a dead battery forced Rick to change devices. He preferred a simpler device
and chose Amazon’s current version of the basic model to substitute for his Kindle Keyboard.
Meanwhile, two other Kindle Basic users, Mike and Linda were ready for an upgrade to a

143
Paperwhite when they replaced their old devices. The fact that new devices were purchased
when old ones died and in some cases before this point highlighted the fact that the devices had
arguably become a necessary part of everyday life: “I do feel ‘not quite naked’ when I travel and
I forget it and leave it on the side table. So yeah, it’s part of me. My kids get a chuckle out of it”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015).
Ideas and suggestions for books came from sources like family members, reading clubs,
BookBub, Wordpress, Goodreads, Barnes & Noble, and Amazon. A limited number of eBooks
were kept on devices at any one time. After books were read, they were “returned to the cloud.”
The cloud was used as both storage and a keeper of lists of Books Read or Books to Read.
Debbie kept a list of Books Read in a paper notebook. For Books to Read, two people
mentioned the use of their phones: Carol added titles to a phone list when she came across books
that interested her and Mike used his phone to take pictures of potential Books to Read. The
individual preferences of what participants read ran the gamut between the fiction and nonfiction
genres: biographies, history, philosophy, geography, self-help, science fiction, romance,
Christian novels, and the classics. James preferred to read nonfiction because of his heavy
emphasis on research that he was conducting and Rick discovered fiction later in life and read
fiction almost exclusively. However, a majority of the participants read both fiction and
nonfiction, though fiction was the most favored. In particular, romance novels and cozy
mysteries were cited as popular reading choices with reasons like “I don’t want anything that
taxes my brain” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015), or “I’d rather
read romance because I don’t want to think that hard” (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 22, 2015). Debbie enjoyed the ability to access newspapers on her device.
Individuals mentioned cookbooks frequently, but a definite divide existed between participants

144
like Debbie that supported the use of cookbooks on an electronic device in the kitchen and other
participants like Rick and Mary that preferred printed versions. The Bible was responsible for a
similar division. James was doing research involving a comparison of the King James Bible and
the Quran, and used electronic copies of the texts, aided by the search functions of his eReader.
However, Bible-reading participants like Mike, Rob and Rick preferred a print version of the
Bible, especially at home, though electronic versions were tolerated when the individuals were
away from home.
During the enumeration of open codes, Functions/Features emerged with the highest
frequency. The elevated count was reflective of a variety of function and features mentioned
during data collection, not the result of one or two specific functions or features that dominated
the discussion. The functions and features discussed were as varied as the choices of eReaders
used by the participants. The eReaders were valued for their ability to sync, their portability,
their long battery life, their light weight, and their convenience. Convenience, as a function of
place, included the ability to read while at home (primarily in bed), while away from home
running errands or waiting for appointments, or while on longer overnight trips and vacations.
Cost was a significant factor and a separate theme was devoted to this point in the next section.
Rick stated, “I love the accessibility––the instant access to it. I think that’s wonderful” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015). The access also included the ability to
avoid the bookstores or to order books “at 2 o’clock in the morning.” Carol described how the
elimination of print books in her home meant her eReader was in essence, a space-saver. Note
taking, searching, bookmarking, and backlighting were frequently mentioned during discussions
regarding features that were used on the devices. Dictionaries were also mentioned as a popular
feature. Carol stated that she read faster on an eReader because the on-board dictionary allowed

145
quick reference and speedy return to the eBook. Rick praised the German, French, and Spanish
dictionaries because of how they helped when encountering vocabulary words from other
cultures, while Mary appreciated the ability to switch to another language for a reading
challenge. Carol made use of a Gaelic dictionary because that was the language of choice for
one of her favorite authors and appreciated the functions that changed the text size, line spacing,
and column width. These features allowed Carol to read in spite of her medical condition, Visual
Field Deficits. However, other non-reading functions on her tablet tended to get her sidetracked. Meanwhile, Debbie described her use of Amazon’s X-Ray function to track characters
in a story.
I have used it and it has been helpful because suddenly they will be talking about
somebody and I’m thinking––okay––I know this person turned up somewhere several
chapters ago and I’m not sure and you usually put your finger on it and it will come out.
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015)
Debbie had also used the Popular Highlights function to see what other people noted as
important while reading, but none of the participants in this study had actually shared their own
highlights with Amazon even though they were more than happy to describe some of their most
recent reading selections with me during the interviews. James went so far as to say others
would not be interested in what he was reading, and even if they were, his highlights were none
of their business.
Theme Two: Sense of Economic Value
As mentioned previously, the cost of the eReader was one of the factors in determining
which device to purchase. Rick’s comments illustrated how important this factor was: “My first
eReader was a Kindle. Because I make a living out of being cheap, I bought the cheapy”

146
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015). Rick was adamant about
keeping his costs low after the battery on his first unit died. He voiced disappointment that the
battery compartment on his Kindle Keyboard basic model was designed without the ability to
access and change the battery, meaning that he was forced to purchase an entire unit instead of
just a battery. He replaced his low-end unit with the least expensive model available at the time.
James and Debbie were so concerned with cost that they refused to purchase eReaders for
themselves, but rather waited for them to be given as gifts. When the other participants bought
their devices, the biggest cost factor revolved around whether the eReaders were being purchased
for a single function (less expensive option) or whether it was being purchased to carry out
multiple functions (more expensive option) like web surfing and gaming in addition to reading.
Besides the initial outlay of funds associated with the purchase of eReaders, the
cumulative cost associated with the purchase of multiple eBooks was important to participants.
Rick had already considered this factor before making his purchase of an eReader. In fact, he
purchased his Kindle knowing that he would use his eReader primarily for access to free of
charge ARCs:
You can’t get a lot of stuff in hardcopy. You can only get it as an eReader book––it
comes as an attachment. So I get stuff here that you cannot read in the library because
they are not going to come to the library. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 22, 2015)
Rick had made connections with multiple authors and had begun receiving invitations to read
books in the pre-publication stage. The only catch was that the books were available solely in an
electronic format and readers like Rick would need an eReader for downloading the eBooks.
The price of a low-end eReader was quickly offset by the number of free books that came to

147
Rick via his ARC contacts. The dramatic changes in the publishing industry caused Rick to
state, “You can’t beat free” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015).
Rob stated that his wife grew up poor, “[did] not waste any resources” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015), and expected the same out of Rob. Rob’s
decision to purchase an iPad was based on the cost of the device and the overall value for the
money. He purchased the iPad because it allowed him to do more than just read. To keep his
costs low, he vowed to stick to free eBooks and became a frequent visitor to the local library,
where he asked lots of questions about tapping into the library’s eBook collection. He described
the difficulty of searching for and downloading books, especially when the library eBook
management system was brand new. Rob was one of the few library patrons that weathered the
storm and made it through the myriad of library software upgrades that the product went through
before it approached the user-friendly stage. Eventually, he read all of the free library eBooks
that interested him. Meanwhile, Carol described the frustrations that she experienced in the early
days with her NOOK and the library’s eBook system. She also described the pressure she felt to
finish an eBook within the checkout time window. For different reasons, Carol and Rob had
begun looking for eBooks in places other than from the local public library.
One cost-saving option that James, Mike, Rob, and Debbie turned to was an annual
membership in Amazon Prime. Of course “saving” was a relevant term since paying for a
membership was not an actual savings. The savings came from taking advantage of the perks
and using these benefits enough to recover the costs of the annual membership fee of 99 dollars.
Non-eReader perks included free movies, free music, and free shipping. The perks for Amazon
Prime eReader owners included the ability to download one free book per month (usually out of
a choice of four) and access to borrow one book per month from the 500,000-book collection

148
housed in Amazon’s Lending Library. These benefits were in addition to the ability of all Kindle
and Kindle app owners to share books with members in their own family or to loan a copy of a
purchased book to someone else for a two-week period.
Even though Mary had to pay for the entire eBook collection of the Harry Potter series
through the Pottermore website, she was able to transfer additional copies to her teenage sons
and their friends free of charge. Participants mentioned other sources of free books including the
classics available from multiple sites, eBooks from Project Gutenburg, and recommendations
provided by sites like BookBub. When eBooks were purchased, the 1-Click option made buying
from Amazon very easy and perhaps too easy: Carol, self-describing herself as a “bibliophile,”
bought more books than she needed and most likely more than she may have had the time to
read, but justified this action by describing how the short-term deal was often too good to pass
up. She also justified her actions by detailing how thorough her reviews were before she
downloaded an eBook so as to minimize the chances of getting a less than desirable book, even if
the price was right. Meanwhile, Linda commented about her spending habits: “I finish what I’m
reading first and then I’ll go buy one or two more, [then] read them” (Personal communication
with interviewee, February 22, 2015). Most participants liked to brag about how inexpensively
they were able to purchase copies of eBooks. As a author, James was still appalled at the price
of books. He was privy to how much he received in royalties compared to what Amazon
charged the customer and thought there was still plenty of room on Amazon’s side for the price
to drop even further. James was looking forward to a better long-term solution. In the interim,
Carol, as an example, waited to purchase eBooks until after the price dropped: “I don’t get to
read them at the same time as everyone else” (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 22, 2015), but that was a tradeoff that Carol was willing to accept.

149
Theme Three: Comfort with Technology
Most of the participants in this study rated themselves lower than their children and
grandchildren in terms of ability level with technology. However, when they compared
themselves to their peers, they rated themselves much higher and described their ability level
using terms like “very high” and “expert.” All participants had some college education and most
had graduate degrees. For individuals like James, Rob, Linda, and Debbie, their experiences
with FORTRAN or DOS in their younger years prepared them for the technology challenges
they would face throughout their lifetime. Participants in this study were likely early adopters of
home computers and their work situations provided them with an educational environment ripe
for learning technology. Most of the participants had spent some time in the military or had
grown up in a military family. This led to comments like “military people are much more
adaptable than the norm . . . than people who have no connection to the military” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015). Whether this was true or not, many
individuals in the group believed it. Rick, a former military member and self-described
“Facebook junkie” used his computer ability to connect with people to discuss a common
passion for reading. This connection resulted in invitations for free downloads of ARCs. Rick
and Debbie participated in writing book reviews for websites and blogs. Meanwhile, James used
his multi-function device to conduct research to write books. Debbie had been “publishing
articles since the late 70s” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015), in a
time when hardcopies were passed back and forth for editing purposes. Shortly before this study
took place, Debbie participated in an online editing process: “I did not ever get a hardcopy to edit
and it was a very different experience. It worked surprisingly well. But I never thought I would
see that” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015). True to their problem-

150
solving nature, participants in this study like Mike and Debbie experienced very few problems
and most of those problems could be solved either alone or through minimal assistance from
Amazon. Participants reported problems like scrolling issues (Mary), battery concerns (Rick),
and library eBook download difficulties (Rob and Carol), though all of the individuals when first
asked were likely to state that they had experienced no problems at all.
Mike adapted quickly to new technology. This kind of background and experience made
participants like him candidates for the use of eReaders. Mike remembered seeing an eReader as
far back as the 1990s. Similarly, Linda and Mary saw other people using eBooks and began to
investigate. Debbie reported lusting after eReaders when she was out shopping. All participants
eventually bought or were given an eReader and most participants had followed up with
purchases of replacement units. Their eReaders had merged to become an important part of the
participants’ lives and the individuals felt like the devices should accompany them everywhere.
Rob relayed an interesting outcome to a recent episode from his volunteer job at the local
hospital:
They came in and told me that I could no longer keep my iPad with me at my position
because they thought it looked bad for them. So I have put it back. They don’t realize I
can use my iPhone the same [laughing]. They won’t catch me again on that. (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015)
A similar confidence for moving between technologies was evident among the entire group.
Participants in the study described themselves as self-motivated when it came to the use
of technology. None of the group members indicated that they were being pushed by anyone to
adopt technology and when asked about why their peers were not following their lead in eReader
adoption, they had replies like, “I just don’t get it,” or “They are not there yet.” Instead, the

151
participants were more likely to be the ones doing the pushing. Rick made light of the lackluster
responses that he got when he tried to convince others of the advantages of an eReader and
conceded, “I’m probably a bad salesman because they see me and they think I’m probably about
half-crazy anyway” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015). From the
perspective of some people, reading 100 romance novels a year on an eReader could qualify.
But Rick was comfortable with his reading choices and used his eReader to gain the efficiencies
necessary to make these high-volume results possible.
Theme Four: Interest in Future Direction of Technology
Participants in this study not only kept up with the present technology, but also showed
interest in the direction technology was headed. As the oldest participant in the study, Rob
stated, “I think all the electronics we have, allows us to use additional things including the eBook
to maximize the time that we have available on this earth. We shouldn’t waste our time [or] our
resources” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015). Rob’s age allowed
him to see things differently than younger participants in the study. He reflected on how the
science fiction concepts portrayed in Dick Tracy episodes had transformed into realities. Mary
revealed how studies had shown that keeping the brain active was a way of “avoiding the
dementia-type syndromes” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015), then
related how eReaders helped by allowing users to make the font larger so that older readers could
stay engaged as their eyesight began to fail. The same technology that helped society solve
problems was also responsible for a downside. Programs like Facebook “made people almost
insular and very too self-aware as if they are the center of everything” (Personal communication
with interviewee, February 22, 2015). Though Linda noted this problem with society in general,
participants in this study did not fit this mold. These individuals were more likely to be

152
volunteers in the community, especially as the definition of community was growing to include
an online component.
In the interview, Linda commented, “Technology was made to make our life easier. It
has not made our lives easier––it has made our lives more stressful because there is more to be
done,” and that “relaxation is leaving society” (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 22, 2015). Participants with living parents, like Linda and Carol discussed how much
more difficult it was for their parents to adopt technology and voiced concern about experiencing
similar issues as they grew older. Members of the group longed for fewer major software and
hardware overhauls and for a return to simpler designs with more tactile keys. However,
participants also looked forward to the mass-marketing of color E Ink, the ability to tap into
more Internet capabilities, and the time when the interface between eReaders and eBooks would
become seamless.
Research Question (a): What are Contributing Factors in Senior Adults’ Decisions to Use
eBooks?
Six of eight participants in this study purchased replacement eReaders for reasons
including failure or obsolescence of their first devices. The participants were resolute in their
desire to purchase another one. Evidently, any frustration associated with having to purchase a
replacement was offset by what eReaders delivered and reinforced the validity of the initial
eReader purchase. Two participants, Debbie and Rick discussed how they were introduced to
eBooks when the book they wanted was only available in an electronic format. There were no
other options. Debbie needed a specific eBook for research purposes, so she downloaded the
Kindle app and the eBook to her iPad. As more and more eBooks became available, Debbie
eventually opted to purchase a stand-alone eReader. Meanwhile, Rick was made aware of the

153
pre-publication existence of ARCs and purchased an eReader to take advantage of a multitude of
electronic resources. He stated, “The availability of ePublishing where you can’t get it anywhere
else but an eReader––you read stuff that nobody else is reading. I like that. It’s cool” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015).
The ARCs represented not only cases in which books were available exclusively in an
electronic format, but also cases in which the eBooks were free. Cost was a very important
factor in the decision to use eBooks. All participants were aware of the classics that were
available to download for free. Also, all participants were aware that the local library had
eBooks available to borrow for free. Several reasons were listed as to why the use of this service
did not meet the needs of the participants, but Rob took advantage of this library service to the
full extent possible as a way of mitigating the costs associated with his hobby of reading.
Participants listed other sources of free eBooks including Amazon website searches, email
notifications on accounts set up at BookBub, and one-day-only download specials from various
authors and publishers. The cost factor was not limited to the discussion of eBooks. The cost of
the device was important too, but the decision to purchase really depended upon whether the
device would be used for multiple purposes. For participants that purchased devices like iPads
and tablets, the higher cost was offset by the ability to do more extensive research, to surf the
web, or to play games. Rob was one of the participants who bought his iPad so that he could do
more than just read. Linda held the opposite viewpoint: “I guess there are some eReaders that
will do other things as well but I don’t get into those. To me, a book is a book. I want it to be
just a book” (Personal communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015). For her, and others
that purchased single-function devices like the Amazon Kindle Basic or Paperwhite, the device
was able to serve the purpose for reading while keeping the overall cost low. A similar argument

154
was used regarding the purchase of an Amazon Prime membership. The annual membership was
deemed worthwhile if the benefits, like the access to the Lending Library and the distribution of
free books each month, outweighed the fee. Therefore, some participants (Rob, Debbie, Mike,
and James) partook of the service, while other individuals (Rick, Linda, Cary, and Mary) did not,
each according to their own analysis of the cost and the convenience.
The convenience of eBooks included the ability for eReader owners to store a large
number of books in a minimal amount of space and for owners to read in various locations. At
home, several participants including Mike and Debbie mentioned reading in bed and taking
advantage of features like backlighting or E ink technology. The convenience extended to places
outside the home like the doctor’s office. Mike, Rick, and Mary mentioned the convenience of
taking the eReader on short business trips where space in the travel luggage came at a premium.
For longer vacations, and particularly beach vacations, study participants like Mike and Linda
mentioned how the Kindle Paperwhite was advantageous for reading outdoors in the sunlight.
A few of the participants like James, Rick, and Debbie enjoyed conducting research or
writing book reviews. The ability to cut and paste snippets for either purpose and to make notes
about what was being read made the electronic format of eBooks highly desirable. The ability to
search the text, even to search terms that were not indexed, provided yet another reason for using
eBooks. This factor greatly increased the efficiency of the eReader owners in this study. For
aging seniors, efficiency was paramount.
Participants in this study were drawn to eReaders for several reasons. Their background,
training, education, and careers were sprinkled with various amounts of technology use along the
way. They saw others using eReaders and also saw eReaders for sale in retail stores. It was only

155
a matter of time before their aspirations in technology and their desire to read brought this
combination of interests together.
Research Question (b): How do Senior Adults Describe Their eReader Experiences?
To better understand how senior adults described their eReader experiences, one must
first look at how the devices were acquired. The acquisition phase was described by Linda as
follows:
There are so many people who are my friends who have the eReaders. . . . So they had
their Kindles and they liked their Kindles. And so I bought one….And I discovered the
ease of it outweighed the actual feeling I had of carrying a book, a nice hard book. And
now I don’t use anything else. It just morphed into––I grew comfortable with it. It’s so
portable. I can pull it out anywhere. It syncs with my phone through Kindle and if I
don’t have my reader with me, I can pull up my phone and read my book. And then
when I pick up my Kindle again, it says, “You read this book up to page so and so.
Would you like to jump there now?” (Personal communication with interviewee, January
30, 2015)
With professions like doctor, pilot, engineer, or librarian, the technical background and education
of the participants in this study meant that decisions surrounding purchases of the chosen devices
would be well-researched and thoughtfully laid out. Mike described his purchase of a
replacement device as follows:
The next day I went on Amazon to look at my options and I saw that newest reader
was––gosh––it was like 200 dollars. I was like I’m not spending that kind of money.
Actually it might have been more than that. So I went with the Paperwhite––got it for I
think 120 dollars––I almost went with the old version for 79 dollars, but I thought I’d like

156
that backlight feature. And the resolution was a little bit better, although when you read,
it doesn’t really matter, although they say that pictures will come out better on it. But I
haven’t come across any pictures in anything I’m reading yet––and so––Paperwhite––I
love it. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 8, 2015)
Even when receiving eReaders as gifts, recipients like James and Debbie appeared to have
considerable input into what was purchased.
After acquiring an eReader, owners had the opportunity to select eBooks for
downloading to their devices. Ideas for eBooks came from friends, family members, coworkers,
book clubs, and the Sunday paper. However, the most mentioned places for ideas were from
eBook vendor websites and from websites like BookBub that made recommendations and
provided links to the vendor sites. For participants like Rick that participated in a forum for prepublished books, ARCs provided another source of reading material. Still, Amazon appeared to
be the most widely used source for books, and as Linda put it:
They are so up on––once you have kind of let them know through your choices what you
like, they have a whole stable of Recommended for You and they don’t go far wrong
with the things that they know that I usually like to read. (Personal communication with
interviewee, January 30, 2015)
Amazon was where most participants eventually ended up, but they had a definite process for
arriving there and for making decisions about what to purchase. Rick described the process this
way:
Go onto BookBub––and you can dial in your interests at BookBub. And every day they
will give you an offer of books that range anywhere from 2 [dollars and] ninety nine
[cents] to free. And so I’ll go on there and that looks interesting––so below they’ve got

157
Barnes & Noble and Amazon and a couple of other things. I click Amazon and boom, I
go into Amazon and then I look at the introduction, the cover . . . the book summary and
then I go to the reviews . . . , the ones that come with the most likes and I look at the
negative and positive reviews––both. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 2, 2015)
The final determining factor before purchasing an eBook was cost. The typical process included
checking multiple vendor websites before deciding whether to purchase immediately or to wait
for the price to go down. Though few participants took advantage of the free eBooks available at
the library, Rob did and saw not only whether a book was owned by the library, but also how
long the waiting list was.
Once a book was selected and purchased from a vendor website, the download step
commenced. Debbie preferred the simple 1-Click process provided by Amazon. On rare
occasions, participants placed an order on a smartphone, but the process for most participants
involved selecting and purchasing an eBook on a larger computer or laptop before transferring
the eBook to the device that would serve as the eReader. This is how James described the
process:
Of course on Kindle you have to go to Amazon first. You buy the book and then you
open the iPad and open the Kindle app and then it downloads itself. It’s not all that
convenient, but it’s not too inconvenient. . . . It’s so much easier to use the Internet and
shop Amazon on the big machine than it is on the little one and then––so it’s one step
there and then you go to the second machine and open it up, turn it on, open it up, and it
downloads––that’s the slightly inconvenient [part]. . . . On Amazon you don’t download
it onto the machine, you just tell it and it knows. Amazon has stored in my account the

158
ID and so forth of this iPad, so just the next time I turn on the iPad and open Kindle, it
downloads automatically. I tap the icon for the Kindle app for example. I type the icon
for device so that I know what’s on here. If it’s a book I know I have but it’s not here, I
will tap the button for cloud and then download it––push the button––push the book and
it will automatically download in about 30 to 45 seconds. And then I go back to [the]
device and I choose what I’m going to read. (Personal communication with interviewee,
January 30, 2015)
Some participants like Mike added an extra step in the download process: “If I think my wife
and daughter might like it, I’ll download it to [their Kindles] also” (Personal communication
with interviewee, February 8, 2015).
Purchasing eBooks from other vendor sites or borrowing library eBooks worked in a
similar fashion. However, the process was very convoluted, especially for NOOK owners in the
early versions of the library software:
That was really hard to do at first. You know you have to read through all of the
instructions and getting it set up and synced up. This, and on my tablet and on my
laptop––just downloading the software, installing it properly, figuring out the right access
codes that everybody wanted because everybody wanted something you know. You had
to use this password for this one and this password for that one. It got really complicated
and it’s a lot easier lately since they updated. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 6, 2015)
The Overdrive program for borrowing library eBooks was favored by Rob “because it’s a total
utility” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 3, 2015), capable of tracking the
number of remaining pages left to read in a book or detailing a library patron’s place on the

159
waitlist. In a slightly more complicated version of downloading, Mike used his technical
expertise to download the Calibre library system to his Kindle, and then downloaded eBooks that
had been saved on a memory stick.
Once eBooks were downloaded to a device, readers had the ability to use search
functions to navigate: “You know there’s a little magnifying glass. You press that, and that’s
really convenient. . . . Put in the search term and the list comes up––but this works on everything
indexed or not and that’s a big convenience” (Personal communication with interviewee, January
30, 2015). Another opportunity to navigate on the device arose when a certain eBook could not
be found. Mary described the process:
On my Nexus, if I haven’t read a book in a while, apparently it sits out there in the cloud
and I have to have a Wi-Fi connection to get to that book again. That can be a bit of a
challenge. Or if it’s a book I bought a while ago and I haven’t read it at all, it drops out
of the active memory––again I’ve got to find the Wi-Fi. It’s out there and it knows I own
it. I just have to go back out there with a connection to get it back in the memory with
my tablet. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015)
In the ultimate statement about the power of navigating and organizing, Rick said, “You’ve got a
list––you can go into your cloud––you can look at every book you’ve ever read on Amazon”
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 2, 2015).
Linda reflected on her previous encounter and stated, “I miss that experience, but not
enough to not use my reader” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015).
Participants in this study not only had excellent technical skills, but also had good
communication skills, allowing them to give a professional accounting of their reading
experience. The most mentioned place for reading was in bed and as Debbie put it, “I’m

160
addicted to reading before bed. It’s like I cannot––I could be wiped out and I’ll still read until I
fall flat on my face” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 6, 2015). The Kindle
Paperwhite came equipped with features to enhance the experience of reading in bed. Mike
commented:
The nice thing is I don’t have to turn on my bedside light or I can sit in a dim room and
read just fine. The thing I’ve always really liked about the Kindle is how nice it is on the
eyes. It’s not like looking at a computer screen––and I wondered if that backlit [feature]
would make a difference––maybe cause a little eye strain, but it doesn’t––you know I
don’t see this shadowing or anything on it. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 8, 2015)
Debbie provided additional comments about reading in bed:
Well I’ve always read right before bed. It stems from when I had a very stressful job.
That was the only way that I could sort of come down and not think about that––keeping
me awake all night––is that I would read. That’s when I started reading mysteries in fact.
There’s just nothing more convenient for bed reading than an eReader. (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015)
Participants spoke of reading when they first went to bed, when they awoke in the middle of the
night, and when they woke up in the morning.
The eReader was deemed a “lifesaver” and proved to be convenient for travel too. Mary
described what it is like when she travels: “I read all the time––there’s a TV in the hotel room––I
never turn the sucker on because I’m usually on my eReader” (Personal communication with
interviewee, February 22, 2015). As a traveler, Rick expanded on the reasons why he liked his
Kindle:

161
The portability of it––the ease of operation––the physical––the ergonomics of it. Just
being able to pick it up and go––I love that. And being able to look on Amazon and see
things I would probably have never even read before. It opens up a whole new world.
(Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015)
The ability to sync allowed for another possibility: “I can [read] on my smartphone” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 1, 2015). Reading was not confined to a specific
location. Rick elaborated: “I carry mine around the house occasionally. I will open it up for
five, six, or seven pages and then click. So I am constantly looking in––going in and out––to
read” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 22, 2015). Then Rick commented
about what his eReader situation is like when he leaves home:
It’s chained to me. It goes everywhere. When we go shopping, it goes in my car. [My
wife] goes and shops. I sit in the car and eRead. Then she generally says, “I’d like you to
see something.” “Okay, if you insist.” So I’ll do it. But yeah, it goes with me when I
travel, anywhere I go, it’s there. It is that indispensable. I have withdrawal symptoms if
I don’t have that thing with me. It’s that bad. (Personal communication with interviewee,
February 22, 2015)
Trips to the doctor resulted in comments from the participants like this one from James:
The good thing is that I can read just about anywhere I am easily and I spend a lot of time
waiting for doctors and what have you and it’s incredibly convenient to have this thing
with me. That is the one thing I enjoy. The only thing that frustrates me is occasionally I
forget which way I’m supposed to turn the page and that’s not a big deal. (Personal
communication with interviewee, January 30, 2015)

162
This previous example highlighted a problem that James could solve by himself. Carol suffered
from Visual Field Deficits and her condition limited how much she read. However, she did
reason out how the Paperwhite might be the answer to her issue with screen glare. Rick was
representative of the group in terms of dealing with problems. When he was unable to solve an
eReader issue, he was comfortable turning to Amazon for support or to his granddaughter for
assistance.
Research Question (c): What are the Challenges and Benefits of Senior Adults Regarding
the Use of eReaders?
For the participants in this study, one universal challenge was the library’s eBook
borrowing program, though there were different reasons given for the cause of the challenge.
James saw the catalog as extremely limited. Carol did not like the short borrowing timeframe
and Mary avoided the system out of fear that she would be charged for an unreturned eBook.
However the biggest concern was the difficulty in searching the catalog and in downloading
eBooks. Early versions of the software and early NOOK models required the eBook to be
downloaded to a computer, and then transferred to the eReader using a USB connection. The
extra steps meant extra possibilities for something to go wrong. Only Rob sang the praises of
this system, though the praise was in how the system was now, not in how it was in the
beginning. On a similar note, Linda and Carol mentioned previous negative experiences with
software updates to computers and other forms of technology and secretly retained concerns
regarding eReaders if similar updates were required.
Most participants mentioned cost as an obstacle and did thorough research before
purchasing an eReader. However, when a unit died or when it was replaced, each participant
somehow came up with the money for a replacement. For the purchase of eBooks, most

163
participants spoke of reading reviews and performing price comparisons as a way of mitigating
costs.
Carol described the challenge of Visual Field Deficits and how this condition affected her
ability to use her eReader; the glare caused her to lose her concentration and limited how much
she could read at one time. The procedure used by most participants, of searching and
purchasing eBooks on a big machine and transferring them to the eReader, presented a challenge
for those participants that borrowed from Amazon’s Lending Library. This program did not
allow transfers, but instead required owners to log in using the actual eReader. Other issues
mentioned included improper scrolling, swipe recognition problems, limited battery life, a
defective battery charger cord, a complaint about an unreasonable time for the device to kick into
Wi-Fi mode, poor design placement of the power button, and difficulties with the use of the
device for Bible study. Participants got used to features like a keyboard (Mike), page-turning
buttons (Rick), or a place to grip their device without touching the screen (Carol) and missed
these features when a replacement eReader was purchased. Though a long list of challenges was
gathered during the course of the study, participants were more likely to issue comments about
eReader problems as follows: “I’ve never had one. They have just worked flawlessly. They are
a great piece of work” (Personal communication with interviewee, February 2, 2015).
Benefits far outweighed the challenges and helped to explain why owners were so
passionate about their devices. All participants eagerly shared the names of websites used to
gather eBook suggestions. The ultimate in saving money was in getting free books and
participants including Rick and Debbie bragged about how frugal they were. Amazon provided
a platform for authors to release pre-published copies of their works as ARCs, so that people like
Rick could read an electronic version before a print version ever hit the shelf. The eReaders

164
were valued for benefits like the ones mentioned by Mike: “ease of use, lightweight, just the
ability to manipulate the page, the font, the type size, [and] the lighting” (Personal
communication with interviewee, February 8, 2015). Rick praised the “convenience, fantastic
convenience,” that allowed for additional reading opportunities:
I read a lot more now. As an [almost] 70-year-old guy right now, it’s so much more
convenient because you don’t have to haul a box of books around. You take that
[pointing at Kindle] and that’s everything––right in there. It’s a library because you can
just pick up and drag away. I can read anywhere––anywhere. I can take it. I can read
because you don’t have to be up on the Internet. It does not require a router or wireless
anything. It’s on there. It’s downloaded. You got it. You open it up––click––it’s
on––go. (Personal communication with interviewee, February 2, 2015)
The convenience was particularly important for participants like Carol and Debbie that read in
bed and for those individuals that traveled like Mike and Mary. The participants that chose
multi-function devices liked the added convenience of being able to take a break from reading to
surf the web or to play games. There were advantages associated with dictionaries, including
copies written in other languages. Reading books through an Amazon Kindle account allowed
readers to easily keep a log of what they read. Other benefits included taking up less volume and
the ability to order books without having to drive to the library or wait for a bookstore to open.
Amazon has continued to make the overall process easier through innovations like the 1-Click
order and payment process, backlighting for reading in bed, and the use of E Ink technology.
And for Paperwhite owners like Mike, Linda, and Debbie, their devices reduced the sun glare
when reading outdoors. Other participants looked for more improvements in the future. Mary
was a big proponent of keeping an active mind and her future plans included returning to school,

165
an endeavor that she predicted would be more electronic and more online. Meanwhile, her
eReader allowed her to keep up with the latest trends.
Summary
This study sought to describe senior adults in their acquisition and use of eReaders. Six
individuals participated in both an interview and a focus group and two participated in an
interview only. Using data from the original questionnaires, the interviews, and the focus group,
I built a textural and a structural description for each of the eight participants. These individual
descriptions were compiled into a composite description of the entire group, creating an essence
of the experience for the phenomenon under investigation (Moustakas, 1994). Four themes
emerged: Passion for eReader and eBook Selection, Sense of Economic Value, Comfort with
Technology, and Interest in Future Direction of Technology. The intended use of the eReader
influenced whether a single- or multi-function device was purchased. The owners took
advantage of many features offered on their devices. Participants concerned themselves with the
cost in terms of the original device, in terms of eBooks, and in terms of other benefits like those
provided by membership in Amazon Prime. The participants were involved in technology from
an early age, whether at home, school, or work and maintained a keen interest not only in the
state of current technology, but also in the future direction that technology was headed.

CHAPTER FIVE: DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This phenomenological study was conducted for the purpose of describing the
perspectives of senior adults in Georgia regarding their acquisition and use of eReaders. After
collecting 29 questionnaires, a group of eight individuals agreed to be interviewed and six
participated in a focus group. The sessions were recorded, transcribed, and then analyzed using
the Moustakas (1994) technique as simplified by Creswell (2013). This chapter begins with a
summary of the findings produced from the data analysis and continues with a discussion of the
findings as they relate to the empirical and theoretical literature. Implications derived from the
study are described, followed by a discussion of the limitations associated with the study. Based
on what was learned, recommendations for future research are presented.
Summary of Findings
The following four themes arose from the analysis of data: Passion for eReader and
eBook Selection; Sense of Economic Value; Comfort with Technology; and Interest in Future
Direction of Technology. Participants usually chose an eReader based on whether its purpose
was for serving strictly as a reading device or whether it needed to have additional functionality.
Six of eight participants had purchased a replacement unit at some point, allowing for an
opportunity to reevaluate whether the single-function or multi-function device could serve them
better. Ideas for Books to Read came from family and friends. Participants also used a
collection of websites including ones (like Amazon) operated by vendors and ones (like
Goodreads) that provided reader support in the form of book reviews and recommendations.
Most participants kept track of Books Read or Books to Read and utilized the cloud not only to
provide storage, but also to list books from these aforementioned categories. Fiction and
nonfiction were both mentioned as reading choices, but fiction was the most prominent. Strong

167
opinions were voiced as to the viability of eReaders for use with certain types of books.
Cookbooks and the Bible represented books in this category of debate over advantages and
disadvantages of print versus electronic versions. The various models of eReaders were valued
for their ability to sync with other devices, for their readability, and for their portability, but most
importantly for their convenience.
Aside from functionality, cost was the most important aspect considered when purchasing
an eReader. Some participants were so concerned with cost that they waited for someone to
provide them with an eReader as a gift rather than spend money on themselves. The cost of
eBook purchases was also an important factor to consider. One participant took advantage of
ARCs and another participant had read all of the books of interest in the local library’s eBook
collection, both free options. All participants had downloaded an eBook from Amazon, but only
half of the participants belonged to Amazon Prime. Prime members felt that they got more than
their money’s worth while nonmembers saw the annual membership fee as an additional
unnecessary expense. Most participants took advantage of the opportunity to lend eBooks to
friends or to share downloaded eBooks with family members. Participants were ready when
one-day sales were announced or were prepared to wait for the price to go down, if necessary.
Most participants mentioned reading book reviews as a way of keeping costs down, purchasing
only books that had received decent reviews.
The participants in this study self-reported technology skill levels ranging from above
average to expert as compared to their peers. Most participants followed up any discussion that
required a peer comparison with a comment about how far behind they were when compared to
younger generations. This group had early exposure to computer languages like FORTRAN and
DOS, were long-time owners of home computers, or were beneficiaries of educational and career

168
training in technology, most notably provided by the military. Activities ranging from the use of
Facebook to the downloading of ARCs provided evidence of the group’s comfort level. Several
participants used technology to write reviews, blogs, or books and one participant recently wrote
an article for publication without having to shuffle the printed copies back and forth to the editor
as was the practice for years. These early adopters of technology remembered the first time that
they saw eReaders, one participant as far back as the 1990s. Early exposure to technology made
these individuals comfortable moving between various electronic devices and their use of these
technologies helped them to garner efficiencies as they increased the volume of their reading.
The past experience with electronics and the current use of eReaders by participants not
only reflected the state of comfort with which these individuals operated, but also foreshadowed
the interest with which the participants held in the future direction of technology. These
individuals had a hard time, because of technology’s prevalence in today’s society, relating to
people who did not adopt technology. This group viewed continued use of an eReader as a way
of keeping their minds active and avoiding dementia-type ailments. Features like the ability to
enlarge the font helped to aid in this endeavor. The participants viewed technology of the future
in a positive light and the group looked forward to enhanced features like the mass-marketing of
color E Ink and longer battery life. However, there was a negative side to the advancements:
Participants predicted social isolation brought about by sites like Facebook and increased stress
due to overdependence and excessive expectations from technology. The individuals that took
part in this study wondered how the Internet would continue to evolve and what impact these
changes would have on newer versions of eReaders.
Many factors contributed to the decisions of senior adults to adopt the use of eBooks.
Sometimes it was because the book was available only in an electronic format. That situation

169
represented how two of the participants got started. One participant went out and specifically
bought an Amazon Kindle. The other participant downloaded the Kindle app to prepare her
computer for the eBook, but eventually ended up buying a stand-alone Kindle. Cost was an
important factor in the purchase of eReaders because participants did not want to be wasteful.
Several participants described the process that they went through, including research, to ensure
that they made a smart financial decision. Some individuals waited until they were given an
eReader as a gift. The anticipated use of a device for more than just eReading usually led to the
decision to buy a multi-function device. Once eReaders were purchased or received, owners in
this study were exposed to multiple ways to download books. The number of free eBooks
available (through Amazon, the library, and elsewhere) was a driving factor in the use of an
eReader and in its continued use. Six of eight participants in the study had determined that
eReaders were a necessity and had already substituted original units with replacements or
upgrades. Amazon Prime offered yet one more opportunity to maximize the cost of the
investment. Another huge factor was the convenience of an eReader and the number of eBooks
that the eReader could hold. Participants had the ability to read in bed, to carry an entire library
in a small package, and to occupy their time in the waiting room of a doctor’s office.
Participants used the note taking and highlighting capabilities of eReaders to research and write
book reviews and gained efficiencies in the process. Another positive factor was the ability to
search the entire eBook, not just the index and table of contents as with a print book. All of the
eReader use began after witnessing others using the devices.
Seeing others use eReaders, plus seeing the units in stores and in advertisements is how
these technology-savvy participants described their introduction to eReaders. The participants
usually conducted thorough research regarding which devices to purchase and used their

170
experience with their first devices to direct their decisions if they needed to purchase
replacements. Even when given an eReader as a gift, each recipient apparently gave thorough
input to the donor. Participants obtained ideas for eBooks from acquaintances and from
websites, with Amazon being the most popular choice. After finding out about a book,
participants conducted reviews and examined costs before making a purchase. A problem with
the original version of the public library circulation software was one of the reasons cited for
keeping people from downloading library eBooks. Though the software is much better now,
most participants had already abandoned attempts to use the program. Participants described the
ease of Amazon’s 1-Click ordering and payment system. Though Amazon could be used on a
smartphone out in public, most participants opted to do their shopping on a larger computer at
home; the eBooks were downloaded to their reading device later. Some participants described
how they downloaded additional electronic copies of eBooks from Amazon to other registered
devices within their same family. One participant had a collection of eBooks loaded on a
memory stick. He described how he had downloaded the Calibre eBook Management system
onto his Kindle and then downloaded a few books at a time when he needed something to read.
The search function came in handy for finding eBooks on the device. The Nexus owner
described how missing books may have been sent back to the cloud if they had not been used
recently and looked there if the initial search came up empty. The cloud served as both a list of
Books Read and Books to Read. Descriptions of reading almost always included the
convenience of reading in bed. Other places described in detail were the home, the doctor’s
office, business trips and vacations. Suffice it to say that the devices went everywhere. On the
rare occasion in which problems occurred, most participants were good problem solvers and took

171
care of the issues themselves. If they could not solve the problem, most participants were
comfortable with options like online chat assistance.
Some examples of the challenges experienced by participants included difficulties
navigating, maneuvering, and downloading within the library’s eBook lending program, short
borrowing timeframes and limited selection within the lending program, fear of future software
upgrades that rivaled past headaches, the glare of the screen, and difficulty of using the devices
with medical conditions like Visual Field Deficits. Other problems included the inability to
transfer Amazon Lending Library books between devices, difficulty with scrolling and issues
with batteries. Instead of reporting challenges, participants were more likely to say they had no
problems. They liked to brag about the free eBooks that they downloaded or that they purchased
at a very low price. Other benefits were the convenience of reading in multiple locations, the
ability to use the dictionary, and the existence of the booklist that was kept in the cloud. Owners
of Paperwhites were particularly pleased with the technology that reduced the glare to the point
of being able to read in the sunlight outdoors. All participants were passionate about their
devices and looked forward to future improvements.
Discussion
Bandura’s (1977) Social Learning Theory postulated that individuals learned by watching
others. Connell et al. (2012) found that exposure to eReaders increased the desire to purchase a
device. Participants in this study saw others using eReaders in restaurants, stores, Karate
practice, and in television advertisements and sought to replicate this behavior for the benefits
that the devices provided. The first assumption of Knowles’s (1980) Adult Learning Theory was
that adults want to be responsible for their own education and studies. One participant described
his hope that his study of romance novels and the writing of online reviews would launch a

172
second career, this time as a professional book reviewer. Reviews written by a man would
provide a unique twist for readers of this genre. Society is drifting away from learning as a result
of strict individual activities (Siemens, 2004) and is shifting toward a model focused on the
combined efforts of participants like the ones in this study that produced blogs, reviews, or
ePublished books in an online environment. Participants in this study were motivated by internal
pressures (Knowles et al., 1998), and one participant conducted his research on classical
religious texts using his eReader, while simultaneously writing a book. This participant
discovered that knowledge emerged as connections were made (Dunaway, 2011), knowledge
that was enhanced by what he learned from eBooks he read in preparation for his book club
discussion groups. Adult learners want to know why they are learning something (Knowles et
al., 1998), and participants in this study came up with several reasons about why they had
learned about eReaders: the need to be prepared for a future with more prominent use of
technology, a finding consistent with White and Weatherall (2000), and the need to keep their
mind active as they grew older. For adults in their 70s, 80s and 90s, Russell (2011) found that
older adults liked the ability to learn at their own speed. Since cognitive functions decrease with
age (Salthouse, 1996), one might be inclined to make the assumption that the pace of reading
may slow down as well, but that was not the case in this study for one participant in particular
who was making up for the lost time of not reading fiction when he was growing up and had read
350 eBooks in the past 3.5 years.
Hawthorn (2007) and Broady et al. (2010) reported the existence of several types of
technology avoidance behaviors, but these behaviors did not appear to be present in the
participants of this study. The eReader needs of the participants of this study were consistent
with the IT needs of older adults found in the Wang et al. (2011) study. The pursuit of a

173
happiness-enhancing life involving reading (Henricksen & Stephens, 2010) was evident in the
descriptions provided by the study participants as they detailed with passion not only what they
liked to read but also how the eReader had enhanced their ability to read in places like the bed
and the beach. This passion or attitude toward new technology was consistent with the factors
like enjoyment, technical ability, and convenience found in the previous study by Li and Perkins
(2007).
Convenience represented a factor found consistently throughout the literature. Most
notably, the factors of PU and PEOU as found in the TAM (Davis, 1985) were present. PU was
evidenced by mentions of the convenience associated with the number of places that one may
read (like the doctor’s office or the beach), the size of the library that may be stored on an
eReader, and the ability to use features like the light to read in bed. PEOU factors associated
with the eReader included a pre-loaded dictionary, an opportunity to open the eBook
automatically to the last page read, eBook suggestions made by Amazon, and ordering shortcuts
like Amazon’s 1-Click. The convenience factor was also cited in the older adult study by
Mitzner et al. (2010). However, the threat of technology (Hakkarainen, 2012) and the fear of
technology (Hogan, 2009) were not found in this study. The closest element to technophobia
was a concern about major software upgrades that appeared to roll out on a semi-regular basis.
The absence of technophobia may have to do with the prior background, training,
education, and careers of the participants. Knowles (1980) postulated that adults learned based
on their experiences collected over a lifetime. For this group, the military had as big an impact
as any other factor. The training from the Air Force in particular provided a majority of the
participants in this study with a solid base in technological skills. Findings from this study about
the use of eReaders were consistent with the findings of Lunn and Harper (2011) about use of the

174
web and the advantage of experience and knowledge being more important than age. Slegers et
al. (2007) found that senior adults with no computer skills had a difficult time transferring newly
learned skills to other devices. That was not the case in this study as individuals frequently
completed tasks like navigating, searching and purchasing books using a larger computer, then
downloading and syncing to a smaller device for reading. On occasion, some participants even
ordered eBooks on a smaller device, like a smartphone, and then downloaded the eBooks to their
eReader. As a whole, computer users tended to be better educated and younger than those that
did not use computers (Carpenter & Buday, 2007; Cresci et al., 2010; DeOllos & Morris, 20032004). These findings were similar to what was found in this study regarding eReaders, at least
in terms of the volunteers that participated. Participants all had some college and most had
Master’s Degrees, a fact consistent with the overall community’s above average number of
college graduates (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2014). Grimes et al. (2010) found that higher
educated adults had computer skills that mirrored those of younger adults. Kooij et al. (2008)
described how age could be discussed in ways other than chronologically, an aspect that fit the
eReader ability of the participants in this study.
Age did play a role in some of the problems experienced by the participants, particularly
age-related vision problems. For instance, though several individuals in the study occasionally
read using their smartphones, a few others made comments about the size of the screen being too
small. This may hint as to why Smith (2014) found that older adults were more likely to own an
eReader over a smartphone. Touchscreen problems, one of the computer issues found by
Barnard et al. (2013), were reported as occasional problems by the eReader participants in this
study. Problems included improper scrolling and failure of the device to recognize when a touch
occurred. Chaffin and Harlow (2005) reported that adults were concerned with the loss of

175
autonomy as a result of aging. One possibility of tackling these problems involved having
designers address these issues during the design phase of technology (Charness & Holley, 2004;
Githens, 2007; Ling 2008; Purdie & Boulton-Lewis, 2003). One study participant suffered from
Visual Field Deficits and needed narrower columns, something that her device was able to
address. However the tablet glare still presented a problem. Mobility issues increased with the
age of seniors, but seniors may be able to use technology for assistance (Charness & Holley,
2004). Participants in this study made mention that their eReader provided them with a way to
make a trip to a “virtual library” without ever having to leave home.
According to Connell et al. (2012) print material can be read faster. One of the
participants in this study had the opposite opinion, stating that the eReader onboard dictionary
saved her enough time by not having to look up words in a separate dictionary that her overall
reading speed had increased. Georgia Download Destination, the state library eBook software,
presented a challenge. One other peculiar problem is worth mentioning. Lunn and Harper
(2011) found that seniors perceive themselves to be better than they actually are when they use
the Internet. The same could be said for the participants in this study regarding the use of
eReaders. Several of the participants brought their eReaders with them to the interview. In all
cases, there was at least one time when I observed each person having a minor issue with their
eReader. They were so quick to figure out what was wrong that they may not have even noticed
this brief struggle themselves. The participants were equally quick to point out their lack of
problems experienced with the devices. The list of issues surfaced only when I continued to
probe. When participants finally began to list problems, most issues were very minor. This may
explain why the memory of the events had been suppressed or why the issues were downplayed
after comparing the issue with the overall usability and convenience of the devices.

176
Support is important for technology acceptance (Wang et al., 2011). Support for
participants in this study was more likely to come from a chat room or from a child or
grandchild. Barnard et al. (2013) described how getting help from an expert reinforced the
notion that technology, and specifically computers, were only for experts. Participants in this
study did not experience this feeling of inadequacy, at least when comparing themselves with
their peers. They considered themselves to be experts, albeit with a skillset slightly lower than
that of younger generations.
White and Weatherall (2000) studied moderate to higher proficiency computer users age
59 to 77 and identified five themes: connection of technology with other interests; role of
computer-mediated communication toward social stimulation and positive aging; impact of cost;
role of computer as a tool; and importance of communication with family. This study of above
average to expert level eReader users age 51 to 73 came the closest to mirroring the findings of
the White and Weatherall study. The connection of technology with other interests in this study
was represented by the link between the eReaders and reading that these devices supported.
Computer-mediated communication was present in blogs, book reviews, and online chat
assistance and the passion for eReaders was a reflection of the positive aging among these
participants. Cost was important in the decision to purchase an eReader, to purchase eBooks,
and to purchase an Amazon Prime membership. Whereas White and Weatherall addressed the
computer as a tool, this study addressed the role of the eReader as a tool. The eReader served as
a storage facility, research aid, and pleasure reading device in a multitude of locations. Finally,
the sharing of eBooks indicated that family communication was taking place among the
participants in this study. Communication with family using an eReader was more likely to be in

177
the form of support questions answered from grandchildren or through the transfer of a book
using one of Amazon’s lending programs.
After growing up in the infant stages of computer development, and receiving education,
training, and military experience in technology, these participants were poised to begin eReader
use after watching others adopt the devices (Bandura, 1977). Their passion for reading on an
eReader was influenced by the convenience that the device offered. Use of the devices did
present an occasional problem, but seldom one big enough to discourage a participant from using
the device. Support was only a chat room or a family member away.
Implications
The use of an eReader among the participants in this study was preceded by a passion for
reading and an exposure to technology via education, training, careers, or military experience.
The background from the group members, including computer programming with DOS and
FORTRAN, ownership of home computers dating to the early 1980s, operation of sophisticated
aircraft and medical equipment, and service in a nuclear warhead missile silo, provided
participants with the prerequisite skills necessary to be successful in their use of eReaders. This
kind of background, common to the participants in this study, was the key to fostering the use of
an eReader. If this was the case, which trigger had the biggest impact on the use of eReaders and
on their continued use? Similarly, which features, designs, and costs of eReaders drove these
decisions? Barnard et al. (2013) found that older adults struggled with issues concerning the
touchscreen. Several participants in this study had similar concerns. Also, several participants
made mention of the need for more tactile keys on an eReader and for places away from the
touchscreen in which to rest one’s hand. These findings highlight important aspects of design

178
considerations for future eReaders. Other design considerations mentioned included the need to
address vision issues, a common problem for aging adults.
Focusing on the eReader was not meant to imply that the physical device was the only
issue that needed design consideration. Instead, use of an eReader should be considered from a
higher level or process standpoint. For instance, Mead et al. (1999) found that older adults
performed similarly to younger adults in Internet searches when the tasking required fewer steps.
This implied, as does this study, that a simpler process is beneficial to older adults. Participants
in this study commented on how simple the process for purchasing and downloading books from
Amazon was (a process consideration that needs to be emulated), and contrasted this with the
sophisticated process for borrowing from Amazon’s Lending Library and from the public
library’s eBook collection (process considerations that need to be avoided).
The implications regarding prior experience and process design considerations lead to
some specific recommendations for certain stakeholders. These recommendations relate to the
following categories: vendors; the community; and the traditional brick-and-mortar library.
Vendors
Alter (2012) described Amazon, Apple, B&N, and Google as major eBook publishers.
All of these eBook vendors also sell their own versions of eReaders, giving them considerable
influence in both markets. These vendors only stay in business if they continue to make a profit
derived from knowing and serving their customers. Alter reported that the data collected from
eReaders gives vendors valuable information about whom they serve. This study identified the
need for more tactile keys, the desire for the mass-marketing of color E Ink, and the need for a
larger area outside of the touchable screen in which to grasp the eReader. None of these findings
would be identified through the metadata collected during the normal use of eReaders, so

179
vendors would need another way to collect data on issues such as these. Therefore, one
recommendation is that vendors commence studies aimed at determining the needs of older
adults as addressed above so that they can incorporate senior-specific design elements into their
eReaders. In terms of the downloading process, this study identified the need for a better
interface with library software and for a simplified process for downloading and using loaned
eBooks. As mentioned earlier, the design of the eReader needs to incorporate more than just the
physical attributes of the device; the whole process should be considered. As an example,
Amazon’s Lending Library site must be accessed on the device in which the eBook is to be
downloaded. Since many participants in this study––and presumably other Amazon customers
as well––preferred to shop and complete the transaction on a larger computer before having the
eBook sent and downloaded to their eReader, Amazon may want to consider simplifying the
process. In particular, participants who represent owners of single-function eReaders like to use
their devices for reading and not for shopping. Fixing this problem may go a long way toward
helping Prime members that pay an annual fee for services such as these. An example of what
Amazon is doing right is the 1-Click order and payment process lauded by participants in this
study. Of course purchasers do have to enter all of their information the first time, but
subsequent orders can be processed rapidly according to the Amazon.com website. A second
example of what Amazon is doing right is in making recommendations for what a customer
might enjoy reading and providing the reviews to help customers make an educated decision
about eBook purchases. Every participant mentioned reading reviews and at least half
mentioned that they wrote book reviews. A final recommendation is in order regarding the issue
of cost. Authors may desire compensation for their intellectual property, but one participant in
this study with a book for sale on Amazon highlighted the steep overhead that Amazon tacked

180
onto the price of a book. Publishers of eBooks, no longer having to include the cost of paper and
printing that was required for print editions, need to help bring the costs under control. Lowering
prices for eBooks would be welcome among this group of participants, all of which mentioned
cost as a relevant factor in their decision making.
Community
Participants in this study had prior backgrounds and training in technology-related fields.
More than half of the participants mentioned how they served as volunteers and a majority of
them had served their country in the military. In short, the participants supported their
community. Schilderman (2002) recommended community support for technology in areas
including the provision, availability, and accessibility of information, and the need for making
experience and education available, the need for social sensitivity, and the need for leadership.
The stakeholders of technology and reading in a community typically include the government,
local businesses and charitable organizations. One participant involved himself in a community
book discussion group. Meanwhile, another participant extended his definition of community to
include online friendships built with authors that offered to give him copies of ARCs.
Library
One particular place that could serve as the hub for community eBook initiatives is the
local library, a place where three of the participants in this study volunteered. Ashcroft (2011)
stated that libraries should advertise their eBook collections and do a better job of marketing in
an effort to mirror the success in the private industry. Several participants in this study described
their frustrations regarding the Georgia Download Destination eBook management system,
particularly in its early stages. These problems may have been what kept other participants in
this study from using the system in the first place. Recommendations for the library included

181
educating the public not only about checking out and downloading eBooks, but also about the
absence of eBook fines. The local library would also need to increase the size of its eBook
collection to offset the increase in usage caused by additional marketing; Some eBooks already
have long waitlists associated with them. An increase in patronage would necessitate a
movement to provide training for those that might be struggling with eReaders. Lai’s (2011) call
for more training in Internet searching skills may provide a valuable skill for those seeking to do
a better job of discovering, reviewing, and purchasing more relevant eBooks at the best price,
including ones available for free at the public library. Gomez et al. (2012) described the public
library as a place that served everyone and that information was its chief product. However,
Duncan (2011) warned that libraries would lose funding and would become irrelevant if they did
not implement eBook solutions specific to their community. Finally, Ashcroft (2011) found that
users liked to access eBooks from multiple platforms. Though this was true for several
participants in this study, most had a preferred reading device. One recommendation for the
public library where the study took place, and others like it, would be to continue upgrading the
Georgia Download Destination eBook delivery system so that the problems described by study
participants, particularly ones associated with NOOK eBooks, could be eliminated.
Limitations
Limitations address the factors that were beyond my control. The first and perhaps most
influential limitation to this study was researcher bias. Because the phenomenon being studied is
the adoption of eReaders, part of the bias inherent from this study is derived from my own
experience as a professional librarian. This bias was additionally influenced by my prior
employment at the public library where this research was conducted and by my previous efforts
in assisting eReader adopters. Though I tried to lay aside these experiences and prejudgments

182
(Moustakas, 1994), human nature dictates that a certain amount of bias still remained in how I
reported the data and in any conclusions that I drew from the research. Even the design of the
questionnaire may have unintentionally introduced ideas or concepts into this study that were my
own and not that of the participants. Next, the homogeneity of the study participants particularly
in terms of race, ethnicity, and geography, limited any conclusions that may have been drawn.
This study was further weakened by the homogeneity of the study participants in regard to their
connection with military service: Four of eight participants had retired from the military, one
participant had served in the military, and another participant had grown up as part of a military
family. This study may have been overly influenced by the high concentration of participants
with a military affiliation and this similarity between the participants necessarily placed
limitations on the results that may have been drawn. The study was also limited by the use of a
convenience sample and by the timeframe associated with the research project. A longer
timeframe may have allowed for the discovery of additional relevant data. Another limitation
was the use of all volunteers and their ability or inability to adequately and accurately describe
their eReader experiences. This study may have been limited if a participant fostered a
preconceived notion about emphasizing the use of his or her reading app on a tablet because the
study was about eReaders. These descriptions by participant may have resulted in an
overemphasis on how much the tablets were used for reading. The study was limited further by
those participants that could have benefited from having their eReader present during the
interview as a way of jogging their memory about certain issues, functions, or features. On the
other hand, individuals that brought devices may have been distracted to the point that they left
out important points about their use of eReaders. The research is weakened by studying only a
limited number of participants. Though the number studied was appropriate for a qualitative

183
study aimed at identifying factors and experiences, limiting the number of participants when the
data appeared to be saturated may have inadvertently eliminated a potential discovery. All of
these limitations, plus the inherent design condition of a qualitative study, contributed to the lack
of generalizability of the conclusions drawn by this study.
Recommendations for Future Research
This study set out to describe the use of eReaders by senior adults in their own words.
Based on the findings from this study and the aforementioned limitations and delimitations,
several recommendations are in order for future research. First, the original questionnaires need
to be analyzed with a focus on participants that were not selected for an interview. The initial
candidates for interviews were selected based on their potential to add significant contributions
to this research effort. Other candidates may have been able to provide equally significant data
given the opportunity to interview, but the candidates were overlooked because their
questionnaires did not stand out in the initial analysis.
Second, future researchers may want to consider additional related studies within this
community or similar communities. The time constraints of this study limited the ability to
collect data. A longer time window may have opened up the opportunity for inclusion of data
from individuals within the community that did not match the homogeneous makeup of those
included in the present study. In addition, a study of eReader non-users within the community
may add a different dimension to the findings of this study.
Third, future research needs to be conducted with populations that differ from the one
used in this study. Future research may include studies in communities that differ in terms of
educational levels, income levels, racial mix, and ethnicity mix.

184
Fourth, certain influences and affects are worthy of future consideration. These include
the impact of the military experience on the use of eReaders, the influence of different models of
eReaders on the perceptions of convenience, cost, and usage, a comparison of the eReader
experiences with the other functions used on a multi-function device, a comparison of eReader
use with other electronic devices, and a study of the relative importance of features used on an
eReader.
Finally, future research may need to focus on the perceptions of others regarding the use
of an eReader by a senior adult. These perceptions may come from groups including family
members, librarians, or other individuals interested in the research outcomes of senior adults and
eReaders.
Summary
I proposed a phenomenological design to study the eReader use of senior adults in
Georgia. Based on the theoretical framework of Bandura (1977), Knowles (1980), and Davis
(1985), I set out to ascertain how these older adults described their eReader experiences, what
made them decide to use eBooks in the first place, and what challenges and benefits they
experienced. Four themes emerged from analysis of the data: a Passion for eReader and eBook
Selection, a Sense of Economic Value, Comfort with Technology, and Interest in Future
Direction of Technology. Implications were that experience and knowledge among the
participants in this study were important factors in determining the use of technology,
particularly eReaders. The participants represented a highly educated collection of individuals
with job titles including doctor, pilot, librarian, and engineer. People from other backgrounds
may have an equally important story to tell, but the results from this study represented a snapshot
in time for a community in Georgia with above average income, age, and education levels.

A second take-away from this study was the importance of designing electronics with
seniors in mind. This concept involved not only the design of the actual eReader including and
excluding certain features and attributes, but also the entire process of eReader usage defined as
the acquisition of the device, followed by the selecting, downloading, navigating, and reading of
eBooks. Vendors of eReaders and eBooks, the community, and the public library have parts to
play in the analysis and tweaking of the processes that result in the delivery and use of eBooks.
This study represented only a beginning to the research involving the topic of eReader
adoption by senior adults. The qualitative design of the study limited the ability to generalize the
results. Future research needs to focus on the perspectives provided by eReader owners from a
more diverse population and from differing backgrounds or from others witnessing the use of
eReaders among this growing segment of the population.
