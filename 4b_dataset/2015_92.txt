Abstract
This dissertation addresses Neal’s (2005) call for more research on the influence of
personal characteristics on turnover in historically Black colleges and universities
(HBCU) libraries by assessing the relationship between the Big Five personality
traits, locus of control, and organizational commitment. The research focuses on
follower perception of the leader using the Big Five personality traits and selfevaluation using organizational commitment. The research includes a double
measure of locus of control to measure follower perception and self-evaluation.
Each of the Big Five personality traits—openness to experience, conscientiousness,
extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism—were tested individually. The
hypotheses were tested using a nonexperimental, quantitative design that included
the widely used and validated Big Five Inventory-10, Internal and External Locus
of Control Scale, and Organizational Commitment Questionnaire. Sample data
were collected using the website SurveyMonkey as the host for the questionnaires.
The HBCU Library Alliance listserv and website were also used to access sample
participants. Multiple regression analysis in SPSS was utilized as the means for
analysis of the results of the study. No significant influence existed in the selfperception of locus of control of the follower and organizational commitment.
However, the perception of internal locus of control of the leader by followers was
found to have a significant negative influence on commitment. Additionally,
openness and conscientiousness of the Big Five personality traits were found to
have a significant positive influence on organizational commitment in HBCU
libraries.

Chapter 1 – Introduction
The purpose of this dissertation was to follow up on Neal’s (2005) call for
future research on leadership in libraries at historically Black colleges and
universities (HBCU) and answer the question: “What is the impact of personal
characteristics on turnover” (p. 42). Libraries at HBCUs are facing a problem of
low tenure compared to libraries at non-HBCUs (Neal, 2005). In this instance,
tenure refers to the amount of time a position has been held. Nyberg and Idelman
(2005) found that some HBCU libraries were evenly matched with staff at nonHBCU libraries; however, “The research and baccalaureate level HBCUs fall
behind peer non-HBCUs in terms of number of library staff per student” (p. 3).
This could indicate an issue with turnover. Also, the HBCU Alliance makes
available an annual report that provides greatly detailed data on libraries at HBCUs;
however, no data were found on staff turnover statistics.
Youmans (2009) found that current library administrators in HBCU
libraries are experiencing challenges with retention of credentialed librarians.
Additionally, Gregory (2003) noted that turnover rates among faculty and
presidents are on the rise at HBCUs. This would include library staff. Colding
(2004) echoed the concern for library turnover across the board in all academic
libraries by stating that retention of librarians through preventing turnover has
become a leading issue in academic libraries, and Rogers (2003) affirmed the
profession of librarianship, in general, faces a difficult time in retaining librarians.
Acree, Epps, Gilmore, and Henriques (2001) stated that competing for the retention
of library staff is an issue amongst all libraries. HBCU libraries must compete with
public, non-HBCU, and special libraries for employees; therefore, retention
strategies are of great importance to the organizations in preventing turnover. Neal
(2005) found that between 1998 and 2004, the average length of tenure for HBCU
library directors was 7.6 years, whereas the average length of tenure for non-HBCU
library directors was 11.7 between 1998 and 2002. Although the referenced study is
focused on library directors, Neal stated, “Academic libraries would benefit
significantly from an improved understanding of the turnover process and an

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

2

expanded documentation of turnover patterns across the field” (p. 39). The current
study addresses turnover in subordinate library employees.
Meyer, Stanley, Herscovitch, and Topolnytsky (2002) stated that tenure is
an antecedent to organizational commitment, and Chughtai and Zafar (2006) found
organizational commitment to be negatively related to turnover intentions. The
current study uses organizational commitment as a dependent variable. Cohen
(1993) stated that a great deal of the focus on organizational commitment stems
from its relationship with turnover, while, Mowday, Porter, and Steers (1982)
posited that highly committed employees desire to remain with their respective
organizations. Personal characteristics lead individuals to act and behave in certain
ways based on situational circumstances (McCrae & John, 1992). Also, McCrae
and Costa (1987) suggested that although personal characteristics have been
previously defined, the Big Five personality traits allow for an effective method of
classifying them.
Erdheim, Wang, and Zickar (2006) found that the five-factor model of the
Big Five personality traits “serves as an informative framework in examining the
dispositional sources of organizational commitment” (p. 966). Therefore, the five
dimensions of the five factor model of the Big Five personality traits are the
independent variables in the current study. According to Kumar and Bakhshi
(2010), a relationship exists between organizational commitment and the five
factors of the Big Five personality traits of openness, conscientiousness,
extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Additional research has supported
this theory. Openness refers to the intelligence and curiosity of an individual (Ganu
& Koguto, 2014). Ganu and Koguto (2014) described openness as the intelligence
and curiosity of an individual and stated that individuals who are open tend to
perform well in situations that require flexibility and change.
In a study on personality, organizational commitment, and job search
behavior, Hackney (2012) found that conscientiousness indicated a relationship
with all three forms of commitment—affective, continuance, and normative
commitment. Barrick and Mount (1991) posited that some researchers refer to
conscientiousness as being dependable, caring, thoughtful, and responsible. The

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

personality trait extraversion refers to an individual’s level of outgoingness.
Kappagoda (2013) posited, “Employees with this type of personality have the
propensity to have more friends and spend more time in social circumstances. Also,
extraverts have an easier time than introverts do when adjusting to a new job” (p.
3), which may allow them to feel more comfortable in organizations, making them
more likely to remain with the organization longer. Agreeableness is a personal
characteristic of individuals that represents trustworthiness, respectability, and
helpfulness. Panaccio and Vandenberghe (2012) found that agreeableness was
positively related to the three forms of organizational commitment through
enhanced positive affect. Neuroticism is a personal characteristic that represents
sensitivity of emotions. Choi, Oh, and Colbert (2015) described individuals who
have the characteristic of neuroticism as having lower emotional stability and being
prevention-driven versus promotion-driven. Prior researchers have suggested that
perception of leadership is an important determinant of organizational commitment
(Avolio, Zho, Koh, & Bhatia, 2004).
Smith and Canger (2004) found compelling indications that a leader’s
personality influences followers’ attitudes. Since the current study focuses on the
influence of personal characteristics of the leader as they apply to the follower,
perception of the follower was used. Jackson (2011) posited that it would be remiss
to overlook the relationship between a follower’s perception of a leader and
positive outcomes. This would include attitudinal outcomes that lead to turnover.
Notgrass (2014) referenced Lord and Emrich (2001), stating, “If leadership resides,
at least in part, in the minds of followers, then it is imperative to discover what
followers are thinking” (p. 551). In an effort to examine personal characteristic
influences on turnover in HBCU libraries, the five characteristics of the Big Five
personality traits were used as individual independent variables in this dissertation.
Chhabra (2013) found that the personal characteristic of internal locus of
control is significantly positively related to organizational commitment. Chhabra
suggested that the influence was stronger for internal locus of control versus
external locus of control. In order to measure locus of control, Chhabra used a
modified work locus of control measurement developed by Spector (1988). The

current study aims to determine the relationship of the personal characteristics
known as the Big Five personality traits with organizational commitment as they
pertain to perception of library directors by employees at HBCUs. Also, the current
research aims to determine the relationship between locus of control and
organizational commitment as it pertains to follower perception of the leader as
well as follower self-perception at HBCUs. Smith and Canger (2004) stated that
leadership theory oftentimes seeks to find traits that relate to effective leadership,
therefore, understanding followers’ perceptions is of great practical interest.
What people often observe or assess as your ability to be a leader and your
effectiveness becomes their perception, which in turn becomes reality.
Perceptions that are not well managed become rumors, then gossip, then
backbiting, which leads to destruction of the leader himself or even the
functioning of the organization. (Otara, 2011, p. 23)
Sarwar, Hameed, and Haftab (2013) found that the dimensions of the Big Five
personality traits had an influence on employee turnover. Hypothesis 1 of the
current study uses follower perception in measuring the Big Five personality traits
of leaders of HBCU libraries.
Erdheim et al. (2006) expressed that affective commitment has been found
to have a link with extraversion, which could be based on extraversion’s core being
positive emotionality and affective commitment’s causation of individuals to form
positive emotional reactions to an organization. Judge, Higgins, Thoresen, and
Barrick (2009) stated that as studies are completed, many results suggest that all
personality measures can be measured under the Big Five personality traits model.
Spagnoli and Caetano (2012) agreed that the Big Five dimensions may influence
organizational commitment based on the findings from previous studies. However,
Spagnoli and Caetano also stated that the research available on personality
influences on organizational commitment is not adequately abundant. Therefore,
Hypotheses 1a-1e test the relationship of followers’ perception of the leader having
Big Five personality traits with organizational commitment in HBCU libraries.
Coleman, Irving, and Cooper (1999) stated that previous studies have
shown that individuals with high external locus of control are least likely to be

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

5

committed to organizations, and individuals with high internal locus of control are
more likely to be committed to organizations. Spector (1982) suggested that the
effects of leadership style can be directly impacted by a follower’s locus of control.
Davenport (2010) used Rotter’s (1958) I-E Locus of Control Scale to measure the
effect of locus of control on leadership style and organizational commitment. The
possible effect of locus of control is hypothesized to influence the attitudinal
outcome of organizational commitment in subordinates employed at libraries at
HBCUs.
Hypotheses
H1:

Perceived Big Five personality traits of library directors have a
positive influence on organizational commitment in library
employees of HBCUs.

relationship with organizational commitment in followers.

H1d:

Follower-perceived agreeableness of library directors has a positive
relationship with organizational commitment in followers.

H1e:

Follower-perceived neuroticism of library directors has a positive
relationship with organizational commitment in followers.

H2:

Internal locus of control of the follower has a positive relationship
with organizational commitment in followers.

H3:

External locus of control of the follower has a negative relationship
with organizational commitment in followers.

H4:

Follower-perceived internal locus of control of the leader has a
positive relationship with organizational commitment in followers.

In summary, Hypothesis 1 states that the five dimensions of the Big Five
personality traits have an influence on organizational commitment in employees at
HBCU libraries. As stated, the five traits include openness, conscientiousness,
extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Hypotheses 4 and 5 state that internal
locus of control within the follower has a positive influence on organizational
commitment, and external locus of control has a negative influence on
organizational commitment of followers. Hypotheses 4 and 5 state that followerperceived internal locus of control of library leadership has a positive influence on
organizational commitment in followers, while follower-perceived external locus of
control of library leadership has a negative influence on organizational commitment
in followers. The research model is displayed in Figure 1.

Methods
The study utilized a quantitative survey research methodology by using all
validated survey instruments. The reason for utilizing a quantitative methods
approach is the asset of numerical data. Antonakis et al. (2004) stated that
leadership research is typically done by using quantitative methods. Also,
quantitative research methods allow for the research to be subjective and leave less
room for subjectivism. The use of surveys easily allows data to be numerically
interpreted. Greene and Caracelli (1997) stated the quantitative method is defined
on the concept of validity. Greene and Caracelli also stated that conclusion,
internal, construct, and external validity are imperative in the methodology of
quantitative data.
Sample
The sample consisted of individuals who are subordinate employees within
academic libraries that are classified as HBCU. This direction of the sample
selection is based on Neal’s (2005) call for more research on personal
characteristics that influence turnover in HBCU libraries. Library directors were
excluded from the sample because the research is based on subordinates’
perception. Follower perception is imperative to leadership research (Yukl, 2002).
The participants have worked under the direction of the leader being perceived for
at least 1 year, as tenure is a control variable used in the research. Camp (1994)
completed a study on the effects of organizational commitment and job satisfaction
on turnover and included tenure as a control variable. Kovjanic, Schuh, Jonas,
Quaquebeke, and Dick (2012) argued, based on studies by Meyer, Stanley, et al.
(2002), that leader–follower dyadic tenure is linked to commitment; therefore,
tenure is an important control variable. Tenure allows for strengths in workplace
relationships to build (Cox, 2008). Altogether, the current study has six
independent variables, one dependent variable, and one control variable. Hair
(2006) stated that a sample should include 15-20 participants per variable.
Therefore, a sample size of 120 was be used in the current study.

Instruments
The short version of the Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10) is a validated
measurement of the Big Five personality traits. The BFI-10 was reworded for
sample participants to rank their library leaders. For example, in lieu of stating, “I
see myself as someone who,” it stated, “I see my director/library leader as someone
who.” Rammstedt and John (2007) stated, “On average, the BFI-10 scales captured
70% of the full BFI variance and retained 85% of the retest reliability” (p. 2010),
which supports it being a viable instrument in measuring the Big Five personality
traits. In a study measuring the effects of locus of control, Reed, Kratchman, and
Strawser (1994) used Rotter’s (1966) Locus of Control Scale to measure influence
of attitude. Lee (2013) stated that one
implication is that, when measuring employee’s personality traits, a
researcher can divide individuals into those with an internal locus of control
(i.e., the person believes decisions and actions affect events and outcomes
in his or her life) and those with an external locus of control (i.e., belief that
environmental factors beyond a person’s control affect events and outcomes
in one’s life). (p. 1048)
Ismail and Yousouf (2009) studied the relationship between transformational
leadership, empowerment, and organizational commitment utilizing the
Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ) to measure organizational
commitment. The internal validity of the study found that Cronbach’s alpha was
.931, increasing support for using the OCQ to measure commitment.
The five dimensions of the Big Five personality traits were measured based
on the validated short version of the BFI-10. The BFI-10 was created from the basis
of the original long measure of the personality traits of the BFI, developed by John,
Donahue, and Kentle (1991). McCrae and Costa (1987) constructed the Big Five
theory in the late 1980s. John and Srivastava (1999) wrote that the BFI has “now
been performed across a wide range of different language families and are
generally quite supportive of similar underlying covariance structures” (p. 13).
Sample participants were given the BFI-10 form and asked to complete the
form. The scales of the instrument allow an analysis of the participants’ responses

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

9

and determine if they perceive their leaders to have the personal characteristics of
the Big Five based on the scales the BFI-10 utilizes. The BFI-10 utilizes two items
per scale. Rammstedt and John (2007) stated that in order to
guard against capitalization on chance when selecting the “best” two items
in any one sample or measurement context, and to make the resulting
measure more useful, we broadened its generalizability in two ways: we
used multiple samples and required that the short scales had to hold up not
only in US samples but also in another language-and-culture context. (p.
204)
Thus, the current study used the BFI-10 as a follower-focused survey. Also, the
BFI-10 is free for noncommercial use.
The instrument that was be used to measure organizational commitment is a
questionnaire survey based on the internationally validated OCQ form
questionnaire from a follower’s perception of the leader angle. Mowday, Steers,
and Porter (1979) developed the OCQ to create a general measure of organizational
commitment. Kanning and Hill (2015) stated that the reliability of the OCQ has
been well documented. The OCQ consists of a 15-item scale (Mowday, Steers, et
al., 1979). Based on the observed research in existence, the OCQ is the preferred
measurement of organizational commitment. It “requires the respondent to answer
each item on a 7-point rating scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly
agree. The OCQ has been validated using data collected in a variety of different
organizations and job classifications” (Robinson, Simourd, & Porporino, 1990, p.
8). Also, Dirani (2007) stated that the shortened version of the OCQ has shown to
have a substantial positive correlation with the 15-question OCQ and has shown a
reliability of .89. Locus of control was measured using Rotter’s (1966) validated
29-question Internal–External Locus of Control Scale. Rotter developed the
Internal–External Locus of Control Scale where individuals are asked to select
amongst internal and external items that relate to daily situations. Access to the
OCQ is obtained through the journal article written by Mowday, Steers, et al. that
displays the items of the instrument with instructions. Also, the Locus of Control
Scale is accessible to the researcher without associated cost.

Procedure
The link to the surveys was sent via the HBCU Library Alliance listserv and
forwarded by participants to other fellow professionals. Also, the surveys were
administered through a survey website host that allowed users to take the surveys
via webpage. The snowball sampling method was also utilized. This method
created an opportunity to survey individuals who may not have been accessible
through other methods. It allowed the research to extend beyond the parameters of
the researcher’s ability to connect to participants one by one. Snowball sampling is
the method of yielding participants through referrals made among people who share
some characteristic of the research study (Biernacki & Waldorf, 1981).
A purposive sample method was also utilized in addition to the snowball
method. A purposive sample method helps to zero in on the target group (Patton,
1990). Since the research is specifically based on subordinate perception of HBCU
library leaders, the purposive sample method helped to ensure qualified survey
participants. The locus of control and organizational commitment characteristics
were measured using the self-measurement method of the OCQ and Locus of
Control Scales. In addition to the self-measurement of locus of control, study
participants rated the leader’s locus of control based on perception utilizing the
Locus of Control Scales. The Big Five personality traits were measured using the
BFI-10. As stated, the dissertation includes one control variable, one dependent
variable, and six independent variables. The independent variables are the five
dimensions of the Big Five personality traits and locus of control, the dependent
variable is organizational commitment, and the control variable is length of
employment (tenure). Controlling for tenure as a variable that may influence the
relationship between the Big Five personality traits and organizational commitment
helps to minimize confounding effects.
Analysis
This dissertation utilized a hierarchal multiple regression design where the
relationships between the Big Five personality traits and organizational
commitment was examined. Also, locus of control was assessed as a predictor. The

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

11

method of multiple regression “closely implements the general linear model and
thus subsumes methods, such as analysis of variance, that have traditionally been
more commonplace in psychological and educational research” (Keith, 2014, p.
vii).The data analysis was completed using SPSS software. Hypotheses 1-5 were
tested using a hierarchal linear multiregression analysis. The characteristics of The
Big Five personality traits were included in the analysis. To investigate the
relationship between perceptions of the personal characteristics of the Big Five
personality traits and organizational commitment, the five components of the Big
Five were assessed using hierarchal multilinear regression analysis. Also, the
influence of self-measured locus of control and follower’s perception of the
leader’s locus of control were assessed using hierarchal linear multiple regression.
Once the data were placed in SPSS, the regression tab followed by linear tab was
selected. Organizational commitment was placed as the dependent variable. Next,
the control variable was placed in SPSS as a predictor variable followed by the
predictor variables: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and
neuroticism. The model included locus of control entered as a predictor variable.
The time frame for the study was approximately 4 weeks. The surveys were
sent, and respondents had 3 weeks to complete and submit them electronically. The
analysis was anticipated to be completed in a 3-week time frame. The budget for
the study was $26, which was the cost to gain access to SurveyMonkey. The BFI10 is free for noncommercial use. The OCQ and Locus of Control Scale had no
cost. The OCQ was obtained through the journal article written by Mowday, Steers,
et al. (1979) that displays the items of the instrument with instructions. The Locus
of Control Scale was accessed through Rotter‘s (1966) study.

Chapter 2 – Literature Review
The purpose of the current study is to follow up on Neal’s (2005) call for
future research on historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) libraries and
answer the question: “What is the impact of personal characteristics on turnover?”
(p. 42). Literature on this purpose is presented in this chapter. The research
addresses the relationship of personal characteristics of the Big Five personality
traits and locus of control in relation to organizational commitment. Writing a
literature review is a method of demonstrating a researcher’s knowledge about a
specific field of study (Randolph, 2009). This literature review provides
perspicacity and direction for the study by exploring the published data and
information on the subjects mentioned.
Neal (2005) reiterated the importance of retaining employees, arguing,
“Employee turnover is an important measure of the vitality of an organization or a
profession” (p. 39). Neal’s study is imperative to the current study as it aims to
respond to the call for more research and poses the question: What is the impact of
personal characteristics on turnover? As stated previously, research has indicated
that organizational commitment has a negative impact on turnover. Neal described
turnover as being “clearly associated with the concepts of employee-organization
linkages and organizational commitment” (p. 40). In a study conducted on library
turnover in HBCUs, 103 surveys were sent out with the intent of acquiring a record
of individual turnover information dating back to 1947. A total of 51 HBCU library
directors returned completed questionnaires. Utilizing the crude separation rate,
Neal found that in a comparison of data, the results “suggest a lower level of
stability among the library directors in HBCU institutions than ARL [academic
research library] institutions” (p. 41). Neal indicated that between 1998 and 2004,
the average length for HBCU tenure of library directors was 7.6 years; whereas, the
study found the average length of tenure for non-HBCU library directors was 11.7
between 1998 and 2002. This suggests that there is roughly a 4-year difference in
the tenure between turnovers of HBCU library directors compared to academic
research libraries library directors. Youmans (2009) posited that library directors
are facing challenges in retaining library staff. In order to determine if the personal

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

13

characteristics of the Big Five personality traits influence library turnover, the
current study first measures the leaders’ personality on the Big Five factors of
personality based on subordinates’ perception by administering the Big Five
Inventory 10 (BFI-10).
Meyer, Stanley, et al. (2002) studied the relationship of conductive,
continuance, and normative commitment as they relate to antecedents,
consequences, and correlates in Meyer and Allen’s (1991) three-component model.
Meyer, Stanley, et al. stated that an important “rationale for the development of the
Three-Component Model was the belief that, although all three forms of
commitment relate negatively to turnover, they relate differently to measures of
other work-relevant behaviors” (p. 21). Meyer, Stanley, et al. used a meta-analysis
method on Meyer and Allen’s three-component model of commitment. Meyer,
Stanley, et al. reiterated the suggestion that all three forms of commitment related
negatively to withdrawal cognition and turnover. Meyer, Stanley, et al.’s finding s
as they relate to turnover help clarify the reasoning for the use of commitment in
the current study as the dependent variable for addressing the turnover in HBCU
libraries.
Chughtai and Zafar (2006) found that personal characteristics were
significantly related to organizational commitment in a study sampling teaching
professionals.
[If] the employees perceive the leadership of their respective institutions as
dishonest and if they feel that the management is likely to take advantage of
them, the trust is likely to be low and consequently is likely to lead to lower
levels of commitment. (Chughtai & Zafar, 2006, p. 56)
Chughtai and Zafar posited, “Commitment is important because high levels of
commitment lead to several favorable organizational outcomes” (p. 39), and metaanalyses show that commitment is negatively linked to turnover. Chughtai and
Zafar used Mowday, Porter, et al.’s (1982) definition of organizational commitment
and described it as “the relative strength of an individual’s identification with, and
involvement in, a particular organization” (p. 39). One of the hypotheses of the
referenced study states that a relationship exists between organizational

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

14

commitment and personal characteristics, with one of the characteristics being trust.
Conscientiousness, which is one of the Big Five personality traits, enhances trust
between subordinates and leaders, thus making the research important to the current
study.
Cohen (1993) pointed out that a great deal of attention directed towards
organizational commitment is a result of its association with adversely influencing
turnover. Additionally, Huselid and Day (1991) stated that the theme of
organizational commitment in organizational literature with regards to turnover has
been major, specifically when it comes to the discussion of organizational
outcomes. Cohen conducted a study where the purpose “was to examine how the
time elapsed between measurement of the variables can moderate the
organizational commitment-turnover relationship” (p. 1151). Cohen indicated that
age (as it pertained to career stage as the indicator) does moderate the turnover–
commitment relationship. However, tenure as the indicator of career stage does not.
Cohen suggested, “Both methodological and theoretical moderators strongly affect
that relationship” (p. 1151). Cohen added to the existing literature that supports the
indication that a significant relationship between organizational commitment and
turnover exists. The research also has supported the call for more research on the
influences of moderators of organizational commitment.
As stated, Mowday, Porter, et al. (1982) suggested that individuals who are
committed to their organizations are less likely to desire to leave the organization.
Mowday, Porter, et al. stated that the research of organizational commitment will
likely increase as a result of the concern for quality of work life rises (p. 71). The
literature has examined the psychology of organizational commitment by analyzing
existing research and theories. Organizational influence, job characteristics, and
nonorganizational factors are among the elements that Mowday, Porter, et al.
examined. Also, citing O’Reilly and Caldwell (1980) on a study conducted
amongst graduates with MBAs, Mowday, Porter, et al. found that commitment to
the organization tends to be stronger in employees who do not accept the highest
salary, suggesting that commitment is higher in employees who had justification
other than salary for job choice. Mowday, Porter, et al. also posited that more

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

15

empirical and theoretical research is necessary to understand the variables that
promote commitment in organizations. The literature has supported the existence of
the need for more research on antecedents of commitment. This can pertain to
variables such as the personal characteristics of transformational leadership.
McCrae and John (1992) summarized the history and functionality of the
five-component model of the Big Five personality traits. McCrae and John
described the five-factor model as a hierarchal ordering of personality traits. Soto
and Jackson (2013) posited that the Big Five personality traits are intended to
represent the diversity in people’s personalities by using a minimum set of trait
dimensions. The model was slightly ignored until around the 1980s when
researchers began determining that the five factors were instrumental in
personality. Soto and Jackson cited several criticisms of the Big Five personality
traits model, including Ashton and Lee (2007), Block (1995), and McAdams
(1992). Ashton and Lee argued for the inclusion of an honesty–humility trait in
addition to the five traits included in the Big Five personality traits model. Ashton
and Lee supported the idea that a new model called the HEXACO model predicts
personality phenomena that are not currently included in the five-factor model.
Block criticized the “algorithmic method of factor analysis may not provide
dimensions that are incisive” (p. 187). Additionally, McAdams highlighted the
limitations of the five-factor model—one being the failure of the model to provide
a causal relationship explanation for human behavior. However, McAdams did
refer to the five-factor model as being important to personality research. Also,
McCrae and John stated that the five factors of the Big Five personality traits were
found to be validated in instruments across cultures.
Erdheim et al. (2006) conducted a study on the link between the Big Five
personality traits and organizational commitment. The study used Meyer and
Allen’s (1991) three-component model of organizational commitment. Erdheim et
al. posited that one of the reasons the study of organizational commitment is
prominent is its relationship with employee turnover. Researchers have argued that
low organizational commitment makes individuals more likely to leave their
organizations (Erdheim et al., 2006; Meyer & Allen, 1991). Saucier’s (1994) Big

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

16

Five personality markers that consisted of a 40-item Likert scale was used to assess
each of the Big Five personality traits. Organizational commitment was measured
using Meyer and Allen’s (1997) affective, normative, and continuance individual
scales. Erdheim et al., indicated, “The five-factor model serves as an informative
framework in examining the dispositional sources of organizational commitment”
(p. 966). They suggested that extraversion is highly consistent as a predictor.
Edheim et al. found that the relationships between commitment and components of
the Big Five personality traits varied based on the component of organizational
commitment with which it was assessed. For example, Edheim et al. stated, “The
direction of the correlation between Neuroticism and organizational commitment
varied according to the specified component of commitment. Neuroticism
displayed a negative (non-significant) relationship with affective commitment and a
a positive relationship with continuance commitment” (p. 967). One of the
limitations of Edheim’s et al. research was the use of self-measurement. The
current study uses organizational commitment as a single construct and utilizes a
follower perception design for measuring the Big Five personality traits.
Kumar and Bakhshi (2010) studied the influence of the Big Five personality
traits on organizational commitment with a sample of hospital employees.
Although research on the Big Five personality traits has been on the rise in recent
studies, Kumar and Bakhshi argued that not much of the research is centered
around the Big Five’s influence on commitment in organizations. Meyer and Allen
(1991) posited that the psychological characteristics that link an individual to an
organization are important to the employee’s longevity with an organization.
Additionally, the perception by followers of the personal characteristics of a leader
is imperative to the acceptance of the leader (Deller, 2008). Kumar and Bakhshi
used the three-component measure of organizational commitment to assess the
influence of the Big Five personality traits on commitment. Kugar and Bakshi
noted that tenure may be a predictor because of the possibility of it being a
measurement of an individual’s investment within an organization. Thus, the
current study utilizes tenure as control variable. This is important to the review of
literature by adding support for the use of tenure as a control variable in the

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

17

dissertation. Kumar and Bakshsi found that agreeableness predicted normative
influence, neuroticism had a positive relationship with continuance commitment,
and conscientiousness had a positive relationship with normative and continuance
commitment. Overall, the Big Five personality traits measured differently based on
each of the components in the three-component model by Meyer and Allen. Kumar
and Bakhshi suggested that more research be completed on the influence of the Big
Five personality traits and their influence on commitment in varying types of
organizations.
Ganu and Kagutu (2014) began their research study by stating, “The
committed employee is loyal to the organization’s values and proud of being a
member of its work team” (p. 145). Mathieu and Zajac (1990) described
organizational commitment as an attachment of an individual towards a particular
organization. As stated previously, the literature has suggested that commitment is
an antecedent of longer tenure. Therefore, the study of factors that contribute to
commitment in followers is worthy of exploration. The study aimed to examine the
influence of the Big Five personality traits on organizational commitment and job
satisfaction. The sample included 252 healthcare employees. This research also
used self-measurement methods, which sometimes create inaccurate results. Ganu
and Kagato argued that organizational commitment is imperative to the success of
healthcare organizations, as it is for many other organizations. Ganu and Kagato
found, “Conscientiousness, openness, and neuroticism personality traits correlate
positively with organizational commitment” (p. 149).
Hackney (2012) conducted a study to integrate a framework of the
relationships between organizational commitment, the Big Five personality traits,
and job search behaviors. The study utilized the three-component model of
organizational commitment that includes affective, continuance, and normative.
Hackney found that the component conscientiousness had a positive relationship
with the all three components of organizational commitment. Hackney posited that
the “study provides further support to the body of research that suggest that there
are relationships between personality and affective, normative, and continuance
commitment” (p. 42). The three-component model used in the study was introduced

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

18

by Meyer and Allen (1991) as an extension of the single-component model of
Porter, Steers, Mowday, and Boulian (1974). However, in a study of organizational
commitment in an academic setting, Borchers and Teahen (2001) used the singlecomponent measure of commitment. Hackney stated,
By far the most interesting results were found in testing the structural path
between personality constructs and components of organizational
commitment. To date, there are no published empirical studies that test this
relationship. A significant structural path was found between
Conscientiousness, Affective Commitment, and Job Search Behaviors. In
addition, a significant structural path was found between Conscientiousness,
Continuance Commitment and Job Search Behaviors. This supports the
proposition that there is a relationship between these constructs that has not
been fully explained thus far. (p. 44)
Hackney supported the previous findings of an existent relationship between the
Big Five personality traits and organizational commitment, as well as expanded
room for research on the analysis of commitment and the Big Five personality traits
in different organizational settings.
Barrick and Mount (1991) investigated the relationship between the Big
Five personality traits and job performance using a sample of employees from five
different occupations. The findings varied for each component of the Big Five as
they relate to job performance. Most notably, conscientiousness was shown to be
the most predictive in the study. Barrick and Mount posited that validity in
previous research of personality traits was questionable based on the lack of a
framework and organization of the personality traits. However, the Big Five
personality traits model addresses some of this concern. Also, one of the points
brought up in the research was the lack of agreement by researchers on the
description of conscientiousness. Hurtz and Donavan (2000) stated that
conscientiousness was the strongest predictor in a similar study. The research of
Barrick and Mount is important to the current study because it shows the benefit of
using the Big Five personality traits in organizational research.

Kappagoda (2013) sampled 470 English teachers from Sri Lanka in order to
assess the relationship between emotional intelligence and the Big Five personality
traits using the BFI to measure the components of the Big Five. Kappagoda
indicated that all five components of the Big Five personality traits were positively
correlated with emotional intelligence. However, conscientiousness and
neuroticism did not have significant relationships with emotional intelligence.
Kappagoda stated that the “personality types of extraversion, agreeableness, and
openness to experience were strongly correlated with persons’ emotional
intelligence. Emotional Intelligence was not a significant predictor of
conscientiousness and neuroticism” (p. 58). One of the limitations of the research
by Kappagoda is the reliability and utilization of self-measurement solely by
sample participants. Podsakoff and Organ (1986) argued that there are several
issues with self-reporting measures, one in particular being the consistency motif,
which suggests that survey participants attempt to be consistent and rational in
answering survey questions. The consistency motif can cause applicants to not be
as honest as possible when answering questions. However, Kappagoda provided a
look at the Big Five personality traits as a valid model and displayed its
international application, strengthening the case for the usage of the model in its
relation to organizational outcomes.
Panaccio and Vandenberghe (2012) conducted a 1-year longitudinal study
on organizational commitment and the Big Five personality traits in employees of
various organizations. Panccio and Vandenberghe argued that personality is often
overlooked in commitment literature. Panccio and Vandenbergh indicated,
“Extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism predicted change in organizational
commitments partly through the mediating influence of positive and negative
affective states” (p. 16). In consensus with research of Smith and Canger (2004),
Panaccio and Vandenbergh indicated that conscientiousness negatively influenced
organizational commitment. Panaccio and Vandenbergh indicated a meaningful
relationship exists between personality dimensions and commitment.
Cho et al. (2015) posited that researchers’ findings of organizational
commitment having an influence on organizational outcomes such as turnover

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

20

prompted an examination of the factors that form organizational commitment. Cho
et al. showed that the Big Five personality traits model as a whole is significantly
associated with the three components of commitment, as other empirical studies
such as Erdheim et al. (2006) have also shown. Agreeableness showed to have the
strongest influence on affective and normative commitment. Also, openness had a
strong influence on the three components. Cho et al. stated that researchers and
practitioners would benefit from exploring all five traits of the Big Five. Cho et al.
also posited that collectivist organizations may benefit even more from the Big
Five personality traits model. If highly committed employees are valuable assets,
research should nurture the commitment in employees (Cho et al., 2015). The
current research takes a closer examination of the five personality traits and their
practical relationship with commitment. As HBCU libraries are facing many
different obstacles, such as funding, employee turnover, and an ever-changing role
in academia, practicality is an important component of implementation. Libraries
are one of the key arenas for learning in any academic environment (Youmans,
2009), which makes them imperative. Cho et al. provided forwardness in the study
of the Big Five personality traits model and it practicality to commitment that
antecedes turnover.
Avolio et al. (2004) posited that the perception of leadership is extremely
important in organizations. The current study uses a follower perception approach
in assessing the components of the Big Five personality traits and locus of control,
which makes the research by Avolio et al. relevant. “The hierarchical structure of
the hospital set-up offered a ‘natural’ setting for studying how distance may affect
perceptions of leadership and, in turn, the effects of leadership on organizational
commitment” (Avolio et al., 2004, p. 955). Although the study focused on the
relationship between transformational leadership and organizational commitment, it
also discussed findings that relate to the current study pertaining to commitment.
For example, Avolio et al. posited that the theoretical implications of the study
included the indication that a more holistic understanding of what drives levels of
employee commitment may need to include some focus on how empowered
followers feel within the relationship they have with supervisors. The current

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

21

research assesses locus of control, which does provide a measurement of how much
control followers feel and how it influences organizational commitment.
Organizational commitment is attitudinal (Mowday, Steers, et al., 1979).
Smith and Canger (2004) conducted research with the intent of utilizing the Big
Five personality traits in order to investigate the relationship of personality on
attitudes in organizations. Smith and Canger posited that it would be safe to say
that leaders have a great deal of influence on organizations and outcomes.
Therefore, personal characteristics of a leader’s personality may influence attitudes
in followers. Smith and Canger argued that followers may find it more enjoyable to
work for a leader who is approachable versus one who instills fear. As previously
stated, the Big Five personality traits place five components into meaningful
categories (Smith & Canger, 2004). In order to measure the five personality traits,
Smith and Canger used the 485-item Career Factors Inventory (CFI). However
Smith and Canger’s research was being conducted at the same time as the
development of the CFI instrument and the results only included 60 items out of the
485 in the assessment of results. Overall, Smith and Canger found “subordinates
had more positive job-related attitudes when supervisors had higher levels of
Emotional Stability, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, but lower levels of
Conscientiousness” (p. 476). These outcomes have not been properly assessed in
HBCU library organizations; the current study explores the influences of these
personal personality characteristics within the referenced organization to extend the
literature.
Chhabra (2013) posited that there is growing evidence that aspects of
cognitive style such as locus of control are related to organizational commitment.
Chhabra posited, “Locus of Control was found to moderate the relationship
between job satisfaction and organizational commitment such that the relationship
was stronger for internals than for externals” (p. 25). Chhabra argued that the
methods in which organizations stimulate commitment is imperative to its success.
Locus of control is a personal characteristic that influences individuals’ views of
situation control. Chhabra stated that the findings of the study are consistent with
previous research in that employees with internal locus of control were shown to be

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

22

“more satisfied with their job, thus leading to more Organizational Commitment”
(p. 36). The research by Chhabra is relevant to the current study as it extends the
indication that locus of control does moderate relationships with commitment
outcomes.
Spector (1988) developed the Work Locus of Control Scale to provide
assessment for individuals’ beliefs about control in the work place. Spector
provided full access to the Work Locus of Control Scale; responses of the
instrument ascended from disagree very much to agree very much. Spector’s
instrument consists of 16 items that measure internal and external locus of control.
Spector found the Work Locus of Control Scale “to correlate significantly with job
satisfaction, intention of quitting, perceived influence at work, role stress and
perceptions of supervisory style” (p. 335). Spector introduced a validated
alternative measure to Rotter’s (1966) Internal–External Locus of Control measure,
which expands the locus of control literature. Spector argued that the Internal–
External Locus of Control Scale lacks the ability to properly measure work-related
variables. However, Rotter’s measure of locus of control has been dominate in
research as the preferred measure (Igbeneghu & Popoola, 2011). The current study
utilizes Rotter’s measure.
As stated, commitment is often viewed as an antecedent to turnover
intentions (Paré, Tremblay, & Lolande, 2000). Sarwar et al. (2013) explored the
impact on the Big Five personality traits and their influence on turnover in public
and private organization employees. Research that sheds light on ways to improve
organizational commitment and decrease employee turnover has great benefits and
practicality to organizations. Particularly in HBCU libraries, Neal (2005) noticed
the disparity in tenure versus tenure in academic research libraries. Youmans
(2009) posited that there is a shortage of literature pertaining to HBCU libraries,
which makes the current research imperative. Sarwar et al. argued, “One of the
biggest challenges faced by organizations is employee turnover that are having an
impact on the current state of organizations productivity Persona which means a
cover or mask used by theater and performance” (p. 1249). Sarwar et al. assessed
the relationship of each of the components of the Big Five personality traits with

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

23

turnover and found that extraversion, emotional stability, conscientiousness, and
agreeableness were negatively related to an employee’s intent to quit. However,
openness to experience was positively related to turnover intent. Sarwar et al.
explored the Big Five personality traits from a self-perspective approach of the
research participants and displayed the versatility of the influences of the
components of the Big Five.
Judge et al. (2009) also investigated the Big Five personality traits. The
influence of the Big Five on career success was the focus of the research study.
Judge et al. cited Goldberg (1990) by stating that essentially all personality traits
can be placed under one of the five components of the Big Five personality traits.
Judge et al. found that the longitudinal study indicated that personality traits are
capable of being predictors of career success. Also, Judge et al. found that the Big
Five personality traits as a collective showed significant variance in career success.
Judge et al. stated that the personality traits that predict career success are the same
traits that predict organizational success that leads to commitment. Of the five
personality traits, conscientiousness and low neuroticism had the strongest
influence on career success in the study.
Spagnoli and Caetano (2012) explored the Big Five personality traits further
by assessing the mediating effect of work satisfaction on the relationship between
personality and organizational commitment. They found that satisfaction with
human resources mediated the relationship “between openness to experience and
normative commitment; satisfaction with the work itself completely mediated the
relationship between conscientiousness and normative commitment whereas it
partially mediated the relationship between extroversion and affective
commitment” (p. 268). Spagnoli and Caetano stated that research on commitment
and personality is sparse in the literature and it would be worthwhile to empirically
explore the relationship more. Erdheim et al. (2006, as cited in Spagnoli &
Caetano, 2012) stated “that extroversion was positively associated with affective,
normative and continuance commitment; neuroticism, conscientiousness and
openness to experience were significantly related to continuance commitment;
agreeableness was significantly associated with normative commitment” (p. 259).

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

24

One of the limitations of the study was the self-report measure of personality traits.
Spagnoli and Caetano recognized the limitation; however, they recognized that the
method is acceptable.
Coleman et al. (1999) stated that previous studies have shown that
individuals with high external locus of control are least likely to be committed to
organizations, and individuals with high internal locus of control are more likely to
be committed to organizations. The possible influence of locus of control is
hypothesized to exist and affect organizational commitment. Coleman et al. argued,
The three-component model of commitment is important because, although
all three forms of commitment decrease the likelihood of individuals
leaving an organization, there are different antecedents and consequences
associated with each form of commitment. Consequently, managers should
be aware of the manner in which their employees are committed to the
organization and attempt to foster affective commitment in their employees.
(p. 996)
However, LaMastro (2000) posited that the approach to organizational commitment
by Mowday, Porter, et al. (1982) was possibly the most thoroughly investigated and
focused on affective commitment. Therefore, the current study uses the unistructured model of organizational commitment by Mowday, Porter, et al.
Coleman et al. reemphasized the findings of other studies that suggest locus of
control influences organizational commitment.
Davenport (2010) stated that locus of control can have attitudinal effects on
employees, and it would benefit organizational leaders to be aware of the
underlying locus of control of subordinates in order to better understand their
motivation. Davenport conducted a study on leadership and organizational
commitment with the moderating effects of locus of control. Davenport supported
the suggestion that locus of control has a significant impact on organizational
commitment. However, the hypothesis that stated locus of control influences the
relationship between leadership style and organizational commitment was rejected.
Davenport noted that the research used the most common measure of locus of
control—Rotter’s (1966) instrument. One of the control variables used in the

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

25

research was gender, which is also used in the current study. Tenure consistently
appears in the literature as a control variable when discussing organizational
commitment. Wright and Bonett (2002) found that the tenure of a person “had a
very strong nonlinear moderating effect on the commitment-performance
correlation” (p. 1183). Davenport’s sample included participants that had some
level of relationship with the researcher. This was mentioned in the limitations of
the study. Therefore, there may have been a possible bias in the sample’s
responses.
Methods
The selection of methodology is imperative to research approach. Antonakis
et al. (2004) stated that leadership researchers usually utilize quantitative research
methods:
Quantitative methods should be utilized when the phenomenon under study
needs to be measured, when hypotheses need to be tested, when
generalizations are required to be made of the measures, and when
generalizations need to be made that are beyond chance occurrences. (p. 54)
However, qualitative methods are also necessary elements in leadership research.
Conger (1998) argued that qualitative approaches in leadership allow the research
to be more flexible and are more equipped for complexity. The current study uses a
quantitative approach to measure the relationships between the Big Five personality
traits and organizational commitment as well as the relationship between locus of
control and organizational commitment. Antonakis et al. suggested that this is the
best approach.
Greene and Caracelli (1997) emphasized the exploration of mixed-methods
research and overviewed its challenges and benefits. However, within the literature,
quantitative methods have also been discussed. The current study uses Greene and
Caracelli’s literature to better understand the characteristics of a quantitative study.
Also, the literature was used to compare methods. Thus, allowing for the
conclusion of utilizing quantitative methods is better suited for the dissertation. As
stated in Chapter 1, Greene and Caracelli described the importance of validity in

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

26

quantitative research and stated that the quantitative method is defined by validity.
Bavelas (1995) noted that quantitative research is largely associated with empirical
findings, whereas qualitative may be viewed as nonempirical.
Sample
The sample of the dissertation includes followers or subordinates in HBCU
library organizations. Examining the values of the perception of the follower
towards the leader is a great method in leadership studies. Yukl (2002) argued that
follower perception is imperative to leadership development. Yukl also argued that
influence is imperative to leadership. Therefore, the influence of leadership on
follower attitude would fall into this theory. Yukl based the text on the paradigm of
organizational leadership. When trait theory is mentioned, the Big Five personality
traits are discussed also in the text. Yukl argued that personality traits are extremely
influential on leadership success.
Additionally, Yukl (2008) stated that the component of openness of the Big
Five personality traits is imperative to leaders who are expected to adopt to a
changing organizational environment. The literature has suggested that follower
perception and the components of the Big Five personality traits are instrumental in
successful leadership.
Camp (1994) completed research on organizational commitment and
utilized tenure as a control variable. Although in differing organizations and
circumstances, Camp’s research problem is closely associated with that of the
current dissertation’s problem statement. Camp stated, “Turnover among
correctional workers creates persistent staffing problems for correctional
administrators” (p. 279). Camp utilized the Organizational Commitment
Questionnaire (OCQ) of Porter et al. (1974). Camp noted that the measure is more
effective for the type of commitment that the study measures, which is essentially
affective commitment. The use of tenure as one of the control variables in Camp’s
research explains the basis of the use of the control variable in the current
dissertation. Camp stated, “Organizational tenure will exert a strong, negative
influence on turnover” (p. 15). Camp referenced Hodson’s (1991) argument of
attitudinal measures like organizational commitment being too flawed to be

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

27

affective in research. However, Camp argued that organizational commitment is an
important measurement in leadership, echoing the findings of Lincoln and
Kalleberg (1990). Lincoln and Kalleberg indicated that organizational commitment
is a predictor of turnover.
Kovjanic et al. (2012) also used tenure as a control variable in a study
assessing the mediating effects of followers’ needs on several organizational
outcomes, including employee commitment to the supervisor. It is important to
note that Kovjanic et al. related affective commitment to commitment to the
supervisor and argued that it is has a stronger influence on organizational
outcomes, based on Becker, Billings, Eveleth, and Gilbert (1996). However,
Kovjanic et al. also cited Meyer and Allen (1997), stating, “Past research has
consistently shown that a sense of personal significance for the organization has
been the strongest antecedent of affective commitment” (p. 1037). Kovjanic et al.
used tenure as a control variable in the research and stated that “leader–follower
dyadic tenure are related to affective commitment” (p. 1039). This shows the
consistency in tenure being used as a control variable in studies that include
organizational commitment.
Cox (2008) conducted research on forgiveness in the workplace. Cox’s
research is relevant because the premise of the literature is to assess an attitudinal
outcome, which in Cox’s research includes forgiveness. Cox indicated that the
hypotheses were correct and stated that a trustworthy climate does relate to
trustworthiness in the workplace. Cox explained that control variables are
imperative to a study and are necessary for explaining additional variance in
research outcomes. Cox also stated that tenure is important in organizational
studies because strength in relationships has the possibility to grow over time and
can influence organizational outcomes. The number of participants needed for a
sample is as important as any other aspect of the research. Hair (2006) simplified
the analysis of research by providing in-depth examples of research analysis. Hair
stated that sample size of a study can be determined by accounting for roughly 1015 participants per variable. The current study uses this method in identifying the
number of participants needed.

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

Instruments
Reed et al. (1994) used the Locus of Control Scale by Rotter (1966) as a
component of their research based on the impact of locus of control and gender on
organizational commitment, turnover intentions, and job satisfaction. One of the
reasons organizational commitment and locus of control is important to an
organization is because “dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the job and/or a lack
of commitment to the employing organization can cause individuals to search for
alternative positions” (Reed et al., 1994). Individuals who perceive themselves to
have little control over outcomes would be perceived as having a high level of
external locus of control. Reed et al. stated, “The origins of an individual’s locus of
control may reflect a view of the social, political, economic, and structural
environment in which that person resides” (p. 32). Reed et al. explored the
relationship between individuals’ perceptions of their relationship to their world as
proved by locus of control. The results are used to asses weather women are limited
with societal support that contributes to their perception. Reed et al. also found that
the “importance of an individual’s locus of control in explaining potential turnover
certainly appears to be gender-related” (p. 52). However, Ng and Butts (2009)
found that locus of control had a significant relationship with the intent of an
employee to stay with an organization in a study that included men and women.
Rotter’s (1966) locus of control is a topic that has been widely studied and
explored throughout research literature. Locus of control applies to the strong belief
individuals have as it pertains to their ability to influence and control outcomes in
their lives. Persons who have a high level of internal locus of control believe they
are accountable for the outcomes of events in their lives. To the contrary,
individuals with high levels of external locus of control believe they have less
influence on the occurrences and outcomes in their lives. They tend to believe that
fate, chance, and those in positions of authority have more influence (Rotter, 1966).
The Internal–External Locus of Control Scale includes a forced-choice 23-item
scale that assesses “whether a person has a tendency to think situations and events
are under their own control or under the control of external influences” (Rotter,

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

29

2011, p. 10). Rotter (2011) noted researchers who have challenged that the scale
does not adequately measure what it was intended to measure. For example, Borich
and Paver (1974) stated that the high rate of convergent validity and the low rate of
discriminant validity indicate that the Locus of Control Scale may not be measuring
the constructs they claim to measure. However, the Locus of Control Scale is a
validated instrument and has been used extensively in various situations (Rotter,
2011).
Lee (2013) measured locus of control in a research study and its influence
on organizational identification. The research was based on the banking industry in
Taiwan. Lee used Rotter’s (1966) Locus of Control Scale and highlighted the broad
usage of the scale even in foreign countries. Lee indicated that locus of control does
influence organizational identification. The research was more focused on locus of
control as a whole versus the individual components and found the Cronbach’s
alpha to be .813. However, one of the limitations of the study was the small sample
size; 102 participants were included in the sample results. Lee suggested that more
studies be completed to contribute to the progress of the literature.
The OCQ was created by Mowday, Steers, et al. (1979) and has proven to
be an effective and reliable measurement instrument. The OCQ was created “based
on a series of studies among 2563 employees in nine divergent organizations”
(Mowday, Steers, et al., 1979, p. 224). Sheldon (1971) posited that attitudinal
commitment is a form of commitment where individuals attach their identity to the
organization. Mowday, Steers, et al. argued that it is highly unlikely that any
measure of attitudinal characteristics would be acceptable if based off of literal
interpretation of standards established by Campell and Fiske (1959). Mowday,
Steers, et al. posited that under the measurement standards of other widely accepted
attitudinal measurements, the OCQ has acceptable validity and reliability. Kanning
and Hill (2015) conducted a study to validate and translate the English version of
the OCQ into four additional languages that included Polish, Hungarian, Spanish,
and Malay. The translation was successfully completed and documented in the
literature. Kanning and Hill stated that the OCQ is one of the most regarded
measurements of commitment and adequately relates to affective commitment.

30

Although, Meyer and Allen (1991) suggested that organizational commitment is
three dimensional.
Ismail and Yousouf (2009) used the uni-structural OCQ to measure the
relationship among transformational leadership, empowerment, and organizational
commitment. The OCQ included 12 items with a seven-item scale that ranged from
strongly disagree to strongly agree. Ismail and Yousouf tested the reliability and
validity of the scale for the research using the Kaiser–Mayer–Olkin measure; the
results were acceptable. Ismail and Yousouf showed that empowerment does
mediate the relationship between organizational commitment and transformational
leadership. Dirani (2007) explained that the shortened version of the OCQ has been
shown to have a significant correlation with the original OCQ. Dirani stated that
several researchers have used the OCQ for empirical distinctions between
measurements of commitment. Dirani used the OCQ to address the research
question: Is the learning organization culture related to organizational
commitment? The results indicated that a significant moderate relationship does
exist between the two. Robinson et al. (1990) also discussed the one-dimensional
OCQ to complete research on the commitment of employees to the correctional
work and service of Canada. Robinson et al. developed an outline for research on
staff commitment and posited that, according to the research literature, the
measurement of choice for assessing organizational commitment is the OCQ.
Mowday, Steers, et al. (1979) tested the OCQ in a variety of settings showing
validation. Also, Cohen (2007) tested the one-dimensional and multidimensional
models of the OCQ and found that the OCQ was acceptable in measuring affective
commitment.
The BFI is a 44-item questionnaire created by John, Donahue, et al. (1991)
in order to measure the five personality dimensions of openness, conscientiousness,
extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The BFI was originally designed to
be used as a self-report by John, Donahue, et al. and has been widely used.
Validation has been shown in a wide scenario of studies, including research by
Fossati, Borroni, Marchione, and Maffei (2011). Rammstedt and John (2007) stated
that in the late 1980s when John, Donahue, et al. developed the BFI, it was

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

31

considered a short instrument. Rammstedt and John posited that what seemed to be
a short survey instrument in the 1980s is now considered long. Therefore,
Rammstedt and John developed the BFI-10, which consists of 10 survey items that
measure the five personality traits. The sample groups used when formulating the
BFI-10 included three U.S. groups and two German groups. Two items from the
original BFI were selected per each of the Big Five personality traits. Rammstedt
and John stated that this measure was taken “so that each BFI-10 scale would
consist of one true-scored and one false-scored item” (p. 205). Rammstedt and John
found that even with the BFI-10 scales including less than 25% of the full items on
the BFI-44 scales, the results indicated that they predicted approximately 70% of
the variance of the full scales.
McCrae and Costa (1987) conducted research to validate the Big Five
personality traits model. One reason for the research was based on the criticism of
fellow researchers such as Mischel (1968, as cited in McCrea & Costa, 1987) and
Block (1977, as cited in McCrea & Costa, 1987) on the inadequacies of personality
trait research. McCrea and Costa’s research to test the validity of the Big Five
personality traits model included the use of two instruments; they used the NEO
Personality Inventory in two forms. McCrae and Costa stated that peer-assessed
and self-reviewed methods were used with adjective factors and questionnaire
scales. McCrae and Costa showed significant nonlinear agreement on all five
components of the Big Five, strengthening the argument for the taxonomy of the
personality traits. John and Srivastava (1999) argued that the Big Five personality
trait model should be able to distinguish, order, and name characteristics that would
be founded upon casual or dynamic relationships. John and Srivistava stated that
the Big Five personality traits models has not yet come to this point. However, an
advantage of the Big Five model is its ability to relay common categorical terms
that provide a clear understanding of terms (John & Srivstava, 1999). Although
researchers have disagreed on the meanings of the five components (McCrea &
Costa, 1987), there is a common broad level of understanding.

Procedures
The purposive sample method is used in the current study. Patton (1990)
described purposive sampling as being greatly appropriate for information-rich
research. Patton placed the snowball sampling method under the umbrella of
purposive sampling. Patton posited that purposive sampling is more common in
qualitative approaches because of the small sample sizes needed. The snowball
sample is one of the data collection methods used in the current study. The method
is well suited for a variety of research scenarios and is applicable when knowledge
from insiders is needed for research (Biernacki & Waldorf, 1981). The current
research requires participants that may not be accessible to the researcher without
the snowball method. The snowball sample works as somewhat of a chain referral
system (Biernacki & Waldorf, 1981). Some of the criticisms of the snowball
sampling method are derived from researchers who have felt the method is not
specific enough (Biernacki & Waldorf, 1981). However, ultimately “what is crucial
is that the sampling procedures and decisions be fully described, explained, and
justified so that information users and peer reviewers have the appropriate context
for judging the sample” (Patton, 1990, p. 186).
Analysis
The analysis of the research is based on the hierarchal multiple regression
method. Keith (2014) stated that multiple regression provides a near
implementation of the linear model and includes an analysis of variance. Keith also
stated that multiple regression generally falls under one of two categories:
prediction or explanation. Keith described prediction as a general purpose for
which multiple regression is used. Keith posited that statements of the effect of one
variable on another is not necessarily the researcher’s interest. Still, multiple
regression does have some disadvantages. One of the biggest theoretical limitations
of multiple regression is that relationships can only be determined lacking
definitive causal findings (Hill & Lewicki, 2007). However, being as accurate as
possible in predicting an outcome is sometimes more pertinent (Keith, 2014).

Chapter 3 – Method
The purpose of the study was to address the call for more research by Neal
(2005) in addressing the question: What role do personal characteristics play in
employee turnover in libraries at historically Black colleges and universities
(HBCU)? The research question was addressed by assessing the influence of the
Big Five personality traits and locus of control on organizational commitment. The
research used a quantitative research methodology. Steckler, McLeroy, Goodman,
Bird, and McCormick (1992) stated that researchers tend to distance themselves
from study participants when utilizing quantitative methods in order to maximize
objectivity. Steckler et al. also stated that instruments with predetermined response
categories are generally used in quantitative studies. The quantitative approach
remains dominant in leadership studies and the Multifactor Leadership
Questionnaire is one of the most widely used instruments to investigate leadership
(Keshtiban, 2013). Surveys were sent to employees at each of the 106 HBCUs. As
stated, the Big Five personality traits, locus of control, and their influence on
organizational commitment was assessed in the current study. Presented in this
chapter is a description of the research question and hypotheses, research design,
the variables and measurement instruments utilized, data collection, and data
analysis method.
Hypothesis and Research Problem
The problem that the research addresses is the turnover rate in libraries at
HBCUs by examining the influence of the Big Five personality traits and locus of
control on organizational commitment.
Hyptohesis 1 follows:
H1:

Perceived Big Five personality traits of library directors have a
positive influence on organizational commitment in library
employees of HBCUs.

Hypothesis 1 is expanded for each dimension of the Big Five personality
traits model, which include openness (to experience), conscientiousness,

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

34

extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (easily remembered with the acronym
OCEAN), as follows:
H1a:

Follower-perceived openness of library directors has a positive
relationship with organizational commitment in followers.

H1b:

Follower-perceived conscientiousness of library directors has a
positive relationship with organizational commitment in followers.

H1c:

Follower-perceived extraversion of library directors has a positive
relationship with organizational commitment in followers.

H1d:

Follower-perceived agreeableness of library directors has a positive
relationship with organizational commitment in followers.

H1e:

Follower-perceived neuroticism of library directors has a positive
relationship with organizational commitment in followers.

Hackney (2012) found conscientiousness to have a positive influence on
organizatioanl commitment. Hackney also cited Naquin and Holton (2002) and
stated that they have completed research that indicates a positive correlation
between all of the Big Five personality traits and affective commitment. However,
Hackney stated that other studies have conflicting results on the influences of all
five dimensions of the Big Five model. Organizational commitment in the
hypothesis represents the definition used by Mowday, Steers, et al. (1979) that
states it is an “attitudinal commitment thus represents a state in which an individual
identifies with a particular organization and its goals and wishes to maintain
membership in order to facilitate these goals” (p. 225).
H2:

Internal locus of control of the follower has a positive relationship
with organizational commitment in followers.

H3:

External locus of control of the follower has a negative relationship
with organizational commitment in followers.

H4:

Follower-perceived internal locus of control of the leader has a
positive relationship with organizational commitment in followers.

H5:

Follower-perceived internal locus of control of the leader has a
positive relationship with organizational commitment in followers.

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

35

Igbeneghu and Popoola (2011) defined locus of control as a personal
characteristic that describes individuals’ view of the main causes of events in life.
Syahputra (2014) posited that several studies have found that internal locus of
control positively influences organizational commitment. Syahputra suggested that
external locus of control has a negative influence on commitment.
Research Design
The research design includes a nonexperimental quantitative approach.
According to Muijs (2004), nonexperimental research is generally research that
includes surveys, historical data, or observation and analysis of existing data.
Nonexperimental data usually involves research where the dependent variable
cannot be controlled and the researcher often relies on surveys. The current study
does include the utilization of survey design. Creswell (2013) posited, “In
quantitative studies, researchers advance the relationship among variables and pose
this in terms of questions or hypotheses” (p. 8). The quantitative approach was
most appropriate for the current study based on the research problem and
hypotheses. Muijs described quantitative research as, in essence, gathering
numerical data to explain a specific phenomenon and stated that specific questions
can be immediately suitable for quantitative design or collected in a quantitative
approach—such as in the current research. The Organizational Commitment
Questionnaire (OCQ), Internal–External Locus of Control Scale, and Big Five
Inventory (BFI) are all validated, quantitative measurement instruments that were
used in this study.
Measures
The OCQ (Mowday, Steers, et al., 1979), Internal–External Locus of
Control Scale (Rotter, 1966), and the BFI (Rammstedt & John, 2007) were used.
These instruments have been widely utilized and are validated measures.
Measurement validity is particularly pertinent if the scoring of cases sufficiently
reflects the concept the researcher is attempting to measure (Adcock & Collier,
2001). All three instruments have been tested and validated in previous research.
There is one dependent variable in the current study: organizational commitment.

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

36

The OCQ (Mowday, Steers, et al., 1979) includes 15 items with a 7-point
Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Reverse scoring was
utilized for items that are negatively phrased. There are six independent variables.
One of them is locus of control. Rotter (1996) created the 29-item Locus of Control
Scale, which was used to measure internal and external locus of control. The
remaining five independent variables are based on the components of the Big Five
personality traits—openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion,
agreeableness, and neuroticism—which were measured individually by utilizing the
10-item BFI-10 (Rammstedt & John, 2007). The BFI was reworded for sample
participants to rank their library leaders (e.g., in lieu of stating, “I see myself as
someone who,” it stated, “I see my director/library leader as someone who”).
Because tenure is a control variable in this study, each survey instrument asked
participants to identify if they have been employed with the organization for at least
a year.
Independent Variables
The independent variables are the five dimensions of The Big Five
personality traits consisting of openness to experience, conscientiousness,
extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. An additional independent variable
used in the research is locus of control. The influence of the independent variables
on organizational commitment was explored in the research. Kerlinger (1986)
stated that the independent variable is generally manipulated by the researcher.
Big Five Personality Traits
Participants completed the BFI-10 survey instrument, which Rammstedt
and John (2007) developed as a short form of the original and well-proven BFI
created by John, Donahue, et al. (1991). The instrument changed to reflect a
follower perception model. For example, in lieu of saying, “I see myself as,” the
survey stated, “I view my leader as.” Each of the five dimensions of the Big Five
personality traits were used as individual independent variables in the current study
and measured by the BFI-10. According to Rammstedt and John, the original BFI
was considered a short instrument upon its creation in the late 1980s consisting of

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

37

only 44 items. However, in today’s research, the original BFI would not be
considered a short survey instrument. Therefore, the creation of the BFI-10 made
sense. The BFI-10 utilizes two items from each scale of the original BFI.
One of the ways to deter the challenge of chance in selecting the best two
items from the original BFI was to use “multiple samples and require that the short
scales have to hold up not only in US samples but also in another language-andculture context, namely Germany” (Rammstedt & John, 2007, p. 204). The sample
in validating the BFI-10 included 726 students at a large American university, 726
students at a private American university, 457 German students, 376 German
Students, and 75 American dog owners. Rammstedt and John found that the two
scales used for the BFI-10 compare very well to the original BFI. The overall mean
correlation of the BFI-10 was .83 and mean retest stability coefficients showed.75
overall between the U.S. and German-based sample, suggesting that the BFI-10
scales achieved respectable levels of stability (Rammstedt & John, 2007). Also,
theintercorrelations range averaged .11, which Rammstedt and John posited
provides great evident of discriminant validity.
Locus of Control
Locus of control was measured using the Internal-External Locus of Control
Scale (Rotter, 1966). Participants were asked to complete the scale twice—once
from a follower perception point of view and again from a self-evaluation
perception. The scale uses a forced-choice survey method. Respondents who the
scale shows to have high internal locus of control are individuals who believe that
they have more control over the events and outcomes of their lives. Respondents
who score high on external locus of control believe that they have less control over
events and outcomes in their lives. Rotter’s final version of the scale included 29
items. Rotter made it clear that the responses to the items included in the survey are
based solely on the survey taker’s beliefs. The Internal–External Locus of Control
Scale showed a stable internal consistency, and test–retest reliability remained
consistent in two separate sample groups. Rotter used several different sample
groups and found satisfactory validity in the groups. Rotter also stated that KuderRichardson reliabilities are limited in the Locus of Control Scale because of the

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

38

forced-choice scale. Rotter stated that the most “significant evidence of the
construct validity of the I-E scale comes from predicted differences in behavior for
individuals above and below the median of the scale or from correlations with
behavioral criteria” (p. 25).
Dependent Variable
The dependent variable in the current study is organizational commitment.
Fraenkel, Wallen, and Hyun (1993) described the dependent variable as one that is
influenced or expected to be influenced by the independent variable. Fraenkel et al.
also noted that the dependent variable is sometimes called the criterion or outcome
variable. The research assessed organizational commitment in followers to
determine its relationship with the Big Five personality traits and locus of control.
The participants were asked to measure the commitment to the organization
by using the OCQ, which is a one-dimensional instrument that measures
organizational commitment (Mowday, Steers, et al., 1979). The OCQ was used to
measure organizational commitment in followers employed at HBCU libraries.
Mowday, Steers, et al. (1979) stated that the approach to the development of the
OCQ was to identify 15 items that represented the aspects of their definition of
commitment. The instrument is based on a 7-point Likert scale that ranges from
strongly agree to strongly disagree. The results are then added and divided by 15 to
represent a summary indication of employee commitment.
In the validation process, Mowday, Steers, et al. (1979) administered the
OCQ to 2,563 individuals who were employees in a variety of organizations. The
authors found that the OCQ had a mean level ranging from 4.0 to a 6.1 across the
samples used. Also, Mowday, Steers, et al. found the standard deviation to be
acceptable in the validation process of the OCQ. Internal consistency and reliability
were calculated by coefficient of reliability, item analysis, and factor analysis.
Mowday, Steers, et al. stated that the results of the coefficient of reliability compare
well with other attitudinal measures and had a Cronbach’s alpha of .82 to .93 with a
median of .90. Also, Mowday, Steers, et al. found that “each item had a positive
correlation with the total score for the OCQ, with the range of average correlations

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

39

being from .36 to .72, and a median correlation of .64” (p. 232). The factor analysis
revealed that the OCQ does measure an underlying single construct, as predicted by
the authors, and indicated convergent consistency validity. Additionally, Mowday,
Steers, et al. found that commitment was a better and more stable predictor of
turnover than other measures.
Control Variables
Tenure is the only control variable used in the current study. Data were
collected on research subjects’ control variables, which includes tenure. The control
variable was reported on a forced-choice nominal scale with the intent of limiting
bias responses.
Data Collection
The HBCU Library Alliance web site houses a directory of HBCU libraries
and members to which the research had access. The researcher sent members an
email address that included a link to SurveyMonday where the surveys were
available. Data were collected from library employees of HBCUs using purposive
and snowball sampling methods. Participants were asked to forward the surveys to
fellow HBCU library directors to encourage completion. The survey measured the
Big Five personality traits, locus of control, and organizational commitment. The
participants were asked to identify if they have been employed in an HBCU library
for at least 1 year and to complete the surveys according to their organizational
experiences.
The demographic level recorded of participants is tenure (length of
employment). There are eight variables (one control, one dependent, and six
independent). Hair (2006) stated that sample size should be calculated based on 1520 participants per variable. The current research collected data from a sample size
of 120 library employees at HBCUs. A high response rate from participants was
initially anticipated in the research. Surveys were sent to each member of the
existing 106 HBCUs. All participants were informed that the surveys completed by
each participant would remain anonymous and not jeopardize any relationships

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

40

with superiors. Also, “anonymity for respondents/participants is assumed to be an
integral feature of ethical research” (Grinyer, 2002, p. 1).
Data Analysis
The analysis of the research was based on the hierarchal multiple regression
method. The results and data of all three of the survey instruments used in the study
were input into SPSS. Hypotheses 1a-1e predict the influence of perception of each
of the five dimensions of the Big Five personality traits in library leaders at HBCUs
on organizational commitment in followers. Hypotheses 2-5 predict the influence
of internal and external locus of control. The Internal–External Locus of Control
Scale has two separate sets of data—one representing follower perception and the
other representing self-evaluation.
The data analysis was completed using SPSS software. Hypotheses 1 and 2
were tested using a hierarchal multiregression analysis. Once the data are placed in
SPSS, the regression tab followed by linear tab was selected. Organizational
commitment was placed as the dependent variable. Next, the control variable was
placed in SPSS followed by the predictor variables: openness to experience,
conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The steps were
repeated using follower perception of locus of control as a predictor variable. Any
shared variability between the control and independent variables was displayed in
the output results. The steps were completed a third time using self-measured locus
of control as a predictor variable. Model 1 represents the five components of the
Big Five personality traits with organizational commitment. Model 2 represents the
follower perception of locus of control with organizational commitment. Model 3
represents perception of locus of control of the leader and organizational
commitment.

Chapter 4 – Results
This chapter presents the results and analysis of the research. The purpose
of this quantitative study was to examine the influence of the perception of the Big
Five personality traits and locus of control on organizational commitment in
libraries at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) by surveying
subordinate employees of the organizations. The three instruments used to collect
data in the study were the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ), the
Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10), and the Internal–External Locus of Control Scale.
Chapter 4 begins with a summary of the response rate, followed by the analysis
process. Instrument reliability, data analysis results, the research hypotheses, and
hierarchal multiple regression summaries follow. The chapter closes with a
summary of the findings.
Sample
The sample size consisted of current subordinate employees of libraries at
HBCUs. The link to the invitation to complete the survey was listed on The HBCU
Library Alliance listserv. Also, a total of 106 email invitations that copied over
1,000 HBCU library employees were sent. Out of the 106 existing HBCU libraries,
employees at each of them were contacted through listserv or email. However, the
response rate of the surveys would be considered low. According to Baruch and
Holtom (2008), organizational research has an average of 52%. Out of over 1,000
indivuals who were contacted using purposive sampling and three listserv postings
utilizing snowball sampling, only 138 particpants completed the surveys. Also, 2
participants were disqualified by selecting no when asked were they employees at
an HBCU library; 16 of the surveys had to be discarded because they were
incomplete. Altogether, there were 120 usable surveys that could be used for the
research. The results were exported when the sample size requirement was met.
The sample return rate was 1.2% based on 1,000 surveys.

Findings
For Hypotheses 1a-1d, 2, 3, 4, and 5, hierarchical multiple regression was
conducted. Tenure was the control variable in all models. Hypotheses 1a-1d tested
the influence of four of the Big Five personality traits on organizational
commitment in HBCU libraries. Neuroticism was excluded. Hypotheses 2 and 3
tested the influence of self-perceived internal and external locus of control on
organizational commitment by subordinates in HBCU libraries. Hypotheses 4 and 5
tested the influence of the perception of internal and external locus of control in
HBCU library leaders on organizational commitment.
The reliability outputs were examined for each scale. The OCQ showed a
Cronbach’s alpha of .921. As mentioned previously in the study, the OCQ’s
reliability is well documented in existing literature with Cronbach’s alpha values
falling between .82 and 93 (Kanning & Hill, 2015). In the BFI-10, the measurement
of neuroticism was excluded because of low reliability. The omission of Items 4
and 9 in the BFI-10 left the scale with a Cronbach’s alpha of .805. The original
scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of .513; by removing the measurement of Items 4 and
9, the Cronbach’s alpha rose to .805.
The Internal–External Locus of Control Scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of
.726 for self-perception and .791 for perception of the leader. To measure the
influence of external locus of control, the points of the scale were reversed to credit
the external items. The scales had Cronbach’s alpha scores of .679 for selfperception and .762 for perception of leader by followers. It is noted, “Internal
consistency estimates for the I-E LOC scale had a mean of .663 and a median of
.690 with results as high as .93 and as low as -.40” (Huizing, 2015, p. 83).
Therefore, the Cronbach’s alpha for the Internal–External Locus of Control Scale
as it applies to the current research falls within the mean.
The model that consists of openness and organizational commitment reveals
that the regression df = 2 and the residual df = 117 with F = 13.022. The R2 value
equals .182 with an 18% variance in organizational commitment being accounted
for by the model. Openness is a significant predictor of organizational commitment
with a beta of .400 and p = .000 < .05. Hypothesis 1a is supported in Model 1.

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

43

Model 2 suggests that the Big Five personality trait conscientiousness is a positive
predictor of organizational commitment with a beta of .541 and p = .000 < .05, thus
supporting Hypothesis 1b. Hypotheses 1c and 1d were rejected in the model. The
analysis suggests that a significant relationship does not exist between extraversion
and organizational commitment with p = .614 > .05. Also, p = .096 > .05 for the
relationship between agreeableness and organizational commitment (see Table 1).

Hypothesis 2 states that self-perceived internal locus of control has a
positive influence on organizational commitment in HBCU library employees. The
model that consists of the self-perceived locus of control of the follower and
organizational commitment reveals that the regression df = 2 and the residual df =
117 with the F = 1.933; R2 = .032. Self-perceived internal locus of control is not a
significant predictor of organizational commitment with p = .149 > .05. Hypothesis
2 is rejected in Model 1.
Hypothesis 3 states that external locus of control has a negative influence
on organization commitment. The model found that p = .285 > .05; thus,
Hypothesis 3 is rejected. Hypothesis 4 states that the follower’s perception of high
internal locus of control in the leader of HBCU libraries has a positive influence on
organizational commitment. The results indicate that Hypothesis 4 is rejected;
however, perception of internal locus of control of the leaders is suggested to have
a significant negative influence on commitment. Hypothesis 5 states that external
locus of control of the leader has a negative influence on organizational
commitment in followers; the results indicate that external locus of control in the
leader has no significant influence on organizational commitment in HBCU
libraries and rejects Hypothesis 5 with p = .828 > .05. Also, the control variable
tenure did not have a significant influence (see Table 2).

Hypotheses 1a and 1b were supported by the hierarchal multiple regression
performed and data collected. This suggests that openness and conscientiousness of
the Big Five personality traits in library leaders have a significant positive
influence on organizational commitment in subordinate employees at HBCU
libraries. Hypotheses 1c and 1d were rejected by the analysis by showing no
significant influence, thus indicating that extraversion and agreeableness do not
significantly influence organizational commitment in HBCU library employees.
Hypotheses 2 and 3 were also rejected by the analysis, indicating that high internal
and external locus of control of the follower has no significant influence on
organizational commitment in the follower. Hypothesis 4 was rejected; however,
the perception of internal locus of control of the leader by followers in HBCU
libraries negatively influences organizational commitment. Lastly, Hypothesis 5
was rejected by the results suggesting that the perception of external locus of
control of the leader by followers in HBCU libraries has no significant influence on
organizational commitment.

Chapter 5 – Discussion
In order to retain quality employees and compete in an ever-expanding
library field, historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) libraries would
benefit from understanding what influences organizational commitment in
employees. There is little literature available that addresses organizational
commitment in HBCU libraries. Angle and Perry (1981) posited that the impact of
employee commitment on the organization depends on the specific kinds of
behaviors to which the employees are committed, including the effects of such
behaviors on organizational outcomes, thus echoing the broad literature on the
influence of personal characteristics. However, there still exists a lack of research
studies that focus on leadership in academic libraries of HBCUs. An understanding
of the personal characteristics in leadership that promote organizational
commitment will aid the task of finding and developing potential leaders from
within the library profession as well as assist with the challenges that librarianship
will face (Jurow, 1990). Analyzing leadership and its effect on organizational
commitment in academic libraries at HBCUs will help to identify the types of
leadership theories that are applicable to the field of leadership and library sciences.
This chapter discusses the findings, implications, and suggested future research
based on leadership in HBCUs and organizational commitment.
Discussion of Findings
The findings of the study suggest that openness, conscientiousness, and
internal locus of control are important personal characteristics in HBCU library
leadership that influence organizational commitment. Internal and external locus of
control in followers had no significant relationship with commitment. Additionally,
external locus of control in HBCU library leadeship had no sigficant influence on
commitment in the reserach. Hierachal multiple regression analysis procedures of
the sample indicated the positive relationship. Although internal locus of control
had a significant negative influence on organizational commitment, it had a low
variance of 6.7%. Therefore, it holds little explanatory variance. Openness and
conscientiousness had a stronger variance in the analysis. The findings imply that

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

48

HBCU library leaders who have the personal characteristics of conscientious and
openness to experience tend to have a positive influence on follower’s
organizational commitment. Conscientiousness within the Big Five personality
traits means orderly, responsible, and dependable (John & Srivastava, 1999).
Openness to experience represents creativity and how willing individuals are to
make adjustments in accordance with new ideas or situations (Popkins, 1998).
These findings are significant because they imply that followers in HBCU libraries
have positive attitudinal outcomes when they work with leaders they perceive to be
conscientious and open to new experiences.
The raw data of the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ)
indicated that overall employees were committed to their organizations. Over 85%
of participants selected that they cared about the fate of their respective
organizations. However, when asked if this was the best possible organization to
work for, 52% of the respondents selected neither disagree nor agree, slightly
disagree, moderately disagree, or strongly disagree. The call for more research on
the influence of personal characteristics on turnover in HBCU libraries by Neal
(2005) influenced the research study. Neal indicated that there is a problem with
turnover amongst HBCU library directors versus non-HBCU library directors.
Also, the broader literature has stated that employee retention is an issue across the
board in libraries. By identifying personal characteristics that influence
commitment, the research provides applicability to address turnover. As it relates to
the findings of Neal, the results suggest that personal characteristics do play a role
in turnover via commitment in HBCU libraries.
Contribution to Literature
According to Mason and Weatherbee (2004), leadership concepts and
theories did not appear in existing “library literature until the late 1980s” (p. 187).
Even so, few studies exist on libraries at HBCUs that pertatin to leadership. Avolio
et al. (2004) stated that a more thorough understanding of what contributes to
employees’ commitment is needed. The current research took the Big Five
personality traits and locus of control and assessed their influence on organizational

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

49

commitment in HBCU libraries. This contributes to the existing gap in the literature
and adds to the strengthening of current research theories. Additionally, the
research adds to research on library sciences leadership. The research study also
provides an addition to the literature concerning employee organizational
perception and use of the Locus of Control Scale from a perception standpoint. It
was stated in an annual report that there are some issues pertinent to HBCU
libraries (Parham, 2004). The findings revealed that the perception of respondents’
current library organizations varied from favorable to nonfavorable with a greater
percentage of employees having high commitment attitudes. However, a small
percentage of extremely low organizational commitment attitudes exist with some
employees. The results indicate that there is room for positive growth in the
commitment of employees in HBCU libraries. An additional contribution of the
research is the utilization of the fairly new Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10). The
BFI-10 had a reliability of .805 with the exclusion of neuroticism. Thus, the
research further supports its reliability.
Contribution to Practical Applications
A few practical applications can be gathered from the research. Bateman
and Strasser (1984) stated that one of the reasons organizational leadership is
prominent in research is because it has consistently been associated with employee
turnover, absenteeism, and effectiveness. Oluwafemi (2013) posited that a
conscientious individual tends to be more focused on achievement and responsible.
Individuals with high conscientiousness also tend to be more satisfied with their
work leading to higher retention. This addresses the research problem directly by
providing a means of measurement for personality characteristics that have been
shown to increase employee commitment. As stated, the research also found
openness to new experience in leaders to positively influence organizational
commitment. Rothmann and Coetzer (2003) posited that those who possess the
personal characteristic of openness are willing to entertain alternative ideas and
values. This is applicable in HBCU libraries since the field is ever changing and
expanding. The ability to be innovative as a leader is imperative in libraries because

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

50

of the addition of new technological and service roles in the organizations. One of
the great positives in finding that openness and conscientiousness influence
commitment is the ability to measure them. The research findings can be applied
and used as a starting point for leadership recruitment using personality
characteristic measurements.
Distinct employee attitudes relating to employment satisfaction and
organizational commitment are of great interest to the field of organizational
behavior and the practice of human resources management (Tella, Ayeni, &
Popoola, 2007). The importance of employee perception is one practical aspect of
organizational leadership that can be taken from the research. Bowen and Ostroff
(2004) posited that in order for human resource practices to lead to desired
performance, they must evoke clear and shared perceptions of the organizational
climate and of the behaviors that leadership expects, supports, and rewards.
The results of the study can be applied to organizational and human
resource practices that utilize personal characteristic fit as a part of the screening
process of applicants, thus implementing hiring practices that increase
organizational commitment and decrease turnover. The positives of the research
have potential to influence HBCU libraries, as well as other organizations, and
increase organizational commitment by providing findings that suggest personal
characteristics do influence commitment. These findings can also be applied by
organizations creating leadership trainings that allow individuals who are already
members to understand the personal characteristics of openness, conscientiousness,
and internal locus of control promoting the development of the referenced traits.
This also contributes to increasing retention.
Limitations of the Study
There were a few limitations within the research study. For example, the
current library directors of the institutions were excluded from the research, which
limits the scope. The inclusion of the library directors from a self-measurement
angle would have allowed for a comparison of self-perception and follower
perception to be utilized in the study. Neuroticism was not analyzed in the study

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

51

based on low reliability of measurement. Therefore, an additional limitation of the
study resulted in the full five personality traits not being assessed. Although the
participants of the study were all subordinate employees, the research did not
identify level of employment. For example, library professionals as well as
paraprofessionals exist in the sample. Level of employment is a possible control
variable that was not utilized in the study.
Future Research
To address some of the limitations of the research, it is recommended that
future research be conducted on organizational commitment and the Big Five
personality traits with the inclusion of HBCU library directors. Also, it is
recommended that research be conducted on employee organizational commitment
and personal characteristics of non-HBCU libraries. It is also suggested that future
research be conducted on personal characteristics and organizational commitment
taking into account organizational size as a control variable. To further expand the
literature on leadership in HBCU libraries and organizations in general, it is
recommended that research on turnover trends pertaining to additional personal
characteristics be completed. It is also suggested that a duplicate study be done for
comparison on tribal colleges and universities. A comparative study will provide a
means to view similarities and distinctions between alternative organizations that
pertain to leadership perception.
Additionally, the results of the research on HBCU libraries contribute to the
research on HBCUs as a whole. Therefore, it is recommended that a duplicate study
be completed on the Big Five personality traits in administration at HBCUs and
their influence on organizational commitment. While previous research has more
abundantly focused on leadership in non-HBCU colleges and universities, it is
important that subsequent research expand into HBCUs that are also becoming
challenged by employee retention and turnover. A report by the Association of
Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (2014) stated that turnover and
instability in HBCU presidents is of great concern. Future research should aid in

Big Five, Locus of Control, and Organizational Commitment in HBCU Libraries

assessing the leadership, attitudinal characteristics, and personal characteristics to
determine organizational fit at HBCUs and improve retention.

INDICATE THE REVIEW CATEGORY FOR WHICH YOU ARE
APPLYING.


X I am applying for an exempt review, based on one or more of the following
categories (check all that apply):
Note: Exempt review cannot be claimed for any research involving prisoners
and most research involving children.
 Research conducted in established or commonly accepted educational
settings and involving normal educational practices such as (i)
research on regular and special education instructional strategies, or
(ii) research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among
instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods
 Research involving the use of survey procedures, educational tests
(cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), interview procedures or
observation of public behavior, if information from these sources is
recorded in such a manner that participants cannot be identified,
directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects; and (ii) any
disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research could
not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or
be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, or
reputation
Note: This category cannot be used for research involving children
 Research involving the use of survey procedures, educational tests
(cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), interview procedures,
or observation of public behavior, if (i) the human subjects are elected
or appointed public officials or candidates for public office; or (ii)
federal statute(s) require(s) without exception that the confidentiality
of the personally identifiable information will be maintained
throughout the research and thereafter
 Research involving the collection or study of existing data, documents,
records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if these
sources are publicly available or if the information is recorded by the
investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified,
directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects
 Research and demonstration projects which are conducted by or
subject to the approval of federal department or agency heads, and
which are designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine (i) Public
benefit or service programs; (ii) procedures for obtaining benefits or
services under those programs; (iii) possible changes in or alternatives
to those programs or procedures; or (iv) possible changes in methods
or levels of payment for benefits or services under those programs

I am applying for an expedited review, based on meeting all of the
following conditions (check all that apply):
Note: Expedited review cannot be claimed for research involving prisoners.
 Research poses no more than minimal risk to subjects (defined as "the
probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the
research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical
or psychological examinations or tests.")
 Research limited to one or more of the following data collection
procedures:
 Collection of data through noninvasive procedures routinely
employed in clinical practice
 Research involving materials (data, documents, records, or
specimens) that have been collected, or will be collected
solely for nonresearch purposes
 Collection of data from voice, video, digital, or image
recordings made for research purposes
 Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior
(including, but not limited to, research on perception,
cognition, motivation, identity, language, communication,
cultural beliefs or practices, and social behavior) or research
employing survey, interview, oral history, focus group,
program evaluation, human factors evaluation, or quality
assurance methodologies
Note: Some research in this category may be classified as
exempt; this listing refers only to research that is not exempt.
 Continuing review of research previously approved by the
convened HSRB as follows: (a) where (i) the research is
permanently closed to the enrollment of new subjects; (ii) all
subjects have completed all research-related interventions; and
(iii) the research remains active only for long-term follow-up
of subjects; or (b) where no subjects have been enrolled and
no additional risks have been identified; or (c) where the
remaining research activities are limited to data analysis.

WRITTEN CONSENT


I am requesting permission to waive written consent, based on one or
more of the following categories (check all that apply):
 The only record linking the subject and the research would be the
consent document, and the principal risk would be potential harm
resulting from a breach of confidentiality.
 The research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects
and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally
required outside of the research context.

 I will be using a written consent form. Attach a copy of the written consent
form with this application.
