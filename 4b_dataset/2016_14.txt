Abstract
Facets in Library Catalogs: The Beliefs, Behaviors, Policies and Procedures which Guide
Implementation
Catherine Elizabeth Hall
Xia Lin, Ph.D, Dissertation Advisor

During the course of the last decade, libraries have begun to offer enhanced library
catalogs. These catalogs include features such as improved relevance ranking, a simple
keyword search box, federated searching of library collections, and facet-based search
and browse capabilities. Facets have been one of the most anticipated and admired
features of new library catalogs; embraced as a way to help users navigate and refine
search results, discover unknown material and avoid empty results sets.
This dissertation research sought to answer two main research questions, 1: How are
facets interpreted by librarians and library staff members involved in developing and
implementing facet-based catalogs? 2: What individual and institutional beliefs, practices
and policies guide the implementation of facet-based catalogs in libraries?
For this mixed methods study, data was collected through online surveys and semistructured interviews. Forty-eight individuals who have assisted with the implementation
of a facet-based catalog at their libraries responded to the survey, and nine of these were
also interviewed. Study participants provided their own understanding of facets as well as
reflections on the processes by which the facet-based catalog was chosen, and how facets
were selected.
The findings of this study revealed that participants were inclined to view facets in one of
two ways; as interface refinement and filtering tool or as a characteristic or attribute
common to a set of information objects. Study participants held a fairly sophisticated

x

view of facets which was informed by the history of facets in library and information
science, information architecture and web design, and, most notably, their application in
library catalogs. While libraries endeavor to create facets and catalogs which are useful
and user-friendly, obstacles remain such as staff indifference, cataloging and metadata
problems, and software and system constraints.
The findings of this study may provide information professionals with useful information
to support the development and implementation of increasingly sophisticated and useful
facet-based catalogs, as well as have implications for LIS educators and researchers.

1

Chapter 1. Introduction
During the last decade, libraries across North America, and around the world, have begun
to offer enhanced library catalogs. These catalogs, developed as a response to previous
systems which were routinely criticized for being difficult to use, include features such as
improved relevance ranking, a simple keyword search box, federated searching of library
collections, user contributions (such as reviews, ratings, comments and tags), enriched
content (such as book covers, tables of contents, reviews from external sources) and
facet-based search and browse capabilities (Yang & Hoffman, 2010).
Facets, in the context of the library catalog, are understood by this research to be dynamic
filters, limits or refinements that modify a set of search results. Examples of facet-based
systems include commercial products such as SirsiDynix’s Enterprise, Innovative’s
Encore and ProQuest’s Summon, as well as open source systems such as Blacklight and
Vufind. Figure 1.1 shows the facet-based search interface of Seattle Public Library’s
(BiblioCommons) catalog. Facets are positioned vertically on the left of the screen,
highlighted here in bold, and presented as post-search filtering options.

Facets have been one of the most anticipated, most admired and most talked about feature
of new library catalogs (Denholm et al., 2009). User difficulties with traditional catalogs
abound in the literature (see Borgman, 1986; Hunter, 1991; Wildemuth & O’Neil, 1995;
Large and Beheshti, 1997, for examples) and have intensified as users apply their
expectations of web search engines to library catalogs (e.g. Griffith & Brophy, 2005;
Makri et al, 2007, Connaway et al, 2011; Khoo & Hall, 2012). Facets have been
embraced as a way to alleviate many of these problems; to help users navigate and refine
search results, discover unknown material, and avoid the frustration of empty results sets,
all while being powered by the controlled vocabularies and detailed metadata that
librarians have built and maintained.
The emergence of facet-based catalogs owes much to the prevalence and success of
facets as a search and navigation tool on the web. Some of the first facet-based catalogs
were born from a partnership with Endeca, a software company which pioneered the use
of facet-based search on ecommerce sites. While this legacy can still be seen in current
implementations of facet-based library catalogs, facets also have a rich heritage within
the library and information science field.
Beginning with the detailed documentation initiated by S.R. Ranganathan in the 1930s,
and refined and expanded during the following decades by himself and members of the
British Classification Research Group (CRG), there exists guidance for how to construct
comprehensive and user-focused facets. This includes directives that facets should be
distinct and mutually exclusive, relevant to the material and its users, and labelled using
terminology which is current and understood by those in the field. Canonical principles
and procedures have been used to good effect by contemporary researchers in the LIS

4

community (e.g. Broughton & Slavic, 2007; Hudon, 2007; La Barre & Tilley, 2010) and
facets are familiar to LIS professionals through their use in thesauri and other
taxonomies.
To find out more about the application of facets in library catalogs, this dissertation
research investigated how library staff view and interpret facets and what policies,
practices and beliefs guide the implementation of facet-based library catalogs. The
research explored definitions and important attributes of facets and facet-based catalogs,
how individuals had first learned about facets, and where they would seek information
about facets and facet-based catalogs. Additionally, this research looked at wider
organizational level decisions such as the selection of a catalog, the importance of
different factors in facet selection and their sequence within the catalog, and the impact
of facets on existing cataloging and metadata practices. Taken together, these personal
and institutional factors will provide important context for understanding how facets and
facet-based catalogs are designed and implemented as well as how they might be
improved.
The justification for this research is threefold. Firstly, there is little literature which
discusses facets and facet-based catalogs from the perspective of library staff. Most
studies of facet-based catalogs have been concerned with recording user experience and
identifying usability issues (e.g. Antelman et al, 2006; Synder, 2010; Denton and Coysh,
2011; Hanrath & Kottman, 2015), or reporting on facet usage (e.g. the transaction log
studies of Lown, 2008; Niu, Lown and Hemminger, 2009; Bauer & Peterson-Hart, 2012).
The importance of these studies is not disputed. They provide valuable information for
the library about use (or non-use) of facets, highlight important design and usability

5

issues, and collect user feedback about the catalog. The publication of these studies
allows for findings to be disseminated to libraries which are designing or implementing
their own facet-based catalog. However, these studies are less likely to explain how the
catalog or individual facets were chosen. In overlooking the opinions of library staff, and
the process taken to design and implement a facet-based catalog, we are missing a key
component in our understandings of facet-based catalogs.
Second, facet-based catalogs have performed well overall against their traditional
counterparts in user studies and usability testing. They have often provided faster results,
refined large results sets, and been discussed favorably by study participants. However,
these same studies have also shown that facets and facet based catalogs are not without
their problems. Study participants have been confused by facet terminology,
inconsistency, redundancy and sometimes even functionality (e.g. Bauer, 2008c; OCLC,
2009b; Synder, 2010; Emmanuel, 2011; Blumer, Hugi and Schneider, 2014). Therefore,
it is reasonable to think that there is still work which can be done to improve facet-based
catalogs. This dissertation was designed to provide useful and original research that can
be used to support the implementation of facet-based catalogs by offering an insight into
the context in which they are created and managed.
Third, the existing literature looking at facet-based catalogs has usually been of a much
narrower scope than this study. User studies and transaction log studies have typically
focused on one or two individual catalogs (e.g. Antelman et al., 2006; Olson, 2007;
Bauer, 2008 a, b, c; Ho et al. 2008, Niu and Hemminger, 2010). Larger-scale studies have
provided broad overviews of the prevalence of facet-based catalogs and their typical
features (e.g. Hall, 2012; Hoffman and Yang, 2011; Hoffman & Yang, 2012). However,

6

they are necessarily lacking in detail about why particular catalogs and facets have been
chosen. This dissertation was designed to fill this gap by taking a mixed methods
research approach, allowing the breadth and depth necessary to explore the perspective of
library staff, and the processes and procedures in place across a variety of libraries
offering both commercial and open source catalog products.
The previously mentioned literature has shaped our understanding of facet-based library
catalogs. It helps us see what catalogs exist and what facets are used. This dissertation
research takes library staff as its participants in order to begin to answer questions about
how and why these decisions are made. As many different people work closely with a
facet-based catalog, participation in this research study was open to any professional or
paraprofessional library staff member who has been involved with the selection,
development, implementation or management of a facet-based library catalog. As part of
data collection, participants were identified by several factors: job role – collection
support, user services, IT/systems, digital services, and administration; library
classification – academic, public, special; and catalog type – commercial, open source.
Where appropriate, these factors were used to observe similarities and differences in
beliefs, behaviors and procedures.
The findings of this dissertation research will be useful for LIS researchers and educators,
as well as LIS professionals. Researchers may use the findings as a basis for adapting LIS
facet theory for use in facet-based library catalogs. LIS educators may find the findings
useful when instructing LIS students in such subjects as cataloging and classification,
metadata, information architecture and information retrieval. It is hoped that LIS

7

practitioners will find the results of this research useful in supporting the development
and implementation of increasingly sophisticated and useful facet-based catalogs.

Chapter 2. Literature Review
To gain an understanding of the domain, and provide context to frame the research
questions, relevant literature was identified and reviewed. Several areas of research were
deemed to be relevant for this study: the tradition of facets within LIS, the popularity of
facets in information architecture and web design, and facet-based library catalogs.
Within this latter area, user studies and implementation reports are considered, as well as
research related to cataloging and catalogers. As facet-based catalogs represent a new
technology for libraries, a brief review of some pertinent literature related to diffusion of
innovations is also considered. The purpose of this review is not to be exhaustive but to
give a general overview of some of the important background, themes and open problems
which inform this study.
2.1 Facets in Library and Information Science
Facets in library and information science (LIS) can be traced back to the theories and
classification systems of Henry Bliss, Paul Otlet and S.R. Ranganathan in the late 1920s
and early 1930s (La Barre 2010b). A facet, as described by Ranganathan, is a “generic
term used to denote any component of a compound subject” (Ranganathan, 1967). Over
the years, as facets have been incorporated into various projects and adopted by
researchers and practitioners in different domains, definitions have evolved and diverged
(see La Barre, 2011). Hearst (2006) describes facets as “categories used to characterize
information items in a collection,” Hudon (2007) defines them as “a characteristic, an
indicator, a criterion that may be used to subdivide a class or set of objects in
homogeneous subjects,” and La Barre (2007) provides a definition which includes the
twin focus of both documents and users: “facets represent the categories, properties,

9

attributes, characteristics, relations, functions or concepts that are central to the set of
documents or entities being organized and which are of particular interest to the user
group for whom a particular resource is being created.”
As the fundamental properties of a given domain - the deconstructed attributes by which
a domain can be accurately described and made accessible - Ranganathan viewed facets
as the cornerstone of a new type of classification:
I happened to visit one of the shops of Selfridge. There, I saw for the first time, a
Meccano set. It consisted of only a few metal strips, small metal plates, a few
wheels and axles, some screws and nuts, hooks and pieces of strings. With this set
the shopkeeper would make all the kinds of toys. I decided a classification scheme
should be like a Meccano set…. (Ranganathan, 1968 as cited in La Barre 2010a)
In answer to the inherent problems of traditional classifications such as the Dewey
Decimal System (DDC) and Library of Congress Classification (LCC), Ranganathan’s
idea was to start with objects and derive index terms and attributes from them rather than
designing a classification scheme and then fitting objects to it (Perugini, 2009).
Ranganathan emphasized the organic nature of his classification, outlining schemas that
were designed to be flexible and forward looking (Fox, 2005).
2.1.1 Facet Analysis
Facets, representing a component of a subject or object, can be combined to represent
complex subjects. Facet theory regulates that prior to the construction of a facet-based
system, an iterative process known as facet analysis must be performed. The basic
procedure of facet analysis begins with a definition of a subject field and the formulation
of facets through an examination of material that represents both the domain and the
interests of the user group (Vickery, 1960, 2008; La Barre, 2010a).

10

Seven basic steps are involved in facet analysis; three which constitute pure facet analysis
and a further four which aid the building of a faceted classification (Vickery, 1960, La
Barre, 2010b):
FA1: Define the domain and interests of domain participants.
FA2: Formulate facets by examining representative domain material.
FA3: Structure each facet into a hierarchical order, identify any mistakes and gaps
that exist.
FC1: Create scope notes which describe the meaning and use of each facet.
FC2: Decide helpful order within each facet.
FC3: Build notation.
FC4: Fit notation and create a schedule of facet terms.
Two of the preeminent figures in facet theory, S.R Ranganathan and Brian Vickery,
developed extensive and comprehensive documentation concerning facet analysis. A
brief description of some of the significant elements of these theories is presented below.
Awarded the 1970 Margaret Mann Citation in Cataloging and Classification by the
American Library Association, Ranganathan’s legacy is undisputed. Over several
decades he developed a comprehensive, complex, and sometimes confusing theory which
divides facet analysis into three parts known as planes:
The Idea Plane: The process of analyzing a subject field and determining its constituent
parts.
The Verbal Plane: The process of choosing appropriate terminology to represent those
parts.

11

The Notational Plane: The process of representing those parts by notational means.
Ranganathan’s theory of facet analysis consists of a series of canons, postulates and
principles (1951; 1962; 1967). While canons exist as must follow rules of facet analysis,
postulates and principles are strongly recommended procedures for applying facet
analysis to classification systems (Spiteri, 1998). The Idea Plane consists of 14
mandatory canons including stipulations that facets are: distinct from each other (Canon
of Differentiation), relevant to the purpose and scope of the classification and its intended
users (The Canon of Relevance), mutually exclusive (Canon of Concomitance) and cited
or displayed in an order that considers the purpose of the classification including an
awareness of user needs and interests (Canon of Relevant Succession).
In the Verbal Plane, canons mandate the terminology used to describe facets, classes and
sub-classes and instruct that terminology used in a classification should be up-to-date and
used by those in the field (Canon of Currency) and free from bias or prejudice (Canon of
Reticence).
The Principles for Helpful Sequence suggests a number of ways in which facet arrays can
be presented such as: chronologically (Principle of Later-in-Time and Principle of Laterin Evolution), by spatial contiguity (Principle of Bottom Upwards, Principle of Left to
Right, Principle of Clockwise Direction, Principle of Periphery to Centre etc.) and by
decreasing quantity of published documents (Principle of Literary Warrant). Finally, the
postulates concerning the choice and citation order of facets include one of the theories
most readily associated with Ranganathan: The existence of five Fundamental Categories
from which facets could be drawn: Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, and Time.

12

Taking Ranganathan’s theory as a benchmark, Vickery (1960) presents a guide compiled
for the Classification Research Group (CRG) with the express aim of being “a more
simply written and more readily available practical guide to the newer techniques of
classification.” Like Ranganathan, Vickery and the CRG believed that facet analysis
requires the strict application of rules, where every distinctive logical category should be
isolated, every new characteristic of division should be clearly formulated, and every new
relation should be recognized (Vickery, 1960). The emphasis of Vickery’s facet analysis
theory is firmly on deriving facets from a careful examination of the literature:
Facet analysis is essentially a conceptual analysis of the subject matter, but
basing it upon the literature ensures that the characteristics of division isolated
are those which actually give rise to literature and are significant in the study and
practice of the subject. (Vickery, 1960)
Glossaries, reference works, indexes and abstracts are the recommended resources when
choosing and populating each facet. Regarding principles for the order of facets, Vickery
advises that user interests be placed above any general combinations as users of different
collections may have different primary concerns. Vickery extends and refines
Ranganathan’s five fundamental categories to create a list which includes: things and
entities, parts, components and structure, materials and constituents, attributes,
operations, place, and condition (Vickery, 1960). Observing that longer lists of
“fundamental categories” have been produced for certain subject areas, Vickery advises
that fundamental categories are not meant to be strictly and automatically imposed, but
instead used as a provisional guide when approaching a subject.

13

2.1.2 The Use of Facets in Library and Information Science
Facet theory as developed by Ranganathan, Vickery and other members of the CRG is
considered canonical (Spiteri, 1998) and the application of their principles can be seen in
a variety of information systems. Ranganathan’s Colon Classification Scheme, the first
fully faceted classification scheme, has been enthusiastically supported as one of the best
organization systems for physical library materials; allowing for rich resource description
and enhanced retrieval options (Vickery, 1960; Broughton and Slavic, 2007). Dissatisfied
with traditional enumerative classification approaches, Ranganathan’s rationale for his
new form of classification was that:
What distinguishes the universe of current knowledge is that it is a dynamical
continuum. It is ever growing; new branches may stem from any of its infinity of
points at any time; they are unknowable at present. They cannot therefore be
enumerated here and now; nor can they be anticipated, their filiations can be
determined only after they appear. (Ranganathan, 1951)
Faceted classifications are not a different representational structure, but rather a different
approach to the classification process (Crowston & Kwasnik 2004). Designed to be a
flexible and responsive method of organization, they are built from the ground upwards
and based on literary and, increasingly, user warrant rather than the strictly hierarchical
division of the entire universe of knowledge. Mills (2004) sees faceted classification as
“the only viable form enabling the locating and relating of information to be optimally
predictable.”
In the UK, BC2 has followed facet theory as developed by CRG members and uses the
13 categories developed by the group to analyze and categorize documents: thing, kind,
part, property, material, process, operation, patient, product, by-product, agent, space, and
time. Although BC2 is only utilized at a handful of small academic and special libraries

14

in the UK, elements of facet theory can also be seen in the Dewey Decimal Classification
and, to a greater extent, the Universal Decimal Classification (Broughton, 2011).
A number of scholars have worked on projects to apply traditional theories of facet
analysis in the design and construction of informational retrieval systems. Developing a
prototype faceted classification for resource discovery in a digital environment,
Broughton & Slavic (2007) used the 13 facets identified by the CRG, and edited, reduced
or supplemented them to fit the subject at hand. Relevant concepts were derived from
looking to existing terminologies such as BC2 for domain specific terms and UDC for
commonly applicable concepts (Broughton & Slavic, 2007).
Hudon (2007) found that five generic facets were enough to “describe, structure and
access a virtual collection of resources in education”: agent, activity, method, space, and
time. These facets were felt to present themselves after each resource was classified and
indexed with DDC, The Educator’s Reference Desk, the thesaurus EDUthes, and had
source, theme and document type noted (Hudon, 2007). The Folktales and Facets project
sought to leverage the principles of facet analysis to enhance access to folktales (La Barre
& Tilley, 2010). Preliminary facets, derived from an analysis of the books in the
collection, their bibliographic records and book reviews, were identified as: agent, area,
association, content, context, documentation, genre, origin, time, transmission, and
viewpoint (La Barre & Tilley, 2010).
While these projects, among others, have demonstrated its applicability to modern
information systems, traditional forms of facet analysis is not without detractors. While
attempting to develop a faceted classification for engineering documents, Wild, Geiss and
McMahon (2009) observed traditional theory was poorly expressed to non-experts and

15

confusing on many issues. These researchers seemed unaware of existing faceted
classifications created by the CRG and of other research and projects which elucidate
steps involved in facet analysis. Nevertheless, the complexity of Ranganathan’s language
and the dispersed nature of the CRG documentation is a well-established difficulty for
both researchers and practitioners (Spiteri, 1998).
Ranganathan and Vickery are not the only pathway to understanding facets, and many
LIS professionals, particularly those with experience in cataloging, classification and
indexing, may be familiar with facets through different avenues. Beginning with the
Thesaurofacet in 1969, the applicability of facets to thesaurus construction was quickly
recognized (Aitchison, 1970). Facets and facet analysis appear in British, American and
international standards for thesaurus construction (Broughton, 2011) and the techniques
of facet analysis employed in the construction of various faceted thesauri have been
documented by Spiteri (1999).
Faceted thesauri are created in one of two ways. In some instances, the development of a
faceted thesaurus begins with an initial division of the domain by discipline or subject
area, with facet-analysis applied to determine relationship between terms. In other cases,
the entire thesaurus is divided first by fundamental categories rather than by subject area.
(Aitchison & Clarke, 2004; Tudhope & Binding, 2008).
The latter process is how the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) was constructed. The
AAT “provides terminology for indexing the art, architecture, and material culture of the
Western world from antiquity to contemporary culture” (Jorgensen, 2003). A faceted
approach was chosen for the AAT in order to “provide an efficient, flexible means of
providing for numerous and varied object and subject descriptions encountered by

16

thesaurus users” (Whitehead, 1989). The AAT contains eight facets: associated concepts,
physical attributes, styles and periods, agents, activities, materials, objects, and brand
names (Harpring, 2016). Like other faceted thesauri, the AAT is not encumbered by high
levels of pre-coordination. Instead, indexers can apply terms from across different facets
to create an incredible number of combinations.
Recommended principles for the construction of thesauri and other taxonomies are
reminiscent of those recommended for the development of facets. Concept terms, for
example, may be derived via a bottom-up or a top-down approach. In a bottom-up
approach, terms may be found from analysis of domain material, or based on user
warrant. In a top-down design, experts outline a knowledge map of the domain, and build
a list of relevant terms. In creating the Library of Congress Genre/Form thesaurus, staff
developed an initial list of terms by examining Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH) as well as other relevant controlled vocabularies, and staff frequently solicited
input from domain and policy experts when faced with difficult decisions about
terminology, scope, and granularity, (Young & Mandelstam, 2013).
In The Accidental Taxonomist, Heather Hedden outlines procedures for selecting
appropriate taxonomy concepts and terminology that includes: ensuring the concept is
within the intended subject area scope of the taxonomy, making sure that the concept is
important and something that users are likely to look for, using wording that matches that
used by the users, and maintaining a consistent style throughout the taxonomy (Hedden,
2010). Facets are described by Hedden as categorical groupings of terms that describe
content from multiple angles, perspectives or attributes. She cautions that facets work
best with content that is well structured and somewhat consistent so that the same facets

17

can be used across all content (Hedden, 2010). This highlights a potential problem for
facets in library catalogs as, not only is the topic of materials diverse, they may contain
collections using different metadata schemes and controlled vocabularies.
Facets may also be familiar to LIS professionals through the FAST (Faceted Application
of Subject Terminology) subject headings maintained by the Library of Congress. FAST
contains approximately 1.7 million LCSH-derived subject headings across eight facets:
personal names, corporate names, geographic names, events, titles, time periods, topics,
and form/genre (OCLC, 2013). It was developed to meet the need for a general use
subject terminology scheme that was simple to learn and apply, modern in design, and
supports faceted navigation (Mixter & Childress, 2013).
A final point to mention is that automatic development and extraction of facets is a
popular choice, but may not yield facets which are as powerful or appropriate as those
generated manually (Yee et al., 2003; La Barre, 2006; Hearst & Stoica, 2009; La Barre,
2009). Hedden (2010) notes that automated taxonomies tend to suffer from redundant
terms and terms of mixed granularity and should be used with caution.
2.2 Facets in Information Architecture and Web Design
In the early 2000s, facets and facet theory became increasingly interesting to web
designers, information architects and knowledge management professionals charged with
designing websites and access to corporate knowledge bases (La Barre, 2006). Rapid
growth of the internet had galvanized discussions around “information overload”, with
Shirky (2008) remarking that filtering content, for quality or other metrics, had moved
from pre-production to post-production, and, rather than information overload, we were
actually suffering from “filter failure.”

18

Facets, as a form of filtering, have found natural support in the information architecture
(IA) and web design fields. “Filters”, “facets” and “faceted navigation” are often used
interchangeably in the literature, with the understanding that “they share the same basic
mechanism of analyzing a large set of content and excluding any objects that don’t meet
certain criteria” and “faceted navigation provides multiple filters, one for each different
aspect of the content.” (Whitenton, 2014). Figure 2.1, taken from Whitenton, (2014),
visualizes this view of the relationship between faceted navigation and filters.

Figure 2.1 Relationship between filters and faceted navigation as expressed in Whitenton
(2014).

Writing in 2001, Peter Morville argued for the importance of facets as a replacement for
the single taxonomy pervasive on many intranets, websites and portals at the time.
Instead of an unwieldly single hierarchy, a system using different facets, which each

19

focus on a discrete dimension of the information space, allows for several smaller and
flatter hierarchies that can create a huge number of combinations (Morville, 2001).
Enthusiasm for facets in web design was spurred by a ready acknowledgement that
people looking for the same thing often use different search terms, and that different user
groups use a website differently and have different information needs (Leise, Rice &
Warner, 2005). Early adoption of facets, in particular, came in the online retail arena with
its additional, financial, incentive for increasing “findability” (Morville & Rosenfeld,
2006).
As early as 2003, Adkisson (2005) found that 69% of 75 leading commerce websites
utilized facets as a browsing or navigational aid. However, many of these
implementations were simplistic, essentially only allowing a user to select a single
category, rather than multiple facets or filters, by which to browse (e.g. a user could
browse red shoes, but not high heeled, red shoes costing $50 - $100). In 2006, La Barre
surveyed 200 websites across multiple categories and industries and found that 24 (12%)
showed evidence of facets. A follow-up study by La Barre, in 2008, found evidence of an
increase in the use of facets on websites that had not previously used them.
Today, facets can be seen on a multitude of healthcare, commercial, educational and
government sites and can be considered a “must-have functionality for all online web
services that contain a search functionality” (Blumer, Hugi & Schneider, 2015). Facets
remain most prevalent in the realm of online retail, with Perguini (2009) stating that they
are now the de facto standard for ecommerce websites. This is testament to the fact that
facets work especially well with items that have physical attributes.

20

Figure 2.2 shows an example of the kind of facet-based structure that predominates
today. This figure shows the facets available when “boys toys” is selected on the Toys R
us website. Various facets for browsing are presented on the far left of the screen such as
category, age, price and brand. With each selection, the page reloads and presents further
options for refinement.
However, while facets have become standard features of modern websites, their
implementation is not perfect. Usability researchers at Baymard Institute benchmarked 50
major ecommerce websites with a focus on facets, filtering and sorting (Holst, 2015).
They found that 34% of critiqued websites provided a poor filtering experience for users,
50% were judged to be passable, and just 16% provided a good filtering experience. The
main problems included a lack of key facets, poor facet and filtering logic, and interface
design issues. Key recommendations from the study include: ensuring that each category
has a unique set of facets specific to the type of products it contains (for example, a mass
retailer like Amazon should use different facets for DVDs than for home appliances),
truncating long lists of facet values, and promoting highly important facets outside of the
traditional left hand menu, such as above the product list or search results (Holst 2015).

22

2.2.1 Understandings and Practices
William Denton, a Scholarly Analytics Librarian, first published his popular guide to
creating web-based faceted classification schemes in 2003 (Denton, 2009). Denton’s
guide, which includes references to Ranganathan, Vickery, and Spiteri, was one of the
early practical guides to creating facets and is still included in recommended reading and
resources for facets by information architects and web designers (e.g. Kalbach, 2014).
Numerous other step-by-step or practical-minded resources have been published during
the last 15 years. Boxes and Arrows, an online web design and IA journal and website,
has published multiple researcher and practitioner authored pieces which focus on facets
and faceted navigation as well as supporting principles such as controlled vocabularies
and authority files (e.g. Steckel, 2002; Leise, Fast & Steckel, 2003; Nudelman, 2010;
Lau, 2016).
In much of the earlier IA research and guides to facets, the relationship to LIS
classification and indexing is made explicit. Writing in 2003, Leise, Fast and Steckel
define facet as a “fundamental category by which an object or concept may be
described.” Facet Analysis is described as “the process of analyzing content to determine
appropriate facets and vocabulary term relationships” and readers are referred to
Aitchinson, Gilchrist and Bawden’s Thesaurus Construction and Use for further
information (Leise, Fast and Steckel, 2003). In a 2006 study, Kathryn La Barre concluded
that information architects and knowledge managers did have sophisticated
understanding of facets that was consistent with “canonical” facet analysis and
classification, although they were not always aware of the theories, and the
implementations they created were often superficial. While Ranganathan’s Prolegomena

23

was referred to by some, the more commonly consulted resources were: discussion lists,
various Marti Hearst publications and Rosenfeld and Morville’s 2002 edition of
Information Architecture for the World Wide Web (La Barre, 2006).
In more recent literature, even without referencing LIS traditions, the process of
developing facets is still understood in a complementary way. Information architect
Grace Lau (2016) advises that “determining the facets used in a taxonomy is all about
understanding the content and the user’s needs.” She instructs that facets should be
chosen by taking content and isolating its smaller components, and terms for facets and
facet content should reflect terms that the intended audience would use.
Russell-Rose & Tate (2013) summarize prevalent trends and best practices in the field
including:


Faceted search should minimize the likelihood of zero results by displaying only
currently available facet values.



Facets can be either single-select or multi-select. Single-select values are mutually
exclusive. Multi-select facets can either be multi-select OR or multi-select AND.



There are three main choices of layout: vertical, horizontal, and hybrid, each with
their own advantages and disadvantages.



There are three main choices of default state: closed by default, open by default,
or a combination of the two. A combination approach can be used to reflect users’
search strategies and mental models.



The display format of facets should match the semantics of the facet values.
Hyperlinks, checkboxes, range sliders, color wheels, visualizations and tag clouds
can each be appropriate depending on the content and the facet.

24



Facets should offer an appropriate information scent—for example, be open by
default and display a representative sample of facet values.

They declare that facets “offer a unique potential to transform the search experience
[and provide] a flexible framework by which users can satisfy a wide variety of
information needs, ranging from simple lookup and fact retrieval to complex exploratory
search and discovery” (Russell-Rose & Tate, 2013). It is this understanding which has
seen facets become a standard feature, not just on commercial websites, but also on
library catalogs.
2.3 Information Seeking in Online Environments
Human information seeking is a complex and variable process. Topics and search
strategies are diverse: different users require different solutions to similar information
problems, and even the same user may require different information in different contexts
(Crowston & Kwasnik 2004). Understandably, the body of literature that concerns
information seeking is large and diverse. For the purposes of this literature review, a
particular focus is given here to literature that focuses on, or has implications for,
information seeking in the context of library catalogs.
Though designed to assist information seeking and retrieval, online environments can
often complicate matters. When an information seeker engages with a system directly,
they are required to represent their needs in a way that matches the conceptual model of
information retrieval held by that system. Traditionally, this model has been centered on
the idea of single user query matched to a database, yielding a single set of results (Bates,
1989), or a particular type of information behavior, “specified searching for one or more
items” (Yuan & Belkin, 2010). Almost three decades ago, Marcia Bates (1989) declared

25

this to be a poor representation of the majority of searches and seminal research has long
established that some form of iterative interaction between system and searcher is
beneficial to information seekers (Oddy 1977, Belkin 1980, Bates, 1989).
While known-item searches may be satisfied with the traditional IR model, people
engage in a variety of different information-seeking behaviors when using information
systems, and there have long been direct calls for designers to build systems with
mechanisms for supporting browsing and exploratory information seeking (e.g. Ellis,
1989; Kuhlthau, 1991).
A wide range of search strategies gives an information seeker increased retrieval power
(Bates, 1989). Studies have shown that good searching strategies involve both broadening
and narrowing a query, appropriate selection of terminology, and the ability to modify the
query (Sutcliffe, Ennis & Watkinson, 2000). However, most searches are not
sophisticated. In a synthesis of 25 years of end-user searching research, Markey (2007a),
concluded that the majority of searches are simple in nature: they bear few queries and
few terms, advanced search features are rarely used and large sets of results overwhelm
users.
Warwick et al. (2009) found that undergraduate students with a limited understanding of
their topic or assignment area struggled with query formulation. Using words from
assignment titles or handouts as the basis for keyword searches, they faced difficulties
both in interpreting the results and refining their search. In the same study, the
information seekers would become frustrated and anxious when they failed to find what
they needed, but instead of altering their approach to searching, or reformulating their
query, they would simply move to another website or search engine (Warwick et al.

26

2009). Looking at user behavior with regards to large results sets, Rieger (2009) found
that a popular coping mechanism for dealing with large information spaces in order to
avoid cognitive overload is simply to begin a new search if satisfactory results are not
found in the first one or two pages.
There is an unfortunate disconnect between what information seekers want and expect
from search and retrieval systems, and the skills they possess. Research looking at failed
searches has shown that the number one problem is the initial choice of search terms
(Markey, 2007b). However, users are extremely reticent to adopt new search behaviors
and are likely to continue to apply searching methods with which they are already
familiar (Sadeh, 2007b). In a study of graduate student web searchers, Martzoukou
(2008) found that while they were aware of the limitations of their search skills and
information seeking strategies, they had “minimal motivation to change habitual
behavioral patterns” and develop more complex strategies.
Users prefer recognizable and easy-to-learn discovery interfaces and expect to find
results rapidly and in a way that does not require precision searching (Sadeh, 2007b).
Exploratory search is another recognized online search technique that people employ,
especially when their information need is vague or difficult to express. Exploratory
searching involves a combination of search and browsing behaviors, and an information
need which crystalizes over the course of the search process (White & Roth, 2009). This
type of behavior is successful because although information seekers cannot always
express what they want at the outset, they can recognize what they want or do not want
during the course of a search (Markey, 2007b).

27

2.3.1 Information Seeking in the Context of the Library Catalog
The modern library catalog was designed to meet the objectives laid out in 1876 by
Charles Ammi Cutter to create bibliographic records designed to assist users in finding,
identifying, selecting and obtaining material of interest (Donlan & Carlin, 2007; La
Barre, 2007). Despite these grand aims, and regardless of their ability to match users with
material, library OPACs have historically been criticized as being difficult and frustrating
for patrons to use. The first generation pre-coordinate catalog of the 1960s and 1970s
were replaced by a generation of catalogs which offered keyword and Boolean operatorbased searching, but the difficulties for non-expert searchers remained, particularly when
attempting subject searches (Antelman et al., 2006). Early research showed that users of
OPACs encountered a series of mechanical and conceptual problems, Boolean searching
was rarely, if ever, used, and features designed to relieve one problem often created
another – particularly in terms of complicating the interface. (Borgman, 1986).
Difficulties with the OPAC continued, and were well documented through the 1990s.
Reviewing OPAC research since 1990, Large and Beheshti (1997) concluded that OPACs
were still in the experimental stage well into the second half of the decade. Researchers
noted that, perhaps more than any other information system, OPACs serve a population
of users extremely disparate in terms of age, language, IT skills, catalog and search
experience, and domain knowledge (Hsieh-Yee, 1993; Borgman, 1996). Although
known-item searches are generally accepted to be less problematic than subject searches
they are not without their problems; misspellings, typographical errors, incorrect syntax,
and individual system requirements and quirks may all contribute to known-item search
failures (Hunter, 1991; Wildemuth & O’Neil, 1995). Although participants in an OCLC

28

focus group experienced high levels of success when searching for known items, when
conducting general searches on a topic they expressed dissatisfaction when items which
were unrelated to what they were looking for were returned in the results list (OCLC,
2009b). Although they might not understand how to best craft an appropriate search
strategy for topic searches, catalog users want the catalog to “know” what they are
looking for based on the terms they type in the search box. (OCLC, 2009b). In a
transaction log analysis at an academic library, Villen-Rueda et al. (2007) found that
patrons frequently approached the catalog through the browsing interface, indicating their
information needs were broad or imprecise, or that they had difficulty formulating them
within the strict linguistic confines of the catalog.
The failings of OPACS intensified with the growing dominance of the web, and studies
showed that library patrons were not only frequent users of web search engines but
brought their understandings and expectations of them and applied them to the library
catalog. (Luther, 2003; Young & Yu, 2004). This is especially true in academic
environments where Google and other web search engines are the first place most
university students will turn for information (Griffith & Brophy, 2005; Connaway et al,
2011).
Though cognizant of both the deficiencies of the web and the strengths of the library
catalog, university students often express a preference for web search engines which are
considered to be easy, fast and convenient (Becker, 2003; Fast & Campbell, 2004;
Griffith & Brophy, 2005). In contrast, OPACs are considered to be much more
intellectually demanding:
An MIT student called the OPAC “intricate.” She said that when searching the
OPAC there were “a lot of little things to do,” “little tricks that you have to know

29

to get somewhere,” and “so many little steps” that “if you forget to do it, it
doesn’t work very well. (Fast & Campbell, 2004)
Research has indicated that people often assume that web search engines, OPACs, and
the search features of ecommerce sites and digital libraries all work in a similar way.
(Makri et al, 2007; Bawden and Vilar, 2006). Mental models of web search engines are
often simplistic and idealized and these models are transferred to other LIS systems
(Khoo & Hall, 2012). Connaway et al. (2011) found that the convenience and ease-of use
of Google were motivating factors in the information seeking habits of students and
faculty, who believed the search engine to be an information environment which libraries
should seek to replicate.
Surveys conducted in libraries frequently reported user dissatisfaction and frustration
with catalogs that they found difficult to use (e.g. Ho et al., 2009, Blair et al., 2011;
Denton and Coysh, 2011) Although librarians attempted to deflect criticism and improve
usability by emphasizing the importance of user-training and library induction, these
were often seen as further barriers to accessing information and an investment that
patrons were not willing to commit to (Sokvitne, 2006). OPAC users have extensive
experience with systems that require almost no training and which produce immediate, if
not completely satisfying, results (Fast & Campbell, 2004). And, while user tests of an
academic library’s new federated search engine found that some patrons were willing to
spend time to learn to use the new system, many just wanted a system with “point-andclick” Google simplicity (Ponsford & vanDuinkerken, 2007). In particular, younger
OPAC users, the so-called millennial generation, are inclined to be self-reliant and tend
not to ask for assistance: they use technology in everyday life and expect simplicity and
instant gratification (Nagy, 2011). Reflecting on the impact of Google over the previous

30

decade, Asher, Duke, & Wilson (2013) posit that “within the library, faculty and students
have come to expect a simplified, fast, all-inclusive, and principally online research
experience that mirrors their use of Google and other search engines.”
Patrons were not the only ones frustrated with the shortcomings of the OPAC. For library
staff, the catalog increasingly represented “stagnant technology” (Antelman et al. 2006).
In a report prepared for the Library of Congress, Karen Calhoun (2006) declared:
Today, a large number of students and scholars routinely bypass library catalogs
in favor of other discovery tools, and the catalog represents a shrinking
proportion of the universe of scholarly information. The catalog is in decline, its
processes and structures are unsustainable, and change needs to be swift.
Karen Schneider (2006a, b, c) wrote a series of blog posts entitled “How OPACs Suck”
which highlighted the failings of traditional OPACs and offered a wish list of desirable
features such as relevance ranking, stemming, field weighting, spell checking, sort
flexibility and faceting. These blog posts gained much attention in the LIS community
while both anecdotal and research evidence continued to point out the deficiencies of the
OPAC, such as empty results sets and lack of support for browsing behaviors or
serendipitous information discovery (Antelman et al., 2006; Sokvitne, 2006).
2.4 Facet-based Library Catalogs
As libraries began to acknowledge that their current toolsets and services were no longer
adequately meeting the demands of users who were used to fast, efficient and easy to use
web-based discovery tools (Sokvitne, 2006), energetic conversations began to take place
about how best to redesign the OPAC and commit to tools that would “provide a modern
search experience, meet user expectations and broaden the scope of what could be
discovered in the library” (Nagy, 2011). North Carolina State University (NCSU) was the

31

first to respond to the growing clamor for enhanced library catalogs by announcing, in
January 2006, that Endeca’s Profind, an implementation previously used solely in
commercial and other business applications, would be used with their OPAC. (La Barre,
2007). Endeca and NCSU worked closely on the implementation, with Endeca designers
visiting Raleigh to learn about the specific needs of libraries and to discuss with staff
what would and would not be possible in terms of functionality and features (Collins,
Samples & Pennell, 2007). The current NCSU Endeca–supported catalog interface is
illustrated in Figure 2.3. Facets are presented on the left of the screen, with the first facets
partially open to show the most frequently occurring values, and the latter facets
(language, region, time period, author) being closed. When partially opened, a “show
more” link appears which will fully expand the facet to display all values. The majority
of screen real estate is given to search results. The default presentation of these is by
relevance, but there is a drop down menu to choose other options such as publication
date, author or title A-Z, and most popular. Other features include item artwork (e.g.
book and DVD covers), buttons to add items to saved lists and to connect to a librarian,
and links to expand the search beyond the material in the NSCU catalog.

32

(image captured May 5, 2016).

33

These new OPAC implementations, of which there are now many in both academic and
public libraries, have been variously referred to as OPAC 2.0, next generation, third
generation or twenty-first century catalogs (Wilson, 2007) and are usually characterized
by “decoupled architecture” where existing bibliographic and management systems will
continue to service librarians, and the user interface is developed and implemented as a
separate platform (Sadeh, 2007b). Alongside Endeca, major players in the nextgeneration catalog market include LIS specific vendors such as Ex Libris, ProQuest and
Innovative Interfaces. Additionally, a number of OCLC libraries are using the enhanced
WorldCat Local interface.
As an alternative, or addition, to the catalog, libraries are also choosing to implement
web-scale discovery systems such as ProQuest’s Summon and EBSCO Discovery
Service. Library content has long been fragmented and placed in silos – the library
catalog, databases, electronic journals, locally hosted digital collections etc. (Wisniewski,
2010; Barton & Mak, 2012) - and unified or “one stop searching” has been a frequent
wish list feature (e.g. Wang & Dawes, 2012 Chickering & Yang, 2014). Web-scale
discovery systems offer this type of searching alongside many of the features and
functions of next generation catalogs. As the lines between catalogs and web-scale
discovery becomes increasingly blurred, the latter is often included under the umbrella
term of next generation catalogs, and are included as facet-based catalogs within this
study.
Open source development is another growing area in next generation catalogs, with
Blacklight and VuFind having a healthy user base. Both VuFind (developed at Villanova

34

University) and Blacklight (developed at the University of Virginia) trace the origins of
their product back to two things: 1) a growing dissatisfaction with the ability of current
ILS to meet the needs of their users, and 2) a belief that the newly commercial catalogs
were inspirational but too expensive (Houser, 2008; Sadler, 2008). In common with many
other open source library developments, Vufind and Blacklight use Apache Solr, a search
application based on the Lucene Java search library, to index and search not only MARC
records but other library materials which have not traditionally been easily representable
in library catalogs.
The much-heralded attraction of most next-generation discovery software is the ability to
provide facet-based search and browsing (Denholm et al. 2009). Facets can help reduce
the frustrating experience of unhelpful results sets, where too many, too few, or even
zero, results are returned (Antelman et al., 2006). Using facets as post-coordinate
refinements can reduce a large result set to a manageable size and, since facets and their
content is only visible if there are information objects associated with them, should not
allow a user to follow a path that leads to zero results. Library and information systems
have traditionally been designed to support search queries, and few allow for a true
browsing experience. Facets may assist with browsing by providing the scaffolding to
allow information seekers the opportunity to explore previously unknown or
unrecognized avenues within the catalog. Facets also allow users to move through large
information spaces in a flexible manner without feeling lost (English et al. 2002). When
an initial search returns an overwhelming number of results, or an information seeker is
struggling to frame their information need, facets can help with the selection of pertinent
avenues of enquiry, and siphon off irrelevant results.

35

Since 2006, the number of libraries offering facet-based catalogs has increased at a rapid
pace. In 2009, Hoffman & Yang (2011) randomly sampled 260 academic libraries in the
United States and Canada and found that 16% offered facet-based catalogs. Revisiting the
sample in 2011, they found this figure had almost doubled to 29% (Hoffman & Yang,
2012). Looking at 100 top academic institutions and 100 top public libraries, Hall (2011)
found facet-based catalogs were offered by 78% of the academic libraries and 54% of
public libraries.
However, as the adoption of facet-based catalogs continues to grow, some of the early
enthusiasm has been tempered by reality, with Marshall Breeding (2012) writing,
“librarians may appreciate what [facet-based catalogs] are trying to do but regret their
weaknesses.” The first libraries to adopt facet-based catalogs did so with commercial
systems designed originally for retail environments with the express aim of connecting
customers with concrete items to generate profit. Although the facet-based catalog market
is large enough that libraries are now using systems modeled primarily for library use, it
is still the case that their design and functionality owes more to commercial online
applications than it does to the traditional LIS origins of facet theory.
In describing the development of the VuFind and Blacklight and products, Houser (2008)
and Sadler (2008) acknowledge their understanding of the history and usefulness of
facets is most closely tied with an information architecture heritage and the deployment
of facets on websites. However, data applied to cultural objects are more complex and
powerful than most metadata that is routinely assigned to commercial products (La Barre,
2007) suggesting that facets must be chosen and implemented with considerable care to
be of optimum use in a library catalog.

36

2.5 Implications for Catalogers and Cataloging
The emergence of facet-based catalogs, along with changes in cataloging standards and
procedures, increased focus on digital materials, and reductions in library budgets has
renewed focus on catalogers and cataloging work. In a survey of cataloging department
heads at academic research libraries, Tarulli and Spiteri (2012) assert that catalogers are
likely more divided in their opinions about facet-based catalogs than other library
professionals, with the new catalogs possibly bringing about changes to existing practices
as well as the adoption of new responsibilities and skills. In Wynne and Hanscom’s
(2011) survey, 18% of participants reported changes to their cataloging workflow, in
addition to data clean up. Boydston and Leyston (2014) found that cataloging
responsibilities had changed over the previous two years with an increased focus on
cataloging digital content, local and unique collections, and creating non-marc metadata.
Against the backdrop of new and increased responsibilities, the adoption of facet-based
catalogs influences, and is influenced by, prevailing cataloging and metadata policies. A
big selling point of facet-based catalogs has been their promise to “better utilize library
data than traditional catalogues” (Schultz-Jones, et al. 2012) and metadata has been
revealed to library users in new, and not always completely successful, ways. Just as
facet-based catalogs are able to expose previously hidden metadata, they can also expose
previously hidden errors and inconsistencies such as incorrect subfield coding,
inconsistent authority names and subject headings, and difficult integration of multiple
classification schemes, controlled vocabularies and metadata schemes (Wynne &
Hanscom, 2011; Schultz-Jones et al., 2012). These problems can be caused by a number

37

of factors including human error, obsolete practices and local or non-standard practices
(Wynne & Hanscom, 2011).
The implications of “catalogers judgment”; the decisions catalogers make when creating
bibliographic records has been discussed by several researchers (e.g. Snow, 2011; ShultzJones et al., 2012; Hasenyager, 2015) These decisions are based on education, training
and practice, and impact what information is included in the record and where, as well as
what is left out (Schultz-Jones et al. 2012). Hasenyager (2015) noted the importance of
training and communities of practice to provide catalogers with the required knowledge
and skills needed for cataloging decision-making. In interviews with new catalogers,
Dulock (2011) found that only five of 22 participants felt that their MLS experience left
them well prepared for their professional position. Hands-on experience through
cataloging coursework or completion of a practicum was noted by interviewees as
especially valuable, and many participants reflected desire for “more and better”
cataloging courses (Dulock, 2011).
Joudrey & McGinnis (2014) analyzed the information organization courses offered by
ALA-accredited LIS graduate schools during 2012-2013. They found that while every
LIS school offered at least one course which focused on cataloging, subject cataloging,
thesaurus construction and classification courses were in decline compared to surveys
taken in 2000 and 2005.The biggest growth area was in courses relating to metadata, with
62% of LIS schools offering related courses. While Joudrey and McGinnis (2014) were
optimistic about certain trends, they found others to be concerning, including the decline
in courses relating to subject access, which they viewed as important to a variety of LIS
positions beyond cataloging.

38

Hasenyager (2015) found that it was not only novice catalogers who needed training and
professional development support, but veteran catalogers too. Terrill (2014) found that
catalogers view professional development as very important to their success with
electronic discussion lists, conferences and journal articles being judged as the most
important and reliable sources.
Park et al. (2010) surveyed cataloging and metadata professionals and discovered a
strong interest in continuing education, with workshops and conferences being the most
commonly used training methods. Survey respondents were interested in further
education and training in a wide variety of cataloging-related topics including developing
metadata quality control mechanisms, markup languages, authority control, controlled
subject vocabularies and thesaurus construction (Park et al., 2010).
CannCasiciato (2010) has argued that a strict focus on the production of bibliographic
records has obscured the true objective of cataloging to provide a needed reference
service to library users:
The cataloger’s purpose is to create an answer to patrons’ questions about what
information resources we have that will help them. The description, the number of
access points, and the various access fields created combine to facilitate the
possibility of a successful interview. Keyword access and structured subject
heading access are not redundancies; they are access and guidance mechanisms
for students who approach their possible topic from various directions, some
articulate and some ambiguous.
CannCasiciato believes that ignoring the service to patrons that cataloging provides is one
of the driving forces behind libraries viewing cataloging as an expensive and timeconsuming activity. Several researchers have discussed the importance of cataloging and
controlled vocabularies to information discovery (Kirkland, 2013; Gross, Taylor &
Joudrey, 2015; Borie, MacDonald & Sze, 2015) Despite this, the perceived value of

39

cataloging, in particular to library management and administration, remains a concern
(Boydsten & Leysen, 2014, Petrucciani, 2015). As libraries increasingly use vendor
created and supplied metadata, Boydsten & Leysten (2014) found some catalogers were
concerned that automated or vendor supplied records would replace original cataloging
and noted that their work had “shifted from data creation to data management.”
Shadle (2013) notes that there can be problems with inaccurate or incomplete publisher
and vendor supplied metadata (e.g. incorrect ISSNs for articles or application of incorrect
genres), but concludes that declining staff resources mean that libraries must depend on
vendor metadata more than ever before. Butler & Thompson (2013) report cataloging and
systems staff have to work together to think about how database content and vendor
supplied metadata is accessed in the catalog. Sometimes this may mean suppressing
MARC catalog records to avoid duplication or adding MARC records to ensure that
resources are included. Problems with library metadata, vendor supplied or librarian
created, directly impacts user experience with facet-based catalogs. In traditional
catalogs, records which did not meet at least minimal cataloging standards were not
readily seen as the system displayed records one by one in the search results. In facetbased catalogs, metadata is aggregated to populate the facets, making errors and
omissions much more obvious (Han, 2012). At the University of Illinois, library users
had problems using facets due to metadata inconsistencies and the use of non-controlled
vocabularies (Emanuel, 2011).
Completeness, accuracy and consistency are the evaluation criteria most commonly
applied to metadata (Park, 2009). In a survey of over 300 cataloging and metadata staff,
approximately 75% of respondents reported that accuracy and consistency were used as

40

metrics for metadata quality in their digital collections, with completeness being used by
65% (Park & Tosaka, 2010). While cataloging and metadata professionals agree that
quality metadata is essential for resource discovery, divergent local practices can create
problems for record and resource sharing between institutions as well as federated
searching of different collections within a single library (Park, 2009; Park & Tosaka,
2010). After implementation of the EDS tool, library staff at the University of North
Alabama found that not all content within EDS was indexed using the same standards and
some of the metadata fields used to populate the facets did not exist in some databases.
As a result, by using certain facets (e.g. language) users may have been inadvertently
excluding relevant content. (Butler & Thompson, 2013).
Integrating different controlled vocabularies and metadata schemes were issues
highlighted by participants in Wynne and Hanscom’s survey. Data maintenance and
clean-up activities were another widespread activity with common problems including
name and subject headings not being consistently maintained, incorrect subfield coding,
and digital resources not being classified (Wynne & Hanscom, 2011).
2.6 User Studies of Facet-based Systems
In concordance with Fagan (2010), most recent literature on user studies falls into one of
two camps: studies of facets on interfaces created by researchers, and studies of facetbased library catalogs. A review of some of the former is included here because of the
transferability of the findings to facet-based library catalogs. Also included in this section
is a review of several studies which have used transaction log analysis to measure user
interaction with facets.

41

2.6.1 Facet–based Interfaces
Researchers at UC Berkeley, led by Marti Hearst, were at the forefront of developing
facet-based interfaces for digital collections, building a system, Flamenco, to determine
how to aid navigation and browsing of collections via the use of hierarchical faceted
metadata (Hearst, 2006). English et al. (2002) describe the results of the first Flamenco
usability study which was performed on a collection of 40,000 architectural images.
Nineteen practitioners and graduate students in architectural fields performed a series of
tasks using both faceted and single hierarchy interfaces, and data was recorded via server
logs, behavior logs (observations), online post-task questionnaires, and paper surveys at
the end of the study. Overall, the facet-based interface was judged very favorably, with
the majority of participants preferring it to the traditional hierarchical interface.
Additionally it was perceived as being 22% more flexible, 18% more powerful and 8%
more browsable than the single hierarchy. However, when searching for specific images,
participants experienced less success using the facet-based interface. The researchers
concluded this was most likely due to differences in the way that images were displayed
in the two interfaces rather than an inherent advantage that a single hierarchy has for
known item searching.
Using Flamenco, and a collection of 32,000 images from the Fine Arts Museum of San
Francisco, Yee et al. (2003) tested a facet-based interface against a traditional keyword
based image search engine. Thirty-two art history students participated in the evaluation
study and were asked to complete four tasks on both interfaces. Ninety percent of
participants preferred the faceted interface overall, and 97% said it helped them learn
more about the collection (Yee et al, 2003). Participants did spend a significantly longer

42

time on some tasks when using the faceted search interface compared to the traditional
interface, although this may be partly due to the slower response time of the system. The
faceted interface outperformed the traditional interface on measures of ease of use,
simplicity, flexibility, interest, ease of browsing, and enjoyment. The faceted interface
was rated to be more overwhelming, but not significantly. Participants were also
significantly more likely to use the faceted interface again (Yee et al., 2003).
Throughout the study, the researchers also observed facet usage. With structured tasks,
the use of facets tended to, unsurprisingly, be driven by the nature of the task and the
most frequent starting points were date, location, media, artist, and theme. In unstructured
browsing tasks however, facet usage was more evenly distributed across all facets.
Within the browsing tasks, participants also used multiple facets simultaneously 19% of
the time, and this rose to 45% of the time in the structured searching tasks (Yee et al,
2003).
The International Children’s Digital Library (ICDL) has used faceted metadata from its
inception, and classified its collection of children’s books by 14 top-level facets such as
shape, language, color and genre (Hutchinson, Druin and Bederson, 2007). However, the
presentation of the facets meant that only one could be explored at a time, leaving the
creation of Boolean queries to be a complicated and confusing process. In order to
address this difficulty and to maximize the usefulness of the faceted metadata, in 2004
the ICDL team redesigned both the structure and presentation of the facets and interface,
by flattening the depth of the facet hierarchies and presenting them simultaneously
(Hutchinson, Druin and Bederson, 2007). In order to evaluate the changes, two user
studies were conducted. Two interface designs similar to the new and old ICDL browsers

43

were created and 72 children from three different age groups (first, third and fifth grades)
evaluated them. In both studies, the participants began with a period of free browsing. In
the first, Simple, study the participants were then asked to conduct a search on each
interface using a single category, and in the second, Boolean, study, participants were
asked to do a search on each interface using two categories. Participants in both studies
were asked questions about their understanding of, and thoughts towards the two systems
(Hutchinson, Druin and Bederson, 2007).
In both the Simple and Boolean studies, children created significantly more Boolean
queries using the new interface than with the old one and completed tasks. In the Boolean
study, children required significantly more hints to complete tasks when using the old
interface. Overall, although both interfaces appeared to be equally suitable for simple
queries, the new interface had significant advantages over the old interface for more
complex searching and browsing activities. Although this work by Hutchinson, Druin and
Bederson focused on children (as the primary users of ICDL), it is not unreasonable to
think that faceted structures may provide similar benefits to adult users, particularly those
who are not familiar with the concept of Boolean queries or who do not have much
experience or confidence in online searching.
Uddin and Janacek (2007) developed a prototype Faceted Classification System (FCS) to
support the diverse user needs and search strategies of staff and students at the Asian
Institute of Technology. Nineteen participants were recruited to test the FCS with the
standard system (SS). The participants were required to perform three tasks with each
system: 1) look for scholarship information for a masters program, 2) look for staff
recruitment information, and 3) look for research and associated faculty information

44

within their area of interest (Uddin and Janacek, 2007). Participants were faster using the
FCS for all three tasks, and significantly so for tasks 2 and 3. They were also more
successful, with more relevant results being found with FCS as compared to SS. A poststudy questionnaire discovered that FCS was perceived to be more interesting, easier to
use, more flexible, more enjoyable and less confusing than SS.
2.6.2 User Studies of Facet-based Catalogs
As libraries have introduced facet-based catalogs, a growing body of literature has
resulted which reports on user experience with facets. These studies usually employ small
sample sizes, and can lack rigorous methodologies and statistical testing; however, they
do provide valuable information on user interaction with real-world systems containing
large and complex datasets (Fagan, 2010).
As the first academic library to adopt a next-generation OPAC, NCSU planned a series of
assessment activities to compare student performance using the old and new catalogs.
The average task duration was significantly decreased with the new Endeca catalog.
Although the number of failed tasks using Endeca was lower than with the old catalog, it
was still reasonably high. Researchers concluded that this was partly due to confusing
terminology in the new OPAC. (Antelman et al, 2006). Although all five participants who
used the Endeca catalog confirmed their understanding of facets as refinement tools
during post-test interviews, only three used facets during the test itself. Participants
frequently sought to limit searches from the outset rather than start with a broad search
and then refine. In a second, 2008, user study, NCSU staff again found that participants
used facets occasionally and inconsistently. Even for tasks where facet usage was
anticipated, few participants used them immediately. For example, one task asked

45

participants to find a certain book at a particular campus library. The Library facet was
eventually used by most of the participants, but it was not immediately used by any
(Littletree, 2008).
At the University of Minnesota, participants in user studies found facets to be useful for
refining results and a differentiating feature between old and new catalogs (Sadeh, 2007b;
Fagan, 2010). However, one year after the facet-based Primo catalog was launched as the
default catalog, the library surveyed catalog users about perceptions of success, knownitem searching and preferred search environments and found higher reported success
rates with the traditional catalog than with the facet-based one (Hessel & Fransen, 2012).
The researchers caution that users of the traditional catalog are a self-selecting group who
may be more likely in general to experience greater search success. They also note that a
high proportion of known-item searching still occurs in the traditional catalog, whereas
the facet-based catalog is often used for browsing topics (Hessel & Fransen, 2012).
The University of Kansas Library, another Primo user, performed user studies of its
catalog shortly after its soft and full launches (Hanrath & Kottman, 2015). As is common
in most catalog user studies, participants were presented with both known-item and openended research tasks. Across all tasks, facets were used 32% of the time and this figure
rose to 55% for the open-ended task. Researchers compared their study findings to facet
usage data collected by Google Analytics and found that use of facets in real information
seeking activities was “not wildly dissimilar” (Hanrath & Kottman, 2015).
In the University of Chicago’s initial user study of its AquaBrowser catalog, nine of the
twelve participants remarked that they found material in the new catalog that they had not
previously discovered, and the researchers were confident that at least four of these

46

individuals identified new material through the use of facets (Olson, 2007). Reaction to
the facets was positive overall, with several participants finding them helpful as a refining
tool. A small number of students were identified as being more ambivalent to the facets,
at least for their own research, but stated that they might be more useful in supporting
users less familiar with the library catalog (Olson, 2007).
York University Library conducted a usability study using both in-person testing and an
online survey to assess its VuFind catalog (Denton and Coysh, 2011). The in-person
usability test was based on previous studies conducted at NCSU and Yale (i.e. Antelman
et al., 2006; Bauer 2008a, b, c) and ten students participated. The online survey was
completed by 75 people. Participants expressed a preference for Vufind over the
traditional library catalog and made particular mention of facets as the feature of the
catalog that they liked and that stood out the most.
Similarly, all 16 international students at the University of Sheffield expressed a
preference for a facet-based interface when interviewed (Tam, Cox & Bussey, 2009).
They found facet interfaces to be familiar from commercial environments and felt that
facets would save time, narrow results, and provide the functionality of advanced search
while being easier to use.
Salaba and Zhang (2009) introduced 98 LIS students to library catalogs using
AquaBrowser, Encore, VuFind and Scriblio systems and asked participants to rate
features for desirability and helpfulness. Facet-based navigation was rated as a top feature
for helpfulness alongside advanced search capability, sorting results, simple search box
and enriched content. Facets were also judged to be the most desirable catalog feature,
just ahead of relevance ranking. A preference for facets over other features was also seen

47

at Western Michigan University where data analysis of the VuFind catalog found that
approximately 20% of searches made use of facets but other web 2.0 “bells and whistles”
were not used (Ho et al. 2008).
Praise for facets has not been unanimous however, and even users who appreciate facets
have experienced problems with their implementation. A 2008 Yale University online
survey to solicit user opinions about their VuFind catalog found that while users had a
generally favorable impression of facets, there were common complaints about the
appearance of particular facets and facet content which was considered to be misleading,
incorrect or unrelated to the search query (Bauer, 2008c).
OCLC conducted a series of usability tests of WorldCat Local with academic and public
library users (2009a) and held focus groups and surveys with catalog users (2009b).
Although participants noticed and appreciated the functionality of facets, they were found
to be “more often praised than used” (OCLC, 2009a). Focus groups discovered that not
all participants were accustomed to using facets and, for some, their immediate
functionality was not clear (OCLC, 2009b). Although one set of studies found that
undergraduate students and casual searchers were likely to be familiar with faceted
browsing and to understand the results they would get by selecting particular facets, they
were not often used in subject searching, and several participants said they were not
certain what they would eliminate if they used particular facets. (OCLC, 2009a; OCLC,
2009b).
Elwell (2013) reports that after implementation of the Summon catalog at the University
of Wolverhampton, library staff discovered that students conducting known item searches
were being overwhelmed by the number of results. As facets were not being used in these

48

cases to narrow down their search, the single search box interface was redesigned to
incorporate fields for title, author, and keyword (Elwell, 2013) While Summon is judged
by library staff to be successful, it is noted that around 60% of searches end with no
results being viewed and three quarters of these are followed by a new search with small
changes to search terms (Elwell, 2013).
A University of Chicago Library study to assess how music scholars were served by the
AquaBrowser catalog found that while the format facet was useful, other facets were
more problematic (Synder, 2010). Participants noted that the topic facet contained both
subject terms and musical genres, and several participants commented on the futility of
topics like “Music”. Genre was similarly described by some as “a hodgepodge” and a
“mess” and there was almost unanimous confusion as to the purpose of the Geographic
Region and Time Period facets (Synder, 2010). Similar confusion about the purpose of
the region and era facets was observed at York University. Participants in the in-person
test thought those facets were indicative of place and date of publication, and survey
respondents indicated those facets, along with call number, were not often used (Denton
and Coysh, 2011).
Reporting on a series of seven usability tests, Blumer, Hugi and Schneider (2014) found
that while user opinion of facets was generally positive, there was some uncertainty about
their functionality. Additionally, some design issues such as unclear labelling, hindered
their use. User testing at the University of Illinois found that while participants generally
liked facets, they had some difficulty in using them effectively (Emanuel, 2011).
However, most problems were caused by the content of the facets – confusing

49

terminology, apparent inconsistencies etc., rather than participants not understanding
facet functionality (Emanuel, 2011).
Cassidy et al. (2014) found that students thought that “full text” was synonymous with
“books” while Hoover (2016) found that users did not expect video streaming to be
available under “full text”. Nichols et al. (2014) report that several users became
confused by facet labels in a Primo catalog with some selecting to limit by “journal”
rather than “article” and leaving them unable to complete a task. Clear and consistent
labeling was deemed to be especially important since the researchers concluded that
when participants failed to use facets and limiters, the search results list was
overwhelming to them (Nichols et al. 2014).
Clear and effective facet labels has been highlighted as a critical need for facet-based
catalogs (Gallaway & Hines, 2012; Nelson & Turney, 2015; Niu & Hemminger, 2015).
Researchers at the University of Colorado found that terms like “government
publication” and “electronic resource” were confusing to undergraduate students (Majors,
2012) while other studies have found library users may have difficulty discerning
between facets (Thompson, Obrig & Abate, 2013; Osborne and Cox, 2015). Nelson &
Turney (2015) surmise that with facet labels, libraries have simply continued the naming
conventions used in databases and that certain facets, such as “source type” and “content
providers” are likely not understood by most users. Even the seemingly benign “subject”
may be confusing to users who believe they have already done a subject search (Nelson
& Turney, 2015).
Usability studies of various facet-based systems have shown that although participants
show a willingness to use facets and other features, they do not always use the most

50

helpful ones (Fagan et al 2012; Brett et. al., 2016). In a study comparing the facet-based
Endeca catalog with a traditional library catalog, Ramdeen & Hemminger (2012) report
that several participants noted that they would not have used facets or understood how
they worked if it had not been for the pre-study training session. This was echoed by
participants in a study at a UK library, who felt that training would be required for
students to take full advantage of newer features including facets (Osborne & Cox, 2015).
At Royal Roads University, introduction of Summon increased the demand for reference
help but had little impact on the type of questions received. Meredith (2013) concludes
that question complexity has not increased since changing the library catalog does not
automatically improve search strategies or reduce confusion about the search process. In
evaluating different web-scale discovery products at Auburn University Libraries, staff
found that much instruction is needed to use web-scale discovery systems as they do not
inherently nurture the research process or promote information literacy, and the
application of subject facets is problematic as metadata is pulled from a variety of
different sources using different controlled vocabularies (Ellero, 2013).
2.6.3 Log Analysis of Facet-based Catalogs
A number of studies have employed transaction log analysis as a method for
characterizing user behavior with facet-based catalogs. These provide a useful insight to
how facets are being incorporated into the real-life information seeking behaviors of
users. Lown (2008) analyzed a set of nearly one million search requests sent to the NCSU
OPAC during a four month period in 2007. Developing a typology of user actions he
found that facet search, where the user refined results set by selecting a facet, accounted
for 18% of user actions, and 34% of all search sessions included at least one facet search,

51

a figure which rose to 40% when sessions that include just a single action are excluded.
Fifty-eight percent of queries that applied facets only applied one; 23% applied two; 12%
applied three; 6% applied four and just 1% applied more than four facets. Looking at
which facets were used most often, the most popular facet was subject-topic which
accounted for 29% of all facet usage. LC call number accounted for 24%, format 14%
and library 9%. New, subject-genre, author, subject-region, subject-era, language and
availability facets each accounted for 5% or less of all facet usage (Lown, 2008; Lown &
Hemminger, 2009).
Some very contrasting results were discovered in the analysis of the University of North
Carolina (UNC) catalog. Niu, Lown and Hemminger (2009) processed and coded over
1,200,000 query records from December 2008 to April 2009 and found that facet actions
including opening and closing facets, adding and removing etc., only accounted for 6% of
the total number of actions. The authors postulated that this low number may be
explained, at least in part, by the relative newness of the catalog at the time of the study.
Transaction log analysis of search sessions in the same catalog between October 2010
and March 2011 saw just over 12% of all search sessions use at least one facet action
(Niu & Hemminger, 2015).
Another study compared the transaction logs of two library catalogs, UNC and Phoenix
Public Library (PPL), to explore the differences in facet usage between an academic and
public library (Niu and Hemminger, 2010). Both catalogs used Endeca to implement
facets, but UNC’s focus was primarily on facets as a form of search refinement, whereas
PPL also offered support for facet-based browsing. Log data from each catalog was
processed and automatically coded for particular actions that form part of the search

52

process. In the UNC catalog, the action of adding a facet only accounted for 5.3% of
actions, but it accounted for 12.4% of PPL’s. A major factor in this difference is PPL’s
support of facet-based browsing where users can select facets without having already
performed a text query. In fact, 53% of PPL’s add facet actions occurred in browsing
rather than as search refinements, suggesting that facet-based catalogs can be of
particular use in supporting browsing behaviors.
Ballard and Blaine (2011) compared a year’s transaction logs for both the classic catalog
and the new Encore implementation at New York Law School library. They discovered
that users of Encore spent an average of four minutes in the catalog as opposed to users
of the classic catalog whose search session lasted an average of 90 seconds. Moreover,
the researchers found that 8.47% of searches in Encore employed a facet to refine a
search. In contrast less than 1% of searches in the classic catalog employed limiters,
despite library staff advocating their use during instruction.
Bauer & Peterson-Hart (2012) studied six month of transaction logs from Yale
University’s traditional and facet based catalogs. They found that facets were applied in
25.4% of searches using the facet-based catalog. Format was the most frequently used
facet (accounting for 31% of all facet use), followed by language (27.8%) and subject
(20.1%). Overall, subject heading facets were used in 5.1% of searches leading the
authors to conclude that “simply exposing existing subject headings in faceted display” is
not enough to ensure their usage. At UNC, Niu and Hemminger (2015) found that format
and location were the most used facet, a result that was expected by undergraduate
librarians who reported that users “typically want to select the most convenient
resources”. Dempsey & Valentini (2016) analyzed the transaction logs of 116

53

undergraduates taking an instructional class for Raritan Valley Community College’s
EBSCO Discovery Service implementation. They found that only 41% of students
applied the peer reviewed limiter, despite the fact it was strongly emphasized during
instruction and students were required to find a peer-reviewed article for their research
paper.
Several researchers have suggested that facets may also be used in a more passive way.
Ramdeen & Hemminger (2012) found that while users did not always select facets, they
visually referred to them while evaluating search results. This was corroborated in studies
using eye tracking software to observe the parts of a catalog screen that users look at
during different stages of searching (Kules et al., 2009; Kules & Capra, 2012).
Researchers at Summon report that while use of the advanced search interface and
advanced syntax features is low, transaction logs show that filter usage is fairly common,
with over 40% of queries using at least one filter. However, they also report that some of
their clients set the default search to include one or more filters, so not all filters are
applied by the end user. (Diamond, Price & Chandrasekar, 2013).
By reviewing user studies and usability tests and transaction logs of real-life use of
facets, we can observe that while facets are generally praised they are not always used.
Non-use of facets may have many causes, including the negligible benefits that using
facets offers to many known-item or quick look-up style searches. In other cases
however, it may be that non-use is caused by other factors such as uncertainty over what
facets are or what they do, confusion about terminology, and unease about apparent
inconsistencies and errors in the metadata.

54

2.7 Staff Resistance to Facet-based Catalogs
Despite the widely reported problems of traditional OPACs and the general professional
enthusiasm surrounding facet-based catalogs, their implementation has not always been
smooth sailing. Some of the most frequently reported concerns have been staff diffidence
to the system. Apparent in many libraries is a division between library staff who embrace
the new discovery tools and library staff who lament the apparent abandonment of
learning effective and advanced search strategies (Rose-Wiles & Hoffman, 2013).
Breeding (2012) notes that as some librarians may prefer to use the traditional catalog, a
strategy for many libraries is to offer the new facet-based catalog while retaining the
older catalog for staff and users with specialized needs. However, he cautions that this
cannot be a permanent solution as the older software will eventually become obsolete,
besides which, a majority of library users express a preference for facet-based interfaces.
Ramzan & Singh (2010) report that librarians’ attitudes to new technologies play a
fundamental role in the provision of these technologies in libraries. If staff are not
comfortable with a resource, they may not be able to effectively teach and advocate for it
(Allen, 2015; Ghaphery et al., 2016).
Calarco et al. (2014) found that many faculty remained unfamiliar with the new facetbased catalog at Queens Library because library staff, who preferred the traditional
catalog, had not been promoting it. In a survey of reference and instruction librarians at
institutions using Summon, Buck and Mellinger (2011) found that 23% of participants
viewed Summon as detrimental to students’ information literacy skills, and criticized its
promotion of “good enough” search results while not encouraging users to learn basic
search skills and strategies. Petr and Currie (2014) report that some Kansas University

55

librarians refused to promote the new Primo catalog in instruction and reference sessions,
and many staff members complained that the new tool was not what they had expected.
At the University of Wolverhampton, the implementation of Summon was reported to
follow the Gartner Hype Cycle and staff “plummeted into the Trough of Disillusionment”
shortly after launch, as every small issue appeared magnified and critical (Elwell, 2013).
A half-day training session was required of all staff to run through some of the known
problems, as well as covering search techniques, to help them feel more comfortable with
the system. Gaining acceptance from library staff was also one of the greatest challenges
faced by the University of Alabama at Birmingham when they implemented WorldCat
Local (Kain, 2014). When metadata errors and inconsistencies in catalog records
produced unsatisfactory search results, tensions rose between systems and public services
staff because solutions were not immediately forthcoming. Subject librarians were also
frustrated that the catalog did not work in the way they expected it to work, while some
were unhappy that users could not search using the same methods that they used in the
old catalog (Kain, 2014).
The challenge of new technology is as much an organizational challenge as it a
technological one (Leonard, Barton, 1988; Lopata, 1993) and that is certainly the case
with library innovations. Aharony & Prebor (2015) found a correlation between computer
use and favorable opinions to facet-based catalogs, where staff with more computing
experience held more favorable views towards the new catalogs. They also noted that
individuals who were more open to new experiences and challenges were also more
likely to value the facet-based catalog.

56

Researchers have identified several factors which contribute to the acceptance of, or
resistance to, library innovations, including: participation in decision-making and
implementation, interest and experience with technology, personality, habits and fear of
change, perceived threats to job security or job status, presence of champions or changeagents, gender and age, size and structure of the organization, and perceived availability
of training and skills enhancement (Leonard-Barton, 1988; Lopata, 1993; Ostrow, 1998;
Weiner, 2003).
Diffusion of innovation theory as conceptualized by Everett Rogers (1998) has been
identified as one way of understanding how, why, and at what rate innovative products
and processes are adopted within a library environment. Rogers’ model includes a
typology of individuals within a social system based on their willingness to adopt an
innovation, the decision making process by which innovations are adopted or rejected,
and the criteria by which individuals evaluate innovations (Weiner, 2003)
Rogers understands innovations to have five attributes that affect the adoption process:
relative advantage (degree to which the innovation is superior to what it replaces),
compatibility (degree to which innovation is perceived as consistent with adopter’s prior
experiences and values), complexity (degree to which innovation is difficult to understand
and use), trialability (degree to which an innovation can be tried in a phased or
experimental manner, and observability (degree to which results of using the innovation
can be perceived by others) (Rogers, 1995; Lopata 1993; Jantz, 2012).
Adopter categories are used to characterize individuals within a social system based on
their willingness to adopt an innovation compared to their peers. The five categories are
innovators (2.5% in a normal-frequency distribution), early adopters (13.5%), early

57

majority (34%), late majority (34%) and laggards (16%) (Rogers, 1998). Weiner (2003)
describes the categories as follows:
“Innovators tend to have a wide network of contacts, are technologically literate
and adventurous, and are able to cope with uncertainty. Early adopters of
innovation are well integrated into their local social system. They act as opinion
leaders and role models who exert influence based on personal networks. Early
majority and late majority adopt with less willingness. They are pressured or
reassured by those who adopted before them. Laggards are traditionalists who
are generally isolated, have few resources, and look to the past as their point of
reference.”
Rabina & Walczyk (2007) surveyed 1128 librarians in order to identify how innovative
librarians were in terms of adopting information technology. After categorizing responses
according to Rogers’ adopter categories, they found 3.6% to be innovators, 24.6% to be
early adopters, 17.2% to be early majority, 37% to be late majority, and 17.7% to be
laggards. While they found consistency with Rogers’ normal distribution of adopter
categories for innovators, late majority and laggards, the researchers found significant
discrepancy with the categories of early adopters (+11.1%) and early majority (-16.8%)
(Rabina & Walczyk, 2007).
The researchers suggest that too many opinion leaders promoting too many opinions to
too few early majority will cause problems for the diffusion of innovations within library
settings. As early adopters are the group which speeds up or slows down the diffusion of
innovation, too many people in this group makes the innovation-decision complex and
time consuming for the early majority, and, as a result, the diffusion of innovations in
library settings may decelerate rather than accelerate (Rabina & Walczyk, 2007).
In a study of academic library leaders, Jantz (2012) found that innovation was viewed as
a critical process for the library of the 21st Century. However, while the view towards

58

innovation was favorable, the researchers noted obstacles such as the routine, procedural
work that many staff engage in, a culture that fears failure and rapid change, and the
inability to take calculated risks. While incremental innovation appears to be praised and
in action at participants’ institutions, Jantz (2012) concludes that the process and rule
based structure of academic libraries may inhibit more radical innovation. This echoes
the conclusions of Leonard-Barton (1988) who believes that innovations should be
viewed as a process of mutual adaption between technology and organization.
The report of successful Summon implementations at NCSU and the University of
Colorado (UCD) indicate that creating and adapting organizational culture is helpful to
the implementation of new systems. Both institutions developed organizational cultures
that encourage innovation and embrace ambiguity, and reorganized their technical
services departments to support these philosophies (Somerville & Antelman, 2013). After
a previous failure to implement WorldCat Local, UCD had learned the importance of the
whole library team taking ownership of the project, and the necessity of continuous and
open communication with stakeholders. For their part, NCSU found that too deep
engagement by senior management was detrimental to successful implementation, and
input from “thought leaders” at the department head level was required to get the project
back on track (Somerville & Antelmam, 2013).
Based on analysis of previous studies as well as their own observations, researchers and
practitioners have compiled recommendations for those in charge of introducing
innovative technologies and processes in order to smooth the transition process and
lessen resistance. Based on innovation theories and conversations with library directors,
Weiner (2003) advised leaders to: provide a clear vision of the change, be a model for

59

accepting and incorporating change, involve all stakeholders, allow time to adjust, divide
big change into manageable steps, make requirements clear, offer positive reinforcement,
allow nostalgia for the past but create excitement for the future, maintain a sense of
humor, and assess change and make improvements.
Jill Ellern’s (2011) advice on surviving mandated projects is based on 20 years’
experience as a systems librarian. Her seven principles include: keeping perspective,
maintaining a sense of humor, establishing clear expectations, practicing good
communication, being aware of the political ramifications of actions, managing
expectations, and a willingness to clean up messes and make required changes.
Calhoun (2006) identified a five point plan for managing change in library catalogs:


Complete stakeholder analyses; prepare and carry out two-way communication
plans customized for each stakeholder group.



Train managers and staff to understand and cope with the dynamics of personal
and organizational transition.



Recruit and train change agents.



Reward flexibility and openness.



Create transitional roles.

As Lopata (1993) concludes, there is no way to circumvent the need to adapt both the
technology and the organization during the implementation process. She therefore
recommends that a good strategy is to expect the unexpected, allow more time and more
resources than planned, and be ready to change specifications and reverse decisions.

60

2.8. Facet-based Catalogs: Understandings and Practices
The majority of literature related to library implementations of facet-based catalogs
generally provide little direct information about the decisions which inform the choice of
catalog and how facets are selected. Reports of usability tests and user studies do indicate
some general trends that suggest a user-centered outlook such as staff and patron
dissatisfaction with previous catalogs and a widely held view that facets are a beneficial
feature for exploring the collection and refining searches. Other factors suggest a more
pragmatic approach such as assessments of cost, staff skills, and existing data.
Vaughan (2012) provides an extensive report of a model used to research, evaluate and
select a facet-based system. He describes how, in 2009, UNLV libraries began the
process of selecting a web-scale discovery system to operate in conjunction with their
catalog. After a disappointing experience with a previous federated search product, the
implementation team wanted to take a thorough approach to evaluation.
Vaughan (2012) describes the process as split in two: internal and external research.
Internal research began with educating themselves, and other staff, about web-scale
discovery. Staff were then surveyed before vendor visits and asked about desirable
features, capabilities and content. After vendor visits, staff were surveyed again to see
how well each product met each need. Finally, early adopter references were obtained
from other libraries that were using the products under consideration. External research
included initial vendor identification, vendor investigation (asking vendors to answer set
questions, literature searches, and product reviews) as well as scheduling vendor visits.
At Auburn University Libraries, a discovery tool committee was formed and instructed to
identify available systems, benchmark the implementations at other institutions, assess

61

the systems, compare technical, user and cost attributes of the systems, and make
recommendations (Ellero, 2013). The committee held workshops for library staff to
introduce the concept of web-scale discovery systems and the evolving nature of search.
The committee interviewed representatives from institutions with implementations of the
products that were deemed to be the best fit for the library, and asked each vendor to use
their system to provide answers to real-world reference queries (Ellero, 2013)
For the University of North Alabama, the primary considerations when evaluating
systems were cost, ease of use, and percentage of subscribed databases that could be
searched with the product (Butler & Thompson, 2013). This evaluation criteria led to the
selection of EBSCO Discovery Service, and once set up was complete, the library
initiated a period of user testing and focus groups to gather student feedback.
Other literature describes evaluation models more heavily focused on usability testing.
Gallaway and Hines (2012) explain how competitive usability techniques were used at
Loyola University New Orleans to evaluate seven different facet-based catalogs under
consideration for purchase. Four to six library students tested each system (in operation at
peer institutions). Tasks for the usability tests were based on information provided by
reference librarians about questions directed to them about the catalog during the
previous six months (Gallaway & Hines, 2012).
The usability testing highlighted strengths and weaknesses for each product and
researchers reported that “the availability of features was just one consideration…the
customization process, labeling, and cataloguing choices of each site also contributed to
the success or failure of the system.” (Gallaway & Hines, 2012). After usability testing,
system vendors were approached by a small working group to see if they could

62

accommodate preferred system specifications. Live vendor demonstrations and site visits
were then scheduled for the small number of system who met the library’s basic
requirements.
George Washington University’s Himmelfarb Health Sciences library investigated
WorldCat Local, EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) and Summon (Thompson, Obrig &
Abate, 2013). Summon was quickly ruled out, primarily due to cost, and the library began
six-week trials of EDS and WorldCat Local. Although interface design and relevancy
ranking was judged by many to be superior on WorldCat Local, EDS was ultimately
selected for a one year commitment based on better citation management and post search
tools, and a closer content match to the library’s electronic collections (Thompson, Obrig
& Abate, 2013).
After initial configuration, library staff were invited to test the system but little feedback
was forthcoming and, after two months, a focus group of librarians was established to
discuss what changes would be required before a general release of the system. The
results of this focus group were then taken to a meeting with EBSCO representatives to
discuss what changes and improvements could be made (Thompson, Obrig & Abate,
2013).
Chickering & Yang (2014) report a similar process at Rider University. After making a
list of the major facet-based catalogs and discovery tools, librarians developed a set of
essential criteria for by which each system would be evaluated (e.g. facet-based search,
relevancy, state of the art interface etc.). Librarians examined between four and seven
instances of each system and recorded their findings. EDS was judged to be the best
match for their needs and a trial was initiated.

63

Deodato (2015) published a recent and extensive reflection on the catalog selection
process undertaken by Rutgers University Libraries. One of the few truly prescriptive
reflections on catalog implementation, he recommends an eight stage process as follows:
1. Form an evaluation team
2. Educate stakeholders
3. Schedule vendor demonstrations
4. Create an evaluation rubric
5. Draft RFP
6. Interview current customers
7. Configure and test local trials
8. Make final recommendations
A notable difference in Deodato’s process is the importance placed on local trials.
Chickering & Yang (2014) and Gallaway and Hines (2012) each performed fairly
comprehensive testing but used existing implementations at other universities. However,
this does not allow exploration of the backend of a system, nor does it allow for any
customization for local needs (Deodato, 2015)
Literature which addresses the selection of facets is rare. At NCSU, an implementation
committee was established comprising of seven staff members including system
implementers, an interface specialist a cataloger and a public services librarian (Collins,
Sample, & Pennell, 2007). They began the process of choosing facets by looking at the
161 MARC fields and subfields captured by the existing system, but soon replaced that
list with one of less than half that number (Antelman et al., 2006). By the time the Endeca

64

catalog was launched, eleven dimensions had been chosen for facets, but the full
justification for these choices is not explained (Antelman et al., 2006).
Sokvitne (2007) reports that facets for the State Library of Tasmania’s library catalog
were decided by an internal working committee and driven by twin concerns about what
would be of most value to the users, and what data existed, or could easily be created, to
provide facets. Existing bibliographic metadata could easily be manipulated to drive
certain facets, for example temporal or geographic ones. Other possible facets such as
audience were less easily supported and required extensive cleanup since metadata had
traditionally been created for bibliographic purposes and not for user discovery
(Sokvitne, 2007; Denholm et al, 2009). The library opted to provide some facets that
went beyond traditional descriptive and subject cataloging entry points and focused on
characteristics which described how the resource was shelved or managed by the library
in order to meet user need to get an item (Denholm et al, 2009).
Gallaway and Hines (2012) suggest that card sorting techniques could be used to develop
useful facets and appropriate terminology, but it is unclear if this process was followed at
their library. Many commercial catalogs come with their own particular challenges; preinstalled vendor supplied facets. Depending on the vendor, and system, libraries may or
may not be able to customize (remove, rename, reorder etc.) facets at the local level.
Thompson, Obrig & Abate (2013), report being able to turn off certain facets in their
EDS catalog, but they were unable to merge or add others. Some issues were resolved by
the vendor, while the library had to find workarounds for others.
Changes to facets, such as deletion or renaming, sometimes occur as a result of user
studies and usability testing of the system (e.g. Synder, 2010; Denton & Coysh, 2011);

65

suggesting that a more user-focused approach should be incorporated from the start of
facet selection process. Hall (2011) analyzed the implementations of facet-based catalogs
in public and academic libraries and looked, in part, at how closely aligned these
implementations were with traditional facet analysis. Over 40 unique facets were
recorded in academic catalogs and almost 30 unique facets in public library catalogs.
Observing the most frequently occurring facets may help to identify “fundamental
categories” for facet-based catalogs, although care has to be taken to ensure that these are
common because they are recognized as useful to patrons and not simply easily
extractable metadata. Another interesting finding was that subject or topic related facets
were more common in academic library OPACs than public ones (90% compared with
57%). Subject and topic facets contain a wide variety of concepts, many of which would
have been teased apart during a process of facet analysis (e.g. people, places, activities,
time) (Hall, 2011).There were violations of mutual exclusivity in the implementations of
the various location facets, particularly in the case of Encore catalogs where the
application of both “collection” and “location” facets seemed to be fixed by the vendor
and thus crudely applied (Hall, 2011).
No clear rationale for facet order could be discerned by Hall (2011) for the majority of
the catalogs although WorldCat Local puts the most often used facets closer to the top
(OCLC, 2009a). The ordering of content within facets was much more easily discernible
with the most common being decreasing order of objects, something that would match
with Ranganathan’s Principle of Literary Warrant. Chronological and alphabetical
sequences are also regularly used for date and location based facets (Hall, 2011). Worth
noting here is that participants in one user study expressed a clear preference for an

66

alphabetical sorting of the content with topic facets rather than a current “relevance”
sorting. However, the library’s Reference Advisory Subcommittee determined that a
default relevance listing was more appropriate than an alphabetical one since there are
frequently more options that can be displayed. (Synder, 2010).
Though an analysis of facet-based catalog implementations illuminates interesting trends,
inconsistencies, potential problems and possible areas for improvement, we can often
only speculate about “why” and “how” facets are chosen and presented as they are. While
the aim of many of those in the library profession has been to focus on improving the
facet-based catalog by conducting usability tests and user studies, this research is based
on the assumption that another focus will also be beneficial. By turning attention to
library staff - those responsible for developing, selecting and managing facet-based
catalogs - we can see what influences current decision-making, policies, and practices. In
turn, this information can be the foundation for making recommendations to support the
development of better catalogs and the generation of more rigorous and useful facets.

67

Chapter 3. Methodology
As the previous chapter showed, researchers have used a variety of different methods to
study the broad scope of facets in library and information science including transaction
log analysis, experiments, user studies, surveys, and interviews. This research study was
largely exploratory in nature with a focus on how facets are generated, implemented and
understood by library staff. As such, this research followed a mixed methods approach
and used surveys and interviews as instruments of data collection.
Mixed methods research uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.
While researchers have disagreed on how much integration of the methods is required,
we find the inclusive definition provided by Tashakkori & Cresswell (cited in Fidel,
2008) to be helpful. They describe mixed methods as, “research in which the investigator
collects and analyzes data, integrates the findings, and draws inferences using both
qualitative and quantitative approaches in a single study or program of inquiry.” This
triangulation of methods provides diverse ways of looking at the same phenomenon and
can strengthen confidence in the interpretation and analysis (Miles & Huberman, 1994;
Patton, 2002).
This research used multiple data collection methods in the form of an online survey and a
semi-structured interview. Surveys can support different types of questions such as closed
and open-ended, multiple choice and ranking questions, each of which can produce rich
structured data in a format that facilitates analysis and interpretation (Wilkinson &
Birmingham, 2003). Online surveys allow a geographically diverse population to
participate at a time and place convenient to them. They also reduce researcher induced-

68

bias by ensuring that all participants receive the same questions, in the same order with
the same wording (Rea & Parker, 2005).
Completed survey data provided a context for the deeper exploration of issues within the
interviews. The semi-structured interview method provided a standardized framework for
data collection but offered flexibility and freedom for the researcher to build a
conversation within a particular subject area, word questions spontaneously, and explore
emerging topics or issues (Patton, 2002). The strength of the qualitative interviews and
open-ended survey questions are their usefulness as a mechanism for understanding
phenomena from the participants’ perspectives (Marshall & Rossman, 2011).
Characteristics of qualitative research that make it particularly applicable for this study
include: the collection of verbal rather than numerical data, an interest in the process, not
just the outcome, of an activity. (Hittleman and Simon, cited in Gorman and Clayton,
2005). This research is focused on building an understanding of the policies, practices
and beliefs which govern the usage of facets in library catalogs. This is best gathered by
obtaining detailed verbal description of behaviors and activities. Additionally, this study
seeks to examine the process of acquiring, building, implementing and operating facetbased catalogs, as well as the outcomes of adopting such a system.
3.1 Research Questions
The research questions that guide this study are:
RQ1: How are facets interpreted by librarians and library staff members involved in
developing and implementing facet-based catalogs?

69



How are facets defined by those who are charged with their development
and implementation in facet-based library catalogs?



What purpose do they believe facets serve?



How did they learn about facets and facet-based catalogs and how do they
continue to get information about them?

RQ2: What individual and institutional beliefs, practices and policies guide the
implementation of facet-based catalogs in libraries?


What factors influence the choice of a facet-based library catalog?



What factors influence the choice of facets?

3.2 Development of Research Materials
The research design for this study drew partial inspiration from La Barre’s 2006 study of
the use of faceted theory in website construction and design. As part of her study, La
Barre interviewed a number of information architects who worked on faceted website
designs. As the current research was focused on library staff who worked with facetbased catalogs, a similar open-ended interview method was deemed appropriate. To
widen participation beyond the bounds that interviewing alone would allow for, and to
allow for the collection of quantitative data that would facilitate direct comparison
between respondents, a survey was also designed.
Initial versions of the survey instrument and interview protocol were developed to
address the research questions. The first iteration of the survey was pilot-tested by an
academic librarian to gauge ease of use, clarity, time taken to complete etc. as well as to
give an indication of the kind of data that would be collected. Following this, a second

70

pilot study was undertaken using both the survey instrument and interview protocol. This
was tested with a small number of academic and public library staff. Based on the
experience of administering these pilot studies, as well as the results collected,
modifications were made to create the final versions of the instruments.
3.2.1 Pilot Studies
The pilot studies were an opportunity to run a small-scale version of the proposed
research and test research instruments and analysis techniques. Pilot studies allow the
researcher to check for clarity (e.g. are question and answer options sufficiently clear?)
comprehensiveness (e.g. are answer choices sufficiently complete? Are questions
redundant?), and acceptability (e.g. are questions personally intrusive? Is the survey too
long?) (Rea & Parker, 2005). Pilot studies can not only identify parts of the instrument or
technique which may need adjustment, they also enable the researcher to verify that the
data collected from the full study will enable them to answer the stated research questions
(Marshall & Rossman, 2011).
Ahead of the first pilot study, several online survey instruments were researched and
tested. Survey Gizmo (www.surveygizmo.com) was selected based on ease of use, clear
design and favorable reviews from other researchers. Survey Gizmo provides free “pro”
accounts for students. These accounts have access to all Survey Gizmo features and
functionality. One participant, a librarian known to the researcher, completed this first
pilot study.
The second pilot study tested both the survey and interview components of the study and
was designed to not only test the instruments, but also the procedures and analytical
techniques used in both phases. Four participants, working at three different libraries,

71

took part in this pilot study. Participants were library staff working at local libraries
known to be using facet-based catalogs. Three participants were contacted directly by the
researcher and the fourth was suggested by one of the initial participants. Two
participants worked at the same large academic library and the other two worked at two
different public libraries. All four completed the survey and three participants completed
the interview stage of the pilot test. Two of these interviews were conducted in person in
the participants’ offices and the third was conducted via telephone. The data collected
during the pilot studies was not included in the final reporting of results.
3.2.2 Changes to the Research Instruments
Based on participant feedback and researcher analysis, changes were made to the survey
instruments after both pilot studies. Over the three major iterations of the survey, special
attention was paid to the language and expression used in order to maximize clarity and
conciseness, and avoid confusion and ambiguity. Other substantive changes to content
are described below.
In the first pilot study, survey questions were soft required. This meant that if a question
was left blank or incomplete, the survey would prompt the respondent to complete it, but
it would not prevent them from moving on without doing so. This was found to be
burdensome in cases where a question may not be applicable, because the survey
software implied that not providing a response would prevent continuation with the
survey. This feature was removed for the second and final versions of the survey. This
meant that some respondents in the final survey did not complete all questions. While it is
possible that given an additional push to respond these respondents might have provided
answers, it is just as likely that they might have abandoned the survey altogether.

72

After the first pilot study, several questions were changed from closed to open-ended.
While closed-ended questions are usually recommended for surveys, they can also be
problematic. Closed-ended questions may require respondents to pick a “closest
representation” to their actual answer, and may not allow researchers to detect subtle
differences between respondents (Rea & Parker, 2005). The questions in this survey that
were changed from closed to open-ended included questions about how respondents first
learned about facets, and what factors influenced the sequence of facets in the catalog
interface. In these instances, closed-ended responses did not always allow respondents to
provide a full and accurate account of past activities and decision making processes.
From the second pilot survey onwards, additional questions were added. Two of these
questions were designed to find out more about how library staff interpret facets: one
question which asked respondents to describe the role of facets in search and discovery,
and one which asked what respondents considered to be important attributes of facetbased catalogs. Additionally a question was added to find out whether the adoption of a
facet-based catalog had any effect on cataloging and metadata activities within the
library. For the final survey, a further question was added asking how library users had
responded to the introduction of the catalog.
One survey question in particular demonstrated the merits of pilot testing and revising
data collection instruments. Trying to elicit information about the sources that people use
when looking for information about facets was more problematic than first anticipated.
The first iteration of the survey presented respondents with a list of possible sources names from the LIS and IA fields, known listservs and discussion groups etc. It was felt
that this was too limiting, even with the option of “none” and “other”, and so, for the

73

second version of the survey, the response option for this question was changed to an
open-text box. Still, survey respondents seemed reluctant to commit to this question, and
most answers were “I don’t know”. Fortunately, the interview phase of the pilot study
gave the opportunity to probe this area further and showed participants to be quite
capable and happy to talk about where they would seek information about facets. It
became clear that the language and format of the question in the survey was still a barrier
to response. The survey had asked respondents who or what they considered to be
“authoritative” sources and this word was causing some hesitation. For the final survey,
the phrasing of this question was changed to be more inclusive and not ask people to
place a value judgment on the information they use, but to simply ask them to list any
people, places, objects or events they would consult or had consulted in the past. The
evolution of this question is illustrated in figures 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.

Figure 3.1 “Sources” question as it appeared in pilot survey 1.

74

Figure 3.2 “Sources” question as it appeared in pilot survey 2.

Figure 3.3 “Sources” question as it appeared in the final survey.

Only two questions were completely removed between the first pilot survey and the final
implementation. After the first pilot, a question asking for respondents’ opinions about
mutual exclusivity of facets was abandoned for being too specific and too leading. After
the second pilot study, a question asking respondents to categorize their job position
under such headings as “administrative”, “technical”, “research” etc. was removed.

75

Respondents were already asked for their job title or position elsewhere in the survey and
this question was too open to ambiguity (e.g. “technical” for a LIS professional could
mean working in cataloging and acquisitions or in IT and web development).
The interview framework used during the second pilot study remained substantively
unchanged for the final study, at least content-wise. Changes were made to the general
sequence in which questions were asked. In the pilot study, questions followed the same
format as the survey: background information - general facet knowledge - questions
relating to the library’s specific catalog implementation. In the final framework,
questions about the specific catalog implementation and facets used by the library were
positioned before questions relating to individual understandings of facets. This sequence
seemed to allow for a more natural and open flow of conversation.
3.3 The Final Research Instruments
In this section, the final survey and interview protocol are described.
3.3.1 The Survey
As Survey Gizmo performed well during the pilot survey, it was also used to administer
the final survey. Survey responses and associated data was securely held in a password
protected environment. The final survey is included in Appendix A and a brief
description of its contents is below.
After accessing the survey, Respondents were presented with a brief introductory
statement outlining the general purpose of the research, and were asked if they wished to
proceed to the survey proper. All questions within the survey were optional.
The final survey was comprised of four parts:

76

1. Background Information
2. Facet Knowledge
3. Facet-based Catalog
4. Additional Information
1. Background Information
The first questions in this section were designed to elicit information about the type of
library that respondents worked at (Q1 & 2), and current role within the library (Q3).
Further questions asked about respondents’ educational background (Q4) and the kind of
facet-based catalog or discovery interface used within the library (Q5). These questions
were designed to provide a useful context through which to view and interpret responses.
2. Facet Knowledge
This section of the survey contained five questions related to facets, their role within LIS,
and their specific applicability to library catalogs. Respondents were asked to provide a
definition of “facet” in the context of LIS (Q6), describe the role that facets play in the
search and discovery process (Q7), recall how they first learned about facets (Q8), list
where they would look for information about facets (Q9), and describe what they would
consider to be important attributes or features of facet-based catalogs (Q10).
3. Facet-based Catalog
This section of the survey contained nine questions with particular applicability to the
deployment of facets in library catalogs (in most cases, specifically how they are used in
the catalog of the respondent’s library). Respondents were asked about their involvement
in the implementation and maintenance of the catalog (Q11), the factors which affected

77

the selection of a catalog (Q12) as well as the importance of the facet feature in the
choice of catalog (Q13). Other questions focused on the facets themselves: the
importance of different factors when choosing which facets to use (Q14), the perceived
usefulness of particular facets (Q15 & 16), the order of facets within the catalog (Q17),
how facets have changed cataloging and metadata practices (Q18), and how library users
have responded to a facet-based catalog (Q19).
4. Additional information
The final section of the survey allowed space for respondents to share any other
comments about facets and their experience with a facet-based catalog (Q20) as well as
provide contact information if they were willing to be considered as an interview
participant.
Table 3.1 shows the survey questions mapped to the research questions. This exercise

3.3.2 The Interview Framework
The Interview Framework can be found in Appendix B. Below is a brief description of its
parts.
1. Background Information
To open the interview, participants are asked to talk briefly about their position/role
within the library. If not mentioned, follow-up probes for this part of the interview
included asking them about their academic and professional training and their particular
involvement with the facet-based catalog.
2. Facet-based Catalog
The next series of questions focused on gathering data about the specific facet-based
catalog(s) in use at the participants’ libraries and their experiences with implementing the
catalog as well as day-to-day use. The participants were asked to recall the selection or
development of the catalog and talk a little about that process. Follow-up questions
included, why was the decision taken to introduce a facet-based catalog? Why was the
particular catalog chosen over other facet-based products? Who was involved in the
decision-making process?
The second question in this section focused on the facets themselves, and asked
participants to explain how facets had been chosen for the catalog. Probes for this
question included asking about choices regarding sequence and terminology, whether
facets had been added or removed since implementation and whether there were plans to
develop further facet options.

80

The final questions in this section asked how users had responded to the catalog and how
much facets are utilized. As surveys began to be completed, and initial data analysis took
place, a follow up question was added to this section to specifically ask how library staff
had received the catalog. Further probes for this question included whether the library
had administered any user studies or undertaken usability testing of the catalog.
3. Facet Knowledge
Questions in this section focused on participants’ general thoughts and experiences with
facets. They were asked to provide their definition of the term “facet”, to think about the
role facets play in search and discovery, and to reflect on whether facets are particularly
well-suited for any specific user-groups or particular information seeking activities.
The next questioned asked participants to recall how or where they had first been
introduced to facets, and if they needed information about facets where, or to whom,
would they turn.
4. Additional Information
This final section concluded the interview and gave participants the opportunity to add
any further comments as well as mention any names of individuals or institutions that
they would recommend talking with.
Table 3.2 shows the interview questions mapped to the research questions. This exercise
ensured that the interview would provide appropriate data to help answer the research

3.4 Setting and Recruitment
The survey portion of this research was conducted online using Survey Gizmo. The
survey was self-administered and SurveyGizmo allowed respondents to access the survey
through a variety of devices with tablet and mobile-friendly interfaces. Interviews were
conducted via telephone or VoIP.
Recruitment for the survey took place by two methods: direct email contact with potential
participants and posting to a listserv. As per IRB protocol, permission was obtained from
the administrator of the NGC4Lib listserv to post recruitment messages to the list.
NGC4Lib was established in June 2006 as a discussion platform for the changing nature
of the library catalog, cataloging, and information access. As the home to a number of
lively and informative exchanges about facet-based catalogs, it was chosen as the primary
recruitment site for this study. At the time of recruitment for this study, approximately
2100 individual email addresses were subscribed to the listserv (E. Lease Morgan,
personal communication, June 8 2016).
A recruitment message was prepared by the researcher and posted to the mailing list on
April 16 2014. The message described the purpose of the research, an estimated time of
completion, assurances of anonymity and confidentiality, and a link to the survey. A copy
of the recruitment message can be found in Appendix C. A reminder message was posted
to the listserv on April 30 2014 and a final call for participation was posted on May 13
2014.
A majority of respondents from the listserv recruitment were from academic libraries. In
a purposive sample such as this, it is acceptable to supplement a sample when it is found

83

that important constituencies are not well-represented (Ritchie & Lewis, 2003). In an
attempt to increase participation from public library staff, and to gather representation
from a wider variety of facet-based catalog products, the researcher also used an online
directory of libraries, called libraries.org (www.libraries.org), to identify further potential
participants. libraries.org is maintained by Marshall Breeding as part of Library
Technology Guides (www.librarytechnology.org) which provides databases and
documentation related to library systems and technologies. Breeding has used records
from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES) to ensure that all academic and public libraries in the United
States are represented in the directory (M. Breeding, personal communication, July 13
2016). The technology data, such as automation system and catalog or discovery interface
is mostly populated by Breeding based on information provided by vendors or his own
observations. Requests are periodically sent to libraries asking them to view and update
their records (M. Breeding, personal communication, July 13 2016). Over 140,000 US
libraries are represented in libraries.org
Using the libraries.org directory, recruitment messages were sent on July 14 2014 directly
to the general enquiry/contact email addresses of 50 libraries who operated facet-based
catalogs. Follow-up emails were sent on July 24 2014 to those who had not responded.
This recruitment message sent to these libraries was a direct copy of the one posted to the
NGC4Lib listserv. As mentioned above, public libraries were not well-represented in the
respondent set from the NCG4Lib listserv. Therefore, public libraries, especially those
using catalog interfaces also not well represented in the initial respondent set, were the

84

recruitment focus. In addition, two libraries were contacted directly on the
recommendation of other study participants.
Interview participants were recruited exclusively from completed surveys. At the
conclusion of the survey, respondents were able to provide an email address if they were
interested in participating in the interview stage of the research. Recruitment for the
interviews took place between August and September 2014, with reminder emails
distributed approximately 10 days after the initial message. The recruitment message
distributed for the interview can be found in Appendix D.
3.5 Data Collection
The Drexel Institutional Review Board (IRB) gave approval for a maximum of 100
participants. This was approximately double the number of desired participants but was
set high to provide a cushion incase the recruitment message to the listserv produced a
high number of responses. The final data set consists of 48 surveys and 9 interviews.
Surveys were included in the final data set provided they had answered questions beyond
question 5 (background information). One participant completed the survey twice. In
order to preserve his responses, these two surveys were merged as one for data analysis.
Thirty-three survey participants were recruited from the listserv posting and 15 responded
to emails from the researcher (13 of those found through libraries.org and two contacted
on the recommendation of other study participants).
3.6 Research Participants
Participants for this research study were library staff who have been involved with the
selection, development, implementation or management of a facet-based library catalog.

85

Many different people within a library work closely with a facet-based catalog during its
inception, implementation and day-to-day operation. These include not only professional
and paraprofessional staff in traditional LIS roles, but also staff who may not readily
identify with an LIS tradition such as programmers, web designers, and information
architects. This diversity was evidenced in participants for this study. Recruitment
methods favored those working at academic and public libraries within the United States.
However, facet-based catalogs may also be implemented in other environments such as
government, national, school, and special libraries and these libraries were not expressly
excluded from taking part.
3.6.1 Survey Respondents
The first section of the survey gathered basic information about respondents’ educational
background and employment role.
The majority (43) of respondents were from the United States, and they represented every
corner of the contiguous map. Eleven respondents were from libraries in the North-East,
13 from the Mid-West, 10 from the South, and 9 from the West. A further five
respondents were internationally based - two from Australia, one from Canada, one from
Iran, and one from the United Kingdom.
Twenty-six respondents worked at an academic library, 19 were affiliated with public
libraries and the remaining three identified themselves as working within special libraries
(see Table 3.3).

Respondents were also asked for their current job title or position within the library.
Using the job titles and other information provided in the surveys and interviews, as well
as information available from the libraries websites, participants were categorized
according to job role. These categories were:
Collection Support: This category of respondents consists primarily of technical services
staff and includes those who work in cataloging and acquisitions as well as metadata
specialists and those responsible for archival and other special collections.
User Services: This category of respondents, who have increased contact with library
patrons, includes reference, instruction, and subject librarians.
IT/Systems: This group of respondents includes software engineers, systems analysts,
web developers etc.
Digital Services: This category comprises a small group of respondents charged solely
with curating and promoting digital content and supporting a growing number of digitalonly patrons. One respondent from this category described his role as follows:
“I manage the department that provides access to all our databases and e-content
resources. At the point where end users interact with the library digitally, that’s
my area of focus. And I’m not in the IT department, I’m kind of a separate
department. So we take more of a user-centered approach and we are moderately
technical though not heavy duty technical in the manner that our IT department
is.” [PID 34]
Administration: This small group of respondents includes those overseeing the overall
operations of the library such as Library Director and Assistant Director.
It should be noted that no survey respondent indicated that they held a dual role (e.g.
cataloger and reference librarian), though this certainly may be the case for many library

88

staff. Figure 3.5 shows the distribution of survey respondents across library roles.
Collection support was the most common role with over 40% of respondents employed in
such a position. User services and IT & web services each accounted for 10 participants.
Digital services and administrative positions made up the remaining participants,
excepting one who declined to provide their job title or role.

Figure 3.5 Number of respondents from each professional role (N=48).

Thirty respondents reported using commercial facet-based products, and 14 operated
open source systems. One additional respondent indicated that their library had both open
source and commercial facet-based catalogs. Two respondents worked at libraries that
were not yet using a facet-based catalog but were in the research and planning stages of
acquiring one. Finally, one respondent did not indicate the type of catalog used at their
library.

89

Table 3.4 presents the specific catalogs operated by the respondents’ libraries as reported
in the survey. ProQuest’s Summon was the most common facet-based system reported by
respondents. During the interview stage, two participants indicated that their library
utilized Summon, though they had not mentioned this during the survey. It is possible
that other respondents may also work at libraries that operate Summon or other web-scale
discovery tools in addition to their primary facet-based catalog.
Open source systems were almost exclusively driven by the Apache Solr search platform.
The two well-known modular applications of Blacklight and VuFind account for twothirds of the open source facet-based catalogs.

3.6.2 Interview Participants
The subset of individuals who completed the interview stage was narrower and less
representative than the respondent set as a whole. All interview participants were
recruited from survey respondents who indicated their agreement to be contacted for a
possible interview. Twenty-one survey respondents provided an email address and were
contacted by the researcher to ask if they would be willing to participate in a telephone
interview. Ten individuals responded to either to the initial interview recruitment
message or a subsequent reminder and indicated their interest in taking part in an
interview. Nine interviews were successfully scheduled with the 10th withdrawing due to
unforeseen personal commitments. The interviews took place during September and
October 2014.Table 3.5 shows the characteristics of the interview participants.

Six participants were from academic libraries, two were from the same public library and
one was from a special library. Participants in IT/systems roles were overrepresented in
the interview stage as compared to their participation at the survey stage – with half of

91

the IT/Systems survey respondents following through to the interview stage. Four of the
five IT/Systems participants did hold a LIS Masters degree indicating that their
background and training was LIS-centric. Unfortunately, public libraries were somewhat
underrepresented at the interview stage with just two participants. Additionally,
interviews were not able to be scheduled with any survey respondents who worked in
user services roles. Three had provided their email in the survey, but did not respond to
the interview recruitment messages.
It is likely that while the survey encouraged participation from a wide range of people in
disparate roles due to its ability to be accessed online at any time through a multitude of
devices and its considered brevity, the interview was not so accessible. The interviews
took place via telephone or VoIP and the duration varied between 24 and 48 minutes.
Eight of the nine interviews were scheduled during the participant’s working day – these
participants had a private office and personal phone line and were able to build time in
their schedule for the interview to take place. This may not have been possible for all
survey respondents.
3.7 Data Analysis
Some of the data collected from the online survey, the closed questions, were analyzed
using descriptive statistics. The data collected from open-ended survey questions and the
interviews were analyzed using the constant comparative method (Glaser & Strauss,
1967), an iterative process that combines coding and analyzing throughout the data
collection, analysis and theory building process. As data was collected from each
participant, analysis of the data and the resultant coding categories was compared to any
data collected previously, providing a continual refinement of the data to help strengthen

92

the developing theory. Data analysis began from transcription, which though a lengthy
process, provided the benefit of early reflection (Kvale, 2007). Guided by the
recommendations of Miles & Huberman (1994), a provisional list of codes was
developed prior to data collection based on the research questions, related literature and
pilot study data. As the survey data and interview transcripts were collected and read,
codes and memos were assigned to individual sentences, words and passages. Codes were
reviewed and revised with each new participant response.
3.8 Research Limitations
The purposive sampling used in this study means that while participants represented key
criteria and characteristics deemed to be important to the research questions (e.g.
different job roles, different library types, and different system types), the respondent set
is small and not necessarily representative of the myriad of library and non-library
institutions that use facet-based catalogs or similar facet-based systems. However, the
researcher was able to identify interesting patterns, cases of shared beliefs and practices,
and instances of original approaches and innovative implementations.
Traditional measures of validity, reliability and objectivity, hallmarks of a purely
quantitative approach, are not applicable to this research. So, while the findings from this
small study are not generalizable to a larger population, trustworthiness may be indicated
by other means. One such measure is transferability which refers to the extent to which
the findings from a study may be applied to other, similar, contexts (Lincoln & Guba,
1985). By the collection and analysis of content-rich data, it is intended that the findings
of this research may be transferred to the broader population of library staff and

93

institutions with facet-based catalogs. However, there will likely be some discrepancies
as contexts and behaviors will vary.
This research used survey and interview methods, both of which rely on the individual to
self-report. Participants are asked to accurately recall past behaviors and events as well as
express personal opinions. It is possible that participants may accidentally or purposefully
report incorrectly (Marshall & Rossman, 2011). By default, the research was not
anonymous, with survey questions which asked participants for their job title and place of
employment. These questions were voluntary and one participant opted to omit this data.
It is unknown whether the lack of anonymity altered the information that participants
were comfortable disclosing.
Common limitations of surveys include the presence of leading, complicated, irritating,
and ambiguous questions (Wilkinson & Birmingham, 2003). While the researcher
attempted to identify and correct any such instances during pilot testing, some problems
were not realized until the final survey was live. Fowler (2009) cautions that one
potential problem of surveys is the use of words that may not have consistent meaning for
all respondents. In this survey, respondents were asked about the factors which
contributed to the selection of the library’s facet-based catalog, as well as the factors
which influenced the choice of facets. “Cost” was one possible answer for both of these
questions, but while some respondents may have understood cost purely in terms of
“price”; others may have interpreted it to include things like investment in staff training.
As mentioned above, the respondent set for this study is small, and the subset of
interview participants is particularly narrow. The initial recruitment site for the survey,
NGC4Lib, was selected due to its focus on issues related to facet-based catalogs and its

94

membership of individuals self-identifying as interested and involved in such issues.
However, other professional listservs, mailing groups and social networking groups exist
and may have provided greater access to certain populations such as public librarians and
those in user services positions.
Researcher bias is an acknowledged limitation of qualitative research methods and in
interviews, in particular, the researcher is the principal determinant of the value of the
data. The researcher attempted to minimize bias by using non directive probes and avoid
expressing personal views or evaluative comments (Gorman & Clayton, 2005). However,
the researcher’s experience as an information professional in academic and special
libraries may have influenced the interpretation of data.

95

Chapter 4. Findings & Discussion Part 1: Individual Interpretations of Facets
In the following two chapters, findings and discussion from this research will be
presented. Chapter five communicates the findings relating to institutional decision
making, policies and practices while this chapter examines individual interpretations and
opinions of facets and facet-based catalogs. In particular, this chapter explores library
staff definitions of facets, their thoughts about facet-based catalogs and how their
knowledge of facets has been arrived at.
4.1. Defining “Facet” in the Context of Library and Information Science
Many study participants viewed facets in terms of their functionality, with specific
emphasis on their role in the library catalog. We might surmise that they were
predisposed to view facets through this lens as the survey itself was clearly geared
towards facets within catalogs. However, it became clear through the survey and
interviews that, for many participants, facets as a catalog feature has been their sole or
primary introduction to facets, particularly within a LIS context.
Across job roles, many participants focused on facets as filtering or limiting tools within
catalog interfaces. As one digital services respondent said, facets are “a way to limit or
broaden a keyword search" [PID 39]. Several in collection support roles also echoed this
sentiment, seeing facets as “a filter feature that patrons select to narrow their search
results as they see fit by genre, date etc.” [PID 20], or simply, “another way to search
subjects” [PID 13].
Those who worked in user services roles were particularly inclined to define facets in
terms of their interface functionality. This is not surprising given their profession. Library

96

staff in user services positions are the front line for reference inquiries and catalog
instruction and troubleshooting. They are likely to use the facet-based search catalog
interface much more than their colleagues in other departments.
Of the ten respondents employed in user services roles, eight mentioned the functions of
limiting, narrowing, sorting and filtering search results:
It’s a way of limiting a search. [PID 12]
A facet is a limiting option available in some library catalogs and web scale
discovery systems. Facets allow users to add or subtract the various limiters
available. [PID 10]
Several respondents, while acknowledging interface functionality, also made mention of
the data that populates them. As one user services respondent from an academic library
explained: “A facet exists because metadata are available to use in narrowing a set of
search results. You need the metadata and the functionality for a facet to work" [PID 30].
Similarly, an IT/Systems respondent described facets thusly: “In terms of
discovery/access, facets are filters that help narrow a given search result. They can be
constructed from formal taxonomies or simply extracted data values from a given data
source” [PID 14].
This view was similar to another definition provided by a systems analyst who said, “In
terms of PACs, facet is a dimension or element of the bibliographic record (and
associated data such as content enrichment)… that can be used after initial search to
further refine results.” [PID 40]
In fact, research participants in IT/systems roles were apt to define “facet” in terms of its
function as an aspect or dimension of the information object:
A facet is an attribute of some members of a set of objects. [PID 43]

97

A modifier that describes information about a catalogued “thing” that references
information in either the Bib data or the item data. [PID 38]
A characteristic or property of documents/records, which can be described using
a controlled vocabulary [PID 32].
Again, this viewpoint makes sense within the context of their job functions and
professional training. IT/systems professionals are more likely to see the backend of the
catalog than the front end. Therefore, facets are seen first as discrete elements of the
catalog record that can be extracted in order to provide specific catalog functionality.
Definitions provided by respondents in collection support roles were divided between
function and form. While approximately 50% of respondents in these roles mentioned
limiting or narrowing a search, the same number talked about facets in terms of being
categories or aspects of resources; elements of metadata records segregated into useful
groupings:
I think of facets as attributes of resources: publication date, author, subject,
aggregator (for e-resource) etc. [PID 23]
A controlled data segment common to all records in a data set. [PID 48]
Individual pieces of access points that have been broken down into logical parts.
[PID 2].
One respondent, working in a collection support role at an academic library surmised that
“a facet is a type of category of organized knowledge found in or under a broader
subject; or a functional tool to organize resources under differing resource types,
subjects etc.” [PID 44]. This dual identity of facets, defined as both an attribute of an
entity and as an interface tool, is complementary rather than contradictory. Over the past
decade, the term has become ubiquitous within the LIS field as a search and browse tool
in catalogs and discovery systems, although users of those systems are more familiar with
the names “filters” or “limits” than “facets.” But the facet as an interface tool cannot exist

98

without the other kind of facet: those “categories, properties, attributes, characteristics,
relations, functions or concepts that are central to the set of documents or entities being
organized and which are of particular interest to the user group for whom a particular
resource is being created” (La Barre, 2007).
4.2 The Role of Facets in the Search and Discovery Process
Survey respondents were asked to describe the role that facets play in the search and
discovery process. This question was designed to more specifically focus on facets within
library catalogs and similar systems, although many respondents had also focused on that
aspect when providing their earlier definition of a facet. Here, many responses made
reference to the functionality of facets to sort, limit and refine; a feature that was
frequently viewed as critical to search success:
[Facets] allow users to narrow results after conducting a search. I suspect this
takes fewer cognitive resources than configuring a search up front. It also allows
people to go from an expansive list of results to a narrower one which would
seem to make more sense and lend greater confidence that the searcher is getting
the best results. [PID 34]
I think it makes a lot more sense to me, in most cases, to have a broad search you
can narrow down rather than having to get largely novice users to do really good,
narrow searches and get the right thing. [PID 9]
The focus on facets as a weeding tool was highlighted, and praised, by many: “they help
students sift through the chaff to get a smaller search set,” said one user services librarian
[PID 12]. Another remarked that the use of facets “helps to zero in on appropriate
content” [PID 35]. A respondent working in IT/Systems at a special library also
mentioned the importance of facets to reduce and refine remarking that, “they provide the
means for users to drill down through a larger imprecise set of results” [PID 14]. In all,

99

twenty four respondents made explicit mention of facets playing an important role in
limiting, refining, or narrowing search results.
Several respondents mentioned that facets were particularly suited to certain types of
search behavior. Broad and coarse searches were noted as being good candidates for facet
application. Three IT/systems respondents commented that facets worked well with the
current preference for Google-like single search screens and Google-like keyword
searching.
I believe facets allow patrons to navigate efficiently in the prevalent landscape of
all field, keyword searches. [PID 38]
Given the predilection for single search boxes, making facets available to users to
focus their initial search results is critical to their success. [PID 37]
A lot of the initial searching that happens is very Google-ish usually, and not well
crafted to work with other kinds of interfaces. We hope that if they can get a
meaningful set of results that include the things that are on target for what they
want that they might be able then to use [facets] to narrow it down. [PID 15]
It is not only user search habits or usability design trends which make facets appear
useful. As catalogs and discovery systems trend towards being a single gateway to what
used to be separately indexed collections, facets are seen as an important tool for
organization and access:
I think facets play an important role in the search and discovery process,
especially in a digital world where there's an increasing amount of results
returned not just from a broad search of the internet, but of a library’s catalog
and other data silos especially if they're indexed as one large dataset for the
researcher. [PID 29]
The focus on facets as an effective means to narrow broad searches and refine large
results sets is mentioned in the literature as a motivating factor for a changing catalogs
and a feature highly admired by library users (e.g. Ho et al, 2008; Salaba & Zhang, 2007;
Blumer et al, 2014; Osborne & Cox, 2015). Although refinement and filtering were the

100

most common roles attributed to facets, several respondents noted their positive impact
on information literacy skills as well. This possible benefit has not been as widely
explored in the general facet-based catalog literature, however, it does correlate to the
idea that facet-based catalogs offer an opportunity to expose the richness of cataloging
data in new and interesting ways (Adamich, 2010; Naun, 2010; Wynne & Hanscom,
2011).
One Administrative respondent explained, “[Facets] assist customers in thinking about
the information they are looking for in other ways, e.g. related or interrelated terms,
synonyms, broader or narrower topics etc.” [PID 42]. A user services staff member was
in agreement noting that, “facets allow…expansion of relevant knowledge of vocabulary
terms” [PID 11]. Additionally, facets were seen to allow users to “pivot searches in new
directions” [PID 23], “identify what something "is", provide subject access” [PID 3], and
“help the user get an overview of the nature of the corpus or of a particular subset of it”
[PID 32].
Facets may also help patrons understand and utilize more complicated library concepts
such as authority headings and controlled vocabularies. As one metadata librarian
described:
They are an easy way to present the benefits of a controlled vocabulary to a user.
If a user enters World War II ideally they should see a facet on the side for the
official heading World War, 1939-1945, which they can then click on to vastly
expand their search over a simple keyword search. [PID 47]
One IT/systems participant from an academic library also praised the dynamic nature of
facets and the ability they afford users to easily create complex searches which can be
modified on the fly:

101

When you do an advanced search in the old way you don’t really know what
you’re dismissing from your results set because you never see that large results
set anymore. And what’s really cool to me, is that with faceted browsing the
search interface is different for every search you do. The metadata becomes the
search interface and, as you apply a facet, the facets change. So this iterative
application of facets and the ability to dismiss facets also, you can apply a facet 1,
2, 3, 4 and then suddenly go back and dismiss facet 2, you can dismiss them in a
different order than you applied them and bring material back into your results
set. [PID 43]
Despite the general enthusiasm for facets, they were not seen as a panacea for
informational retrieval. It was noted by several survey respondents that there are cases,
such as many known item searches, or when precision is desired over recall, where facets
are not particularly useful and possibly even a hindrance to the user. This is supported by
the transaction log analysis of Niu & Hemminger (2015) who found that facets offered no
advantage for basic and exact match tasks, and concluded that the more complex facetbased interface may even lead to a lower success rate than the traditional catalog for these
types of information activities.
One digital services participant remarked at how facets were complementary to, rather
than an alternative for, a good search:
So my gut reaction is that a truly excellent mind-blowing search is 90% of what
you want and facets probably need to be there but they can’t do all of your heavy
lifting for you. They can’t compensate for a poor search. [PID 34]
4.3 Perceived Important Attributes of Facet-based Catalogs
Using a facet based catalog was explained by one survey respondent as being “an
intuitive action on the part of the user [which] does not require an understanding of the
theories of searching to get successful results” [PID 47]. While many would argue that
facet-based catalogs have not yet realized those aims, ease of use and user-friendliness

102

were popular choices when respondents were asked what they considered to be important
attributes of a facet-based catalog.
A “concise, easy to use interface”, suggested one respondent [PID 48] , while another
suggested “using terminology and UX design that exposes [facets] and makes them
beneficial to basic users” [PID 22]. Clear and recognizable labeling was mentioned by
respondents from all library roles. “Phrases that are understandable to the general public
and are not too 'library'” offered one collection support respondent [PID 41]. Several
others agreed, with an IT/systems respondent cautioning that “the use of jargon should be
kept at a minimum” [PID 43] and a user services respondent explaining it was important
within the catalog “that the facets use language the patrons understand, rather than
library jargon” [PID 30].
Several respondents mentioned specific functionality that the facet-based catalog should
employ. Facets should be easily manipulated. The ability to “stack” or add multiple facets
was mentioned on more than one occasion as was allowing multiple values from a single
facet to be selected so, as one respondent [PID 29] explained, “a user could select two
format [values] at the same time.” Several facet-based catalogs do allow users to stack
values from the same facet, though this is usually confined to subject/topic facets. The
example given of stacking two format values would most likely require that they acted as
“OR” operators.
Other respondents mentioned the ability to easily remove facets “without having to redo
your search from the beginning” [PID 10], and “the ability to exclude as well as include
facets” which PID 15 noted as a useful, but probably not widely known, feature. The
ability to employ facets prior to beginning a search was listed by one respondent; a

103

feature which is not readily available in most facet-based catalogs, which are built on the
premise that searching begins with a search engine-like simple box, with facets appearing
on the search results page. However, Niu and Hemminger (2010), did observe facetbased browsing in evidence at Phoenix Public Library. They found that more facet usage
occurred at this stage than as a post search refinement suggesting that allowing facetbased browsing without an initial search may be a desirable and useful feature for many
users.
Other attributes, which do appear to have become standard across facet-based catalogs,
were also mentioned, such as always displaying the number of matching objects within a
facet, and never displaying facets or values with zero matching objects. Providing options
for patron customization of facets was something several study participants mentioned.
Specifically, allowing results within facets to be sorted either numerically or
alphabetically was a feature that was mentioned multiple times. During the interview,
PID 38 explained her frustration with the facets as implemented in her library’s
commercial catalog:
The one thing we really don’t like with our product, and we’ve communicated this
to the vendor, is that for a lot of the facets that SirsiDynix delivers you’ll notice
that they do it by order of occurrence. And there’s no way for us to allow a patron
to re-order that by alphabet.
For patrons and librarians looking for particular values (e.g. a musical score in a format
facet or particular name in an author facet), it can be tedious to comb through potentially
very long lists. The assumption that the most frequently occurring values are the most
useful is not always correct, and valuable concepts may regulated to the bottom of facet
menus. PID38’s library has also implemented two facets – Accelerated Reader Reading
Level and Reading Level – which provide information about the Lexile measures and

104

ATOS readability ranking for children’s books. Values in these two facets are displayed
by order of occurrence, and she describes this as “maddening.” Although a workaround
has been found, PID 38 is concerned that it places an unnecessary burden on the catalog
user:
What I’ve had to train our librarians to do is that if you’re looking for a
particular value the best thing to do is to expand them all and then do a CTRL+F
on the webpage and then look for your value. And then you can go through and
click each one and then hit your include button but the problem is at the end of
the day it’s laborious and a librarian will do it, that’s not a problem, but it’s not
the height of user-friendliness for a patron.
The date facet also drew attention as one where “a simple facet is not enough” [PID 16].
Here, results should “be able to be aggregated - current year, last three years - as well as
individual year and dates that are reverse chronological, not by number of results” [PID
40]. Based on user feedback, PID 16’s library made changes to their date facet so that
instead of being a simply a list of dates, the facet includes a date slider.
Respondents also commented on the importance of consistent quality data to support the
facets. One collection support respondent advocated for “clean underlying data,
including clean data from the system vendor's central knowledge base, robust
normalization rules to pipe data into appropriate facets” [PID 23], while another listed
the "accurate assignment of facet data” [PID 48] as an important attribute of the catalog.
Facets “should be granular enough and independent of each other,” so that users can
search effectively in a large dataset [PID 18]. One user services respondent highlighted
the need for “metadata/cataloguing descriptions [that] are used systematically enough to
be useful” [PID 30], thus avoiding scenarios where users encounter facets that cover just
a small percentage of the library collection.

105

4.4 How Participants First Learned About Facets
Question eight of the survey asked respondents how they had first learned about facets.
Forty-two respondents answered this question while six either did not answer, or
indicated that they were not sure or could not remember. Respondents indicated a range
of sources by which they first became aware of facets. The most common responses are
detailed below.
Seven survey respondents, including four of the ten respondents in IT/systems roles,
traced their first awareness of facets to their implementation on commercial websites
such as Amazon. During the interview stage, some participants acknowledged that they
felt a little sheepish admitting that their first introduction to facets was in an ecommerce
environment, and as one explained, at that point they weren’t necessarily known to them
as facets: “Facets had been on the web and I don’t know that I had heard them called
facets, they were just those things that I noticed” [PID 34]. Another participant [PID 14]
mentioned in his interview that the ecommerce model was helpful when trying to explain
to colleagues the value of a facet-based catalog:
I would go into meetings and say “think about what you do online. Think about if
you’re doing online shoe shopping or online wine shopping or something like
that. That’s how you narrow stuff down. You know, the wine shop has 755
Cabernets, ok? So you go down by country, by region, by grape type, by all of this
kind of stuff until you get a manageable result and then you look at those 27.”
One participant, who had noted in the survey that he first became aware of facets through
online retailers like Amazon, paused in the interview to acknowledge that he could recall
some exposure to facets in library school in the early 1990s:
My own experience is that faceted classification was covered on my course but
going into a working environment I never really encountered [facets] until I came
across them in discovery systems. I retain a slight skepticism that the way that

106

faceted classification was described back then is actually quite how they’ve been
implemented now. [PID 16]
Seven survey respondents indicated they heard about facets during a LIS graduate
program. Five of these seven were employed in collection support positions and three
specifically mentioned that they had been introduced to facets in cataloging and
classification courses. One respondent mentioned he became aware of facets through PhD
course readings and described this in more detail during his interview:
[In the survey] I mentioned certain writers. One was recent, Kathryn La Barre; I
know she did a PhD thesis on that. But you know, the classic ones: Ranganathan
and others, Jack Mills, the Classification Research Group, Henry Bliss as well.
Coming from Ranganathan there’s a lot of theoretical work, and practical work I
guess too, with facets and how it better organizes, or breaks, down different
subject areas. So I came through it just theoretically, knowing the importance and
have been studying that for some time, and it was only more recently that we got
the Summon product where I can see a demonstration of that. [PID 44]
Five additional respondents suggested, with varying degrees of certainty, that facets were
not a new feature on the LIS scene. From collection support, one respondent recalled first
seeing facets used in the 1970s as part of card catalogs, while another remarked that the
“concept of narrowing search using specific aspects has been around forever” [PID 27],
though the latter conceded that the specific term “facet” was not known to her until the
first next-generation catalog implementations. Similarly, one respondent from
administration described facets as “a new term for a traditional methodology that we are
getting better at building into catalogs through discovery applications” [PID 42].
Several respondents indicated that their introduction to facets came through the catalog
implementation at their library. Of these responses, two specified that their introduction
came first through the vendor demonstration session and five responded with simple
variations of “when we got [the] catalog.” One respondent claimed that his library

107

“worked to develop the concept [of facets] here as part of the initial creation [of the
catalog]” [PID 7]. This is certainly a contentious claim, even as one of the first wave of
catalog products to employ facets, but it highlights a not uncommon belief that facets
were born in the mid-2000s. Based on data collected in other parts of the survey, for at
least some respondents it seems that their exposure to facets happened once the catalog
was in place and they became involved in choosing facets or testing the catalog. Other
respondents specified that their introduction to facets came through direct involvement in
catalog development or purchasing decisions.
Exposure to facets via the wider LIS community was another common response by
respondents. Six heard about facets through formal channels such as conference
presentations and journal articles about catalogs or specific early innovators. One digital
services respondent mentioned that although they had used facets on commercial
websites for several years, it was a webinar “that solidified their importance in a library
context” [PID 34]. He explained during the interview:
Where I first became aware of their importance in a library context was a
webinar on next generation catalogs that I watched with a team at my previous
job, and that would have been about 2009. It basically established a model for the
next-generation catalog and best practices. They focused heavily on facets as a
core feature… When I saw that webinar it wasn’t like it was a foreign concept to
me but, you know, they gave it a name and gave it their approval and
recommendation. Over the next couple of years every discovery product that came
out included facets.
Other survey respondents simply noted that they had seen facets in use in other library
catalogs and online databases, either in products they used in high school and college or
that they had come across in a professional capacity:
The Endeca catalog, the North Carolina State catalog, that was probably the first
time I had seen anything like that and that. AquaBrowser was the same sort of
time. Those two products, applied to libraries I think around 2005 or 2006, is

108

probably where I first became aware. At the time I had a different job and had no
responsibility for things catalog-ish or discovery focused, so it was much more of
a curiosity than a real interest. It was with the position that I now have, starting
in 2007, that it became a much more practical interest. [PID 9]
Neither the survey nor interview asked participants when they had entered the profession,
nor where they had untaken their academic education. It is possible that such information
may have provided further illumination for these answers.
4.5 Facet Information Sources
Survey respondents were asked to think about, and list, where they would look for
information about facets – the people, places, objects and events they would consult, or
have consulted in the past. This question was intentionally broad to account for the
multitude of information that respondents may have sought: from finding out what facets
are and what they do, how to select, populate and label them, to how patrons use and
respond to them. Thirty six survey respondents provided at least one source where they
would look for information. Twelve either did not complete this question or indicated that
they did not typically seek information about facets.
In total, survey respondents listed 116 sources. The most sources given by any one
respondent was eight, though most listed three or fewer. Of the five identified participant
role groups, those in user services provided markedly fewer sources than the others. Four
user services respondents provided no answer, while another indicated that they do not,
or have not, tried to get information about facets. Of the five user services respondents
who did answer, four listed just a single source, and one listed three. It is possible that the
fewer sources listed by user services respondents is a consequence of their primary
involvement with facets. As previously mentioned, these respondents are the library staff

109

that field most patron questions about the catalog. The sources they listed reflect that
much of the information they need may be of the troubleshooting variety: “the catalog,”
“other catalogs,” “help pages,” and “colleagues.”
Overall, sixteen respondents listed LIS literature as sources to consult. This raged from
the vague “library journals” [PID 45] and “library literature” [PID 6] through “textbooks
on online searching” [PID 46] and “OPAC research journals” [PID 40] to the specific –
“computers in libraries magazine” [PID 18], “catalogue 2: future of the library catalogue
by sally chambers” [PID 20] and “LITA reports” [PID 23]. Half of all collection services
respondents mentioned consulting LIS literature, perhaps indicating an interest by this
group to learn more about the context in which facets are created and applied as well as
the experiences of other libraries.
One respondent mentioned they would consult their graduate LIS online searching class,
implying they would look at course readings or lecture notes. Several LIS researchers and
practitioners were mentioned by name. Marti Hearst and Marshall Breeding were each
mentioned once, both by IT/systems participants. Eric Miller of Zepheria was mentioned
by a collection support respondent. S. R Ranganathan was mentioned twice, both by
collection support respondents, one of whom also mentioned Jack Mills, the
Classification Research Group, and Kathryn La Barre. Library-centric and librarianmaintained blogs were mentioned by four respondents; two in digital services and two in
collection support. Blogs mentioned by name were Planet Cataloging and Catalogablog.
Twitter was mentioned by one respondent suggesting that they may “follow” particular
LIS researchers or practitioners.

110

Eleven respondents mentioned that they would consult, or have consulted, their library
coworkers. Whilst several simply mentioned “colleagues,” some of the more specific
answers indicated particular roles or departments such as technical services, IT and
systems, public services, developers, archivists and metadata librarians. These responses
tended to be cross-departmental, so collection support staff would seek out colleagues in
IT/systems, and user services staff would talk to catalogers etc.
One respondent, who initially mentioned in the survey that he could not think of where he
would go for information about facets, spoke in the interview about the chair of their
OPAC committee:
We have a very, very dedicated reference librarian on our project team …she has
been a vocal proponent of adding facets and making sure that they work
properly… she’s always looking at other implementations for ideas and things we
can do ourselves here and for different perspectives because we don’t want to get
into a rut. [PID 43]
Eleven respondents listed sources related to their system vendor or open source software.
These included the vendor’s website, product documentation, system help pages, vendor
help center, open source documentation, catalog – specific listservs, and open source
catalog and discovery service communities:
In the context of our experience, by default if we have an issue we wish to
understand; how a facet might work, how we might want to do things slightly
differently in Blacklight, our default would be to go to the Blacklight community
and look at how other members of that community have implemented different
things. And, we have learned a few things by looking at how other people have
constructed and built their facets, some of which we have implemented and some
of which we are still thinking about. [PID 16]
Five respondents also mentioned the NGC4Lib listserv, home of a general
catalog/discovery layer community, and one of the recruitment sites for this study. One

111

respondent, working in a collection support role, also mentioned MOUG – the Music
OCLC Users Group.
Four survey respondents mentioned they would look at other library catalogs for ideas.
BiblioCommons and Blacklight were mentioned as particularly good examples of facetbased catalogs. During the interviews, two additional participants spoke of the benefit to
‘borrowing’ from other vendors:
The discovery vendors who are the Summons’, the EBSCO Discovery services’,
folks at OCLC, they have a lot of interesting white papers and they obviously do a
great deal of research on it. I think it would serve us well here to borrow a bit
more heavily from the native interfaces to things like Summon. We use that in our
article discovery tool but we have chosen to build our own front end that we
wrote rather than relying on the vendor supplied one. But I think there’s a lot to
be learned from the power of their usability research budgets as we look at what
we’re doing. [PID 9]
Then, the other thing is we did look at OCLC. It’s very, very interesting, I think,
the way that OCLC uses facets and the way that they are using grouping. We’re
really, really intrigued by the way that OCLC has developed, so much to the point
where we’re involved in a lot of the strategic partnership which SirsiDynix does
which is basically where they allow their clients to give them feedback on what
new products they want to see, and that’s something we’ve been engaged in when
we’ve been talking about the future of the OPAC interfaces. [PID 38]
Seven respondents mentioned events. The majority of these were LIS conferences, with
the American Library Association and Computers in Libraries conferences being
mentioned by name. Other events mentioned were ALA and WebJunction webinars,
technical service retreats, and in-house training sessions.
Three respondents mentioned they would consult Wikipedia, and search engines were
also mentioned by three, with Google Scholar and Clusty (now Yippy) being named once
and Google being listed twice. Another respondent concluded their list of sources with
“random searching” [PID 1]. Although it has been recommended that libraries should
look to commercial websites for inspiration for user design and labeling conventions (e.g.

112

Nelson & Turney, 2015), only four survey respondents noted that they would look at
facet-based commercial sites. Two of these, both IT/systems respondents, mentioned they
would look at commercial sites expressly for ideas about functionality and user design.
4.6 Perceived Useful facets
Question 15 of the survey provided respondents with a list of 15 potential facets and
asked them, regardless of which they may use in their own catalog, how useful they
thought each facet was for catalog users. The list of facets was taken from existing
catalog facets recorded by Hall (2011). A total of 43 respondents answered this survey
question. Figures 4.1 and 4.2 show the overall breakdown of responses. A more detailed
look at how respondents valued each facet is presented below.

Figure 4.2 Perceived less useful facets.

A format facet was declared to be universally useful, with 31 respondents (72%)
declaring it to be a mandatory catalog facet, eight saying it was extremely important, and
three moderately important. Respondents working in public libraries were more likely to
think of format as a mandatory facet with 88 % (N=14) of those respondents indicating as
such compared to 64% (N=14) of respondents from academic libraries. A higher
percentage of user services respondents thought format was mandatory (75% compared
to 70% of IT/systems participants and 67% of collection support respondents),
presumably reflecting their experience and understanding of patron needs and desires.
Subject/Topic was another highly valued facet. A total of 26 respondents (60%) rated this
as a mandatory facet. Respondents working in collection support, were most likely to
value this facet with 94% (N=16) marking it as mandatory or very important. They were

114

closely followed by IT/systems respondents, 90% (N=9) of whom placed it in the top two
categories. User services respondents were less likely to value it so highly, with 75%
(N=6) of those respondents assigning it to one of the top two categories. This difference
is compelling as it suggests that subject/topic facets as usually delivered may not be as
useful to library users as commonly believed, Subject/topic facets are frequently large
and operate as a “catch all” for characteristics which would be teased apart by a process
of traditional facet analysis.
The survey offered three more subject facets for consideration: person, geographic
location and time period. Reaction to these was mixed, although the majority of
respondents still rated them to be at least moderately useful. All user services and almost
all collection services respondents rated the three facets as at least moderately useful.
However, IT/systems respondents were less sure about the usefulness of these facets.
Sixty percent (N=6) judged person to be at least moderately useful, with those figures
rising to 70% (N=7) for geographic location and 80% (N=8) for time period. It may be
that IT/systems respondents do not understand exactly what this type of facet is, the value
of these facets to library users in the same way that user services and collection support
respondents do, or the benefits of separating them from a general subject/topic facet.
They may also be more likely to feel constrained by the limitations of the underlying
metadata and user interface design in effectively deploying such facets.
Publication date was rated as mandatory by 25 respondents (58%), nine (21%) said it was
very useful, seven (16%) moderately useful, and two (5%) not very useful. This facet was
ranked very highly by respondents in user services and IT/systems roles, 100% (N=18) of
whom declared it to be mandatory or very important in a catalog (compared to 72%, or

115

13, of collection support respondents). Publication date was more likely to be viewed as
mandatory by respondents working in academic libraries, 70% (N=16) of which said so,
compared to 47 % (N=8) of public library respondents.
An Author facet was viewed as mandatory by 24 respondents (56%), very useful by nine
(21%), and moderately useful by four (9%). Just over 88% (N=15) of respondents from
public libraries said that Author was a mandatory or very useful facet compared to just
over 65% (N=15) of academic library respondents. The comparison is even starker if we
look at just those who said it was mandatory – 76 % (N=13) of public library respondents
compared to 39% (N=9) of academic library respondents. This difference is perhaps
explained by the different collection emphasis of academic and public libraries, where
fiction material is a central component of public library collections. Collection support
respondents were more likely to view the author facet as mandatory or very useful with
83% (N=16) of respondents saying so, compared to 63% (N=5) of user services
respondents and 60% (N=6) of IT/systems respondents.
Language was another highly valued facet, viewed as at least moderately important by
94% (N=16) of public library respondents and 90% (N=19) of academic library
respondents. Public libraries may maintain non-English language collections to serve the
needs and interests of their communities, while academic libraries are likely to maintain
non-English language collections to support the research and teaching of language and
literature disciplines. Genre was rated as at least moderately important by all public and
special library respondents and over 90% (N=20) of academic library respondents. All
collection support respondents felt that genre was at least moderately important. PID 38

116

explained in their interview that the genre facet was well liked by library staff and felt to
be particularly useful to highlight large print materials at their public library.
There were two facets listed that dealt with location: branch/building and collection/shelf.
Both were seen as useful by respondents, especially the branch/building facet. All user
services respondents rated branch/building as mandatory or very useful. The importance
of this facet to patrons and user service staff was discussed by PID 34 during his
interview:
Up at the top of our facets list we now have a library facet so you can limit results
to location and having worked the desk myself and having talked to people here
who work the desks, that is an extremely important facet to the patron who walks
up to you in your location and wants to walk away with something that day. And
so it’s very helpful to limit to items on the shelf at your location because that’s
still very much a common use case. We when we unveiled our catalog we did not
have that library facet functioning correctly and so we didn’t have it turned on for
probably nine months. And this was something we obviously heard about from
staff and I think it was a legitimate complaint and one that I was really trying to
get taken care of.
For non-front line staff, the importance of a branch/building facet decreased, with 76%
(N=13) of collection support respondents agreeing that it was mandatory or very useful
and 70% (N=7) of IT/systems respondents. For a collection/shelf facet, the number of
user services respondents marking it as mandatory or very useful remained high at 88%
(N=7). For collection support participants the number fell to 70% (N=12), and for
IT/Systems respondents the figure was just 40% (N=4), with another 30% (N=3)
reporting they did not think it was at all useful. The two location facets were viewed as
slightly more useful at public libraries than at academic libraries. One hundred percent of
public library respondents said that a Branch/Building facet was mandatory or very useful
and 80% (N=12) said the same about a Collection/Shelf facet. For academic library
respondents, those numbers were 82% (N=18) and 73% (N=16) respectively.

117

In terms of other facets which help the patron walk away with an item that day,
availability is also important. All public library respondents felt that Availability was a
mandatory or very important facet and 83% (N=19) of academic library respondents
agreed. Interestingly, both IT/systems and collection services respondents ranked this
facet higher than user services respondents. Ninety four percent (N=16) of collection
services respondents and 90% (N=9) of IT/systems respondents felt this was a mandatory
or very useful facet compared to 75% (N=6) of user services respondents.
Audience was a facet much more valued by public library respondents than those from
academic libraries. Eighty one percent (N=13) of public library respondents felt this was
at least a moderately useful facet compared to 48% (N=10) of academic library
respondents. In public libraries, audience is often formed of two or three values – Adult,
Young Adult/Teen and Juvenile/Child which was described by PID 38 as the “traditional
service emphasis” of a public library. Specific target audiences for academic libraries
would be much more difficult to discern.
Unsurprisingly, LC Call Number was not a facet seen to be very useful to public libraries,
with just 20% (N=3) of public library respondents feeling it was moderately or very
useful compared to 73% (N=16) of academic library respondents who said it was
mandatory, very useful or moderately useful. User services respondents were the most
likely to find it useful with 75% (N=6) recording it as at least moderately useful. This
number fell to 59% (N=10) for collection support staff and 50% (N=5) for IT/systems
respondents.
Publication Place was judged to be the least useful facet with 70% of survey respondents
noting it to be not very, or not at all, useful. Those who did find it useful were almost

118

exclusively collection support or IT/systems staff. Forty-two percent of collection support
respondents (N=7) judged it to be at least moderately useful and the two lone respondents
who said it was mandatory and very useful came from this group. It is difficult to imagine
many scenarios where a publication place facet would be useful to library patrons. That a
relatively large number of collection support respondents think it is important may speak
more to its requirement in the bibliographic record than anything else.
4.7 Suggestions for Additional Facets
Beyond the facets listed in question 15 of the survey, 25 respondents offered ideas for
other facets which they believed would be useful. Of these 25, 12 worked in academic
libraries, 11 in public libraries and two in special libraries. In terms of job roles, 10
worked in collection support positions, six in user services, six in IT/Systems, two in
digital services and one in administration.
Three public library respondents mentioned user ratings and three mentioned a
fiction/non-fiction facet. Facets specifically tailored for younger patrons were mentioned
by two public library respondents. One IT/systems professional added that their previous
facet-based catalog had a separate children’s interface which included facets for grade
level and number of pages. They also added that Lexile, a measure of reading ability,
would be a welcome facet. Another IT/systems respondent thought back to common
patron questions and said, “sounds crazy but on a pure user viewpoint they'd probably
like color. How many times do they tell staff it was a blue book when trying to locate
something they've read previously?” [PID 31]. Although color is not a facet seen in
conventional catalogs, the International Children’s Digital Library does provide a visual

119

color facet for its young readers and many facet-based catalogs have added cover images
to their record displays.
Two respondents, one each from an academic and public library, suggested a facet for
Award winners. The academic library respondent provided the relevant MARC field
(586) implying that this is available cataloging data they have not yet made use of. Series
was also mentioned as a possible facet by two respondents. Acquisition date or new at the
library was suggested by two respondents, again one from an academic library and one
from a public library. The new at the library facet is a feature seen in BiblioCommons
catalogs and allows patrons to view items from the past 7, 30, 60, 90 and 180 days, as
well as older material.
One collection support respondent from a public library suggested that format facets
should be more granular: “Format is typically overly broad. Customers do not want to
know if something is a recording on a disk. They want to know it's a Blu-ray, a regular
DVD or an audio CD” [PID 48]. This sentiment was echoed by a user services
respondent from an academic library who said, “Format is too broad. It should be
carrier, media, and content type. For example, a sound recording is a content type that
could be issued on a CD, LP, or as an electronic resource, all of which are very different
and very important for patrons” [PID 19].
One collection support respondent noted they would “like users to actually have access to
information on authority records” [PID 25] and using authority records was also a feature
that PID 38 commented on in her interview:
There’s another aspect on OCLC which we really liked which I think would
probably make really good use of authority records… you especially see it with
directors and actors and if you’re doing a search by that personal name entry it

120

will actually come up with really, really good related suggestions of what else you
might be interested in.
A few ideas were mentioned that might best be served as a values of another facet. For
example, being able to limit to scholarly publications was listed by one respondent, and
another said textbooks; both of these could fit under a more nuanced format facet.
Similarly, “availability beyond the local collection” [PID 15] could most likely be
incorporated into a format or availability facet. One respondent suggested a title facet
though, assuming most titles are unique, it is difficult to envision how that could be
executed in a useful way.
Many of the suggested facets appear to be born from respondents’ personal and
professional experience and would be useful only in certain settings or contexts. A Lexile
reading level facet would be of little use for an academic library, for instance. This
speaks to the need for library catalogs which are customizable at the local level, where
librarians can alter not just the aesthetics of a catalog, but add features and functionality.
While open source catalogs give a full range of control, libraries are often more
constrained by commercial products (e.g. Thompson, et al., 2013).
4.8 Staff Reaction to Facets
Staff and patrons are a completely different category of users. That’s probably
something every library struggles with because the catalog of course is a staff
tool, and a very important staff tool, but it is also the primary interface we have
with people in the community. [PID 34]
In the LIS field, when we talk of library catalog “users” we are most often referring to
patrons. However, there is another important group of library catalog end users: library
staff. The survey asked how well the catalog, and facets, had been received by users.
When several respondents took the opportunity to specifically comment on staff reaction

121

this was incorporated into the interview framework. As mentioned in Chapter 2, the
traditional OPAC was much maligned and there were enthusiastic the calls for the
development and implementation of facet-based discovery systems. However, reaction
from staff after implementation was not unanimously positive (e.g. Breeding, 2012;
Aharony & Prebor, 2015).
Mixed sentiments were also reflected in the findings of this study. The following
opposing statements from collection support respondents express the divergent
sentiments attributed to library staff by survey respondents:
Our reference librarians love it because it enhances the searching experience and
they can easily explain it in library instruction sessions. [PID 47]
Our staff have refused to use them, except for the branch location facets available
in our Encore discovery layer. I'm pretty sure they underutilize the Format facet,
despite it being a very good way to narrow their search results... [PID 29]
One digital services participant reflected that staff reaction had been “pretty positive,” but
that some people hadn’t warmed to the catalog immediately:
I will say that most of the sticking points, in my mind, had to do with things that
were different than the previous catalog and not necessarily a better feature or a
worse feature, they were things that just operated differently and they needed to
get used to that [PID 34].
This observation was echoed by PID 16, a collection support participant, who noted that
some staff were still adjusting to the new catalog and its functionality, and figuring out
how useful and favored actions learned in the old catalog could be transferred to the new.
This participant took a very sympathetic view, noting that adjustment takes time and that
work was still ongoing with the new Blacklight implementation to fully utilize all
available features. PID 14, an IT/systems participant at a special library was much more

122

frustrated by staff reticence towards the new catalog. He recalled a fraught transition
period with a lot of pushback:
All the grief we got was from staff. Because, that’s normal. All staff want MARC
view, all staff want all that other stuff and I kept telling them that’s why you all
have a log in to Alma [the ILS]. You go into Alma and you look at your records
and you don’t worry it.
Cataloging staff at his institution were particularly thrown by the new system. They had
incorporated their old catalog interface into their work routine and it had become a
verification method for their cataloging activities:
We had catalogers who would catalog and then immediately look at the record in
the old OPAC to see how their 5xx field structure looked, or what came before
what, or to make sure all their notes lined up in the content description, and it’s
basically like they cataloged for OPAC consumption.
PID 14 reports that these changes left staff “all screwed up” and it took over a year for
them to get past their reservations and adapt their behaviors.
Resistance from cataloging staff was also mentioned by PID 27. Though now using a
different product, the experience with a prior facet-based catalog had left them leery.
Using WorldCat Local, catalogers had been dismayed that much of the metadata
previously displayed in the Millennium catalog was not visible in WorldCat Local:
“A lot of the data that [catalogers] were taking the time to create was not being
displayed to users. With OCLC, we had no control over what was displayed in the
detailed display. That was a decision they made for the sake of development that
the detailed record being displayed would be the same for all customers.”
While most of the staff complaints were reported second hand, one collection support
respondent mentioned their own misgivings in the survey:
It feels like we have lost the ability to search well, and are being offered facets as
an alternative, but it isn't a better alternative - it requires many more steps. It
would be wonderful if a discovery layer could combine the powerful search
capabilities of a “traditional” OPAC with the faceting of a discovery layer. [PID
37].

123

PID 9 reflected on this resistance and speculated that for some, it may be a generational
challenge; reluctance to change the professional habits of a lifetime. PID 34 was not
surprised by the resistance, and commented that it was something he had observed in
library and non-library environments whenever new systems were deployed:
Anytime someone has spent a lot of time in learning how to manipulate a system,
overtime they internalize the complexity of that and what they do – and this is
really interesting – they attribute their ability as being an attribute of the system.
As a result, when you introduce a new system, you are devaluing this complex
skill that a person has developed, but they don’t necessarily see it that way. They
see that you are taking this system that works really well and are replacing it with
a system that doesn’t work as well.
For those that have embraced facet-based catalogs, resistance can seem baffling, and even
frustrating:
Most of the problem reports we get about facets come from staff who see a
problem and often, you know, it’s not really that much of a problem [PID 27].
Some study participants reported that staff were still using the traditional catalog, either
because they simply preferred the old interface or because they thought it offered them
more precise recall and Boolean search features. This is consistent with the study by
Aharony and Prebor (2015) who found library staff more likely to use the traditional
catalog for known item searching, but the facet-based catalog for subject searches.
Even PID 44, a big proponent of their facet-based catalog with a well-developed
understanding of how facets work, prefers to use the traditional catalog for certain
information seeking activities:
And when it comes to books, when anybody’s asking for a book, I just go through
the classic catalog, the voyager catalog. So if they’re looking for a book, or VHS
or DVD, some serials which are print, I’d rather go through the classic catalog. It
has more precision than recall and we can find material directly. If we try doing
that with Summon we might get all kinds of materials. But if you’re really doing a
broad search with all kinds of resources using summon, especially its advanced
search can be good.

124

Some of the difficulties mentioned by PID 44 are particular to a product like Summon
which contains a centralized index of over one billion resources. In such a system, local
collections may be deemphasized and patrons may be connected to content which is not
readily available at their institution. Another system limitation was noted by a respondent
whose library uses an Encore system:
Vendors seem to overlook consistency of facets between staff and public
interfaces. Not all staff modules have facets or even the same facets as the public
interface, making it harder for staff to buy-in to the power of faceted access to
metadata. [PID 29]
While most libraries do continue to maintain the old catalog alongside the facet-based
catalog, at least for some time, PID 14 was determined that would not be the case at his
library:
I said, “Well we’re not going to be a Princeton and run a discovery layer and the
old catalog.” And that, actually, was nice, because that was the clean break we
needed because we put Primo up on voyager about six months before we switched
over to Alma and no one would use it. They refused to use it. So we didn’t get any
user data, we didn’t get any user experience stuff that we could tweak very much.
Staff especially, just refused to use it on Voyager. [PID 14]
One respondent PID 38, felt that his colleagues in other departments would benefit from
a better understanding of how facets work:
From a data systems standpoint, not enough public services or circulation staff
have a sufficient understanding of how the facets function. It would be helpful
(from where I sit) if they better understood the synergy of the facet to item and
title metadata and advocated for good data practices accordingly.
However, it seems equally likely that IT/systems staff could also benefit from a better
understanding of how library users and different library staff use facets in particular and
the catalog in general. Open communication with different stakeholder groups may help
identify particular problems and challenges as well as foster an appreciation for the
expertise of different professions.

125

Although facet-based catalogs do require a change in search strategy and letting go of
well-established behaviors, with time, and familiarity, respondents reported that
resistance had mostly abated, although small pockets of discomfort and dissatisfaction
remained. PID 43, who works in an IT/systems capacity at an academic library,
concluded:
It’s an entirely different way to search…but what I would say to librarians when I
was showing them this interface is “we commit to getting for you, if not the same
results as you were able to get in the old catalog, results of comparable quality.
What we do not commit to doing is getting you there by the same path.” And I
would say that, and people would nod their heads and agree, but they would still
go back and try to apply the old path and overtime as people got comfortable they
stopped – their discomfort level was less.
4.9 Summary
Participants interpretations of facets are born from many streams; their professional
education, their interaction with them in the workplace and their use of them in other
systems. For most participants in this research, facets are a recent phenomenon. Despite
this, in a relatively short space of time facets have become a standard catalog feature,
recognizable by name with no definition or description required in much of the recent
catalog and discovery service literature.
This research was unique in obtaining library professionals’ definitions and
interpretations of facets in their own words. Their definitions are consistent with the
published work of their peers: and the term “facet” has come to mean an interface
enhancement, a search and discovery tool, and, often, a synonym for filter or limit. This
was found to be especially true for participants in user services roles who, unlike
IT/Systems and collection services participants, are a step removed from the underlying
metadata, and are apt to define facets as filtering and narrowing mechanisms.

126

Discussing important attributes of facets and facet based catalogs, the library user is at
that forefront of participants’ minds. They advocate for user friendly systems, distinct
facets, and easy to understand terminology. While some first saw facets in use in
commercial environments, most turn to their profession for further education, advice and
inspiration. To find out more about facets most would look to the facet based catalog
community, colleagues, and LIS literature.
While generally acknowledged that the library OPAC needed a drastic overhaul, the
introduction of facet-based catalogs has not been a smooth transition for all, with
participants reporting resistance from library staff both to the new catalogs and the new
methods of searching.

127

Chapter 5. Findings & Discussion Part 2: Libraries’ Practices and Procedures
This chapter examines issues relating to institutional and organizational factors which
may impact or influence the introduction and maintenance of facet-based catalogs. An
exploration of these factors can help researchers, designers and practitioners better
understand the limitations and opportunities that exist for libraries with facet-based
catalogs. This chapter looks at how catalogs are chosen, what influences facet selection
and facet sequence, and who is involved in various parts of the process. As this chapter
explores differences between libraries, systems and professional roles, graphs and charts
are used as a mechanism to provide a quick overview of some of the quantitative data.
Both number of participants and percentage of participants are used as measurement in
these figures, with the latter most often used when showing some of the potential
variation between groups.
5.1 Involvement in Selecting, Developing and Administering the Catalog
The survey asked respondents to describe their involvement with the facet-based catalog
by choosing from several multiple-select options: Selecting the Catalog, Metadata
Evaluation, Choosing Facets, Testing & Evaluating the Catalog, Technical Development
& Assistance, Facilitating User Testing, and User Instruction. They were also able to add
any other involvement not covered by the survey options. Forty-three respondents
completed this survey question.
Overall, those working in collection support positions indicated that they were involved
in less implementation tasks than the respondents working in IT/systems and user
services. The figures below offer more information about who was involved in which
specific processes. Figure 5.1 shows overall involvement by all survey respondents.

128

Figure 5.2 compares involvement by the three main professional roles: collection support,
IT/systems and user services. Figure 5.3 compares involvement by participants from
academic and public libraries, and figure 5.4 by participants using commercial and open
source catalogs.

Figure 5.4 Comparison of implementation task involvement by catalog type.

Almost 50% (N=21) of survey respondents said that they were involved in choosing their
library’s facet-based catalog, although, surprisingly, none of the four digital services
participants indicated involvement in the selection process. Overall, 60% (N=26) of
respondents assisted with metadata evaluation and conversion. As one would expect,
respondents from collection support roles were more likely to be involved in this
particular process with 78% (N=14) of them indicating as such. By contrast, just 25%
(N=2) of user services respondents said they helped with metadata evaluation.
Overall, almost 70% (N=30) of respondents indicated that they assisted in the selection of
facets. Of all roles, this number was lowest for collection support staff, 55% (N=10) of
whom mentioned involvement with this process. By comparison, 80% (N=8) of
IT/systems, and 75% (N=6) of user services respondents said that they helped to choose

131

facets. The involvement of a large number of user services staff is promising, and implies
that libraries may be attempting to create facets that meet user needs rather than simply
creating facets from whatever metadata is available. However, the relatively low
involvement of collection support staff is surprising, and suggests that some libraries may
not be leveraging the experience and insight of catalogers and metadata specialists when
developing facets. This supports previous research which has found that involvement of
cataloging staff in any stage of catalog selection is highly variable (Wynne & Hanscom,
2011). Survey respondents with open source catalogs were more likely to be involved in
choosing facets compared to those from libraries with commercial systems. At least some
of this difference may be attributed to the number of commercial products that do not
allow, or severely limit, facet choice.
Testing and evaluating the catalog was the process that the most respondents were
involved with. Over 88% (N=38) of those who answered this survey question indicated
that they assisted with this, including all from public libraries and all IT/systems
respondents. Collection support respondents were the group least involved in this process
but, even so, over three-quarters of them indicated that they helped with testing and
evaluating.
By contrast, technical development and assistance was the process that the least number
of survey respondents participated in. Understandably, IT/Systems participants were the
most heavily involved group but even so, only 60% (N=6) reported that this was
something they assisted with. This can likely be attributed to a number of factors
including, but not limited to, commercial catalogs with high levels of central vendor
support, and consortium or branch libraries where catalog development and maintenance

132

is handled at another location. No respondents from user services or digital services roles
were involved in this process.
Facilitating user testing and delivering user instruction were the final processes offered in
the survey and were selected by 54% (N=23) and 52% (N=22) of respondents
respectively. User services respondents were more likely to be involved with these, with
88% (N=7) of those respondents indicating that they had assisted with this. This number
dropped to 50% (N=5) for IT/systems respondents, and even lower for collection support
respondents where 39% (N=7) helped facilitate user testing, and 29% (N=4) delivered
user instruction.
For every process, a higher percentage of public library respondents were involved than
their academic library counterparts. Sometimes these margins were small, as with
metadata evaluation and conversion, and sometimes the margins were large, as was the
case with user instruction. Although further research would be required to ascertain why
there is a difference, we can speculate based on what we know about the different library
types. Several of the academic library participants interviewed in this study described
catalog implementation as a fairly structured process involving a “team” of people with
delineated roles and assigned tasks. These implementations may employ processes
similar to those described in the research of Gallaway et al, (2012), Thompson et al.
(2013) and Chickering & Yang (2014), whereby teams and taskforces are charged with
very specific deliverables. It is possible that the public libraries in this study employed
fewer staff, requiring more people to be involved with more parts of the selection and
implementation process, or it may be that the culture within public libraries invites a
more informal approach to implementation.

133

5.2 Factors in Catalog Choice
In question 12 of the survey, respondents were asked to select the factors which
contributed to the purchase or development of their particular catalog. Forty individuals
responded to this question. Table 5.1, below, identifies the number and percentage of
respondents who acknowledged each factor as contributing to the choice of catalog.
Figure 5.5 explores the differences between academic and public libraries and figure 5.6
looks at the differences between commercial and open source systems.

Survey respondents were given seven possible factors to select, and could select multiple
factors, and add others. Overall, cost was a contributing factor for nearly half (48%) of
those who answered this question. The biggest difference here was observed between
libraries using commercial and open source systems, with cost being listed by 58% (N=7)
of respondents from libraries with open source systems and 42% (N=11) of those using
commercial systems. Commercial systems can be expensive, sometimes prohibitively so,
while the cost of open source systems is usually felt in terms of development time. Even
for those operating commercial systems, cost may affect what product is chosen and
when it is implemented, as two survey respondents from public libraries explained:
I’m in a small consortia with one other library. That library added
BiblioCommons about 1.5 years before we did. That was due to my library not
having enough money to move forward with BC earlier. [PID 41]
We were using AquaBrowser through a consortium without a cost to us and had
to find an alternative since the cost was no longer going to be covered. [PID 42]
Performance against other library systems was selected by 50% (N=13) of those with
commercial catalogs but just 33% (N=4) of those with open source systems. In part, this
may be explained by the fewer options available to libraries who have already made a
commitment to developing their own catalog. As one interview participant explained:
Back then there weren’t many options. Vufind and Blacklight were the two kind of
packaged open source things you could really play with. At the time it seemed that
Vufind had a more active development community and was the more general
solution. [PID 9]
While case studies in the literature may describe detailed comparative studies of
commercial systems (e.g. Vaughan, 2011; Gallaway & Hines, 2012; Deodato, 2015), they
may not be the norm. One interview participant admitted that their evaluation process
was not always particularly rigorous or detailed:

136

I think at other library systems if they were thinking of a discovery layer
implementation, they might go out and either do an RFP or bring in demos from a
series of providers and make more of a competition out of it. And I have been part
of a similar process in the past but not necessarily on this product. We did see
demos of a few others over the course of the year, but as I said, the decision was
largely made and we just wanted to be aware of the landscape of discovery layers
that were out there. [PID 34]
Rather than comparing different systems, open source libraries were more likely to place
importance on recommendations from other libraries. This factor was selected by 42%
(N=5) of open source library respondents and 23% (N=6) of those with commercial
catalogs.
The existence of IT and Technical staff to support the catalog was selected by 43%
(N=17) of respondents overall. This was another factor that was more important to
libraries with open source systems, two-thirds of whom chose this. Having an “in house”
IT team is critical for libraries with open source systems as they lack the centralized
vendor support that commercial systems offer. For open source system libraries,
developer familiarity or preference for certain software or programming languages can
have a significant bearing on system development. One interview participant explained
how his multi-campus academic library uses an open source discovery interface initially
developed largely by one individual:
So, as part of a 23 campus state university system, there’s a small central office
that does a lot of library services on behalf of all of us. And the person who is
currently the director of that, earlier on when he was the librarian at one of the
campuses, was the lead on creating the open source interface that we use. And
then, I think, as it grew, he partnered with a number of other University people,
so there’s some sort of extended community support there of developers [PID 15].
Positive user feedback was selected by just under a third of survey respondents. Those
from public libraries were less likely to select this as a factor (25% compared to 38% of
academic libraries). Possible reasons for this disparity may be that public libraries lack

137

resources (staff, time etc.) to commit to usability testing and user studies, or the academic
library culture places more emphasis on testing and evaluation (and by extension,
publishing). However, the figures are relatively low for both types of library and while
there is ample evidence of user studies and usability testing in the literature, it appears
that in the majority of cases this is undertaken only after final catalog selection.
Vendor support was chosen by 25% (N=10) of survey respondents, an unsurprisingly just
one participant with an open source catalog selected this option. It appeared that public
libraries with commercial systems were more apt to place importance on vendor support
than their academic library counterparts. Five of 13 (39%) public library/commercial
catalog participants selected this option compared to 2 of 11 (18%) academic
library/commercial catalog participants. Again, it is possible that staffing may play a role
here, with academic libraries having more ready access to IT and systems staff who can
assist with some of the minor troubleshooting.
Twenty-three percent (N=9) of survey respondents mentioned that their catalog had been
selected as part of a consortium purchase. Consortium decisions were more likely to be
made by public libraries (38% versus 14% of academic libraries) and those using
commercial systems (31% versus 8% of libraries using open source products). One
interview participant explained how his academic library was transitioning to a new
catalog to meet consortium needs:
The reason that we’re in this transition period right now is that the University is
part of a 37 library, academic library consortia and all of us are moving from
separate library systems, separate ILS. We’re all moving onto a shared ExLibris
system so we’ll all be working in the same system with the same catalog records.
One of the principles behind the move was that to support resource sharing, to
support collaborative collection development, to support other consortia activities
including some kind of collaborative technical service activities and we realized

138

that in order to do that we needed to all be on one system looking at the same
record, working with the same record. [PID 27]
During surveys and interviews, individuals also mentioned other factors which affected
catalog choice. One survey respondent said their discovery system was a “package deal”
with their ILS, and another mentioned that backend interoperability was important.
During interviews, two other participants mentioned that they chose catalog/discovery
interfaces offered by their ILS provider, in part, because of the perceived ease of
integration:
We were an [ExLibris] Alma early adopter, so we got a good deal, but it was also
a lot of growing pains with that too. And, because of the way Alma is, it’s cloudbased and there is no OPAC so we had to have some sort of discovery layer. We
looked at most of the discovery games in town and of course it was going to be
easier to deal with Primo because it was a better integration and Primo has a
huge install base…[PID 14]
We were stuck with an upgraded discovery layer called AquaBrowser. We’d been
using that since 2008 or so and it was so heavily customized that we couldn’t
upgrade it. We have kind of a unit within the library that’s responsible for
maintaining our ILS. We run SirsiDynix Symphony. And we also provide ILS
support for a consortium of regional libraries - small academics, other public
library systems and some high school libraries. So as an organization we have a
lot of capacity to support SirsiDynix technology. [PID 34]
Familiarity was not confined to libraries operating commercial products. One interview
participant [PID 16] traced his library’s Blacklight catalog interface to their repository
development several years before when they had become project partners with the
University of Virginia (where Blacklight was developed):
We then became more familiar with what it meant to work with facets and
understand how Blacklight operated. And, having made that decision, we then
took the view that it would be interesting to see whether or not we could
implement Blacklight over our Millennium Library Management System so that
we would be offering a similar user experience whether people were searching
the library catalog or they were searching the digital repository. [PID 16]

Four survey respondents mentioned that open source was a factor in choosing a catalog.
Open source allows libraries a greater amount of control with all aspects of the catalog,
and while some libraries operate with the basic default template that is provided by some
open source software, others have developed expansive, highly customized, and
innovative implementations. For many, in the LIS field and beyond, open source is not
just a choice of architecture but an endorsement of, and commitment to, a more open and
collaborative way of working.
This was certainly the case at PID 43’s library. Their open source catalog was one that
several study participants cited as an example of “best practice”, and the development
experience was something that PID 43 spoke very enthusiastically about. Their decision
to develop their own open source catalog reflected a desire for a highly individual and
customizable product. Importantly, they had the organizational infrastructure to fully
support their deliberate, measured approach. Their success, PID 43 stated, could be
attributed to a number of factors but one critical starting point was a general “buy-in”
from the administration who were able to give the team the fiscal and temporal resources
they needed:
We were fortunate that the administration decided to invest in this development
effort. A smaller school may not have those resources. We took several years to
get to where we are. We were not in a particular rush. We wanted to be careful to
do it as well as we could. I don’t believe that there’s one right solution. I don’t
mean to be critical of anyone else’s decisions...one of the things that kind of
helped us was we had a bit of extra time. [PID 43]
They were also resolute in their belief that they wanted a unique, tailor-made product
and, as much as their decision-making embraced open source technology, it was also a
conscious rejection of the existing commercial products on the market, especially webscale discovery systems:

140

Summon – the Serials Solutions article database – they were very eager to load
our catalog records into Summon and some schools are doing that. We chose not
to do that and we were very strong in our belief that that would be a mistake…
there are two billion objects in Summon and [our library] has 10 million in its
catalog, so even with a very large collection like [ours] at 10 million it’s a needle
in a haystack compared with 2 billion. So these local collections would be deemphasized to such an extent that they would essentially disappear in many cases.
5.3 Importance of the Facet Feature
Overall, facets were a highly anticipated feature for libraries when they were selecting or
developing their catalog or discovery layer. Forty-one survey respondents answered this
question, with 25 indicating that facets were seen to be of equal importance with
(an)other feature(s), and five reporting that facets were the most important or anticipated
catalog feature. Eleven respondents said that while other features were viewed as more
important, facets were a welcome addition.
Of the five libraries where facets were the most important or anticipated feature, four
were academic libraries with open source systems. These libraries had either completely
developed their own catalog, or highly customized a modular open source product. One
respondent later recalled in his interview:
We wanted to provide a better user interface, we wanted to provide faceted access
to the catalog. We were probably a little bit caught up in the web 2.0 hype of the
late 2000s and wanted to stay modern. I don’t think that most of our users
particularly enjoyed, if you can enjoy using a catalog, using the Aleph OPAC. For
the most part though, I think it was the recalling everything and narrowing down
approach that appealed to us. [PID 9]
PID 43 was another who said that facets were the most important or anticipated feature.
He and his colleagues were concerned that the metadata used in existing products like
Summon “is not especially rich or deep”. Developing their own catalog allowed much
more flexibility in creating facets and allowed for the potential to use different facets for
different parts of the collection.

141

The fifth library where facets were the most anticipated feature was a public library
offering a commercial catalog product. However, this survey respondent reported some
disappointment with their current implementation when compared to the previous,
customized, facet-based catalog:
Not all faceted interfaces are created equal – we found our [current] catalog to
be far less sophisticated in terms of ability to aggregate, flexibility in ranking etc.
than our previous [faceted catalog] implementation which we had admittedly
tweaked to provide the best possible experience… [PID 40]
Of the eleven respondents who indicated that facets were a welcome addition but other
features were more important, six were from public libraries, representing 35% of public
library respondents who answered this question. These participants worked at libraries
with a variety of different catalog products (two open source and four commercial). The
other five respondents who selected this answer were comprised of four from academic
libraries and one from a special library. While this research did not ask which catalog
features were considered more important than facets, relevancy ranking, a single Googlelike search box, auto completion and stemming, and enhanced content (tables of contents,
book covers, etc.) are some of the features identified as desirable in the existing literature
(e.g. Schneider, 2009a, b, c; Gallaway & Hines, 2012; Chickering & Yang, 2014).
5.4 Factors in Facet Selection
Previous research has highlighted that library catalogs vary widely in the number and
type of facets that they use (Hall, 2011), and this research sought to find out more about
the factors that informed the selection of facets for library catalogs. Survey respondents
were offered 10 variables, which had been discerned by the researcher as potentially
influential to facet selection, and asked to indicate the importance of each one. The

142

results are presented in figure 5.7. Table 5.2 provides a ranking of the factors for library
and system type based on weighted responses to the survey.

Figure 5.7 Factors influencing facet selection

User warrant is a primary recommendation in both LIS and IA guides to creating faceted
classifications and taxonomies (Vickery, 1960; Ranganathan, 1967; Denton, 2009; La
Barre, 2010a; Hedden, 2010; Lau, 2016). In this study, perceived usefulness to patrons
was the paramount consideration, and all but four respondents ranked it as a mandatory
or very important factor (two said it was moderately important and two said they were
unsure of its importance). Respondents from public libraries were more likely to say that
perceived usefulness to patrons was mandatory than were their academic library

143

counterparts (40% versus 27%) The same was true of those with commercial, rather than
open source, products (35% versus 25%).
PID 15 mentioned that discussions took place early on about the types of facets that users
might want for different types of searches. Location facets are often observed in multibranch/multi-campus environments and PID 27 explained this was also an important
facet for them because patrons expected immediate access to material. For PID 38,
working at a public library, it was important that their chosen facets reflected the needs of
a varied patron base, and a diverse collection. Their library chose to include an audience
facet of “adult, juvenile, young adult, as dictated by our traditional service emphasis”
and developed a custom facet, accelerated reader level, to accommodate one of their
member libraries; a K-12 school district.

The availability of pre-existing metadata to populate facets was the equally top ranking
factor for open source system respondents, 83% (N=10) of whom said this was
mandatory or very important. No academic library or open source system respondent said
that pre-existing metadata was not important or not considered. PID 9 explained how his
academic library began selecting facets for their open source catalog:
I think we took the approach of “Well, here’s all the things we could facet: What
don’t we want?” and narrowed it down to seven or eight main categories
including one that’s homegrown. The academic discipline is something that’s our
own campus wide, or library wide, taxonomy. The rest are all out of the MARC
record one way or another.

145

For public library respondents, pre-existing metadata ranked fourth, although the
percentage of participants viewing this as mandatory or very important was similar to
their academic colleagues at over 66%. Interface design was the second ranked factor for
public libraries with three quarters (N=12) indicating it was a mandatory or very
important factor in facet selection. While this figure dropped to 52% (N=11) for
academic libraries, it was still the third ranked factor for that group of respondents.
The paramount interface design concern was “cluttering” or “overcrowding” the interface
with too many features and facets. PID 38 mentioned that her library was intrigued by
geographic subject facets seen in other library catalogs but that they had not implemented
it themselves because they “feel it would be a little cluttered to do that”. Similarly, PID
16 explained that his library had abandoned the idea of creating hierarchical facets in part
because it was anticipated that it would take up too much screen real estate. These
interface design issues are discussed with some regularity in IA and web design fields.
Russell-Rose & Tate (2013) discuss some of the issues and trade-offs concerning number
and position of facets, such as the ones below the page fold not being seen.
System and software constraints ranked highly with those using commercial facet-based
catalogs. Seventy percent (N=18) of respondents from libraries with commercial catalogs
ranked this factor as mandatory or very important. In comparison those with open source
catalogs were more divided in their opinion. While 50% (N=6) felt it had been mandatory
or very important, 33% (N=4) reported it to be not very important or not considered.
System constraints were something that PID 27 spoke extensively about during his
interview. His academic library operates the Primo system from ExLibris and while the

146

library has full control of facets populated by their local data, the “web- scale” portion of
Primo, Primo Central, comes with its own facets:
The problem is that the facets for the Primo Central content are handled
separately, centrally, by ExLibris. We can do a certain amount of renaming the
facets and suppressing of facets… but we can’t actually change or make new
categories of the Primo Central content.
The resource type/format facet proved particularly problematic, with identical or very
similar facets being published by Primo Central and the local Alma System.
…these two instances of resource type facet are separate and we have no way of
combining them into a single facet. So, one of our big problems right now is,
depending on how something is ordered or where it is profiled, the same content
could appear under one of two separate facets which, depending on how you label
them, could be labeled identically… [PID 27]
User feedback and usability testing was the third ranked factor for open source system
libraries, fourth for academic libraries and fifth for public and commercial system
libraries. Despite the difference in ranking, the percentage of respondents who said this
factor was mandatory or very important was similar across all groups at between 52 and
58 %. While formal user testing appeared to be somewhat scarce, several respondents
mentioned that user feedback was collected via more informal channels such as website
comments, help desk queries and conversations with patrons. As evidenced elsewhere
(e.g. Fagan, 2010; Thompson et al, 2013) some respondents mentioned that patron
feedback led to tweaks and changes to their facets. PIDs 34 and 38 explained that
changes to their author facet were a direct result of patron feedback. Their library has a
large eBook collection, and the publisher metadata is supported in the 7XX fields of the
MARC record. This information was populating the author facet and patrons were
confused by the appearance of “OverDrive”, “Hoopla” and “NetLibrary” alongside

147

personal author names. As a solution, the library split the author facet in two: personal
author and corporate author.
The importance of what other libraries were doing varied quite considerably. Three
respondents said this had been a mandatory factor in facet selection, eight said it was very
important and 12 said it was moderately important. However, 13 said that it was not very
important and three noted that it was not considered. Respondents from public libraries
were apt to place less importance on this issue than their academic counterparts. Fiftythree percent (N=9) of participants from public libraries said that this factor was not
important or not considered, compared to 32% (N=7) from academic libraries.
In his academic library, PID 43 explained that reviewing other catalog implementations
was a regular part of their own catalog maintenance. Speaking of a colleague, he said:
“[she] is always looking at other implementations for ideas and things we can do
ourselves here and for different perspectives because we don’t want to get into a rut.” As
previously mentioned, the catalog at PID 43’s library was one that other participants had
themselves acknowledged as an example of best practice. PID 9 specifically praised the
way they had implemented facets:
I think there’s something to be said for not hitting the users with the facets right
away but providing them in a hopefully more context relevant way. So I think
there’s some good practice out there that I hope we can adopt or at least learn
from in our next generation…
Time was a divisive factor within all groups. Respondents with commercial systems were
more likely than those with open source systems to place importance on this factor.
Thirty-seven percent (N=10) of commercial system respondents said that time was
mandatory or very important compared to 17% (N=2) of open source respondents. Time
was ranked most highly by those working at public libraries, 44% (N=7) of whom said it

148

was mandatory or very important. However, between a quarter and a third of respondents
in all groups said that time was either not important or not considered in facet selection.
Unsurprisingly, vendor suggestion was a much more important factor for commercial
system respondents than open source respondents. Over 38% (N=10) of those with
commercial systems said that vendor suggestion was either mandatory or very important
and a further 23% (N=6) said it was moderately important. By contrast, two-thirds (N=8)
of those with open source systems said vendor suggestion was not considered, while onethird (N=4) said it was moderately important.
PID 27 explained that some of their vendor supplied facets were not particularly well
received by staff or patrons:
I notice one of the other facets we have here in Primo Central is ‘Collection’
which is not a terribly useful facet. That actually is for Primo Central content; it
drills down to the information source from Primo Central. I think people don’t
understand that one. It’s sort of a silly facet anyway because it’s basically where
are the citations sourced from? And not, where do I get this from?
Although the library can suppress or relabel this facet, PID 27 concedes that they have
left it as is, in spite of its limitations. This highlights a concern that vendor supplied or
suggested facets might not only be ill-defined and awkwardly constructed, but that
libraries are not always motivated to remove or improve them.
Cost was a very divisive factor for public library and commercial system respondents.
Approximately 44% (N=7) and 35% (N=10) from each group respectively said that cost
was either mandatory or very important, with the same numbers reporting it as not very
important or not considered. Open source respondents were the group least likely to place
importance on cost with 58% (N=7) noting it was not very important or not considered in

149

facet selection. Although included in the survey to mean “price”, it is worth noting again
that “cost” is ambiguous, and respondents may have defined it in different ways.
Recommendations from LIS facet theory was the sole variable that no respondent
indicated was mandatory. However, six respondents did record it as being very important
and 11 as moderately important. Over 81% (N=9) of respondents with open source
systems said that facet theory was either not very important or not considered at all. By
contrast, 56% (N=14) of respondents with commercial systems said it was very, or
moderately, important.
However, while relatively few libraries may have expressly sought out guidance from
LIS facet or cataloging and classification research, the perceptions and understandings of
individuals involved in facet selection are guided by those principles which they have
gleaned during LIS education and professional development.
5.5 Facet Sequence
Usefulness was the overwhelming response that respondents gave when asked which
factors had determined the facet sequence within the catalog. Nine respondents
specifically mentioned that facet sequence was based on perceived usefulness to users,
and provided little or no evidence that this had been validated by any user testing. As one
respondent explained, the facet sequence in his library’s open source catalog was based
on “general perceived usefulness though we have not yet subjected our choices to
assessment. We are likely to look at web analytics as a first pass at doing so” [PID 43].
Some libraries had looked at transaction logs and user search behavior to inform their
decision making, leading them to push the most used facets to the top of the list:

150

The way customers search, what they most frequently use. [PID 42]
Observation of user questions and patterns of use resulted in us prioritizing
format over subject, then date. [PID 15]
Other respondents mentioned utilizing user clicking heat maps, user feedback, and
general user testing to help determine sequence.
Other considerations were mentioned sparingly, and usually in conjunction with
usefulness. These included “guiding principles of library science” [PID 24], “catalog
card styles and citation styles” [PID 48], and interface design. One participant mentioned
“accuracy” [PID 40], and explained that facets which might contain a large amount of
incomplete or undefined metadata would ideally get pushed below the fold.
Study participants were not expressly asked about customization, but the ability or lack of
ability to customize facets was mentioned by some as a factor in facet implementation.
Not all facet-based catalogs allow customization of the facet display, even changing the
sequence. Survey respondents with Summon catalogs, in particular, noted that facet
sequence was determined by the vendor. However, one respondent did add that the
vendor had “shared usability study data with us to substantiate their choices” [PID 20].
There was some discrepancy in reports of respondents with Encore catalog
implementations. Two respondents, one from a public library and one from an academic
library, said that they could not control the sequence by which facets are presented in the
catalog. However, another respondent, from an academic library, said their facet
sequence was based on “perceived usefulness” [PID 18]. A visit to the web OPACs of
these libraries showed that all three did have slightly different facet sequences. It is
unclear whether the libraries were operating different versions of the system software or

151

if respondents were mistaken in their belief that they could not change the sequence of
facets.
5.6 Cataloging Practice
Question 18 of the survey asked if the introduction of a facet-based catalog had
influenced or changed cataloging practice. Of the 13 public library respondents who
answered this question, six said they were either unsure, or that the introduction of facets
had no influence on cataloging practice. One collection services participant explained, “It
has not [had any influence]. We've always worked hard to be consistent in our practices”
[PID 41]. Of the 16 respondents from academic libraries who answered this survey
question, one said they were not sure and two reported that there had been no change.
However, one of these respondents did concede that facets had been beneficial in
“improving the visibility of descriptive cataloging efforts” [PID 9].
Other respondents reported that the introduction of facets within their catalog or
discovery layer had implications for their metadata and cataloging team. Cataloging data
is much more visible in a facet-based catalog and this was mentioned as having a positive
effect on the value that catalogers place on their work. “It has definitely improved our
catalogers’ perception of the work they do” said PID 27, who explained that staff could
now see the catalog record elements more extensively used and mined than in the
traditional author/title/subject catalog. A handful of respondents explicitly mentioned
how a facet-based catalog had resulted in a shift in cataloging practices with “less focus
on how a librarian wants to use the catalog” [PID 42] and more focus on “the user and
their needs; how to be creative with new facet creation and creation of better MARCbased metadata by the cataloging department.” [PID 44]. These kinds of changes would

152

fit with what Wynne and Hanscom (2011) categorized as workflow and policy
implications.
A number of respondents commented that facets had exposed incomplete and
inconsistent metadata. “We have exposed some pockets of data that need attention. When
metadata is actively used as it is in facets, it needs to be more consistently structured
than when it is used purely descriptively,” explained one academic library interview
participant [PID 43]. Metadata errors have implications for catalog users, which was
noted by some:
We’ve become more aware of cataloging and metadata mistakes, since some types
of mistakes, such as the wrong format designation, can become far more obvious
to users and such mistakes can impede the user's ability to find all results
matching a facet they select when refining their search results.” [PID 29]
While most did not place any kind of judgement on the exposure of cataloging
inconsistencies, some did speak out. One survey respondent noted that facets had no
change on cataloging practice: “it should, but it hasn’t” [PID 26]. Another complained of
“lax cataloging practices” [PID 10].
It’s interesting because facets aren’t really something you can turn on and expect
to work which in a way is fascinating to me because librarians, for decades, have
put so much work into cataloging and description and what facets really did to my
mind was expose all the inconsistencies and inaccuracies in your cataloging when
the whole point of cataloging is quite the opposite of that. For that reason a lot of
the data has to be cleaned up or mapped in such a way that patrons don’t see five
different subject headings for what is the essentially the same concept. I’m
increasingly interested in the interplay between cataloging practices and patron
discovery and the more I’m in this sphere the more I realize, at the risk of
professional blasphemy, that a lot of our cataloging practices are really making
the problem worse… the precise problem that they’re supposed to address. [PID
34

153

Another respondent recognized that inconsistencies and errors were born out of more
complex reasons, and over a long period of time:
The thing is that before, we’ve been spending all this time building this structured
metadata but it was really in the card catalog and first generation web OPAC this
metadata was used descriptively. It was used to describe an item once you’d
found it. It wasn’t really used to filter or in search and retrieval and as a result
you were not looking at things sorted together by that metadata element and
therefore metadata coding errors did not pop up the way they do when you cluster
things together by a given marc field. [PID 43]
Libraries in consortiums face a unique set of challenges; marrying different cataloging
practices to present a unified catalog display. As one respondent from a public library
consortium said, “I believe that there is more visibility of the errors, lack of authority
control, lack of cataloging standards within a consortia environment within a faceted
catalog - we did a lot of clean up after launching our first faceted catalog” [PID 40].
While most respondents who mentioned metadata problems also mentioned past or
proposed cleanup projects, there is often a limit to how much time and effort can be
devoted to this as one academic library respondent explained:
There is a lot of metadata which is theoretically present in standard marc, but
which, after revealing through facets, is found to be poorly maintained and
inconsistent. In some cases this leads to cleanup efforts, but more cleanup efforts
are deemed infeasible and we need to make UI sacrifices. [PID 32]
As well as general metadata cleanup, some mentioned the inclusion of additional RDA
and MARC fields. Three respondents, one from a public library and two from an
academic library, noted that they provided new RDA 33X fields to reprogram format
facets. Another academic library respondent revealed that their library now included
additional MARC subfields “in the 650 [Topic] and 655 [Genre] for further delineation”
[PID 3]. Two respondents, one from a public library and one from an academic library,

154

also mentioned how much of their metadata comes from outside vendors. For the public
library, this meant being extra vigilant about metadata standardization. For the academic
library, it meant relaxing the cataloging reigns a little:
Because so much of the data that our end users interact with (for e-resources)
comes from vendor-supplied and controlled data, we have lowered our standards
for e-resource metadata. So long as it's good enough for users to find resources,
the data is “fine”, this is not a bad thing. [PID 23]
5.7 User Response and Feedback
Study participants were asked how library users had responded to the facet-based catalog
in general, and to facets in particular. Though this study was not directly concerned with
facet usage or user experience with facets, how libraries and library staff collected and
used that information was of interest.
Survey comments were analyzed for positive and negative statements regarding user
response to facets. Overall, respondents reported that users responded well to facets
although some recounted reservations. Table 5.3 shows the breakdown of positive and
negative comments by library type and Table 5.4 shows comments by system type.

Overall, positive comments outweighed negative ones by roughly 2:1. In several cases,
respondents recorded both positive and negative experiences where facets were
welcomed by certain user groups, or for certain information seeking scenarios, but were
less helpful for others:
Regarding facets, how users perceive them depends on how they've approached
the discovery layer. Known item print resource search? The discovery layer is an
unwanted firehose of information. Looking for items of any format on a particular
topic? The discovery layer is well received. [PID 23]
[Facets are] Popular with expert users. Not used by basic users. [PID 22]
Some users are confused and ignore it. Others use it all the time. Depends on the
user and his/her need at the time. [PID 26]
Where positive user experiences were reported, survey respondents also offered thoughts
as to why. PID 25 remarked, “They like [facets]! It’s a lot easier, seemingly, for users
than before. They have one stop shopping for materials” and PID 18 felt that
undergraduates liked facets because of familiarity: “because they are used to seeing them
in some popular websites (Newegg, Best Buy, etc.).” Explanations for discomfort were
also provided, and ranged from those mentioned previously such as facets making a
simple known item search more complex, to user resistance towards changes to the
traditional catalog.

156

PID 44’s experience in an academic library might shed some light on why user
experience has not always been as positive as expected:
We really need to do a lot of library instruction to our students and our faculty in
how best to use the search tools and how to configure your search query using the
features of Summon... So that problem becomes that you have to do a lot of
teaching for using Summon and for first and second year students it may be a
little bit too much, you want to keep it simple. But if you’re doing more advanced
research at the higher levels… junior, senior those school levels, it may be useful
to a more serious searcher and then they take to it and discover it on their own.
So it’s a mixed bag of things.
The idea that facets are more useful to advanced researchers or for certain types of
information behavior (e.g. broader, open-ended, more complex queries) was discussed by
several study participants. One of whom, PID 42, reported that “most users have been
very receptive to facets but they do not want them to get in the way of doing a simple
search for a title or author”. This is also seen in the literature reports of formal user
studies where open-ended tasks have elicited greater facet usage (e.g. Nichols et.al, 2014;
Hanrath & Kottman, 2015.)
The other important point raised by PID 44 was catalog instruction. Despite the
prevalence of facets in online environments, several researchers have reported on the
importance of user training for effective facet use (e.g. Asher et al., 2013; Kules & Capra,
2012; Nichols et. al, 2014). Although this flies in the face of much of the early
assumption that facet-based catalogs would be familiar and intuitive, training or
instruction sessions are desirable as they allow library staff the opportunity to explain
catalog features, functionality and search strategies. It is in this kind of environment that
library staff will sometimes see “a light bulb go on over a person's head” [PID 43].

157

User experience with open source catalogs was reported as less successful than with
commercial catalogs (see Table 5.4). While this warrants more detailed investigation, it
seems unlikely that this is because the open source catalogs in this study are somehow
inferior to their commercial counterparts. It is possible that libraries with open source
products may have had higher expectations for the transformative properties of facetbased catalogs. Three of the six negative comments from those with open source products
concerned lower than anticipated facet usage.
Several survey respondents noted that facets were not used as much as initially hoped or
expected. During his interview, PID 9, whose library operates a VuFind catalog, talked
about facet usage in a little more depth:
Most users don’t see or use the facets. This is old data, but last time [we] looked
at it there was something like 6% of user sessions ever touched a facet. We do see
that a much more common behavior is refining the search in the search box.
Adding words, usually, which in a discovery system is a little bit counter-intuitive
as that tends to give you more results, not less. But that’s what people tend to do.
PID 16 explained that prior to launching their Blacklight catalog, the library did some
user testing of the facets in their Summon tool.
The evidence we found tended to suggest that people liked the search but
instinctively they didn’t really think about using the facets. It was a bit like the
Google experience… if they couldn’t find anything using the search, they’d just
go back and search again. They wouldn’t try and narrow it down.
Others noted that they were not really sure how often patrons were using facets. A small
number mentioned in the surveys, or during interviews, that usage statistics were
passively collected by the system but had not been analyzed or acted on by library staff,
while others said that usage statistics and user studies data had not been collected at all.
We haven’t done any detailed usage studies to figure out how often they’re using
the facets but...it’s probably a comparatively small proportion of the time that
they bother. [PID 15]

158

PID 27 noted that prior to switching to a Primo catalog, his library had operated a
WorldCat Local catalog and had been impressed with the regular usage statistics reported
by OCLC:
We don’t get that same data from Primo, or at least not yet. It’s an enhancement,
a requested enhancement, for them. So we don’t really know for sure, in a
quantitative perspective, how much the facets are being used. [PID 27]
PID 16 remarked that his library launched their catalog with the default settings
expecting to make changes based on user feedback but, “haven’t had that much feedback
to suggest what changes there ought to be.” This is reminiscent of the experience
reported by Thompson et al. (2013) who found they needed to establish targeted focus
groups and usability tests in order to get feedback.
Even where participants knew, or suspected, that facets were being underused, they were
generally at a loss as to how to remedy that. Again, PID 9, who does have usage data to
demonstrate low usage, explains:
We haven’t yet delved into the whys behind [why facets are not heavily used]…
whether its design, that they’re not visible, not understandable as things that
would actually help you….. I don’t know what would make them more findable or
usable from the users’ perspective. That clearly needs more research from our
side because we haven’t done a lot to improve the interface presentation.
5.8 Summary
Participant involvement with facet-based catalogs spans a gamut of different
responsibilities and tasks from selecting the catalog, through choosing facets and user
testing. While some responsibilities are more likely to fall on those in particular job roles
(e.g. metadata evaluation – collection support; technical development – IT/systems; user
instruction – user services), all participants indicated that they were involved in multiple

159

processes, with testing and evaluating the catalog being selected almost 90% of
participants.
Looking at the factors contributing to catalog purchase or development, we can see areas
of commonality and difference between different types of libraries and different catalog
systems. While cost was a factor for almost 50% of participants overall, it was more
likely to be selected by participants with open source catalogs than with commercial ones
(58% versus 42%). Similarly, the existence of IT and technical teams was more than
twice as likely to be selected by participants with open source catalogs as those with
commercial products. Public libraries were more likely to purchase within a consortium
than academic libraries and were less likely to take into account positive user feedback
when selecting their catalog.
Facets themselves were a highly anticipated feature of new catalogs, with most
participants reporting that facets were viewed as either the most, or equal most, important
feature. This enthusiasm echoes that seen in the literature where facets are presented as
something of a game changer for library catalogs and an important mechanism for
improving user experience. It is interesting, then, to compare the eagerness with which
libraries approached facets with the reaction from catalog users. While the majority of
observations were recorded as positive, a number of participants recorded patron
discomfort or lack of use. Participants who felt that facets were not used as much as
initially expected admitted that little had been done to find out why, or to ascertain what
would increase usage.
When choosing facets, perceived usefulness was the paramount consideration for
participants, and was also the primary concern when choosing facet sequence. Other user-

160

focused considerations also ranked highly such as interface design concerns, and user
feedback and usability testing. This focus on users shows an alignment with, if not an
awareness of, a principal concern of facet theory. Recommendations from LIS facet
theory itself was the only variable that no participant indicated had been a mandatory
consideration. Seventeen participants indicated it was very or moderately important, a
surprisingly high number considering how few had mentioned facet theory or facet
theorists as informing their own understandings of facets. It seems likely that participants
here were interpreting “LIS facet theory” in a much wider way, perhaps encompassing
any LIS literature relating to facets or facet-based catalogs.
The availability of pre-existing metadata was listed as a top consideration by many when
selecting facets, and certainly the concern that facets are “low-hanging fruit” has been
readily discussed in the literature (La Barre, 2007; Hearst & Stoica, 2009). The
relationship between cataloging practices and facet-based catalogs was explored by some
participants with a number of participants reporting that the introduction of facets had
exposed cataloging errors and inconsistencies. Encouragingly, several participants noted
that facets had positive effects on cataloging practices from the addition of new metadata
fields to provide new or improved facets to a change in cataloging focus from a librariancentered perspective to a user-focused one.

Chapter 6. Discussion

This chapter explores some of the key themes which emerged from the research, and
discusses them in more detail within the context of the existing literature: individual
beliefs and behaviors, implementation practice, cataloging practice, and staff reaction to
facet-based catalogs.
6.1 Individual Beliefs and Behaviors
6.1.1 Perceptions of Facets and Facet-based Catalogs
Overall, study participants displayed a fairly sophisticated view of facets, and the useful
and complementary views held by individuals in different professional roles supports the
recommendation of Weiner (2003) to involve multiple stakeholders in the
implementation process. The two prevailing definitions of facets from participants were:
1) as an attribute or characteristic of an entity, and 2) as a filter or limiting tool. The
second viewpoint, where facets and filters are near synonyms, is commonly seen in
discussions in information architecture and web design fields, where faceted navigation is
often viewed as the application of multiple filters (e.g. Whitenton, 2014).
The emphasis on facets being an interface search tool was commonly expressed by
participants working in user services roles. In their professional position they are much
more likely to interact with facets on the catalog interface compared to collection support
and IT/systems staff who, due to their work with cataloging records and other metadata,
spend more time with different parts of the ILS, and may see facets differently. While
approximately half of all collection support participants did make reference to facets as
limits or filters, the same number referred to facets in terms of being attributes common

162

to a set of resources or information objects, or “individual pieces of access points that
have been broken down into logical parts” [PID 2]. While this view is common to IA and
web design, it is also the prevailing view from LIS classification, cataloging and indexing
researchers and practitioners (La Barre, 2007; Hudon, 2007; Hedden 2010).
Participants in all roles saw facets as an important tool for the modern library catalog.
That information seekers favor a single search box and like to perform keyword
searching has been frequently noted in the literature (Makri et al, 2007, Connaway et al,
2011; Nagy, 2011; Asher, Duke & Wilson, 2013), and participants in this study
recognized that traditional library catalogs have not been a good fit for user search
behavior. Facets were seen as critical for managing the very large results sets that new
library tools produce.
The enthusiasm of participants for facets as important post search refinement tools is
mirrored by other LIS practitioners and researchers as well as information architects and
web designers (e.g. Antelman, 2006; Tam, Cox & Bussey, 2009; Denholm et al., 2009;
Russell-Rose & Tate, 2013; Holst, 2015). Several participants also noted that facets
provided benefits for information literacy skills. Facets were seen as a way to help users
think about related and interrelated terms, expand relevant vocabulary terms, provide an
overview of the domain, and pivot searches in new directions. It is not clear if these are
“real”, measurable, benefits of facets that participants have observed at their libraries, or
expectations which they hope can be realized. If true, it would be further support to the
argument that cataloging remains extremely important to information discovery
(CannCasiciato 2010; Kirkland, 2013; Gross, Taylor & Joudrey, 2015; Borie, MacDonald
& Sze, 2015).

163

There were some divergent opinions about just how transformative the facet-based
catalog could be. While one participant claimed that facet-based catalogs do “not require
an understanding of the theories of searching to get successful results” [PID 47], another
stated that facets “can’t compensate for a poor search” [PID 34]. Despite these
differences, participants were agreed on the most important attributes of a facet-based
catalog: ease of use, a user-friendly interface, and clear and recognizable labeling. On the
last point, several participants noted that the use of “library jargon” in particular should
be limited.
The difficulties and disadvantages for patrons using jargon-heavy library catalogs has
been well documented (e.g. Emanuel, 2011; Majors, 2012; Thompson et al., 2013;
Nelson & Turney, 2015). While no one in this study specifically compared the language
of library catalogs with commercial sites, Nelson & Turney (2015) have recommended
that libraries could benefit from looking at commercial websites to get idea about how to
use more intuitive and user-friendly facet labels and general interface language. Using
terminology that matches user expectations is also strongly advised in facet analysis and
taxonomy construction (Vickery, 1960; Ranganathan, 1967; Hedden, 2010; Young &
Mandelstam, 2013).
Other specific functionality that research participants either admired or wished for
included: stackable facets and the ability to add multiple values from a single facet,
removing facets without restarting a search, the ability to exclude facets and facet values
as well as include them, and using sliders and other different facet displays. These
functionalities are seen in many of the more sophisticated offerings on commercial

164

websites and are recommended practices by IA and web design experts (Ruusell-Rose &
Tate, 2013; Holst, 2015).
6.1.2 Facet Education and Sources of Information
Participants in this study recalled a variety of places where they had first learned about
facets, and the majority of these can be considered as taking place within a LIS
environment. However, seven survey respondents, including four of 10 IT/systems
participants noted that they first learned about facets through their implementation on
commercial websites. One IT/systems participant explained during his interview that he
had found the ecommerce example of facets to be useful when explaining to colleagues
the purpose and usefulness of a facet-based library catalog. That this particular
participant [PID 14] used the example of online wine shopping was especially intriguing
as his institution has been responsible for the development and maintenance of a
comprehensive and extensively used faceted thesaurus. However, this participant made
no mention of this thesaurus having informed either his own perceptions of facets, or
affecting library staff attitudes to facet-based catalogs.
It is possible that the relationship between faceted taxonomies and facet-based catalogs
may not always be immediately evident, especially to those who do not work in
cataloging roles. Five of the seven participants who reported first learning about facets in
a LIS graduate program worked in collection support positions, with three specifically
mentioning cataloging and classification courses. Jourdrey and McGinnis (2014) have
reported that certain types of information organization courses such as thesaurus
construction, indexing and subject cataloging are decreasing in availability, while other

165

courses such as general metadata courses are increasing. This may influence the context
in which future professionals are introduced to facets.
Several other survey respondents noted that facets were not new to LIS, and that facets
were “a new term for a traditional methodology” [PID 42]. For many participants
however, their first recollected experience of facets came with the emergence of facetbased catalogs, and they either heard about new implementations in professional
literature or at conferences, or facet-based catalogs were introduced at libraries or
institutions where they worked or studied.
The origins of facets for many participants are somewhat complicated and intertwined.
Several noted that while the introduction of facet-based catalogs solidified the concept,
and even the term “facet” for them, facets were not wholly unfamiliar. The functionality
of facets had been observed on commercial websites, and the idea of describing
information objects by their constituent parts or creating multiple “access points” to
information is a familiar concept in LIS.
When looking for information about facets, study participants indicated that they would
turn almost exclusively to the LIS field. The most common sources were LIS literature
(books, journals, and the work of specific LIS or IS researchers), LIS events
(conferences, webinars, and training sessions), library colleagues, and listervs (vendor
specific and general). Sources mentioned by study participants align with previous
research that shows discussion boards, journals, conferences, training etc. are preferred
over blogs and social media as sources for professional development (e.g. Park, 2010;
Terrill, 2014). Survey respondents in collection support roles appeared more likely than
their colleagues to seek out information about facets, with 18 of 20 providing at least one

166

information source, compared to 7 of 10 respondents in IT/systems roles and 5 of 10 in
user services.
The strong focus on colleagues as an information source, mentioned by 11 participants,
was interesting. It is possible that colleagues assist with some of the troubleshooting
aspects of facets and facet-based catalogs implementation. But it may also be that
colleagues are providing a useful source of professional development, especially as
respondents indicated that they tended to seek out colleagues in different departments.
There was general agreement that certain facets were the most useful to catalog users:
format, subject/topic, publication date, location/branch, author, and availability.
However, there were interesting differences observed between survey respondents when
job role and type of library were taken into account, which suggests that professional
background and experience, as well as user populations, may influence opinions. User
services and public library respondents placed a particularly high value on format and
branch/building facets, while all public library participants ranked availability as either
mandatory or very important. Several study participants, in both surveys and interviews
mentioned the usefulness of facets which could help a user “walk away with something
that day” [PID 34].
A subject/topic facet was considered mandatory by 94% (N=16) of collection support
respondents and 90% of those in IT/systems (N=9) but just 75% (N=6) of those working
in user services roles. This may suggest that how subject/topic facets are currently
implemented is not of optimum use for library patrons search queries and search
strategies. Collection support and user services survey respondents judged person, time
period and geographic location to be more useful than their colleagues in IT/systems. It is

167

possible that the latter may not share the same understanding as their colleagues as to
what those facets are and how they would be useful to patrons.
6.2. Implementation Practice
Over the last ten years, facet-based catalogs have been enthusiastically purchased and
developed by a range of libraries, looking to improve the problems of the traditional
OPAC and provide users with a retrieval system that matches their expectations and
delivers satisfactory results.
For participants in this research study, facets were a motivating factor in selecting a
catalog product. Seventy-three percent, or 30, of the respondents who answered this
survey question, indicated that facets were at least the equal most important or anticipated
feature of the new catalog. The appeal of facets as a catalog feature was their “recalling
everything and narrowing it down approach” [PID 9] that takes “fewer cognitive
resources than configuring a search upfront” [PID 34].
The reported factors which contributed to catalog selection mirror those found in the
literature, though it is notable that no single factor was reported as a contribution by more
than 48% (N=19) of respondents. This shows that factors are implementation specific and
context dependent. Cost was the most commonly selected factor overall, at 48% of all
participants (N=19), but was as high as 58% for survey respondents with open source
catalogs (N=7). The unclear nature of the term “cost” makes any comparison
problematic. While some participants expressed that fiscal considerations directly
impacted their choice of commercial catalog, open source catalogs may have their own
“cost” in terms of employing or training a developer etc. Within the literature, cost has
been noted as a factor which can limit choices from the outset, even removing certain

168

products from consideration because of their high price-tag (Butler & Thompson, 2013;
Thompson, Obrig & Abate, 2013; Chickering & Yang, 2014).
Performance against other systems is a common evaluative feature in the literature, and
can involve creating product checklists, engaging in a number of vendor demonstrations,
evaluating instances at other libraries, and sending reference questions to vendors
(Gallaway & Hines, 2012; Vaughan, 2012; Ellero, 2013; Deodato, 2015). Fifty percent
(N=13) of participants with commercial systems indicated that they measured
performance against other catalogs, although these evaluations were not always as
rigorous as outlined in the literature.
For early adopters, and those looking at open source systems, there were likely not as
many options for comparative evaluation. For open source respondents, recommendation
from other libraries was fairly high at 42% (N=5) compared to 23% (N=6) of those with
commercial catalogs. IT support was also an important factor for open source libraries
with 67% (N=8) of respondents selecting this compared to 31% (N=8) of those with
commercial catalogs. Of course, IT staff are critical for open source systems, and
developer preference may take precedence other factors, but the literature shows that it
can be very important for commercial systems too. Even with a vendor, there can be
integration issues at launch that in-house IT staff can help resolve.
Vendor support was selected by 25% (N=10) of respondents. Looking at just libraries
with commercial catalogs, 39% (N=5) of public libraries, and 18% (N=2) of academic
libraries selected this factor. The difference here is interesting, and not immediately clear.
It may be that academic libraries feel able to push more to in-house IT staff or it may be a
reflection of differences in culture. The low figures are interesting because for

169

commercial catalogs, vendor support can often be critical, and required even for small
changes. Thompson, Obrig & Abate (2013) show that vendor support can be needed to
change facet names, suppress facets, and find missing content. Of course, the level of
vendor support required may not be known at the outset, and it is possible, even probable,
that promises of vendor support at the purchasing stage are universally good, and not
seen as a differentiating feature.
Previous research has shown that libraries may purchase systems based on familiarity
(e.g. Butler & Thompson, 2013) and a number of participants in this study also made
similar allusions. PID 14 said his library chose the product offered by their ILS provider
for “better integration” while PID 34 made a similar choice because they already have
“the capacity to support [the catalog’s technology].” PID 16’s library chose Blacklight
for their catalog interface because they had used it successfully for other projects.
Study participants were involved in a range of implementation processes. Creating
ownership and involving all stakeholders is something that has been highlighted by
research both specific to LIS and about system and technology adoption in general (e.g.
Weiner, 2003; Elwell, 2013; Somerville & Antelmam, 2013), and we have seen in the
findings of this research, and in the discussion above, that there may be differences in
how different LIS professionals perceive facets, and which facets they think are
important. As might be expected, study participants in administrative roles indicated that
they were involved in the most processes of any group. Collection support participants
were involved in less parts than those in IT/systems and user services, the implications of
which will be discussed further in the following section. The most common form of

170

involvement for survey respondents overall, was testing and evaluating the catalog,
which 88% of all participants indicated they helped with.
In the literature describing facet-based catalog implementation and usability studies, there
is very little which expressly discusses how facets for the catalog are selected and
deployed. What user studies and usability tests do show is that a decade after
implementation in library catalogs, and despite their continued prominence on
ecommerce sites, library users are still having difficulties with facets.
A central tenet of facet-based systems, both in LIS and IA and web design, is that facets
should be user focused (e.g. La Barre, 2006; Morville & Rosenfeld, 2006; Hedden, 2010;
Lau, 2016). Participants in this study explicitly stated that user needs were critical factors
in decision making when it came to catalog implementation and the selection of facets.
Perceived usefulness to patrons was the top ranked factor when survey respondents were
asked what had influenced facet selection, and no one said it was either unimportant or
not considered. Participants gave examples of what they considered to be useful or userfriendly facets, including the addition of a corporate author facet to prevent terms like
“Hoopla” and “OverDrive” appearing alongside personal author names, and location and
format facets, which several participants mentioned were important for users who wanted
immediate access to materials.
Usefulness to patrons was also the overwhelming response when survey respondents
were asked what determined facet sequence within the catalog. Several indicated that the
most frequently used facets (either substantiated through transaction logs and user
questions, or perceived as being most used) were given more prominent positions at the
top of the facet list. Despite their efforts, participants reported that user reception to facets

171

was mixed. While most suggested that overall reaction was positive, some were
disappointed to report that facets were not used as often as they hoped, or remained
confusing for some users. This is also reflected in the literature. Most user studies report
that facet-based catalogs are preferred over their traditional counterparts and facets are a
valued feature (e.g. Cox & Bussey, 2009; Denton & Coysh, 2011; Niu & Hemminger,
2015) but even as users praise them, they may be confused about how facets work or
when to apply them (e.g. Bauer, 2008c; Emanuel, 2011; Blumer, Hugi and Schneider,
2014; Cassidy et al., 2014).
While not expressly asked about in the study, the issue of customization was brought up
by a number of participants and is of importance in any discussion about facets in library
catalogs. “Flexibility is the key,” declared one reference librarian from a public library,
“the library needs to be able to change both how the facets are composed, and the way
they are presented” [PID 26]. Open source catalogs allow libraries full flexibility in facet
choice and presentation, although some software may offer a basic installation template
with a few common facets. For commercial catalogs, the degree of available
customization, and degree of local control, varies greatly between systems:
Not all faceted interfaces are created equal - we found our Polaris catalog to be
far less sophisticated in terms of ability to aggregate, flexibility in ranking, etc.
than our previous AquaBrowser implementation which admittedly we had
continually tweaked to provide the best possible experience. [PID 40]
While questions about customization and local control of facets will ideally form part of
the catalog selection process, issues may not arise until local content is loaded and more
stakeholders are involved in evaluating and testing:
In my experience with facets, they are most useful when customized after user
testing and evaluation. I know the underlying data structures and normalization

172

rules and still have difficulty sometimes finding what I know is there.
Customization is very important. [PID 23]
As mentioned above, libraries may need vendor assistance to add, remove, suppress or
rename facets, and some issues may not have a wholly satisfactory solution. Vendor
supplied facets caused some difficulties for participants in this study. PID 27 described
issues that his library had with their collection facet. This facet, which describes the
source of PrimoCentral content, was one that he viewed as “a silly facet”, “not terribly
useful,” and something that “people don’t understand.” However, despite this, the library
had not taken any action to suppress or even rename the facet. Another participant
remarked how their library was unable to create their own facets, and the vendor was
unresponsive to requests: “Our vendor's development of additional facets seems to have
ground to a halt. The fiction/nonfiction facet would be super-helpful in public libraries,
but pleas to add it have fallen on deaf ears” [PID 29].
It should be noted, that participants’ understandings about the amount of local control
afforded to them by vendors may not be reliable. Several survey respondents, especially
with Encore or Summon catalogs, indicated that their library had no control over choice
of facets or facet display. However, looking at their catalogs, differences were observed
in some instances between local implementations and the standard default settings.
Newer releases of Summon, at least since 2013, do offer some option for customization
including the ability to rearrange and relabel facets. (Janeczek, 2013). It is possible that
participants in this study were using older versions of the product which did not offer the
same customization. Alternatively, participants may be mistaken about the degree of
customization available, or their libraries may not be able, or willing, to make
modifications.

173

Issues in labeling and terminology are addressed in both IA and LIS literature about
facets (e.g. Vickery, 1960; Ranganathan, 1967; Hedden, 2010, Russell-Rose, 2013; Gau,
2016). Labeling and terminology issues arise in commercial systems but they are not
exclusive to them. As Nelson & Turney (2015) remark, libraries need to think more
seriously about how they make the search process more intuitive and effective. Facet
labels, and the content within facets, tend to follow traditional library naming
conventions and can be difficult for the casual, or non-expert, user to parse (Cassidy,
2014; Nelson & Turney, 2015; Niu & Hemminger, 2015; Hoover, 2016).
Looking at the catalogs of participants in this study, many libraries had continued the
jargon-laden naming conventions (e.g. “source”, “collection”, and “call number”). This is
despite the fact, as discussed above, that survey respondents mentioned that clear, userfriendly terminology was an important feature of facet-based catalogs. An additional
concern is that facets may not always be distinct. That is, their content may appear to
overlap, or they may be including content that should be split into multiple facets. Mutual
exclusivity is an important element in facet design (e.g. Aitchison, 1970; Hedden, 2010;
Broughton, 2011, Harpring, 2016). PID 27 noted that his library’s Primo catalog
contained two resource type facets, one locally generated and another handled separately,
centrally, by ExLibris. These two facets could not be merged at the time of the study,
meaning that depending on how a resource was acquired or cataloged it could appear
under one, or the other, facet.
While participants indicated that facet theory was the least likely factor to influence the
choice of facets, as discussed earlier they did have a fairly sophisticated understanding of
facets that is grounded in professional practice as well as their LIS education and

174

professional development. Participants appeared to have a view of facets that aligned
with both LIS and IA/web design understandings of facets: they recognized that facets
were different aspects of a set of information objects, and that, in a user interface, facets
should be user friendly, useful, and clearly displayed. They also recognized many of the
limitations of their own catalogs. However, while catalog users were their oft-stated top
priority, other factors appeared to constrain rather than complement a user-centered
approach. These include a reliance on existing metadata, system and software constraints,
vendor suggestions, cost, and time.
Where facets in library catalogs differ quite substantially from both facets on commercial
websites and facets in thesauri and smaller taxonomies, is the abundance of facets which
deal with Meta or contextual information (Niu & Hemminger, 2015). Examples of these
types of facet include format, location, and availability. Such facets are extremely
common in library catalogs and often placed at, or near the top, of the menu. Participants
cited these facets as ones considered to be extremely useful to patrons, and ones which
were used most often. While support for this can be seen in some of the log analysis
literature (e.g. Niu & Hemminger, 2010; Bauer & Peterson-Hart, 2012), one can question
whether facets are at the top of the menu because they are most often used, or most often
used because they are at the top of the menu. Usability studies have shown that catalog
users will most often rely on facets that can be seen without scrolling or expanding
(Cassidy et al., 2014).

175

6.3 Cataloging Practice
Good quality, consistent metadata was something that study participants noted as an
important attribute of facet based catalogs, and included making sure that in-house and
vendor data was appropriately integrated and applied. The promise to “better utilize
library data than traditional catalogues” (Schultz-Jones, et al. 2012) has been a highly
touted feature of facet-based catalogs , and usability tests have found that cataloging
choices can contribute to the success or failure of a catalog (Gallaway & Hines, 2012).
The availability of pre-existing metadata was a very important consideration for
participants when deciding what facets should be included in the catalog, with most
facets being automatically populated from the MARC record. Aside from questions about
the rigor and appropriateness of facets created in this fashion, data conversion and
migration is not always a seamless transition, and can often create headaches for systems,
instruction, and cataloging librarians alike.
Wynne & Hanscom (2011) surveyed cataloging staff about the impact of facet-based
catalogs on cataloging at their libraries and found responses fell into the following
themes: data maintenance and cleanup, workflow and policy decisions, system display
and indexing issues, staffing and economic considerations, and communication and
catalogers’ involvement. Many of these issues were also mentioned by participants in this
study. Several participants mentioned that the facet-based catalog had uncovered
inconsistencies and errors in their metadata. Participants were cognizant that facet-based
catalogs do not just highlight metadata omissions, but that the facets themselves rely on
clean, consistent cataloging data to be useful to catalog users:

176

When metadata is actively used as it is in facets it needs to be more consistently
structured than when it is used purely descriptively. [PID 43]
Some types of mistakes, such as the wrong format designation, can become far
more obvious to users, and such mistakes can impede the user's ability to find all
results matching a facet they select when refining their search results. [PID 29]
Most participants who mentioned metadata problems also mentioned past or proposed
cleanup projects, and the incorporation of additional RDA and MARC fields to populate
new or existing facets.
Libraries operating in consortiums and those whose catalogs included web-scale content
faced additional cataloging challenges. Most study participants only had to contend with
local metadata issues but participants in consortium environments had to contend with
“lack of authority control, lack of cataloging standards” [PID 40] across a number of
different member libraries. Two participants also mentioned issues that arose due to how
much of their metadata came from outside vendors. Libraries usually do not have
permission to edit this metadata and, although they can submit requests and suggestions
to the content provider, the most prudent course of action is sometimes to let things be:
Because so much of the data that our end users interact with (for e-resources)
comes from vendor-supplied and controlled data, we have lowered our standards
for e-resource metadata. So long as it's good enough for users to find resources,
the data is “fine.”[PID 23]
Other participants also stated that clean-up projects of local data, although desirable, were
not always feasible. One participant mentioned that while they sometimes work to rectify
problems through metadata improvement, at other times they decide to make UI
sacrifices instead. Such “sacrifices” might include collapsing facets so that “problem”
values are not immediately obvious or moving “problem” facets towards the bottom of
the screen.

177

Cataloging is important to information discovery (Canncasiciato, 2010; Kirkland, 2013;
Gross, Taylor & Joudrey, 2015), and a small number of participants spoke positively of
the impact that facet-based catalogs had on cataloging efforts. One participant mentioned
that facets were “improving the visibility of descriptive cataloging efforts” [PID 9] and
another said that catalogers at his library had an improved perception of their work.
Schultz-Jones (2012) notes that beyond clean-up and data maintenance, other issues may
require changes to established policies and procedures. Catalogers’ judgment has been
mentioned by a number of recent researchers (e.g. Snow, 2011; Shultz-Jones, 2012;
Hasenyager, 2015) and concerns the decisions that catalogers make while creating a
bibliographic record, as well as the education, training, and professional practice which
assist in their decision-making. Previous studies have shown that cataloging staff retain a
keen interest in professional development (Park et al, 2010; Terill, 2014) and this carries
over to this study where they listed a variety of professional sources and events where
they obtain information about facets.
A few participants indicated that changes to policies and the culture of cataloging were
occurring within their libraries, and resulted in “less focus on how a librarian wants to
use the catalog” [PID 42] and more focus on “the user and their needs”[PID 44].
Previous research has indicated that the perceived value of cataloging remains a problem
in some libraries (Boydsten & Leysten, 2014; Petrucciani, 2015). One survey respondent
in this study complained of “lax cataloging practices” [PID 10], while others suggested
that cataloging practices needed to change, with one digital services participant
explaining that current cataloging practices were causing, rather than alleviating, patron
discovery problems.

178

Catalogers have been reported to be reticent about facet-based catalogs, as they bring
about changes to existing practices as well as the adoption of new responsibilities and
skills (Tarulli & Spiteri, 2012). Negative sentiment towards new technologies and
processes is not uncommon and will be discussed in more detail in the following section.
Catalogers’ participation in the implementation process is an important consideration.
Wynne & Hanscom (2011) found that the involvement of catalogers in the facet-catalog
implementation process was highly variable with some catalogers reporting they had
assisted with multiple parts of the implementation process and others saying they had no
involvement at all. For this study, collection support respondents, like others, tended to
be involved in multiple parts of the catalog implementation process. However, they were
less likely than the IT/systems and user services survey respondents to test and evaluate
the catalog, facilitate user testing, deliver user instruction and choose facets. While they
are more likely than their colleagues to assist with metadata evaluation, there is a very
strong case to be made for increasing the participation of catalogers in facet selection and
catalog evaluation. Not only do catalogers offer valuable insight about metadata and
cataloging practices, the relative importance of various data fields and relationships
between different MARC data fields, their increased participation in the implementation
process is likely to help improve their perception of facet-based catalogs.
6.4 Staff Response to Facet-based Catalogs
In 2006, when the first of the new facet-based catalogs and discovery systems began
emerging on the scene, the professional buzz was optimistic. These systems would solve
many of the age-old difficulties of search, appeal to millennials who yearned for a
Google-style simple search box, provide improved relevancy rankings, and give better

179

access to controlled vocabularies and library-created metadata. However, with
implementation came the realization that facet-based catalogs have not solved search and,
in some cases, they may have just changed the nature of the problem. As such, one of the
themes that emerged from this research was that staff response to facet-based catalogs
has not been unanimously positive.
A majority of study participants noted that facets were more useful for certain types of
information seeking behavior. Facets were viewed as critical components of new
catalogs; an essential tool for filtering, narrowing or limiting initial keyword searches.
However, for known-item searches, or searches where precision is desired over recall,
facets, and facet-based catalogs in general, were perceived to be less helpful. These views
are consistent with those in the published literature, and with the findings of many
usability studies (e.g. Antelman et al., 2006; Breeding, 2012; Hessel & Fransen, 2012;
Breeding 2015; Hanrath & Kottman, 2015; Niu & Hemminger, 2015).
Notwithstanding this expected, and accepted, assessment, multiple study participants
reported library staff who were reluctant, or in a few cases even refusing, to use the new
catalog at all. Staff attitudes towards facet-based catalogs can have wide ranging and long
lasting effects on the preferences and habits of other library users. Researchers have
found that staff who do not like the new catalog may not teach or advocate for it (Petr &
Currie, 2014; Calarco et al., 2014; Allen, 2015; Ghaphery et al., 2016).
Breeding (2012), notes that where the traditional catalog is maintained in conjunction
with the facet-based catalog, staff may continue to use the old one. This was the case at
PID 14’s library when they first launched Primo on their Voyager ILS. Six months later,
they migrated to Alma and made a clean break with the old catalog, with PID 14, who

180

works in IT/systems, deciding they were “not going to be a Princeton and run a
discovery layer and the old catalog.”
For some, there is a fear that facet-based catalogs are helping to “de-professionalize” or
devalue libraries and library services. “It feels like we have lost the ability to search well,
and are being offered facets as an alternative, but it isn’t a better alternative” lamented
one study participant [PID 37], while another declared that some staff perceive that
“Boolean searching would be a more precise/scholarly way to get to the materials the
patron needs” [PID10].
Rose-Wiles & Hoffman (2013) reported a division between staff who embrace the tools
of the new catalog and those who lament the apparent abandonment of sophisticated
searching. In a survey of reference and instruction librarians, Buck and Mellinger (2011)
found 23% of participants viewed Summon as detrimental to students’ information
literacy skills, with the main criticisms being that Summon was promoting a concept of
“good enough” and was not encouraging users to learn basic search skills and strategies.
An opposing argument to this point comes in the form of the previously mentioned
information literacy benefits that some participants in this study afforded to facet-based
catalogs.
Reports from participants of dissatisfied colleagues matches reports in the existing
literature (Elwell, 2013, Kain, 2014). While, there were some legitimate teething troubles
for new catalogs at participants’ libraries, there was agreement that “most of the sticking
points…were just things that operated differently and they needed to get used to that”
[PID 34]. The introduction of new technologies or processes is disruptive and requires
both a technical and organization adaption (Leonard-Barton, 1988; Lopata, 1993).

181

Researchers have identified a variety factors which contribute to the acceptance of, or
resistance to, library innovations, including: participation in decision-making and
implementation, interest and experience with technology, personality, habits and fear of
change, perceived threats to job security or job status, presence of champions or changeagents, gender and age, size and structure of the organization, and perceived availability
of training and skills enhancement (Aharony & Prebor, 2015; Leonard-Barton, 1988;
Lopata, 1993; Ostrow, 1998; Weiner, 2003).
Everett Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory is one way to understand the resistance to
facet-based catalogs reported by study participants. In his theory, innovations have five
attributes that affect the adoption process: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity,
trialability and observability. Therefore, when staff see facet-based catalogs as inferior to
their predecessors, devaluing information literacy skills, and being difficult to learn, they
resist adoption.
PID 43, an IT/systems librarian at a large academic library, offered substantial reflection
on why he believed some staff at his institution found the transition to a new catalog so
difficult: “Anytime someone has spent a lot of time in learning how to manipulate a
system, over time they internalize the complexity of that, and what they do – they attribute
their ability as being as an attribute of the system.” Staff devalue their own skills, and the
time spent learning sophisticated search techniques as well as catalog shortcuts and
workarounds. Instead they come to think of a system - in this case, the traditional catalog
- as being, if not easy to use, then at least dependable and easy to understand.
Diffusion of innovation theory also identifies and characterizes adopter categories of
individuals within a social system: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late

182

majority, and laggards. Early adopters are the category of individuals that contains the
“opinion leaders” who hasten or stall the diffusion of an innovation. Rabina & Walczyk
(2007) have found that librarians may be overrepresented in the early adopter, and
underrepresented in the early majority, categories, slowing down the diffusion of
innovations within libraries.
Certainly many of the participants in this study would fall into the early adopter category.
They were mostly onboard with the idea that the traditional OPAC had come to the end
of its design-life and that facet-based catalogs were critical tools for search success.
Participants were frequently involved in choosing, or building, the system, meeting with
vendors, and testing and evaluating the catalog. They were part of implementation teams
and committees, and they sometimes did not see the problems that their colleagues saw:
Most of the problem reports about facets come from staff who see a problem and
often, you know, it’s not really that much of a problem. [PID 27]
Those of us who manage the interfaces just sort of sigh and let them get on with it.
[PID 9]
All the grief we got was from staff. Because, that’s normal. [PID 14]
By and large, participants in this research study were well involved in catalog
implementation. Forty-three survey respondents indicated at least one task that they
assisted with Almost 50% (N=21) participated in choosing the catalog, nearly 90%
(N=38) helped to test and evaluate the catalog, and 70% (N=30) helped with the choice
of facets. However, this study explicitly sought participants with such involvement, and
they may not represent the experience of the majority of their colleagues.
While participants in this study indicated that resistance had largely abated with time,
several researchers have made recommendations for how to encourage the diffusion of

183

innovation and lessen resistance. These include: providing a clear vision, being a model
for accepting and incorporating change, involving all stakeholders, allowing time to
adjust, maintaining a sense of humor, practicing effective communication, allowing more
time than planned, and being willing to make changes and reverse decisions (Lopata,
1993; Weiner, 2003;Calhoun, 2006; Ellern, 2011).
The comprehensive case studies of implementation described by Vaughan (2012) and
Deodato (2015) both stress the importance of educating stakeholders. They also provide
recommendations for tools to communicate this information and knowledge, including
the creation of internal blogs, libguides and bibliographies (Vaughan, 2012; Deodato,
2015). The involvement of staff from a range of different departments and roles also
helps to foster understanding and appreciation of different areas of expertise as well as
eliminate the “us” and “them” mindset that can develop. One systems participant [PID
38] felt that, “from a data systems standpoint, not enough public services or circulation
staff have a sufficient understanding of how the facets function.” While this may be a true
statement for his workplace, Ghaphery et al. (2016) found that systems and teaching
librarians were actually much more aligned than either group would have previously
assumed. Instigating discussions between the two departments also helped to move away
from the idea that systems librarians are “gatekeepers” of the catalog and form a more
inclusive vision where librarians of all stripes are “partners in success” (Gayhart, 2013;
Ghaphery et al, 2016).

Chapter 7. Summary & Conclusions
This was an exploratory research study which aimed to discover more about the
behaviors, beliefs, policies and practices which govern the implementation of facet-based
catalogs in libraries. This chapter summarizes the findings presented in chapters 4 and 5
in specific reference to the research questions. In addition, implications of the research
are briefly discussed: for libraries, LIS education and LIS researchers.
7.1 Research Question 1: Individual Beliefs and Behaviors
Research question one asked, how are facets interpreted by librarians and library staff
members involved in developing and implementing facet-based catalogs? The findings of
this study related to this question are summarized below.
Participants tended to define facets in one of two ways: as a characteristic or attribute of
an information object, or as a catalog feature; a function synonymous with filtering,
refining or sorting. While the former definition has clear echoes to LIS literature, the
second definition was the primary understanding for many participants, including the
majority of user services participants. Even collection support participants, a group
largely dominated by cataloging staff, were evenly split between the dual identities of
facets as a function or an attribute, a dichotomy bridged by the few participants who
recognized that the term has become acceptable for both purposes.
By an overwhelming majority, participants viewed the role of facets in the search and
discovery process as being concerned with filtering, narrowing and refining; making
large results sets more manageable by weeding out the imprecise and non-applicable.
Facets are seen as excellent complements to the trend for Google-like interfaces and

185

keyword searches, but not so useful for precision or known item searches. A small
number of participants also mentioned secondary benefits of facets beyond their filtering
capability. These included: providing an overview of the collection or subject area,
encouraging users to think about a subject in new ways, and helping them to pivot a
search.
While outwardly surprising that so many participants did not readily associate “facet”
with the traditional LIS understanding as an attribute of an information object, this makes
more sense when viewed in conjunction with how participants have come to hold their
beliefs. For although the majority of participants first learned about facets within a LIS
environment, it was in the context of the emergence of facet-based catalogs; through
vendor demonstrations, reading OPAC journal articles, attending training sessions, seeing
other library catalogs etc. Seven participants explicitly mentioned learning about facets in
LIS graduate school, the same number who reported learning about them from
ecommerce sites. A small number of participants asserted that facets were not new to the
LIS field but were mostly unclear of their origins.
Only one participant explicitly mentioned learning about facets through the works of
Ranganathan, Vickery and others associated with facet analysis and traditional facet
theory. Another participant mentioned Ranganathan as a source they would consult to
find out more about facets, but these were the only two participants to mention the man
most commonly and prominently associated with facet theory and faceted classifications.
Again, if looking for information about facets, participants would almost exclusively stay
within the LIS field. Colleagues were a common source of information, as were product
vendors and software communities. Participants would consult formal and informal

186

sources; conferences, journal articles and webinars, but also listservs, blogs and social
media.
We can surmise that participants’ beliefs and interpretations of facets are heavily
influenced by their relatively recent implementation as a feature within library catalogs,
but they also align with many of the central principles of creating faceted taxonomies.
Participants were agreed that facet-based catalogs must be user-friendly and easy to use.
Terminology and facet labels should be familiar to the user, rather than “library jargon”.
User-friendliness was not only confined to interface design choices, it permeated
participants’ views on the important attributes of facets themselves. Participants wanted
facets that catalog users could easily manipulate: facets that can easily be added,
removed, stacked, and rearranged. Facets should make sense to the user, and metadata
should be accurate, consistent, of good quality, and applied systematically enough to be
useful.
When participants were asked about the usefulness of particular facets, a small group
emerged above the rest: format, subject/topic, publication date, location (branch), author,
availability (online/on shelf). These facets are common to most catalogs and participants
felt strongly that they were the facets most useful to, and most heavily used by, patrons.
Aside from subject/topic, these facets were concerned with expressions of the
information object rather than the knowledge contained within. Interestingly, subject
related facets - person, time period and geographic location were judged at least
moderately useful by the majority of participants, including all user services participants.
These facets are not common to all catalogs but may be worth further investigation by
libraries.

187

Over half of all participants also supplied facets that they thought would be useful
additions to current catalogs. No single facet was mentioned more than a handful of times
but the following were all referred to by more than one participant: award winners, user
ratings, fiction/non-fiction, series, acquisition date/new at the library, and facets
formulated especially for children. Some of these ideas might best be incorporated into
other facets or in other parts of the catalog, and other suggestions, such as title, would be
difficult to incorporate in any meaningful way.
Overall, participants themselves spoke favorably about facets and facet-based catalogs.
However, they reported that reaction from their colleagues had been mixed, occasionally
even hostile. There were multiple reports of library staff refusing to use the new catalogs,
or preferring to use the old one. In some cases, this was explained as being due to
difficulties with facet-based catalogs: new features not yet fully implemented,
incongruent staff and patron displays etc. However, resistance often appeared to be as
much a cultural or organizational problem as a technology issue. Some staff were seen as
entrenched in their old habits and hesitant to try a new tool that required different search
behaviors. Participants reported that over time, most staff became accustomed to, if not
enthusiastic about, using the facet-based catalog but individual antagonism and
institution-wide diffidence to facet-based catalogs may have lasting repercussions for
their success within a library as well as the success of future innovations.
7.2 Research Question 2: Institutional Policies and Practices
Research question two asked, what individual and institutional beliefs, practices and
policies guide the implementation of facet-based catalogs in libraries? The findings of
this study related to this question are summarized below.

188

Study participants were very involved in processes related to acquiring, developing and
managing their library’s facet-based catalog. The majority of participants indicated they
were engaged in multiple tasks, e.g. facet selection and testing and evaluating the catalog,
but whether we can transfer this finding to the population of library staff as a whole is
unclear. It seems probable that the participants for this study represent some of the staff
most engaged with facets and facet-based catalogs and, as we saw in the discussion of
RQ1, other library staff appear to be somewhat distant or divorced from the process.
However, implementing facet-based catalogs is a collaborative effort which involves staff
from a range of different roles. While there was a large degree of overlap in roles and
responsibilities, certain patterns did emerge; user services participants were most likely to
facilitate user testing and user instruction, collection support staff were most likely to be
involved in metadata evaluation, and IT/systems participants were most likely to be
involved in technical development and testing.
It was surprising to note that collection support participants were the least likely of the
three to be involved with choosing facets. Eighty percent (N=8) of IT/systems
participants assisted in the choosing of facets as did 75% (N=6) of user services
participants but only 55% (N=10) of those who worked in collection support positions. It
may be oversimplification, but if we characterize the three groups as experts in users,
systems, and collection/content, we see that libraries may be missing valuable input from
those who know the metadata and descriptive cataloging best.
Approximately half of the participants were directly involved in selecting the catalog
itself, and more felt knowledgeable enough to talk about the contributing factors to
catalog choice. The most common factors overall were cost, performance against other

189

systems and the existence of IT and technical teams for support. Unsurprisingly, cost was
a more common factor for libraries with open source systems, but even for libraries with
commercial products it was an important consideration, sometimes delaying the
implementation of a catalog until necessary funds could be secured, being the difference
between two competing products, or encouraging libraries to pursue consortium
purchasing.
Public libraries were more likely than academic libraries to get their catalog through a
consortium purchase, and also less likely to consider positive user feedback when
choosing their product. Libraries with open source systems were more likely than those
with commercial systems to place importance on recommendations from other libraries
(42% to 23%) but were less likely to be influenced by performance against other systems
(33% versus 50%).
Libraries building open source catalogs were also some of the most excited about the
introduction of facets, though no participant said that facets were unimportant. While the
majority of participants reported that the introduction of the facet-based catalog had
reaped positive returns, some participants felt that facets had not lived up to their hype,
had not been as well-received by users as they had expected, or that users did not use
them as often as they should.
Muted user response to facets was a surprise to some participants since perceived
usefulness to patrons was a paramount consideration for almost all libraries when
selecting facets, as well as when choosing their sequence within the catalog. Perhaps in
conflict with this, however, the existence of pre-existing metadata also ranked as a very
important influence on facet selection. The dichotomy between creating facets which best

190

serve the user and facets which are simply born of available metadata has been well
established by researchers.
Other highly ranked factors in facet selection included, user feedback, interface design
issues, and system and software constraints. The latter was more of an issue for those
with commercial catalogs, some of which come with pre-installed facets that participants
found difficult, or impossible, to repress or rename. Other factors tended to be divisive;
what other libraries did, time, cost, and vendor suggestion were as important to as many
libraries as they were unimportant. Public libraries were less likely to take inspiration
from facets used by others and more likely to find time and vendor suggestion to be
important.
A number of participants noted that changes had been made to facets after their initial
implementation. Some of these changes were reasonably quick fixes for patron
satisfaction: renaming, reordering, splitting a bloated author facet in two (personal and
corporate) etc. Other additions and alterations resulted in changes to established
cataloging practices such as using new RDA and MARC fields to add new facets and
refine others. As facets showcase descriptive metadata as never before, libraries are
keenly aware that cataloging errors and inconsistencies are more visible and potentially
more problematic in their new catalogs. Some, mostly small scale, cleanup projects were
initiated, but libraries often found that extensive correction was not feasible.
A couple of participants offered thoughtful critiques of the evolving relationship between
cataloging and patron discovery and suggested that, as cataloging metadata was
conventionally used to describe an item rather than to help find it, traditional cataloging
practices could be a hindrance to patron discovery. Perhaps having similar experiences in

191

their own libraries, a small number of other participants mentioned that facets had
introduced a change in cataloging behavior, where focus had shifted from a librariancentered view of the catalog to a more user-centered approach.
7.3 Implications for Libraries
Facet-based catalogs have not provided a magical solution to the problems of OPAC
searching. Facets, alone, cannot solve problems of poor interface design, poor user
experience, and incomplete and inconsistent cataloging. What the introduction of facetbased catalogs has heralded, is a move away from librarian-centered search tools towards
user-centered search tools. However, this needs to be met with a commitment from
libraries to change some of their policies, procedures and workplace philosophy to match.
People do not always welcome change, and library staff are no exception. Resistance to
facet-based catalogs was widely reported by study participants, even where they,
themselves, were unequivocally enthusiastic. Reports ranged from dissatisfaction (e.g.
records display differently, search behaviors need to be adapted), to distrust (e.g. facetbased searching viewed as being less powerful than Boolean searching) to refusal to use
to even use the new catalog. While resistance to new technologies and processes is not
uncommon, administrators and project managers may wish to explore some of the many
recommendations in the diffusion of innovations literature, in order to ease transition. It
is important that library staff are onboard and involved with the switch to a facet-based
catalog, not least because it can have direct consequences for how facets, and the catalog,
are used by patrons.
Open dialog between library staff is important. Just as developers and IT/systems staff
can teach their colleagues a lot about the facet-based systems they develop and manage,

192

they can, in turn, learn a lot from those with a deep understanding of collections and
users. Many libraries do well to involve a range of staff and skillsets in their catalog
development and implementation teams. Keeping the wider library community - staff and
students - updated about new developments, roadblocks, and plans for the future may
also help to ease the transition between catalogs.
Libraries enjoy having some degree of local control over their catalog. Of course, the
highest degree of autonomy belongs to those who have developed their own catalogs, but
even those with commercial products can enjoy the feeling of participation, collaboration
and ownership. Participants spoke positively about being beta or test partners, as well as
having open and continuing dialog with vendors.
When selecting a catalog, libraries should look for a system that offers flexibility and
customization, in recognition that libraries, their collections, and their users, may be
markedly different from each other. Such customization may include the ability to
rename or reorder facets, to suppress facets which are not useful or applicable, and to add
facets which are locally important. Study participants expressed frustration with vendor
supplied facets that they could not manipulate or that they had to employ back door
workarounds in order to modify. This was amplified when libraries felt that vendors and
developers were not responsive to questions and suggestions or welcoming of feedback.
There is a clear need to continue to refine and adapt facets, and the catalog, long after
their initial introduction. Few libraries had a concrete sense of how patrons were utilizing
facets; user testing was rarely performed after the catalog had launched, and usage
statistics, if collected at all, were usually passively generated and not subjected to any
real form of analysis. Study participants expressed a need for more user testing in order to

193

better understand how facets are currently used by patrons and, particularly, how patrons
can be encouraged to use facets more often. The most common forms of facet-based
catalog studies are log analysis and task-based user studies, but libraries might also want
to consider some more qualitative methods, such as interviews and focus groups, in order
to gather information about why and how patrons use the library catalog, what they
understand facets to do, and when they would use them.
7.4 Implications for LIS Education
Just seven participants first heard about facets in LIS graduate school. While this could
partly be a consequence of when participants attended graduate school (e.g. any recent
graduate school attendee may already have been familiar with them), there certainly
appears to be scope to look at how facets and facet theory are presented in LIS education.
Five of the seven participants who did first learn about facets during their LIS education
worked in collection support positions and some explicitly mentioned being introduced to
facets in cataloging and classification classes. While discussion of facets finds a natural
home in such classes, facets can also be introduced in other contexts such as: information
retrieval, information architecture, and digital libraries. Introducing facets and facet
theory within these frameworks is all the more pertinent as more libraries move towards
developing their own catalogs or employing modular open source options.
As many of our professional habits are nurtured in graduate school, LIS educators must
also to continue to promote libraries as dynamic, changing environments, requiring
professionals who place service and community at the fore. Cultural shifts, such as
cataloging for user consumption rather than purely for item description, can be cultivated

194

alongside the teaching of important user-focused skillsets such as research methods and
user testing.
7.5 Implications for LIS Researchers
This research provides valuable information about what LIS staff know about facets and
the parameters they work within to build and operate catalogs. Acknowledging and
respecting these limits is important if researchers wish to aid in the development of
improved facet-based catalogs. Researchers may also want to consider the sources which
LIS professionals consult for information about facets such as OPAC focused journals,
blogs, professional conferences, webinars etc. For as much as is often heard about
“bridging the gap” between research and practice, academic research often remains in
academic circles, inaccessible and unrelatable to those in the professional trenches.
7.6 Future Research
This research was largely exploratory in nature and offers important insight into the
construction and management of facet-based catalogs. The previous sections have
highlighted numerous avenues worthy of further research and investigation. Some ideas
which I would like to pursue are presented below:
Facet education: For this research, I would examine the course offerings and syllabi for
LIS graduate programs in the US to see the context in which facets are being introduced
to future professionals. Joudrey & McGinnis (2014) found that certain information
organization courses are in decline (e.g. subject cataloging, thesauri construction) while
others (e.g. metadata), are on the rise. How are facets introduced in these different types
of classes? Are facets introduced in other classes such as information architecture, web

195

design, or information retrieval? Are there differences between the classes taught at
traditional LIS schools and iSchools? Are there gaps in teaching that LIS educators
should be aware of?
Facet and metadata evaluation: For this research, I would like to evaluate the quality of
facets in a number of catalogs. A comparative evaluation would look at whether facets
were distinct from each other, whether facets and facet values used terminology that was
clear, consistent and jargon free, whether facet values were of the same granularity,
whether there was evidence of metadata errors, inconsistencies or incompleteness. There
are many types of catalogs which could be compared, but one interesting approach would
be to compare catalogs where facets and metadata have been chosen and created by
library staff and catalogs which include a large number of vendor supplied facets and
metadata. This would provide useful information to see whether vendor supplied
metadata and facets are of a measurable lesser quality than those created by library staff.

Appendix A: Survey Instrument

We are conducting a research study looking at the current design, implementation and
management of what we term ‘facet-based library catalogs’.
A facet-based library catalog is one that includes dynamic filters, limits, refinements or
facets to modify a set of search results. Examples of facet-based catalog products include
AquaBrowser, Endeca and Vufind.
You have been asked to participate in this survey because of your experience in the
selection, development, implementation or maintenance of a facet-based library catalog.
We hope you can tell us a little about your thoughts and opinions on facets in general as
well as about your library catalog.
You only have to answer the questions you want and you may exit the survey at any time.
All information will be anonymized for the purposes of publication.
If you have any questions or comments please contact:

Appendix D: Interview Recruitment Message

My name is Catherine Hall and I am a doctoral student at the College of Computing &
Informatics at Drexel University. I am currently working on my dissertation about the
implementation of facets in library catalogs.
Several weeks ago you were kind enough to participate in my dissertation survey
research (http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1083142/Facet-use-in-library-catalogs), and
indicated your willingness to talk about the issues in a little more detail in a follow-up
interview. If you are still able, I'd love to talk to you about the points you raised in the
survey as they were extremely interesting and very relevant to my dissertation. Like the
survey, I am interested about your work, your understanding of facets and how facets are
used in your library catalog. Any responses are kept anonymous within my research.
If you'd be happy to participate, please let me know your general availability and I will
get to scheduling a short phone interview!
Thank you very much for your consideration,
