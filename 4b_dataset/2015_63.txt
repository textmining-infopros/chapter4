ABSTRACT
This dissertation study examines the role of the public library in fostering digital literacies in
underserved Illinois communities. Over the course of two years I collected data on the library as
an institution, and as a context, by investigating people, policies, activities and infrastructure
related to how individuals learn, comprehend and apply digital technologies in collaboration with
and in relation to the library. The data was collected during visits to libraries in sixteen locations
around the state with significant levels of poverty, including a selection of rural localities and
predominantly African American and Latino communities. Research methods included several
kinds of site observation as well as interviews with librarians. As a collective whole, these case
studies yield a series of interesting and surprising stories that reflect some of the connections
between social roles and service roles, as well as the particular innovations and challenges present
in underserved communities.
These findings support a number of related theories and initiatives, including the need to
reconstruct digital literacy as digital literacies, in the plural, and the impetus to see them primarily
as a function of community engagement, especially in underserved community settings. The data
suggests that library roles related to digital literacy are changing in several substantial ways. First,
libraries are moving beyond merely providing internet to proactively promoting assisted public
computing. Second, they are shifting their view of themselves as a community space to include
leadership in community networking. Finally, they are working to cultivate information
experiences that progress beyond consumption to involve a dimension of generative learning.
When considered in conversation with existing scholarship, these findings have important
implications: they show new avenues for research into diversity and social inclusion, critical
discourse analysis and dynamic models for learning. They also suggest new directions for the field
of Library and Information Science (LIS) and offer a compelling reason for libraries to both
participate in and help guide movements and initiatives to promote digital literacies.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
When I first started writing this dissertation I had written a small acknowledgement snippet
featuring praise of Mountain Dew, videogames and rollerblading. It’s amusing how much we can
transform in just a few years. I clearly owe my committee substantial thanks for their insightful
feedback and guidance throughout the project, especially Linda Smith, who must have had the will
of a titan to put up with all of my informality and rampant side projects. More importantly, I owe
a lion’s share of gratitude to a whole network of people who kept me going along the way. To say
they supported me would be too vague; I think I’d rather express my enrapturement in their
outstanding belief that my strange hacking of scholarship, technology and activism actually had
some merit to it.
Many thanks are to be had. To Professor Mike Twidale for his cheery and perturbed fascinations
with social-technical quandaries and his unending supply of almost spontaneous and
simultaneously nonchalant but helpful wisdom. To Professor Kate Williams for her to-the-point
challenges and forthright dedication to defining the field of community informatics. To Ann
Bishop for being something of a role model for me by compassionately and proactively evoking
her personal convictions in her professional life. To Linda Smith for providing the somehow
amazingly appropriate balance of wisdom, knowledge, flexibility, common sense and warmth as
a committee chair. To Lisa Bievenue and Informatics for letting me cultivate my dream job and
bounce back and forth between public engagement and scholarship. And to GSLIS for being a
department that is both gracious and an excellent place to tackle problems. To my friends and
colleagues at the Fab Lab, who allowed me to direct and expound on my positivity and affinity for
play. To Joel Spencer, Amber Cox (Castens) and all of the teens at The Urbana Free Library
because they are an exemplar when it comes to fostering digital literacies. To my sister, parents
and friends who pushed my work ethic and provided incentives. And finally, to all of the libraries
and librarians all around the state who not only told me stories, but give of themselves continuously
to powerfully promote and grow their communities.
Thank you all.

INTRODUCTION
A few years ago, I conducted what became the seed for this dissertation. As part of the study, I
spent time calling and talking to librarians about the kinds of internet access their public libraries
offered, and, naturally, one of the questions was about wireless. At the time (2008), many libraries
were only just beginning to implement wireless networks, and they were often still determining
policies and expectations. When I asked one librarian in a small town about the strength of their
library’s wireless, she replied that it extended well beyond the walls of their building and
proceeded to tell me how, after hours, youth would often gather in cars just outside with a laptop
to watch YouTube videos together. They probably could not do this sort of thing in the same way
at home, maybe as a result of the prying eyes of parents, a single contested family computer, or
the speed of their internet. The scene was almost like a stereotypical 1950’s diner or ice cream
parlor where youth would go to hang out when it was late, only in this case it was a kind of
renegade public computing. They could make as much noise as they wanted, playing music and
talking loudly, limited only by the battery life of their laptops.
In this story, we can see the rather deviant use of library resources for a kind of community
gathering—but also the possibility for informal learning with information communication
technologies taking place between peers. These youth exposed a gap between actual and intended
service provision, and, among other things, showed that the library meant something different to
them. The library, in turn, recognized the behavior and did not see anything wrong with it, so they
permitted it to continue. They were not concerned about viruses or torrenting any more than they
would be if a patron did these things inside of the library with a laptop during the day.
This dissertation project, however, is not primarily about investigating youth behaviors in evolving
third spaces, as interesting as that might be. Nor is it a call to argue the learning opportunities
present in engaging in participatory culture communities like those found on YouTube, at least not
explicitly. It is instead about uncovering the unconventional, unexpected, and innovative ways
public libraries are evolving as places that enable learning with technologies. It is also about
shedding light on the full context in which the process of participation and socialization occurs by
investigating several dimensions of the public library’s social and service roles as an institution.
In the case of the library in the above example, a combination of library infrastructure (the wireless
broadband and parking lot), policy (all-hours wireless and parking open to public use), and people
1

(youth patrons teaching and sharing with one another) made it possible for the library to facilitate
a kind of informal social program (YouTube sharing in cars), one that presented an opportunity
for these youth to develop digital literacies.
I never managed to get enough information about this activity to determine what kinds of outcomes
were happening for the youth, or if it continued for very long or was popular, but that’s not the
point. The point is that no form of official research survey about libraries is ever going to capture
these sorts of occurrences. Libraries, even ones in rural locations or those with limited assets, are
innovating and responding to evolving patron needs all of the time, and they often do so in ways
that don’t fit the norm or that are not well-documented. Conversely, they also face challenges that
arise with these innovations that require context-sensitive solutions. So what can we learn from
this that is generalizable? How does it relate to what we already know?

SPOTTING THE GAP
Public libraries, for the most part, have always been tied to the social development of technologies.
As card catalogs and large physical collections have shrunk or disappeared and databases and
online services have grown over the past two decades, libraries across the US have necessarily
evolved to become the mainstay of free public computing and public internet access in most
communities (Gant et al. 2010, Manjarrez and Schoembs 2011). In many libraries, you can walk
in to the computer lab at most times of the day and see every workstation in use, by people of all
kinds. Just as librarians in the past helped patrons to find the right book or resource, now they help
them to find the right website or learn how to use the right software. Understanding everything
related to processes like these, and how they relate to library service roles overall, is a substantial
part of what library and information science does.
As implied earlier, the inspiration for this project began many years ago, in the spring and summer
of 2008. By examining twenty-two public libraries spread throughout five counties with significant
African American populations in Illinois, 1 using a research framework based on an access-based
conception of the digital divide, I was able to gain some insight into the data, methods, and issues
that eventually turned into this dissertation study. I began the project by surveying library staff

over the phone about their IT infrastructure, personnel, policies and technology education
activities, with the objective of assembling a database of information on these variables. I soon
found myself inadvertently collecting a series of stories like the one told earlier in this introduction,
many of which were quite interesting, if not downright inspiring or surprising, and which didn’t
fit in the database. It wasn’t just a library here or there with an odd story, it was over half of them,
which meant there had to be some pretty big issues that numbers-based narratives were missing.
Since I couldn’t summarize much of what I was discovering suitably with spreadsheets and
typologies, I began to go out and visit library sites. The case study format proved to be an effective
method of data collection, and eventually became the impetus behind this dissertation.
Respectively, this work was designed directly in response to two gaps in the data:
1. While there are substantial publications available that measure the technology-related
resources that libraries provide, most studies fail to capture an adequate array of factors.
Furthermore, existing governmental, academic, and NGO reports and case studies do not
integrate a holistic perspective of digital literacy, one of the main goals behind providing
these assets. Only in recent years have such studies moved beyond wide surveys and
isolated, case-based data collection techniques. This dissertation takes a kind of hybrid
approach by working with several case study sites comparatively while considering them
in relation to larger issues, to better ensure generalizability.
2. Few existing published studies are explicitly focused on underserved, low-income or
ethnically diverse communities in small town and rural Illinois. The few identifiable
focused case studies in the body of literature feature stories and research on libraries with
considerably more assets, those located in Chicago and the outlying suburbs. We stand to
learn a great deal from the other, often-overlooked, communities in Illinois. There is as
much value in their knowledge and experience as there might be anywhere else. As public
libraries increasingly find themselves in a position of inheriting a widening burden for
providing social services, it becomes more pressing to understand what innovations and
challenges exist in settings where resources are not plentiful.
The purpose of this dissertation, however, is not just to collect different data in a quest to plug
holes in the literature; it is to ask why. Developing measures to explain what technologies libraries
possess, which digital literacy related programs they run, and how they go about conducting their
3

services is all to aid in understanding why they’re doing what they’re doing and why it works (or
doesn’t), why it matters. In doing this we construct important and specific examples of the social
forces and structures as well as individual agencies that shape, characterize and otherwise
determine outcomes and impacts. The mission, consequently, is to contribute to the scholarship
and theory in several fields of study and help to inform implementation and practice. Specifically,
in many ways the parts of Illinois outside of Chicago—small-town, struggling post-industrial and
rural—are similar to parts of other states with limited resources, underserved demographics and
hidden innovations. Furthermore, I believe my work will encourage scholars to rethink the
application and interpretation of digital literacy as a conceptualization and challenge library
professionals to reconsider the ways they believe public library service roles carry out social roles.

A SNAPSHOT OF THE STUDY DESIGN
In order to establish a basis through which to understand the essential “why” questions I started
with one with sufficient room to explore:
What is the role of the Illinois public library in fostering digital literacy?
My first objective was to achieve a general understanding of the character and conditions of digital
literacy in Illinois public libraries. I did this by operationalizing pertinent dimensions of the context
that represent service roles—infrastructure, people, policies and activities—to achieve a more
holistic base of data from a specific set of public libraries all around the state. The meticulouslyassembled sample included only libraries that serve socially excluded populations arguably most
in need of services and empowerment, particularly those in the most rural areas, impoverished
areas, and areas with significant African American and Latino populations.
I then traveled all around the state over the course of several months, visiting libraries for
observations and conducting interviews. In total I explored 16 libraries, interviewed 34 librarians,
took a wealth of field notes, accumulated over 45 hours of audio, and then stepped back to consider
the amalgamation. I wrote up and critically interpreted the sum of the data to supply the stories,
comparisons and implications presented in this text. The work naturally led to several libraryrelated digital literacy projects and an extended case study not included in this dissertation.

CHAPTER OVERVIEW
The next section is a literature review that details the path of inquiry I took to assemble my research
question. This includes some of the theory and social forces at play beneath the social roles of the
public library, how they relate to public education and the definition and purpose of digital literacy.
I then move on to review several related studies that this work was originally positioned in response
to and make the case for the gaps in data indicated earlier. Following is a detailed breakdown of
my research design, which includes a clarification of disciplinary affiliations as well as an
explanation of the multi-stage study. Readers will then reach two sets of findings: the first is a
series of stories illuminating some of the interesting and surprising ways library roles relate to
fostering digital literacies and the second is a series of comparisons between libraries in the form
of tables and explanations demonstrating the breadth of institutional attributes. The dissertation
concludes with a discussion of the “why” questions in the form of implications for theory as well
as related research and practice.

LITERATURE REVIEW - PATH OF INQUIRY
This section helps to guide readers through the relevant literature that comprises the foundation
beneath my research question.

UNDERSTANDING THE ROLES OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
In 1947 the American Library Association (ALA) asked the Social Science Research Council, led
at the time by Robert D. Leigh, to conduct a study of the value of the public library in the United
States. The study (Leigh 1950) was built upon the assumption of several American democratic
values that find deep integration with the conception of the library’s social role at the time. In his
text he walks us through a series of assumptions:
1. All individuals deserve equal opportunity, which relies on their opportunity to learn and
grow.
2. Freedom of personal expression and communication are individual rights, but in the
aggregate they are a kind of social good.
3. Institutions of public good must be subject to popular control as well as direction by experts
(an electorate), which implies a blend of top-down and bottom-up governance.
4. We ought to cultivate institutions which serve the whole community by investing in
resources for and by persons of diverse types and backgrounds.
5. Such public goods necessitate both centralization and local participation.
6. We must strike a balance between technological progress and cultural traditions.
Leigh noted that the public library is a symbol as well as a servant of culture and that it relies
primarily in a kind of faith, “belief in virtue of the printed word” as a fundamental force of social
change. He found that the social functions of the library were very much in alignment with those
of democracy: the promotion of tolerance, free speech and participatory governance (pg. 12). His
research, though rather limited in its selection of inputs, identified that many representatives of the
field of library science at the time were rather forward thinking. They saw that the library’s service
roles included provision of information in all forms, such as “films, recordings, and radio; also by
lectures, forums and discussion groups” and that not only should information materials be made
available free to the public but that “library service should be established where it is not now
available” (pg. 18). In its entirety Leigh even posited that “the library, however, may also be
6

thought of as a constituent part of public (or mass) communication” (pg. 25). And perhaps bolder,
an outstanding social role of the library was identified in stating: “Librarians should change the
intensity, the duration and even the nature of their services so that they will contribute directly to
the solution of the crucial problems of our time” (pg. 19). 2
Ultimately, what Leigh builds up to is a rather noble and magnificent vision of the public library.
It is remarkable in that it captures so many dimensions of American values and then finds those
values to be woven into the very structure of the operations as well as the recurrent effects the
public library has on our communities. But to what extent was this really the case? Was the library
really as splendid as its ideal form was described?
Leigh worked within the context of his time, which was an atmosphere of great post-war
governmental approval characterized by assumptions of American exceptionalism. Libraries were
often still of the Carnegie sort, giant stone buildings with towering stacks of books available
primarily for the privileged. Without a doubt, the insistence of the importance of public libraries
as an underpinning in our democracy has persisted over the years, but they haven’t served as quite
the tremendous apparatus of public communications or social problem solving centers that Leigh’s
report may have envisioned them to be. How does one measure the public library’s contribution
to democracy? Should we assume an operational definition, on the basis of historical analysis of
policy? What about measures based on the character of library activities and patrons as well as the
content of information made available? A comprehensive understanding of outcomes and impacts
would certainly require analysis from many perspectives. More recent critiques, like the one given
by John Buschman 3 in Dismantling the Public Sphere (2003) have suggested that the connection
between libraries and democracy may be more of a matter of rhetoric or faith than substance, and

2

Leigh even noted challenges that are still relevant today – the amount of information people consume from

(presumably questionable) commercial sources (as compared to academic or government curated) as well as a key
question of agency: “Are librarians teachers, or are they rather the keepers and organizers of the instruments of
education and stimulators of their use?”
3

Challenging the assumption that libraries are democracy incarnate is based, in part, on works by Leah Lievrouw,

Brenda Dervin and Neil Postman written in the 80’s and 90’s. Buschman’s conceptualization of the new public
philosophy is grounded heavily in the critiques written by Michael Apple, Henry Giroux and Sheldon Wolin.

7

that in the age of a new public philosophy, an age driven in large part by the descendants of
Reagan-era marketization, libraries are on the defensive. We see this reactive state through
language and policy: libraries are frequently forced to render their social value in terms of
economics, such as monetary value per individual user, as opposed to aggregate value to the entire
community or variance in value to different sorts of patrons. Buschman claims that scholars in
library science are all too willing to assume a kind of “information equals democracy” narrative,
and yet they remain unsettled about the relationship between libraries and the emergent capitalistic
forces of the information society. In effect, our field has entered a perpetual state of panic because
this perception of crisis has become woven into our very identity over the past thirty years.
Buschman levels this criticism not without hope, and instead calls for a solution in the form of a
sustained return to the democratic public sphere, an elaboration on the vision of Jürgen Habermas
(pg. 42):
As an ideal type, the public sphere is the space in between the state (and its formal systems
of [civic participation like] voting or legislation) and private life. It is where unfettered
and equally available information is gathered and argumentation and critique (i.e.
discourse) takes place among people as the basis of rational public will formation: the
genesis of legitimacy in laws, decisions, and ethical norms in a democracy.
Buschman finds several key duties the library performs in the domain referred to as the public
sphere:
•

Collecting and organizing information resources, from a diverse array of sources and
perspectives, for access and use, which in effect extends the parameters of rational
discourse (debate) and affects resulting normative conclusions.

•

Active demonstration of information transparency in the implementation of these
collections (and services), and, in parallel, provision of verification (or refutation) through
the ability to backtrack the development of ideas in literature.

Buschman contends, on the basis of considerable literature, that “libraries contain within their
collections the potential for rational critique and individual/community self-realization” (pg. 47)
and that, for better or worse, they have supported the right of access to information to people

8

outside of the dominant culture. This position bears some similarity to Leigh’s rhetoric, but is
better immersed in recent and critical scholarship.
So what do these understandings of the public library say together? It appears to be here to support
social (or public) goods, like free speech and education, which ideally lead to outcomes such as
self-realization and informed civic participation. In this view the library is positioned as a
supporter, providing knowledge and information tools to bolster other endeavors, a common theme
in library and information science when we talk about the social roles of the library. In my opinion,
these authors present views that do not do enough to adequately address to what degree the library
should be a pro-active enabler, however. Is its domain just one of conscientiously and equitably
sorting, circulating and promoting a diversity of materials, in hopes that someone will use them?
Is the contemporary library here to support providers of education by simply making information
available or is it actually a provider of education itself by helping patrons to make sense of,
understand, apply and create information? The field has continued to grapple with these questions
over recent years. 4
Every civic institution develops service roles that are situated in response to desired social roles.
Social roles, implicitly desirable facets of democracy, are usually framed in terms of the impacts,
benefits or values they provide (or affect), related to information, education, recreation or culture
and economic regeneration (Williamson 2000, Debono 2002, Kerslake and Kinnell 1998).
Numerous disputes exist over the best ways to measure these engagements, of course, be they
about effectively and appropriately demonstrating the contributions of public libraries in
hypothesis-structured performance measurement (Matthews 2004, 2007), discerning the degree to
which libraries influence social capital in communities (Bourke 2005, Hillenbrand 2005, Alkalimat
2003, Alkalimat and Williams 2001), or reconciling the position of the library in providing new
social-cyber infrastructure (McClure and Jaeger 2009). In 1987 the American Library Association
(ALA) and Public Library Association (PLA) commissioned a study that, over its evolution, gives
a comprehensive and progressive typology of library service roles: what libraries do, concretely,
in their fulfillment of social roles. They posited that the public library fills key functions as a center

4

The debate is often framed in terms of neutrality, and though scholars have generally recognized that the library is

far from apolitical the discourse still persists amongst practitioners.

9

for community activities, local information, formal education support, independent learning,
research, and as an access location for popular materials, learning for preschoolers, and reference
provision (McClure et al. 1987). An update to the report over a decade later (Nelson 2001) added
several library service responses and also maintained some overlap. It indicated that the library
should help address literacy needs, act as a business and career information center, be a kind of
commons environment for community discourse and social inclusion, promote cultural awareness,
foster lifelong learning, facilitate local history and genealogy efforts, and offer government
information. Yet another installment was developed in 2007 (Nelson 2008) and added a few new
service responses, including public internet access, a commitment to services for immigrants and
supporting patrons in: informed citizenship in the context of world affairs, creation and sharing of
creative expression, critical evaluation and use of information, participation in physical and online
spaces. With each update common themes were carried over and the organization of the
information presented changed to better match evolving implementations of public library service
roles. 5
In total, this list of possible roles is as dizzying as it is inspiring. Clearly the range of service roles
the library assumes is both changing and expanding and assumes active engagement with
information. The latest version of the ALA Policy Manual (ALA Council 2013) cites, in total,
eleven service responsibilities, including literacy, instruction and services to the poor, all of which
were prominent areas of focus throughout my study. The two service roles that drove the
development of my initial inquiry and successive research, however, were a little more restrictive:
(1) enabling the acquisition, critical evaluation and need-relevant use of information, and (2)
encouraging the expression of creativity through the creation and sharing of multimedia content. 6
Other goals addressed by libraries, like lifelong learning, clearly overlap with these two missions
in substantial ways, but for the sake of creating a manageable and defined analytic frame, I
narrowed my focus, at least initially, to just those two. These two service roles seemed to most
directly support a call for libraries to be engaged in fostering digital literacy through services and
thus merited investigation.

SHIFTS IN EDUCATION
By many assessments, the US public education system is in trouble (Singer et al. 2006). As the
forces of digital capitalism have swept across the globe over the past few decades, the expectations
and needs of education and preparation for participation in the current workforce have changed
quite rapidly. The logic of labor markets has sunk deeply into the values and culture that impact
policy and education reform, and as a result we’ve seen an increase in standardization. Our nation
has been preoccupied with replicable, portable and competitive assessment ever since the
introduction of No Child Left Behind in 2001, 7 amidst a generalized fear of failure to retain
leadership in our global economy. The social sciences, arts, and humanities have become a kind
of collateral damage in the midst of an ever increasing focus on mathematics, science and
regimented testing. 8 If anything, teachers are more pressured, stressed and overwhelmed than ever
before 9 and schools sacrifice important context-specific education (situated learning) for desperate
access to better funding. Interestingly, even more students go to and graduate from college than
ever before and yet they still face a very intimidating job market, a challenge only exacerbated by
ever-increasing levels of student loans. On the other end of the spectrum, large numbers of students
in disadvantaged communities drop out before making it through high school, and, in most of these
places, they face considerably more difficult chances for employment.
Ken Robinson (2011), who is certainly not the first to speak of this occurrence as a kind of crisis,
suggests that the rise of industrialism in eras past permanently disfigured education both
structurally and culturally. Today, students systematically move through their days cued by bells,
segregated by a date of manufacture (their age) instead of their needs or interests. Almost as if on
an assembly line, students are shuffled from one location to another, taught by teachers categorized
by the distribution of labor embedded in disciplines, moved forward by year on the basis of a
progressive accumulation of knowledge. This year’s algebra feeds into next year’s geometry and

7

And has been arguably continued by additional legislation, such as the America COMPETES Act of 2007 and Race

to the Top.
8

Emphasis on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) has compounded the existing agendas like report

cards for the nation. In the end it appears like the humanities and arts lose out the most, given that the NSF’s definition
actually includes social science (Gonzalez and Kuenzi 2012).

Dropout rates are incredibly high, compared to other fields. See Fairbank (2013) for a convincing overview.

so on, until one day they might reach calculus, if they work hard enough, or so they are told.
Robinson describes this vision of education as a sort of gas-tank model, where students start out
as empty tanks ready to be filled up to make their journey through life. The problem is that their
tanks were never completely empty to begin with, and there is a whole lot more than gas going
into them, substances that may or may not help them to make it effectively through their journeys
in life. Save for the occasional bout of graduate school, many of these students never engage in
formal education again in their lives, despite the very real fact that they will all indisputably be
rolled into life-long learning of all kinds.
Robinson is not alone in his concern for the trajectory of public education. Buschman (2003) makes
the argument that the education system faces the very same ‘crisis’ (or crisis culture) of
information society that libraries do, in terms of being consistently disrupted by reduced flows of
funding, fragmented identity, and the challenge of putting their great potential for impact as an
element in the public democratic sphere into action. By extension public education must also
oblige what Buschman identifies as the new public philosophy: technocratic conservative attack
that occurs mostly in the form of social exclusion and decontextualized standardization. Buschman
(pg. 20) cites Giroux (1983, 1988) and Apple (1982, 1986, 1993, 1996) who identify a variety of
issues in schools brought on by the economic-driven public philosophy: failure and dropout rates,
the differential performance of minorities, absenteeism and also accountability programs, testing,
accreditation processes, and emphasis on credentials over instead, say, learning and meaning.
Capitalistic dimensions include privatization, increasing corporate information in classrooms and
the continuing conservative nature of reforms as ‘market-based’ and ‘competitive individualism,’
effectively privileging those already in power.
What Robinson describes is well-known in the field of sociology of education, and could also be
referred to simply as what Lisa Delpit (1988) designates the culture of power: 10 codes and rules
that reflect those who have power, that are enacted in classrooms. Delpit insightfully points out
that participants in this system are seldom directly told the real rules of power acquisition, and as

10

Many other scholars have referred to this concept in other ways. The preservation of power is a way of talking about

social reproduction, or, as Warschauer (2003) says, “education institutions are structured in ways that reflect and
contribute to broader social, economic, political and cultural relationships (Bowles and Gintis 1976, Willis 1977).”

12

Robinson emphasizes, they’re often blatantly misled. 11 Those who do successfully navigate the
system often do so without any acknowledgement or comprehensive awareness of their own
privilege. Beyond these cultural norms manifested in daily life, public education is impacted by
many other issues of structural inequality: racism in criminal justice, white flight, the cycle of
poverty and more. Kids are brought up being socialized into the American ideal of a meritocracy
only to find that individual agency will only get them so far without structural support.
Digital literacy does not fit neatly into the four to six servings 12 of academic discipline students
receive each year. Often, computer-based activities happen in isolated labs, where students follow
ritualistic patterns inextricably tied to certain software programs that may or may not be phased
out in a year or two. In contrast to subjects like mathematics, where we have consistent and widely
accepted systems for dependencies and regularized measurement, computer, information and
media literacy skills have no universally accepted metrics, outside of perhaps the prerequisite of
keyboarding and the effective use of a mouse. 13 Even these assumptions are changing as we depart
from a world where computers are our sole point of digital information access and authorship. In
low-funding public school settings teachers may at best have a couple of computers in their
classroom to share amongst dozens of students. Access to the latest technologies is really just one
facet of this problem, however; the social construction of education lies at the heart of the issue
(Warschauer 2003). On-going debates in the US have well-problematized our framing of
educational methods, be they understood as a process of transmission (Hirsch 1987),
constructivism (Piaget 1970, Papert 1980), learning within communities of practice (Lave and
Wenger 1991, Brown, Collins and Duguid 1989), apprenticeship (Vygotsky 1978, Collins, Brown
and Newman 1989), critical pedagogy (Freire 1994) or in relation to tools and knowledge and
outside of schools entirely (Illich 1971, 1973). How we think about education—where it happens,

11

And Ivan Illich, as explained by David Gauntlett, who I will introduce later, would claim that students are misled

such that they believe they are unable to do things for themselves at all.
12

The subjects we see emphasized in standardized testing, give or take a few: math, science, English, history and

language.
13

Or, perhaps, to demonstrate my point more poignantly, recent potential requirements may be use of touch screens

and other interface manipulations, like orienting attention and directing actions in a 3D environment.

13

with whom it happens, why it happens, and for what purpose it happens—absolutely determines
our answer to the question of the social roles of civic institutions like the public library.
The ALA’s Office for Information Technology Policy (OITP) recently published the findings from
what began in 2011 as a task force, entitled Digital Literacy, Libraries and Public Policy (2013a,
2013b). The report seeks to be an overview of the involvements of libraries in fostering digital
literacies as well as a general guide for action. It identifies three primary discourses that take place
around digital literacy: inclusion, education and the workforce. I will revisit and distinguish the
first of these in greater detail in an upcoming section on contextualizing access to technologies but
it is worth examining the other two here to understand what they imply about the library’s potential
and realized contemporary social roles.
The public library continues to be known for providing lifelong opportunities for instruction and
extracurricular learning but is increasingly being recognized for cultivating advanced digital
literacy skills, through project creation and creative expression in K-12 settings. Much of the focus
happens in school libraries, where concern over standards 14 and teacher competencies remains
dominant but efforts like the Digital Media and Learning initiative of the MacArthur Foundation
strive to enable learning in after-school settings and alternative environments like museums.
Unfortunately in Illinois much of the focus in education and workforce development remains on
the barebones essentials. The federally-mandated tests 15 do not include substantive dimensions of
digital literacy, instead focusing on a minimal set of basic subjects like reading, writing, math and
science. Additionally, the format of these exams emphasizes rote memorization and ritualistic
operations, which raises questions about what they can truly measure about a given student’s
ability to write and read in a variety of media contexts, apply math in interdisciplinary settings and

14

21st Century Learning frameworks, the National Educational Technology Standards (from ISTE), Common Core

Standards and the recent Technology and Engineering Learning assessment of the National Assessment of Educational
Programs (NAEP) are all examples of attempts to codify and measure dimensions of digital literacies.

assessments.

participate in the processes of science, such as hypothesis formation and experimentation. While
a student’s capability to navigate through a given exam on a computer might matter in a minimal
way, the actual content tested on leaves a lot of room open. Optimistically this could allow for
teachers to cover the minimal set of standards material and then move on to teaching digital
literacies in ways appropriate to their preferences and student needs but realistically this possibility
often falls prey to pressure to keep schools in the black by ensuring students pass tests. Similarly
institutions like the National Center for Education Statistics focus primarily on basic literacies (the
three “r’s”) amongst youth and adult learners alike, making it difficult to even know where to begin
when it comes to getting a sense for where we stand in terms of digital literacies.
Libraries also continue to provide base-line training for job-seekers, offering internet and limited
computer software training for unemployed, under-skilled and elderly populations. Some offer
resume workshops and career centers or helpful services like activities for children while adults
work. The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) supports
programs for these activities, including some libraries (and programs attached to them) and
operations like WorkNet, a place the library may refer patrons, make an attempt to at least assess
and enable computer literacy. 16 Nearly all of these programs are social services and safety net
contributions to economic development, not programs for advanced digital literacies and
associated businesses or innovative fields of practice.
The US public library can (and currently does) serve as a component of our public education
system, and when decoupled from more formal or explicit institutions, can break free from some
of the imposed limitations outlined above. There are no restrictions on age, no subjects enforced
in timetables, and tremendous potential for collaborative and contextualized learning with varying
degrees of formality, directionality and scope. Public libraries grapple with the very fundamentals
behind education: aiding in the cultivation of talents and sensibilities in individuals, deepening
understandings of the world by sharing and challenging knowledge, and providing skills and
resources required to earn a living and be economically, morally and politically productive. If
anything, there is an opportunity for the public library to aggressively step up its role, through

navigation of the web, as well as file organization.

actions like collaborating with nearby community colleges, serving as a public lab for multimedia
production, leveraging resources dedicated to multicultural community history and more.

DIGITAL LITERACY
Digital literacy provides a uniquely appropriate perspective to studying the relationship between
education, learning and service roles in public libraries. It is not without a layer of abstraction, and
consequently I have developed my conceptualization of it as an engaged scholar since my early
pilot study back in 2008. At the time I found the discourse on the digital divide wanting, and sought
to explain the socio-cultural and cognitive dimensions of technology adoption and application as
a kind of “digital consciousness” (Ginger 2008) that built upon Adam Banks’ notion of experiential
access (Banks 2006). In some ways this idea reflected the digital natives (Prensky 2001, Palfrey
and Gasser 2008) debate, which had reached a peak around this time, and still lingers in discourse
on the topic even today. As I struggled with reconciling the various views I traced a path through
the surrounding body of literature that led me to ultimately characterize the term with two
imperative qualifiers: critical and creative. This composite definition informed the formulation of
research questions and acted as an analytic lens for data collection and successive scrutiny. Over
the course of several stages of my dissertation research I grew to adopt an even broader approach
to the issue, eventually choosing the model pioneered by Douglas Belshaw (2012), which will be
addressed specifically in relation to my data and discoveries in the discussion chapter. For now, I
will cover the seed of the dissertation: the definition of digital literacy and the consequential
questions that can be raised about it in the context of public libraries.
DEFINING LITERACY
Literacy finds many different definitions in varying contexts, but one of the most globally
conscious, as well as universally adopted, is that put forth by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO 2004):
Literacy is the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and
compute, 17 using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy

17

Compute as in basic mathematics, not modern computing or computer operations.

16

involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals, to develop
their knowledge and potential and to participate fully in their community and wider society.
In presenting this definition UNESCO (2004, 2005) thoughtfully positions literacy as a set of social
practices rather than a singular skill, and elevates it to the level of a human right (the right to
education, UNESCO 2005). It suggests that meaningful acquisition and application of literacy
provides the basis for positive social transformation, justice, and personal and collective freedom.
Although this characterization establishes desired outcomes that include a dimension of relevancy
and everyday practice, the UN report purposely restricts their focus to text and written materials.
It is at this juncture where digital literacy comes into play.
In the vernacular, literacy often is taken to be equivalent to competency, proficiency or
functionality, and is frequently affixed to other words to create compound meanings, such as
information literacy, (new) media literacy, and stranger and perhaps contested pairings, such as
emotional literacy. 18 Digital literacy is another one of these duos, and like the others it has a
surrounding body of literature and discourse. However, I think it stands apart because it is wellpositioned to appropriately frame research on libraries, information technology and empowerment,
as will be explained.
Many studies of digital literacy have turned up over the course of the past two decades, but they
can generally be sorted into two major categories: (1) conceptual (abstract) definitions, often
advocacy-laden, and (2) “standardized sets of operations intended to provide national and
international normalizations” (Lankshear and Knobel 2006:21), or, more simply, comparable (and
usually measurable) described skills. In a sense this is just theory and application, but the examples
are so numerous and vague that they become difficult to track, especially when someone is seeking
to determine which theory leads to which application. Even still, digital literacy research is largely
international 19 and this makes direct comparison and universal classification difficult, and a

18

For a brief history and example of emotional literacy analysis in action see Liau, Liau, Teoh, Liau 2003. As Burman

(2009) points out, however, the term is still somewhat contested in its use and needs to be considered and employed
with caution.
19

An ever-increasing amount of research on digital literacy education and associated practices is taking place in

countries outside of the US, including Ireland (Digital Literacy in Primary Schools 2009), Greece (Koutsogiannis

17

dominant portion of it seems to be focused on youth enrolled in K-12 education, 20 which delivers
an incomplete view of the issue. Included here is not a comprehensive literature review 21 of all
‘digitally’ associated literacies but instead a simpler outcome-oriented alignment of commonalities
found in several models of digital literacy that I think are important.
IN THE ABSTRACT
Conceptual definitions of digital literacy include a call for an alteration of the media and mode
limitation seen in the aforementioned UN articulation: reading and writing with physical text.
Some interpret this as broadly as the ability to comprehend information however it is presented
physically, no matter how complex 22 (adapted from Lanham 1995), while others provide a new
concentration as a stipulation: the ability to understand, evaluate and organize information
represented through ICTs (among the first to propose this was Gilster 23 1998; there have been
many others since). The field of New Literacy Studies is so bold as to suggest that digital literacy24
is a facet of entirely ‘new literacies’ and that though these literacies include practices mediated by

2007, Mitsikopoulou 2007), Israel (Eshet-Alkalai & Amichai-Hamburger 2004, Eshet-Alkalai & Chajut 2009), Spain
(Meneses and Mominó 2010), Australia (Walsh 2010, Bulfin and North 2007), Brazil (Braga 2007), South Africa
(Jacobs 2004, Walton 2007), Botswana (Mutula and Mutula 2007), Rwanda (Mukama & Andersson 2008), Hong
Kong (Lee 2002) and more. Together these comprise a rich array of ideas and perspectives.
20

It is widely acknowledged that digital technologies significantly impact literacy developments in K-12 education

(Walsh 2010, Carrington and Robinson 2009, Jones 2007, and more), and this has been given some special attention
with young children (Hisrich and Blanchard 2009, Burnett et al. 2006, Russo et al. 2009, Marsh 2005). The popularized
‘digital natives’ concept (Prensky 2001, Palfrey and Gasser 2008) may be responsible for this heightened interest and
concern, but could also be a reflection of the current iteration of moral-panic that is reoccurring in education (Bennett,
Maton and Kervin 2008).
21

Readers seeking a more thorough review of material on digital literacy would do well to consult Lankshear and

Knobel (2008) and Belshaw (2012).
22

This might be stated more specifically as any “ways of making meaning with diverse semiotic resources”

(Warschauer 2010:124) that could enable the discovery of ‘invisible literacies’ (Baynham 1995, Warschauer 2010),
which is too broad of an approach to be useful here.
23

A budding typology that included several aspects: assembling knowledge, evaluating information, searching and

navigating in non-linear routes.
24

And in fact, Lankshear and Knobel (2008) advocate that an expansive frame of ‘digital literacies’ (plural) more

honestly accounts for the diversity of research on the topic, and ties well into previous research on literacies.

18

post-typographic forms of text they also inherently involve social behaviors and patterns, such as
being ‘participatory,’ ‘collaborative,’ or more ‘distributed’ (Lankshear and Knobel 2008, Jenkins
et al. 2006, Mills 2010, Hague and Payton 2010). Such practices may dramatically transform the
production of knowledge (Warschauer 2010, Tapscott and Williams 2008) and this also implies
that new sets of cultural or social relations may be necessarily represented through information
sharing and expression with ICTs. Stated differently, it could be said that these new social practices
are value-laden, and these values become intertwined with the experience process and overall
medium of various ICTs. Many discussions on related issues seem to indicate this is the case, such
as the discourse on digital natives (Bennett et al. 2008), privacy and impression management in
social networking sites (Utz and Kramer 2009), and media ideologies (Gershon 2010), to name
just a few.
The potential of digital literacy, to some extent, actually lies in its flexibility and lack of strong
structure. In the 1980’s scholars grappled with the idea of computer literacy, and later, in the
1990’s they incorporated a broader view of information literacy (Bruce 1994, 1997). Bawden
(2008) explains that the roots of digital literacy are interrelated to a host of other terms: library
literacy (Bawden 2001), network literacy (McClure 1994), informacy (Neelameghan 1995),
mediacy (Inoue, Naito, and Koshizuka 1997), and e-literacy (Martin 2003, 2005). Though the
objective is not to create one master form of digital literacy, Lankshear and Knobel (2008) and
Belshaw (2012) suggest that a view of digital literacies (plural) is appropriate, and can account for
the underpinnings of traditional text literacy, computer literacy, background knowledge, central
competencies like knowledge assembly, and attitudes or perspectives, like independent learning
that relies on patience and persistence. I will return to this issue later on in the text, as it is quite
important.
Digital literacy is notably situated in related sociocultural debates (Koutsogiannis 2007, Williams
2003), topics like textual design and multimodality (Kress 2003, Kress & Van Leeuwen 2001), the
trajectory of education in the global information age (Cope & Kalantzis 2000, Luke & Carrington
2003), what forms or adoption processes the social practices of literacy take (Lankshear and

19

Knobel 2008), 25 and in envisioning new media as potential sites or environments of learning (Gee
2004). This discourse may be, in many cases, a reproduction of previously-encountered literacy
debates (Collins & Blot 2003), and a great deal of the extant reports on digital literacy could stand
to benefit from integrating a broader range of disciplinary perspectives. 26 Conversations too far
removed from practice and experience may give insufficient attention to cultural tradition, the role
of identities and local economic factors, to the point where we may fall into the trap of reinforcing
digital capitalism, in a variation on a broader theme of the digital divide (Pieterse 2005,
Koutsogiannis 2007). Despite all of this, the rhetoric does illustrate the sheer assemblage of
ideologies on the topic, as well as the powerful interdisciplinary constituency of scholarship.
AS MEASURED
The fragmented theory from the numerous academic disciplines connected to digital literacy is
passed on to its application in research; many measures of digital literacy exist in recent
publications. Similar to education or intersections of humanities topics and social science, digital
literacy seems to be most often measured in two ways: (1) in terms of flexible (qualitatively
described and socially situated) examples and typologies of best practices or processes as well as
(2) specifically measured aptitudes and behaviors, usually seen in the performance of tasks.
A complete review of studies employing these types of measures is beyond the scope of this work.
Instead, reviewed here are exemplars that give an idea of the ways definitions of digital literacy
might be expressed in measurement.
First is the model for participatory culture discussed by Jenkins et al. (2006). In their report the
authors argue for the existence of an emerging culture tied to digital literacy, described as having
“relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement, strong support for creating

25

Though they make reference to this in the introduction, examples can be found throughout their whole book by a

range of authors: David Bawden, Genevieve Marie Johnson, Maggie Fieldhouse, David Nicholas, David Buckingham,
and Ola Erstad.
26

One such example can be seen in Williams’ 2003 assessment of the National Research Council’s 1999 report Being

fluent with information technology. While the report effectively captured fluency with IT in terms of technical skills,
concepts and history, it failed to articulate many of the ways literacy connects to social structures related to power,
democracy, and cultural hegemony.

20

and sharing one’s creations, and some type of informal mentorship whereby what is known by the
most experienced is passed along to novices” (Jenkins et al. 2006:3) The authors suggest that the
recipe for participatory culture includes many social practices connected to engagement with ICTs,
such as affiliations in online communities, digital expressions and circulations, and distributed
problem-solving. They see this social action as related fundamentally to other challenges, such as
digital inclusion and participation, transparency of information, and the question of ethics in the
proliferation of new media. Out of this they draw a set of skills and cultural competencies and give
examples that include teaching scenarios and encouragement for best practices. For instance, they
describe transmedia navigation, “the ability to deal with the flow of stories and information across
multiple modalities” (Jenkins et al. 2006:46) by presenting the case of Pokémon, a fictitious set of
creatures for which there is no single core source of information. Children learn about Pokémon
by following stories of their experiences and characteristics in a variety of mediums with different
affordances and systems of representation, including card games, television, videogames and
websites. Though Pokémon appear in many contexts, children still have a grasp of who and what
they are. The application of digital literacy seen here is helpful in that it constructs useful and
flexible categories and instances of social practice, but without chaining them to specific
information technologies.
Second, Eshet-Alkalai (2012) together with other colleagues (with Amichai-Hamburger 2004 and
Chajut 2009) introduce a compelling model in their operationalization of digital literacy as testable
skills: photovisual literacy, reproduction literacy, branching literacy, information literacy,
socioemotional literacy, and real-time thinking skills. Their series of studies (2004, 2009, 2012)
featured a sample comprised of a diverse group of participants controlled for age, education and
socioeconomic variables. They demonstrated the examination of digital literacy skills through
verifiable and reliable tests over time, but with sufficiently complicated tasks. For instance,
participants were challenged to use a word processor to modify the meaning of text by rearranging
its parts. The work involved included an understanding of connotation, grammar, and composition
as well as knowledge of the interface and comfort with hardware manipulation. In comparison to
other simpler measures of digital literacy, such as knowing how to send an e-mail, 27 the authors

27

As seen in Meneses and Mominó 2010, for instance.

21

more effectively capture digital literacy in its context: while they might pay more attention to
technical aptitudes and cognitive abilities with regards to certain variables, they acknowledge the
complexity and embeddedness of technology use. Knowing how to send an e-mail has as much to
do with knowing what or how to write and grasping the cultural norms of the people using your
domain of the internet as it does using a mouse, typing or navigating Gmail.
What makes these examples powerful is their emphasis on surrounding context and applicationoriented research. They are also in need of one another. Jenkins et al. don’t present metrics that
work well with portable, operationalized (hypothesis testing) research and evaluation and EshetAlkalai et al. rely on cognitive models that may not draw upon enough of the wisdom found in
cultural literacy studies, such as the plight of literacy as relative or contextualized. Research on
digital literacy more generally falls in to the same trap: how to balance giving sufficient attention
to informing theory and at the same time establishing and testing comparable, valid and applicable
models or measures.
DIFFERENTIATING AND DECIPHERING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE
Before addressing my chosen arrangement for inquiry into digital literacy I want to take a moment
to explain how I see it as related to the digital divide. In community informatics a lot of work on
the subject of information society examines people’s ability to participate in it meaningfully, be it
as part of global conversations, local democracy, or broad social change movements. The
perspective this often instinctually assumes is that participation boils down to a matter (or
requirement) of access, known commonly as the digital divide, or, stated perhaps more
appropriately, the power differences between people or communities tied to varying levels of
computer and internet opportunity.
Establishing the digital divide as our enemy necessarily embarks us on a quest for digital solutions,
but the lack of possession of material access to technology and the absence of skills, community
support and perceptions to make effective use of it is often a symptom of deeper, prolonged issues.
In some sense the digital divide is a moving target, because the make-up of ICTs shifts as we look
back over time. We’ve been in something of an information revolution (or crisis) for over thirty
years. First it was the onset of significant availability of computers in business and homes (the
computer and information revolutions, Beniger 1986 and Jones 1982, cited in Williams 2001),
22

then it was the internet (DiMaggio et al. 2001, Warschauer 2003) and more recently mobility
(Johnson, Levine and Smith 2009, Horrigan 2009b), broadband (Horrigan 2008, 2009a, Smith
2010) and Web 2.0 (Scholz 2008). It is worth taking a step back, disentangling oneself from the
ever-changing constitution of ICTs, and interrogating the underlying assumptions and agendas of
the digital divide and the credence for the proliferation of ICTs.
A fitting example might be Jan Pieterse (2005), who questions the agenda behind the discourse of
the digital divide in his critique of information communication technologies for development, or
ICT4D. His argument takes place in the context of digital capitalism, where networks of
corporations drive and dominate cyberspace and subject the world to restrictive types of media
and deepen forces like consumerism (Schiller 2000), which is not unlike the network society
described by Castells (2010). ICT4D implies the imposition of flawed (or loaded) developmental
models, such as technological determinism or neo-liberalism (market forces are assumed to be
equivalent to development) that serve to mask the true intentions of insidious political and
economic agendas: to make money off of poor people through selling more material goods and
exploiting labor, to control markets with ideologies like copyright and to force developing
countries to choose between dependence on NGO’s or corporate networks. Pieterse’s stance is
accurate, if resoundingly pessimistic, and reminds us of the baggage we drag with us when we
deploy ICTs to ‘bridge the divide’ between peoples, especially in the international context.
Looking at just the possession, use and access to information technologies does not preclude
attention to outcomes and impacts. Furthermore we often forget that these tools reflect the values
and intentions of their creators, which may do more to sustain privilege than dismantle it.
Another more recent and localized example can be found in the work of Virginia Eubanks (2007),
who worked with low-income women living in transitional circumstances participating in popular
technology programs in her local YWCA. She argues that emphasis on a “distributive paradigm,”
one that seeks to equally distribute technologies, is an inappropriate model to describe the social
relations that may or may not enable a person to be empowered or participate meaningfully in
shaping information society. Perhaps the most interesting part of her analysis was a series of
diagrams drawn by participants illustrating their visual annotations of the traditional ‘divide’
diagram of information ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots.’ While they did not all have the same features in
common, they demonstrated a remarkable familiarity with a variety of conceptions of social
23

exclusion that really just demonstrated that the digital divide is a reductive and faulty theory.
People deal with a lot more than if they’ve got a computer or internet, and the context in which
they’re using these contraptions matters a lot – it’s one thing to own your own laptop to watch cat
videos on the web, it’s another to do data entry for ten hours straight on an old and failing
workstation. While filling out a resume on a cell phone is much harder than it is on a desktop,
they’re both a big problem if you don’t know how to present yourself in terms that make sense to
employers. Giving people computers and telling them what buttons do is simply not enough, and
it may in fact be a deterrent. The digital divide may also be a pessimistic view, explained in adept
form by Eubanks, “A bridge over the digital divide underestimates the skills and resources of the
people on the ‘deficit’ side of the divide. It also distorts the very qualities of networked
communication that can make a powerful tool for social change: its flexibility, its openness and its
ability to connect people to people” (Eubanks 2007:10).
Its failings aside, many researchers have gone about the task of revealing the digital divide and
have found helpful ways to describe dimensions related to unequal distribution and use of ICTs:
from material access and a simplified set of skills (DiMaggio et al. 2001, Banks 2006, Van Dijk
and Hacker 2003) to mental access (interest in ICT) and usage opportunities (Van Dijk and Hacker
2003, Banks 2006) to perceptions of these variables (Porter and Donthu 2006) to the accumulative
ability to openly critique technology tools (Banks 2006). Van Dijk and Hacker express the situation
rather appropriately when they criticize the passing way most articles situate their findings:
…based on a rather static and superficial sociological analysis of the present situation.
Constructing rather arbitrary background variables of individual resources at a single
point in time does not make a theory that is able to relate to social and technological
development, that is to say, the level of society and technology. (Van Dijk and Hacker
2003).
They instead link ICT policy to long-lasting and concrete positive outcomes, specifically social
inclusion and equal distribution of resources for life chances, and suggest researchers place
emphasis on variations of classic factors that strongly determine socioeconomic status, like
education. In other words, I would argue that a positive outcome of the digital divide is that it has
led us back to the discourse, theory and tools that are rolled up into literacy. While my dissertation
24

research deals primarily with digital literacies, I would never wish to assume that these are the
extent or limit of the factors that empower people. In a sense this is just another reflection of my
view of community informatics (as established by Stoecker in 2005), that really we can see
ourselves as a subset of community development and work with many other models or methods in
an interdisciplinary or collaborative fashion.
The shift in focus from divide to literacy might also be desirable because the emphasis can be more
easily placed on working with individuals, who then in turn effect social change in the aggregate.
The learner ought to play a strong role in orienting their own education agenda, not just external
authorities like government, corporations or NGO’s. In this way access instead becomes a down
payment for literacy, empowerment and inclusion, not an end goal.
AND WHAT ABOUT OTHER LITERACIES?
So why examine digital literacy, as opposed to the many other compound affixations? What may
ultimately set digital literacy apart from classic media, visual, and information literacy is that it is
fundamentally about being an active player with use of digital tools and expression mediums. The
study of the influence of a hundred channels of information all produced by external authorities
might be an act of raising awareness, but viewers in the contemporary 28 have little or no ability to
shape what’s on the airwaves of radio or TV. They have limited access to the print-based
publishing world and little say in the formalized rules of visual design in print media. By contrast,
the discourse, ideas and content that perpetuate throughout the internet and via ICTs is in large
part authored by individuals and organizations of varying type and scope. Digital literacy is
represented by involved and directed activity or processes that are about interacting and producing;
it must go beyond watching, reading and even interpreting and understanding as much as it might
go beyond experience and comfort with computers and input devices. 29 Exposure to ICTs does not

translate to competence, even when it concerns young learners, but research has begun to suggest
that those who are indoctrinated into the active-producer norms of the internet will apply these
skills and conceptual models to classic media like TV (Shirky 2010). Writing code for your own
software program or painting a picture on the screen with a digital tablet are not easily reducible
to the “application” or “interpretation” of information in a classical sense. These tasks involve a
dimension of physical interaction, interactive and multi-step crafting and usually require attention
given to social context to be meaningful. The recent decade has produced and made accessible
more information and communication opportunity than ever known before, but leveraging the
quantity to produce quality is necessarily an active, iterative and reflexive process of inquiry,
interpretation and production.

BUILDING A RESEARCH QUESTION
The public library has a substantial array of possible social roles that translate into a variety of
continually transforming service roles, including some that relate directly and indirectly to digital
literacy. The ALA has contended that digital literacy ought to be of concern to libraries of all kinds,
including those in academic, public and school settings. Beyond commissioning the creation of
member-wide services like DigitalLearn.org and organizing a digital literacy task force, the Office
for Information Technology Policy has recently published “Conclusions & Recommendations for
Digital Literacy Programs and Libraries” (2013a) as a way to drive home several objectives,
paraphrased here:
•

Increase investment in digital literacy through going beyond general promotion to actual
support at the local, state, and federal levels. Investment is stipulated with several key
qualifiers, such as continued and simultaneous focus on traditional literacies, stress on a
combination of access and skills, as well as attention to real-world impacts like classroom
performance, workforce readiness and participation in civic life.

•

Develop and sustain partnerships in order to better enable funding, sustainable and high
quality programs and context-specific strategies. They suggest libraries must actively seek
partners out to add capacity, extend influence and minimize redundancies.

information these days. More often than not the term just refers to knowing how to do things like operate a mouse
and show some understanding of the conceptual models taken up by operating systems.

26

•

Strengthen research and assessment to help practitioners, scholars, community members
and other stakeholders demonstrate the value of investments. Studies like this one are cited
as key to determining success and aiding returns on future work as well as addressing
abstract issues such as definitions and boundaries, learning contexts and more.

•

Increase access to programming by enabling activities with a blend of appropriate
infrastructure, awareness and reflexivity, and flexible or contextual design. The statement
explicitly requires that initiatives must be “culturally sensitive and be aware of unique
needs and challenges of diverse populations” (pg 4), such as those learning English or
people with differing degrees of physical ability.

This call to action naturally raises several questions. Do public libraries have a similar awareness
and understanding of what digital literacy entails? Are they invested in abstract understandings of
digital literacy and do they have very specific metrics to evaluate it? To what extent are libraries
in places like Illinois carrying out these objectives? What do they look like, in reality, in different
kinds of settings? How might a scholar study digital literacy and library services in such a way
that we could better understand a broader context?
This report was released after I had set out on my study, but it is no coincidence that it matches
my topic nearly perfectly, as the research area of digital literacy has been escalating in importance
over the past several years, which is why my attention was drawn to it in the first place. Ultimately
it all starts with one concise yet rather complex central research question:
What is the role of the Illinois public library in fostering digital literacy?
Inherent to this inquiry are two assumptions that I continually examined throughout my
investigation:
1. What do the roles of the public library look like in action? What are the reported service
roles that relate to digital literacy?
2. How do librarians conceptualize and relate to digital literacy? What can I learn from this?
I further refined my research question by adding another filter: What does this look like in libraries
that operate in underserved communities? What more do we have to learn from these places? This
inquiry also had an assumption to unravel: how might someone define underserved communities?
27

I chose to approach this central question as a study of the public library as an institution. This was
operationalized by seeking to understand how libraries are fostering digital literacies through
activities, people, policies, and infrastructure. Effectively, these four lenses formed an
investigative framework for observing the context in which service roles happen. My sample,
explained in an upcoming section, demonstrates what “underserved” means in the context of this
study. I built off of this central question set with a series of more specific inquiries:
•

What do libraries think Digital Literacy is? How does this factor into policy? Why? Is the
operational definition of digital literacy evolving?

•

What kinds of equipment and internet access do they have? What activities happen? How
well do they work? Why are these things the case?

•

Who is involved, who do they work with, in terms of both organizations and individuals,
and how do they make those connections? Why do partnerships or collaborations happen
or matter?

•

Does engagement with the library affect the way patrons learn to use or experience digital
technologies? How? Why?

•

How do you measure the impacts related to digital literacy? What evidence of impacts do
we have? Why do we measure it in this way?

•

What might the library do moving forward in terms of digital literacy related service roles?
Why and do we want that?

This list of questions may seem overwhelming or nearly boundless at first. My study doesn’t
answer all of them, by any means. It instead sheds some light on portions or facets of all of them.
The next two sections clarify this by situating the gaps in data and detailing the research design.

LITERATURE REVIEW - RELATED STUDIES
In some respect this dissertation study is positioned as a response to the many studies on digital
literacy and public libraries today. Most often these studies fall into two categories: (1) broad,
sweeping initiatives that collect data comparing libraries all over the US, or (2) singular or small
collections of case studies showcasing particular programs in libraries. They differ from my work
for a number of reasons. First, they don’t examine the mid-level (state subset) context. In Illinois,
this means Chicago warps the view of the entire state for large-scale studies, and small-scale
studies are often compared to the only general data available, which is typically national. I seek to
better situate my data by localizing it and representing it in the terms of the conditions in which it
is actually encountered. Second, small-scale studies tend to be idealized, positive cases and often
overlook issues like structural privilege and system-level policies or arrangements like supportive
library boards. Frequently, these idyllic stories of libraries don’t feature the very real challenges
libraries that serve disadvantaged populations face and provide unrealistic expectations for best
practice models. Third, large-scale studies are typically less able to note the full scope of important
activities or people, elements that often determine the real impact of both infrastructure assets and
technology policies.
Fortunately, the body of scholarship on topics related to digital literacy programs and public
computing infrastructure in libraries is considerable, especially as the library’s future role
continues to be negotiated. As a comprehensive literature review of all of this would be a
dissertation unto itself, this section instead presents a selection of a few pertinent examples for
analysis.

GOVERNMENT-DRIVEN PROMOTION
The US government formally recognizes the importance of digital literacy in stimulating the
development of both individuals and communities. www.digitalliteracy.gov, a web portal backed
by an impressive group of government organizations, 30 features a variety of resources, including

30

The U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of Education, U.S. Department of Energy, Federal

Communications Commission, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, U.S. Department of Labor, Institute of Museum and Library Services, Corporation for National
and Community Service, and U.S. Department of Agriculture.

29

activities/tutorials, curriculum, research, videos and more. A significant portion of these resources
are specifically designed for libraries, such as exemplary programs found in case studies or
instructional documents. One example is the Museums, Libraries and 21st Century Skills (2009)
report, popular at the time of my proposal, which provides a self-assessment tool for institutions
interested in guiding themselves along the government-sanctioned digital literacy development
routes. The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) promotes what they refer to as 21st
century skills as a compelling national imperative, a requirement for maintaining U.S. global
competitiveness and ensuring personal success. Throughout the publication they continually
compare 20th and 21st century library and museum characteristics, emphasizing that in the current
context these organizations need to be interactive, audience-driven places. They must collaborate
with other groups and assume multidirectional organizational structures, all in the name of lifelong learning and education in a school system and workforce increasingly dominated by nonroutine tasks. 31 The report’s self-evaluation tool is somewhat vague, referring to approximate
percentages that cannot quite summarize or measure complex goals, competencies and skills, but
it succeeds in calling attention to several important factors: (1) institutional assets, including
people, IT/collection infrastructure, programs, etc. (2) leadership and management issues, such as
planning or sustainability, (3) the importance of partnering with other anchor institutions, and (4)
accountability for measuring and improving all of these aspects. The result is that libraries that
make use of this kind of evaluation will likely have an appropriately broad focus but probably fall
short when it comes to working to operationalize contested or complicated concepts like creativity,
diversity, or effective communication.
Realistically, though, if a librarian from a rural or underserved community were to read this report,
they’d likely have a lot of trouble making sense of it for their own context. They wouldn’t
necessarily know what innovative applications of ICTs could look like in smaller and low-budget
libraries, nor would they know how to run educational programs for patrons to, say, help them
understand the ethical and legal implications as well as opportunities present in sharing videos on
YouTube. They may not even have anyone on the staff who has ever posted a video to the internet

in the first place. While not always the case, this is nonetheless a significant challenge when
pushing for the adoption of digital literacy empowerment agendas; reports like these assume a
nominal level of familiarity and participation in internet-driven culture and expectations.

NATIONAL SURVEYS ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES
As mentioned, many joint studies have inquired about the importance of public computing and
information access in libraries in recent years. In a collaborative study conducted by the Pew
Internet and American Life Project and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
(Estabrook, Witt and Rainie 2007) researchers found that the internet is most certainly the frontline go-to source for many patrons and that people come to the library with different needs
depending on their internet access at home and in the workplace. The report concluded, in part,
that e-government is no longer an option, but a necessity. Findings such as this help us to
understand the potential the library holds for aiding a variety of populations in crucial information
access and help to supply some of the reasons libraries remain a key site for digital literacy
concerns.
Perhaps the most famous collection of nation-wide and case-based studies on internet services and
related policies in public libraries are the assemblage of works belonging to Charles McClure, Paul
Jaeger and John Bertot. Together, in collaboration with other scholars, institutions and
organizations, including the American Library Association, 32 the Institute of Museum and Library
Services, 33 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Information Institute of the Florida State
University, and a number of research centers 34 at the University of Maryland, they have published
an enormous amount of material on e-government, networking and broadband, and information
policy in public libraries.
Of their studies, the series of national surveys 35 conducted periodically from 1994 to 2012 on
public libraries and the internet are a key reference point for this project. Though the details have

varied over the years, they have helped to establish a kind of census for public computing and
internet services in public libraries and contain information ranging from the basics, such as the
number of hours a given library is open, to more detailed measures, such as the services available
to patrons or the speed of the provided internet. The results of these surveys provide a global
reference point for where libraries are (and have been), all the way down to a state-level analysis.
They are ideal if a researcher wants to know what the technology-related operating expenditures
for rural or high poverty public libraries might look like, or even if they want to know whether to
expect digital cameras for loan in one of these places. Unfortunately, while the survey data
illustrates a powerful narrative about the trends present in the midst of our information society,
they don’t tell us much about the individual stories that make up the numbers. Individual
technology program innovations, remarkable people knit together by social capital, and the
nuances of local policy are necessarily absent from such studies, which is precisely why there is
an identified need for a more granular approach to better discern social impact. It is important to
note that these authors are not ignorant of the limitations of the large surveys; they often call for
additional research, such as investigation into the differences funding systems make in rural library
service provision (Real et al. 2014). Beyond this, states like Illinois, which are in many ways
drastically defined by a single city, are difficult to reconcile with the sort of data afforded by big
surveys.

ILLINOIS CASE STUDIES
Few case studies specifically on Illinois public libraries 36 exist, particularly any involving rigorous
research on workshops, programs or initiatives related to digital literacy. A notable exception is

36

Studies on digital literacy and other community institutions and organizations, such as community technology

centers or after school programs, do exist but are not covered here. Nearly every community has a public library and
nearly every one of those offers public computing. Many offer programs and services that directly relate to digital
literacy but we don’t have much data on this. The fact that other organizations work to address digital literacy needs
often independently of the public library (and that none of this seems to be reflected in the literature) is part of the
motivation behind this investigation.

the Chicago Public Library (CPL), which has been consistently recognized 37 for pioneering a
totally different approach to teen spaces through YOUmedia (Tripp 2011, Larson et al 2013) and,
more recently, an engagement-focused website. They are also home to the Cybernavigators, 38 paid
adjunct and part-time staff who aid users in a variety of tasks on public computer workstations.
Cybernavigators help patrons to both find critical, relevant information, such as government
resources, as well as actively produce web content, even if it might be as simple as posting a
resume to a job-finding website. They are an excellent example of a ‘resource’ that fosters the kind
of digital literacy that often goes beyond simple computer basics (Williams 2010a, Duffy et al
2011). Williams (2010b, 2011) postulates that they may be a sign of what’s to come in the world
of library reference, and, like so many aspects of the public library, are a service measurably tied
to social capital.
Locally, a similar program exists at The Urbana Free Library (TUFL), known simply as the
Technology Volunteers, the primary difference being that they are library and information science
students who work for free. Both of these programs involve an interesting dimension of policy.
Volunteers or adjunct staff enable an extension of services regularly offered by the library, but do
so in a more informal manner; they may not carry the same duties or obligations as an ordinary
librarian (Rodgers 2010, Kent et al. 2010).
While they are seldom the object of study for articles published in academic journals, interesting
or remarkable digital literacy programs do find mention in magazines, newspapers, blogs and other
less formal publications. Wilmette39 Public Library’s Game Design Club, for instance, was run as
a feature in the March 2009 edition of Computers in Libraries. The club, comprised mostly of
teens, could easily be identified as what Henry Jenkins (2006) would call participatory culture:
informal affiliation, expression, and collaborative problem-solving, the kind of activities that, by
many definitions, are competencies underlying digital literacy. Participants learn—often from one

A John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation report (2012) references a wide range of areas of research

channeled through YouMedia, including outreach to deal with bullying, the impact of digital media on ethics in young
people, networked youth and participatory politics, connected learning, ethnographies on digital device use and more.

another as much as from facilitators—to program in an environment where media production is
considered as important as consumption. They tackle projects that involve cultural mash ups, game
design, mathematical modeling and free and open source software (FOSS). Wilmette could be
cited as an example of the public library as an informal media production lab, which might merit
long-term and in-depth analysis of individual and community impacts. This kind of analysis could
take many forms, including cost-benefit evaluation, mapping outcomes to timeframes, comparison
to similar school, and business or nonprofit programs; or it could follow a rhetorical approach,
such as presenting what Wilmette might say about our current moment of increased technological
convergence (Sey and Fellows 2009).

DEPICTING THE SOCIAL IMPACTS OF PUBLIC ICT ACCESS
More recently, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, IMLS and the Information School at the
University of Washington have taken steps to further investigate the substantive impacts of ICT
use in US public libraries. In their report, Opportunity for All: How the American Public Benefits
from Internet Access at U.S. Libraries (Becker et al. 2010), they identify worthy and meaningful
impacts for patrons, and by extension their communities. They are, in effect, organized into
categories that are eminent examples of social connection, education, employment, health and
wellness, e-government, personal finance, and community and civic engagement. The report was
multi-method and depended principally on telephone and internet surveys with tens of thousands
of patrons as well as 400 libraries. It extended into interviews and case studies, which makes it
similar to the two-phase approach used in this dissertation.
While the Opportunity for All report provides a good overview of the kinds of ways internet use
in public libraries help individuals and local communities, it takes a definitively promotional
position. It highlights strengths more than challenges and uses qualitative data mostly to decorate
quantitative findings, instead of as the ingredients for individually told stories. The report does
have the kind of focus that I would argue is akin to the angle of my project, as it pays some attention
to people in specific disadvantaged demographics, such as those in poverty and those from
racial/ethnic minorities, but it ultimately breaks users into a relatively vague typology based on
their frequency of use of the computers. It would be more interesting to understand more about the
identities of these users and the ways they actively shape and produce information as they take
part in computing activities related to health, education and more—and, perhaps more importantly,
34

what these activities mean to them and how stakeholders judge their effect on the community.
Fortunately, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation released a second portion of the impact study
that more robustly contextualizes their case study sites in connection to their global findings
(Becker et al. 2011). This material provides more insight into the relationships within the network
of influences on public computing and social outcomes and provides recommendations based on
these findings, such as supporting staff in technical training or collaborating with community
organizations. The locations featured in this report are all larger, in comparison with the Illinois
sample set of this dissertation, and the study employed a broader, deeper and more structured set
of variables for study—in general appearing more deductive in design.
The Opportunity for All report is only one of many studies on the impact of public access to ICT
and multimedia production technologies. I bring it up here because of its particular concern for
libraries and disadvantaged people and because it is an empirical study that tries to illustrate
discernable downstream effects. As of yet, research indicates that we don’t fully understand the
implications of the public access model in terms of sustainability, users, usage patterns and
prolonged social outcomes, despite being in place for many years in varied form across the globe
(Sey and Fellows 2009). Critics contend that commercial, market-based solutions, intensified
mobile and personal computing, and the increased possibility for ubiquitous learning (Cope and
Kalantzis 2009) may supplant the need for traditional forms of public computing. Consequently,
one of the main reasons I frame the public library as a network of relationships and resources that
foster digital literacy is because it transfers the emphasis to arrangements that lead to learning and
empowerment, which depend on an array of factors, as previously stated, people, activities, and
policies in addition to infrastructure. In other words, if we want to appropriately gauge social
impacts, we have to paint a picture that goes beyond decontextualized or general numbers about
access, as well as separate, concentrated glimpses of case studies, and work to connect the two.
It is important to pause to take stock of the discourse in operation behind much of this literature.
It may not be fair to say that the politics of government, universities, libraries, and library patrons
are all in alignment when it comes to the context of ICT. In fact, words like empowerment are
sometimes used as tools to advance hidden agendas and mask what may or may not be contestable
social transformations. Who or what the government conceptualizes as an empowered (or
informed) citizen may just as well serve as a vessel for continuation of extant power rifts and
35

dominating social norms. Shifting the library from its traditional roles—archival, pedagogy,
legitimization and gatekeeping—to what might be characterized as a postmodern orientation—
interactivity, empowerment, cultural pluralism, and communitarianism—is inherently political
(Hand 2005), and something that I believe will continually run up against resistance and
infiltration. The internet cannot be summed up by any central discourse, but the tools used to access
and make meaning of it are very often the products of commercial enterprise and thereby subject
to the influences of capitalism and the regulations of the market. We see this very much in action
as libraries struggle to make public goods out of commoditized information in our current phase
of increased marketization (Burawoy 2005b). Battles are waiting to be fought over intellectual
property produced or remixed with library assets, or systems of eBook distribution and
‘borrowing.’ Companies like Facebook and Google walk a dangerous line between privacy,
transparency and encouragement of open access and sharing; their practices, policies and ethical
dilemmas will work their way into the social impacts yielded by the public library. In one sense I
like the idea of making sure everyone has the ability to share their identity and establish social
connection on the internet, but in another sense I’m less excited if the only—or institutionalized—
way to do this is through Facebook. As it stands right now, some of the main uses for public
computers, as well as new ICT mediums like cell phones, are commercially driven interactions
and entertainment. If public libraries are to be seen as institutional intermediaries between citizens
and their government, and connectivity, content and competencies are a requirement for
meaningful citizenship and input into globalized cultural flows (Hand 2005, Castells 1997), then I
see it as our duty as researchers to move forward from descriptive analysis, as it is commonly seen
in the literature above. We need to grant recognition of power, both when we establish what we
mean by digital literacy and when we measure literacy-related outcomes.

36

RESEARCH DESIGN
Research for this project was conducted for more than a year and consequently involved an
evolving, inductively-driven focus both in terms of methods and the changing nature of the sites
being studied. Principally, it was carried out in stages in order to address the main gaps in data
identified earlier: to achieve a balance between breadth and depth as well as address a large share
of the different dimensions of the context that relate to library roles and digital literacies.
This section reviews the framing of this research as a work of social science research and
scholarship in community informatics, a field connected to library and information science, and
then moves on to elucidate the way data was collected and analyzed in phases.

AS A WORK OF COMMUNITY INFORMATICS
Community Informatics (CI) is a relatively recent field of scholarship, practice and activism that
rose to prominence in the early 2000’s, driven and developed initially by scholars in the US, UK
and Canada like Michael Gurstein (2002, 2007), Leigh Keeble and Brian Loader (2001), Randy
Stoecker (2005) and Larry Stillman (and Stocker 2008), Kate Williams and Joan Durrance
(2008) and later by an increasingly international body of researchers. 40 Its central goal is to
provide communities with the means to address community-defined needs. In community
informatics these means are enabled by, or considered in relation to, information communication
technologies and associated information processes.
Several of the terms at stake in this understanding are contested, which has motivated much of
the discussion behind the scope and purpose of the field. Communities might be defined as
historical or geographically-bound neighborhoods, virtual groups with shared practices or as
distributed networks of people with shared social identities like the gay community. The call to
provide communities with the means to address needs introduces another set of complications, as
‘means’ might include skills for individuals, resources like internet infrastructure, social
connections and relationships or even ideologies or consciousness. And, finally, how needs are
defined, and by whom as well as which assets they are posed in relation to, significantly

determines the arrangement of perspectives and solutions. It is nearly impossible for all members
of a given community to help identify and solve problems, or drive or inform research, and
likewise it is nearly impossible to solve problems or conduct research that will impact all people
equally or fairly. By its nature community informatics must be a negotiated process and we do
our best to balance utilitarian means and needs as well as those that might be characteristic of
minority or socially excluded groups. Typically this means community informatics addresses
components of formidable social challenges like education, community health, civic engagement
and more. Scholars in related areas, like urban planning or social work, may also take issue with
the field’s chosen focus on the impact of digital technologies, or, sometimes even more broadly,
with informatics in general, but I would advocate, in kind with Stoecker (2005) that it is best to
envision ourselves as a supporting cast in the larger field and mission of community
development.
Despite these foundational and definitional quandaries the field finds a remarkable degree of
unity in our methods: we are activists and social engineers because we are actively seeking to
solve problems. Community informatics is interdisciplinary, so it benefits from a strong coalition
comprised of critical inquiry derived from the humanities, theories and research methods from
the social sciences, and design and practice-oriented problem-solving from engineering and
library and information science. I believe our diversity, as well as our commitment to validate
the usefulness of our knowledge in community contexts makes us a powerful and recognizable
movement. 41
In particular, the University of Illinois, as a land-grant and state institution, has a duty to serve
their local and state communities through commitment to public engagement 42 and to the
discovery and application of knowledge to improve and serve the greater society in which we live.

methodology and scholarship can be found in the section on Positioning My Scholarship (p. 57).

38

Not only do we have an obligation to break out into various forms of community, but we must also
help acknowledge and understand the valuable knowledge present within these communities.
This dissertation is therefore a work of community informatics in several regards:
1) It investigates how libraries and digital literacies relate to challenges that affect many
communities, like public education and life-long learning, civic participation and social
inclusion, job training and employment, economic stress and social services and more.
2) It seeks to inform the field of library and information science with knowledge and
perspectives from active practitioners in public libraries and bring community knowledge
into the scholarship of the University of Illinois.
3) It employs a blend of social science research methods, critical socio-technical perspectives
and directs attention to socially excluded populations.
I set out on this project years ago with an initial research question that relied on an understanding
of ‘library roles’ and ‘digital literacy’ that I knew would change. This was, in fact, the explicit
purpose of the inductive approach, the goal and opportunity to better understand not only what
these terms meant in the context of my sample but also why they meant this, and what we could
learn from it to help libraries, patrons and communities.
I chose to break up and frame the work as I did for a few reasons. I wanted to adequately address
the gap in data on libraries that are located in underserved communities so I chose a selection of
libraries that could help establish the breadth of issues, but also still contain unifying characteristics
and identities in their service roles and populations. I also sought to gather a diversity of data about
innovations and challenges that could be shared to help the field advance its work. A series of
stories about a single library might be inspiring, but not hold relevance elsewhere. A statistical
report on the status of many libraries might miss those stories, however. Taking the middle ground
by doing a series of case studies allowed me to hear enough stories and situate the data enough
within a limited context to make more actionable data, lending credibility to the work as being
more in the vein of community informatics by being more accountable to practice and
implementation.

39

SAMPLE
As stated, a central objective of this dissertation is to examine the role the public library plays in
fostering digital literacies in underserved communities with significant socially excluded
populations. Therefore the first stage of data collection included a specialized sample of public
libraries positioned in geographic communities with the following characteristics:
•
•
•
•

Large African American and/or Latino/a populations
High rates of poverty and/or unemployment
Rural locale
Counties outside of the Chicagoland area 43

The sample was assembled through use of US census data cross-referenced and enhanced with
supplementary resources like mapping tools.44 A formal GIS was not employed, though it was
considered as an accepted way for determining population coverage for libraries based on the
characteristics of surrounding communities (Hertel and Sprague 2007). It was important to make
sure the data was able to be double-checked by the constituent libraries, and that the work was
replicable; to require ESRI ArcMap or similar software, while useful and cutting-edge, would be
less accessible. Instead, all of the visual analysis tools used were provided for free by government,
corporate and university entities and publicly available online.
The following section details how each component of the sample was gathered and explains why
each characteristic is a good measure of an underserved or disadvantaged community.

is found in the story of Reverend Elijah Lovejoy, a central Illinois white abolitionist publisher who
was eventually killed for his efforts by an angry mob seeking to burn down his printing press
warehouse. The contemporary population distributions of Illinois are a reflection of a complicated
process of settlement, slavery, sundown towns, black codes, servitude, white flight and suburban
sprawl (Cha-Jua 2000, Eichholz 2004). As a result a number of concentrated African American
communities exist in and nearby both major and minor towns and municipalities in the state. Like
many people of color in the US they face racism in both structural and interpersonal forms.
The US has always been a country of immigrants. 46 Historically in Illinois the majority of migrant
populations have settled in Chicago, but in recent years we have seen a larger number of Latino/as
begin to find work in some of the rural communities spread around the state. Additionally, the Pew
Hispanic Center (Passel and Cohn 2011) estimates an unauthorized immigrant population of
approximately 525,000 in Illinois, presumably largely Hispanic (nation-wide 87% are from
Mexico or Latin America) with a significant portion existing outside of Chicago. Nation-wide 25%
of jobs in farming are taken up by unauthorized immigrants and adults among these populations
are disproportionately likely to be poorly educated (Passel and Cohn 2009). This is not to mention
the abundance of challenges these workers might face as a result of lack of legal representation in
the workplace, or general discrimination against Latino/a groups in the US. We do not have data
on the specific locations of undocumented workers in Illinois, but it is reasonable to assume that
since many of them work in farming, libraries in small town and rural communities with substantial
food-production related employment could serve them. Many migrant populations follow
preexisting familial and cultural networks in their settlement patterns, so it also stands to reason
that vulnerable populations could easily be present in areas with large proportions of Hispanics
who come from high-throughput immigration backgrounds.
Many individuals within African American and Latino/a communities must deal with multiple
forms of discrimination and are in certain need of information and technology resources. Though
the homes of family and friends continue to be the primary (and possibly preferred) point of access

46

Specifically a diverse Latino/a immigrant population, which has known many names and compositions over the

years. Clara Rodriguez (2000) gives a detailed account of US census counting as it applies to ethnicity in the US, if
readers are interested in learning more about the validity and importance of this kind of data.

for all internet users, African American and Hispanic populations are much more likely to make
use of public libraries for internet access than any other public institutions that might provide it,
including schools, churches, and community centers (Gant et al. 2010, Manjarrez and Schoembs
2011). Public libraries have an obligation to their entire community, including groups that are
historically and statistically socially excluded like African Americans and Latinos; therefore it was
important to include these ethnic qualifiers as a primary determining factor in building a sample
to represent underserved populations.
Poverty is another substantive measure of a socially excluded or underserved community. Though
it is an insufficient and outdated metric, 47 one that does not accurately reflect government benefits,
work expenses, cost of living, and medical or insurance fees, it has been generally accepted and
used as a measure since the 1960’s (DeParle, Gebeloff, and Tavernise 2011). Since libraries are
often very reliant on local funding and Illinois is in the midst of an ongoing budget crisis (Kniffel
2010), high rates of poverty easily coincide with libraries that are unable to sustain service
offerings. This, combined with the fact that the new measures for poverty show that the social
service safety net (which I believe includes public libraries) makes a big difference in the lives of
those who would be in poverty (DeParle, Gebeloff, and Tavernise 2011), means poverty is an
important criterion for inclusion when creating a sample of underserved communities.
My sample draws from 2010 decennial census data 48 to provide a list of places and census tracts
with a single (not combined) racial/ethnic minority population 49 proportion of greater than 20%.
This list has been cross-referenced with a composite of the most recent Small Area Income and
Poverty Estimates (SAIPE; 2009) and American Community Survey (ACS; 2005-2009) material
to identify several target areas with a percentage of people whose income in the past 12 months
was below the poverty level of 18% or higher. 50 Comparatively, the state-wide average without

I used the most recent redistricting data, where available.

49

Black or African American of one race, not listed as Hispanic or Latino/a, Hispanic or Latino/a of any race, based

on Census 2010 data.
50

This measure was based on the 2005-2009 ACS data, which sometimes had high margins of error. If the lowest

bound (the estimate minus the margin of error) of this measure was below 20% I fell back on Census 2000 data poverty
rates for comparison – if this rate was 15% or higher I kept the entry.

42

the Chicagoland counties is approximately 8% for African Americans and 5% for Latino/a groups,
and under 2% for all others, and poverty for all people is about 13%. 51 To further reduce the sample
and provide an improved composite measure of poverty I selected locations on the basis of food
stamps 52 (over 20%) and rates of unemployment 53 (over 14%). Once places had been identified I
located nearby54 public libraries. I should be clear in stating that the percentage requirements were
not established on the basis of a strict measure of statistical significance, nor am I assuming a
correlation between racial/ethnic minority status and poverty. Instead they served as a cut-off point
with which I could limit my sample to something reasonable in terms of both size and inclusivity.

51

Numbers calculated manually, using a table of all counties (besides the Chicagoland ones) and 2010 census race

data, and a table with all precincts and townships with 2005-2009 ACS poverty data.

is probably lower in the areas outside of Chicago.
53

Percent unemployed of those in the civilian labor force; the ACS 2005-2009 estimate. For reference, the Illinois

54

This was done on the basis of simple visual measurements with maps. In most cases towns had a single library, or

one right nearby. In the event of two equidistant libraries both were listed, with preference given to the one in the
larger adjacent city. I did look over state and census tract lines in several cases, but, curiously, populations were
usually sharply divided by them.

In cases with multiple public library locations the ones inside and nearby census tracts with the
greatest percentage of ethnic minority populations were selected. See an example below for what
this might look like in a typical Illinois city:

In some ways Illinois poverty exists in its harshest form for rural areas in the south and southwest
regions, where residents are typically older, less healthy and face challenges in terms of public
transportation, availability of jobs, education opportunities, and affordable housing (Harper and
Edwards 2004, Miller 2007). Essentially, patrons living in a rural areas have less access to some
resources, and limited access to others at a greater cost. For example, in most rural communities
the public library is the only available public access to the internet, and in many it is the fastest
broadband in town. Additionally, adults in impoverished rural areas are often hard-pressed to find
opportunities for continuing education, especially when it comes to digital literacy, and, for rural
areas in particular, broadband is essential for economic growth (Stenberg et al. 2009).
Compounding the issue, race and ethnicity are strongly correlated with rural poverty (USDA
2004), and often occur together. Libraries in these areas also face challenges in terms of technology
infrastructure and stable funding (Real et al. 2014). I went to some length to ensure my sample
included a representation of rural communities with significant poverty, more information on how
I did this can be found in Appendix B.

45

WHY NOT CHICAGO?
I decided to leave the Chicagoland area 55 out of my project completely for two reasons. First,
Chicago is often the dominant player in any analysis of the state. In terms of income and ethnic
minority percentages it doubles or triples the state-wide averages with its influence alone (see table
below). However, of the approximately 800 public libraries in the state about two-thirds of them
exist outside of the core and collar areas. Any analysis of the rural and small-town reality of the
rest of Illinois is dramatically thrown off by the involvement of Chicago. To understand and
address the needs of these kinds of downstate communities it is appropriate to consider them apart.
Second, I removed Chicago as a matter of practicality. Any project is limited by fiscal and temporal
factors and to do an analysis on the level of this dissertation for Chicago (Cook County) alone
would be three or four times the complexity. This leaves the door open for future comparative
analysis and investigation in these areas. 56

46

the efforts of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the
Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) one can easily see gaps in coverage (see
figures below). If one were to conduct a study of public libraries in Chicago, as compared to
somewhere else in the state, the assumption of potential internet availability and speed would
simply be different.

Figure 2 – Broadband in Illinois, in terms of coverage and speed, from http://www.broadbandmap.gov. There are
large gaps in coverage in rural areas and some libraries may not be able to secure affordable internet that is strong
enough to support an entire computer lab. Many libraries in small towns also offer the only fast and free internet
available for visitors from neighboring rural areas.

DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES
For each library I opened a simple case file, where I collected a variety of notes, literature and
multimedia related to library services that could support or promote digital literacies. Before each
visit I:
1. Consulted existing state-wide and national data available on the library, including the
Illinois Public Library Annual Report (IPLAR) and Bibliostat Collection, L2: Library

47

Learning, IMLS census data and other resources. 57 I also investigated the history of the
primary communities each library presumably served, which included a brief review of
census reports for economic and demographic factors. Additionally, I conducted basic
internet research on recent news related to the town and public library 58 as well as found
information such as the largest employers in the area.
2. I visited each library’s website (if available) to see how they presented themselves, their
mission and their roles related to digital literacy, such as computer lab policies or online
tutorials for electronic resources. In a sense this was also an implicit measure of the
library’s concern for digital literacies – not every library had a website and many were not
in active use.
I then made arrangements to visit on a day when I could talk to the library director for at least half
an hour. It was important to make a direct connection to the director, if at all possible, in order to
ensure I was presented the official viewpoint and policies of the library and to also establish
permission and a rapport for continued research. Each library was sent an official invitation on
University of Illinois letterhead and informed of the focus, intentions, value and involvements of
the research. As with most studies of this sort some libraries were harder to get to than others,
requiring several phone calls, e-mails and so on. Several of the larger libraries referred me to
specialized staff and a few sites were non-responsive. One location declined participation.
Then, over the course of several months, I drove to visit each library in person. Generally visits
were kept to just a few hours on one day as many trips involved multiple cities and tight schedules.
At each site I:

1. Observed static elements related to digital tools, taking down notes, photographs 59 and
desktop screenshots and whatever literature I could pick up. For each library I tried to draw
a map of the public computing layouts and take pictures of workstations, if possible. This
data collection process was similar to traditional ethnographic field methods, but much
shorter term and with greater emphasis on technology use and an in-depth look at public
workstations. I was able to bring my expertise in usability and technical support to bear
during observations in ways not often present in other library studies. For instance, at every
library I assessed computer capabilities by trying them out for a test drive and recording
my notes. After doing some basic measures of bandwidth and noting aspects like what
programs they had installed I spent some time seeing how tamper-proof computer security
settings were in public lab arrangements – if I was able to view invisible files, 60 edit start
up processes and execute programs stored on external media. I also had some sense for
interface and usability concerns, noting how easy it was to find certain information and
programs on the computer as well as spatial arrangements of computers that might enable
surveillance, collaboration or accessibility.
2. I spent most of my time at each site interviewing librarians. I employed a flexible interview
schedule (see appendix A) which evolved over the course of my research and was also
adapted to each site. Interviews were driven by following the critical incident technique
(Woolsey 1986), an exploratory qualitative method that relies on accounts of behaviors and
events given in the words of a respondent. In other words, I did my best to avoid asking
general opinions and tried to guide respondents to give examples. Unlike scripted
interviews and surveys my objective was not to capture specific pre-defined variables but
instead ask about the array of agents and factors that influence happenings in the library
that relate to digital literacies. Therefore I recorded many kinds of stories during interviews
and paid attention to a diverse set of points of observation, sometimes ones that even
59

Acquiring consent as required, photos never involved people and screen shots never captured personal files.

60

This may seem innocuous but might be a privacy issue. One patron may come work on a MS Word document that

includes their SSN and save it several times, only to be logged off abruptly by an automated time-keeping system. A
patron following them could force their temporary save files, which are normally invisible, open for use. This isn’t
dramatically different than a user accidentally leaving their data on a computer or poor data clean-up policies but it is
an example of a potential issue.

49

initially seemed irrelevant, and encouraged respondents to talk about the topics in ways
that made sense to them.
The questions I chose were an attempt to capture the context of digital literacy activities and related
perspectives in an operationalized form. Each contributed to illustrating some dimension of the
relationships between infrastructure, activities, people and policies that form the basis of this
context. They were, however, generally starting points and not an exhaustive list that was forced
to fit all interviews. Many undoubtedly required follow-ups and often times respondents drifted
off topic with their stories, sometimes in surprisingly good ways.
The interview question set was specifically structured around my initial focus on critical and
creative digital literacies, and therefore intended to help capture the following:
•

Service population – The first question I asked didn’t have anything to do with
technology. I wanted to know who the library felt they were serving and how they identified
and spoke about them. I knew in many cases it would be based on their funders but I
specifically asked about all groups who used the library, including those who were not
cardholders. I did this because I wanted to confirm or question one of my first assumptions:
that these libraries were providing services to underserved communities and populations. I
continued to explore who the library felt they were serving and how they knew throughout
most of my questions on programs and policies.

•

Understandings of digital literacy – Overall, I sought to gather fundamentals behind the
narrative related to digital literacy in each public library. This meant I was paying attention
to many factors, such as chosen language or terms, familiarity with concepts, explicitly
identified service roles and more. The goal, generally, was to understand what digital
literacy meant to each library as an institution, as expressed through how directors and
librarians thought about it, created activities related to it and chose to support it (or not)
with policy and access to information tools. This often connected to other questions, such
as if the library considered itself to be a community center or pro-active education provider.

•

Generative uses of digital tools – One of the key ways digital literacy is distinguished
from information literacy or media literacy is that it includes emphasis on interactive use
of tools. While I was interested in activities dedicated to access, evaluation and sharing of
50

information with public computers, this was just a starting point. Many public libraries
have scanners, digital cameras, projectors and color printers that involve production as part
of information transfer processes. All kinds of library programs might make use of recent
digital tools, whether they are run by library staff, volunteers, or if they are simply activities
driven by external group activities that happen to take place in the space. They might
include, for instance, a paper-based arts and crafts kids event that prints media off the web,
or a group of community historians scanning photos to post them on Flickr. Generative use
is not necessarily limited to the production of physical objects or electronic data, but could
also include ideas. In my questions I focused less on what the interviewee speculated users
were “doing with the computers” and instead the possibilities digital tools enabled,
explained in examples supported and promoted by the library. The concentration on recent
use of tools by groups and library programs made it possible for interviewees to look at a
calendar to think about objects and undertakings instead of relying fully on memory. I
complemented this measure by asking many participants what they thought about the
concept of the library as an information production space.
•

Critical views of digital tools – In most interviews I inquired about when technologies
didn’t work as intended or the problems people had with them. I also sought to find out
ways digital tools were being used for inquiry or in divergent or deviant ways, or when
librarians were finding creative solutions to deal with technological constraints. Some of
my questions were also directed at understanding their chosen policies, such as limiting
who could use the computers, in which ways and for how long to understand the sorts of
relationships and activities they wished to promote. More often than not this led to
discussions on the affordances of various services, interfaces and mediums as well as
library support capacities.

•

Complements to other measures – I made some effort to collect data that could be
comparable to that collected by the survey work by McClure, Bertot and Jaeger. These
studies didn’t look into issues like lab layouts and modularity or what the internet’s actual
functional speed was, compared to its officially stated speed, and I wanted to make sure I
could demonstrate the difference. I asked about what staff did to assist users with
computers, to get detailed descriptions of what was often reduced to phrases like ‘one-toone’ tutoring.
51

I began my interview by asking about programs related to digital tools, broadly defined as more
than just computers, including tools of media production, and then let this flow into collaborations
and community networking as well as policy and issues like infrastructure. Not every interview
covered the same ground; if something was particularly unusual about a given library I dug deeper
into it. At nearly every library I interviewed more than one librarian, which allowed their question
sets to complement one another.

DATA ANALYSIS
In sum, the series of observations and interviews comprise a collection of cases. Case studies are
a kind of inquiry into a specific social context that enable researchers to decipher the complexities
inherent in true-to-life situations. They can help to establish validity by accommodating diversity
and uncertainty, and they facilitate the emergence and comprehensive development of research
ideas because they can incorporate multiple sources of data (Berg 2004, Eisenhardt 1989). They
are often used as the basis to develop theory in an inductive fashion by “recognizing patterns of
relationships among constructs within and across cases and their underlying logical arguments”
(Eisenhardt and Graebner 2007, also see Eisenhardt 1989 and Stake 1994). I was drawn to
happenings on account of uniqueness or ordinariness, and the application of my external
theoretical frame: digital literacy. In this sense my work was somewhere between exploratory and
descriptive (Yin 1994); it elicited elements of discovery, confirmation, snapshot descriptions, and
emphasis on issues encountered on multiple visits and in outliers. It allowed for more robust
storytelling that helped to challenge presuppositions and distinguish new constructs.
Functionally, interviews were recorded on my cell phone and transcribed for content analysis.
Specifically, this meant studying, sorting and analyzing the text based on the frame of my topic.
My chosen method for this was a two sweep coding process, based on Berg’s (2004) interpretation
of Strauss’ (1987) grounded theory approach. I read through the data multiple times, first
annotating it with short snippets of description and comments on thematic observations. Then,
after I had familiarized myself with the material I went through a second time to cut it down to
stories and topics of interest and began to build second-level codes that tracked ongoing themes. I
found that this process was not formulaic, as I skipped around to different interviews and question
responses to ask of the data specific and consistent sets of questions, without an overlay of classic
socio-analytic categories like race or class, because those didn’t always fit the frame. On the
52

contrary, in my experience with sociology technology-human interactivity elements are often
misunderstood, overly criticized or ignored entirely. 61 I then selected a series of signature stories
found in each site which illustrated different dimensions and issues related to library roles and
digital literacy. I took care to avoid redundancy between sites in my stories, even though topics
like e-readers came up frequently, and instead chose those that I felt were most representative or
revealing of the issues at hand. Though I knew my analysis would, by nature, not be neutral I did
my best to find examples of both challenges and successes, as well as opposing viewpoints and
contradictions. Part of the reason I needed to be selective was that despite asking the same set of
core questions at each location the data I was provided varied. In some locations, for instance, I
didn’t even have to draw a map of computing spaces, as the library already had a handout with
one, whereas in other locations I couldn’t see all parts of the library. As such the observations were
considered to be as subjective and incidental as the interviews: they were dependent on the
circumstantial constraints in which my visit took place. After the conclusion of the study site
stories were submitted for review and scrutiny by my research committee and location and
personal references were then anonymized.
This dissertation study is unusual in its methodological approach partially because of its adherence
to asset-based data analysis. Earlier when I introduced it as a work of community informatics I
identified the field as a study and pursuit to address community needs, and while it is true that all
communities have problems and needs, starting with this as the fundamental focus tends to make
a given work about remedying deficiencies and deficits, rather than recognizing and leveraging
strengths and assets. Underserved communities are frequently described and defined primarily in
terms of their problems, as I myself have done in the justification for the use of census-driven
qualifiers. My research, however, largely reflects the reality that communities often have the tools
to address their own needs, and may be uniquely or best suited to develop and drive solutions. This
is not to say that structural forces are irrelevant or that there are not times when external assistance
or perspectives are required, it is instead to simply strive to start the analytic focus with local
knowledge. This may provide an initial impression that each of the stories included in this study

61

Or, in the case of Actor-Network Theory and the new sociology of associations (Latour 2005), given as much

attention as any human or ideological agent in the network of patterned relations, which may be the other extreme.

53

are selectively optimistic or positive, but, in fact, they represent a wide range of recurrent themes
and issues as reflected by members of these communities themselves.
Existing scholarship provides a significant precedent and reasoning for this perspective and
approach. Starting as early as two decades ago John Kretzmann and John McKnight (1993)
introduced a handbook for asset-based community development. They promoted a model for asset
mapping that included local institutions like businesses, parks, hospitals and libraries, associations
like church groups and interest organizations and, finally, individuals of all kinds, qualified in
terms of their identities and agencies. The approach has grown over the years to include many
kinds of studies and fields, finding use in social work (Lightfoot, McCleary and Lum 2014), urban
planning (Dennis 2005), health (Harrison et al. 2004), community informatics (Pinkett 2000) and
even provoked criticism in relation to social network analysis (Ennis and West 2010) and social
good (Macleod and Emejulu 2014). Asset-based community development supplies a recognized
and important perspective that is integrated into many scholarly studies of communities, and my
own is no exception.
That said, my position is likely somewhere between the alignments for top-down need-oriented
and grassroots asset-based analysis techniques. Clearly the concern for digital literacy has been
highlighted as a kind of universal reality and challenge, but the examination of it in practice, as
will be revealed in the following sections, is much less about what libraries are not doing about it
and much more about the unusual and surprising roles libraries are filling and interpreting. This
might also be compared to another kind of asset-oriented analysis, typically referred to as positive
deviance. A concept initially explored in health-related studies (Zeitlin, Ghassemi and Mansour
1990), positive deviance refers to the possibility that in every community there are individuals or
groups whose uncommon behaviors and perspectives enable them to find better solutions to
problems than their peers, despite being on relatively equal footing in terms of access to resources
or extant challenges (Spreitzer and Sonenshein 2004). The occurrence has been increasingly
observed in multiple settings, including those particularly relevant to this study, such as education
outcomes (Dura and Singhal 2009, Richardson 2004) or creativity and innovation amongst
organizations (Acharya and Taylor 2012). The presence (or lack thereof) of positive deviance in
relation to the factors that determine digital literacy—people, policies, activities and
infrastructure—was a recurrent frame of analysis as I processed the case study data.
54

Finally, it must be understood that this work, at its core, is a kind of advocacy research. It pushes
beyond the classic, mundane academic scope of measuring an established theory in a novel way
or locating and describing an interesting phenomenon. Like other studies of this nature, it may run
the risk of inspiring biased views or misunderstood generalizations (Gilbert 2004), which is why I
have taken steps to intentionally contextualize all of the data in terms of limited case studies. It
was earnestly and necessarily engaged with the current political climate of libraries throughout the
period of study. As a researcher I did carry the advantage of being inexperienced and not overlyinformed about the topic of the shifting library systems, state funding and educational imperatives
present in Illinois at the time. That said, there is simply no way for a study like this to be neutral
in the same sense of something like examining the movement of particles under a microscope
might be. I once asked one of my advisors if she felt activist motivation behind research was
unethical because it could potentially compromise the quality or integrity of her work. She
responded by explaining she felt it would be unethical of her not to study the systems of oppression
that were being systematically overlooked. The focus on certain or prescribed methods of data
collection may sometimes serve the purpose of drawing attention away from the fact that particular
data is not even being collected to begin with. This was essentially my concern for validity when
I set out to frame the work in the wide terms of people, policies, activities and infrastructure when
talking about digital literacy. Despite this predetermined position I still took steps to address
validity and reliability in terms of more classic social science.

VALIDITY, RELIABILITY AND LIMITATIONS
A major concern throughout the process was the validity and reliability of the research. On the one
hand, case studies of this nature are not intended to be hypothesis-driven replicable models, but on
the other hand, the findings should still be framed in such a way that they could be easily related
to if another researcher were to conduct a similar study. The previous sections have clarified the
specific uses and classifications of census data, as well as the use of openly-available spatial data
analysis tools to qualify participant libraries, which should make it transparent for other
researchers to follow the same process. Another method employed to ensure a degree of reliability
was to ask the same questions to multiple interview participants and to verify stories as much as
possible by noting repeatedly mentioned cases or inquiring about a given notable story with
multiple respondents. Furthermore, state-wide datasets were used when fact-checking participant
55

responses and on-site observations, when available, such as library assets like grant funding
allocations or the number of computer workstations.
Validity is a more difficult question to address, particularly because there were so many ways
definitions and understandings can vary. One perspective might be that this entire study is an act
of challenging validity of prior digital literacy research, which is often survey-based or restricted
by overly-specific skill-based or, conversely, widely abstract definitions. Asking participants to
phrase concepts in their own words (which was my standard operating procedure), such as
prompting them to define digital literacy, or the roles and audiences for their library, helped to
confirm if participants were talking about the same (or different) issues I had in mind. In particular,
several conflicts of conceptualization came up that are noted later in this text, in both the “And
Then My Research Model Broke” findings section and also in the discussion. Another possible
issue or limitation would be the use of the structured model of people, policies, activities and
infrastructure. In many library settings human resources were considered to be part of the
infrastructure and in others stated formal policies blended a great with social norms and cultural
practices. The difference in scope and scale of official library ‘activities’ varied, from large scale
events to independent but reoccurring moments of computer assistance. Participants were initially
invited to review my notes to provide feedback, but very few actively responded. This was
important because it did offer a chance to validate results and findings, but the final decision to
keep locations anonymous made it less possible for libraries to control precisely what was said
about their operations. This allowed for a degree of balance in presenting both challenges and
notable innovations, making it more about explaining “what was happening” than acting as a
platform for value-laden public relations.
As might be expected, the methods limited the amount and type of data that could be collected. In
one sense the study included a useful exploratory function, as data on these locations of this sort
had never been collected before, but in another sense it could not be strenuously vetted or subjected
to interpretation based on cultural-immersion that might be encountered in a typical ethnography.
As such readers should not take this text to be an undisputable or complete book of “truths” about
each of the public libraries visited, but instead a collection of common and notable observations
and perspectives assembled and presented by both myself and respondents in collaboration.

POSITIONING MY SCHOLARSHIP
The contemporary field of Library and Information Science (LIS) benefits from an
interdisciplinary blend of epistemological perspectives and research traditions. As a collective area
of study we claim no central set of theorists or works and rely on a variety of methodologies to
carry out research. As a result, we also must (or ought to) face evaluation from our peers who come
from sometimes differing perspectives. I would argue this produces better communication of
concepts and scholarly innovation through a wider diversity of ideas. I felt it important to
distinguish and justify my methodological orientation so that those who are interested can better
understand where I’m coming from as a scholar and social science researcher.
As stated, LIS is an interdisciplinary area of study. We run the full scope, from scholars who study
the abstractions beneath search and categorization systems with logic-based formal methods to
digital ethnographers who chronicle and decipher the meaning of experiences, such as battling
cancer with the aid of online communities, in order to posit new strategies and perspectives in
healthcare informatics. To be honest I cannot point to a single book, scholar or method that fully
encapsulates my research design or methodology. It is not that it was haphazard, without intention,
or uninformed; it is instead that my experience with a variety of forms of social science, from
sociology to human-computing interaction to education, draws me to the strengths of various
lenses, and also makes me all too aware of the high-expectations some people place on various
invocations of methodology. For instance, if I were to say I conducted an ethnography many might
have expected me to have personally worked in libraries for a decade, or at very minimum
observed from the inside of a single library for a year or more. The attention I give to observing
people, activities, policies and infrastructure together might suggest the sort of analysis that relates
objects and concepts known as Actor-Network Theory (Latour 2005), but I am far too invested in
preexisting (and quite meaningful) social conceptions like racism or literacy to really commit to
this view. It is also quite difficult to make sense of ideas as comparable agents within systems of
people and objects and it likely involves sacrificing a lot of potential for work within existing
patterns or conceptual frameworks that facilitate conventional forms of reliability and validity. I
applied multi-stage coding to my interviews and field notes, similar to what researchers guided by
the Strauss (1987) or Glaser (1992) conception of Grounded Theory might do, but my outcomes
were too complex to be summed up in the discovery of a single core variable, unique theory or
57

epiphany. Besides, I began my endeavor with significant orientation from existent literature (and,
more importantly, strong opinions) about how to focus my research, which could account for the
site selection as a kind of theoretical sample, but I do not think I could qualify the outcome of my
work as a truly unique “theory of digital literacy” or anything of that matter. I paid some attention
to the way interviewees spoke about topics and at times related what they said to the narrative
themes visible in society and literature but this was not enacted with enough frequency and rigor
to associate my work as exclusively content or discourse analysis. For instance, my data collection
included observations like computer lab layouts or software offerings. Rather than select a social
science method ‘brand name’ to shortcut the process of explaining how I did what I did I chose to
explain it, step-by-step.
As to how I situate myself as a social science scholar, I personally identify in many ways with
what Mitroff and Kilmann (1982) characterize as ‘the conceptual humanist.’ In contrast to more
structured science perspectives where research relies on formulaic, hypothesis-driven
experimentation and replicable (positivist) study of data, or, dedication to the construction of
universal, portable abstractions, I strive to ground social science in practical and more immediate
applications for the measurable benefit of everyday people and communities. Generally, I desire
to seek out (or produce) multiple—possibly conflicting—explanations for phenomena in lived
social life. Models in science serve as useful representations of reality insofar as they encourage
our conceptual imagination. As Mitroff and Kilmann state, “their purpose is to direct and guide
inquiry, not constrain it.” (1982:55). In other words, a diverse marketplace of ideas in an area of
scholarly inquiry is a sign of strength, if one’s goal is to produce knowledge. I don’t go so far as
to take the extreme position that thinkers like Paul Feyerabend or Pierre Duhem might pose, such
as steadfastly refusing to tie ideas down to accepted theories or facts, 62 but I do appreciate the
dedication to challenging the ways the academic machine makes sense of realities. Some
abstractions I really do earnestly appreciate, such as the tangled mess of sociological theories on
power, but I’m also all for trying to build or discover new incarnations or measures of power. I do
vehemently believe in the purpose and importance of abstraction and measurement, even if it is

62

Mitroff and Kilmann offer an excellent explanation of the complexities behind truth by falsification if readers are

interested in better understanding this position (1982:55-60). Ultimately, what this leads to is the necessity that
conceptual-oriented social scientists be able to work between several often contradictory frameworks.

58

relative to, or housed within, a kind of perspective, but my goal matches that of the conceptual
humanist: to examine and understand how science, methodology and observation can further
humanity (as opposed to truth or scientific theory). It begs the question: how do we go about doing
this as social scientists?
Mitroff and Kilmann provide an answer through a series of questions and concerns originally
posed by John Rowan (Mitroff and Kilmann 1982:80, Rowan 1976). It’s not important to elucidate
on each one individually here, but what they investigate are the ethics and arrangements of power
in the process of research, particularly with regard to subjects or respondents. I would advocate
that researchers to recognize the political forces that support them, listen carefully and thoughtfully
to external or alternative perspectives, especially those that they study, and be aware of their own
motivations behind their research, to the extent that they can be. Similarly, I desire to push
researchers to think critically about the uses of their research outcomes and otherwise interrogate
the moral and mechanical factors beneath their study design. Consequently, I take the position that
science should not reside in a privileged position in relation to other fields, but instead be cast as
a valuable perspective among many methods of making sense of the world. It is not autonomous
or independent of other methods of knowledge production and, on the contrary, depends upon
areas like history, the study of literature, philosophy, arts and more that fabricate our cultural
context. The kinds of studies conceptual humanists undertake are necessarily personal, valueconstituted and interested activities, and benefit by being so. For an ethnographer to engage
effectively and deeply with his or her endeavor to, say, understand how meaning appears in a given
cultural circumstance, they must be significantly invested in their work and its context. They seek
to comprehend their own biases, freely let their passion animate their work, and interpret on the
basis of how they see their data in accordance with the encompassing body of scholarship. This is
not to say that my work as a qualitative researcher is hopelessly anecdotal or detached from
generalized systems of comparison but instead to suggest that I would like to place emphasis on
validity and relevance in context.
What does it mean when so few scholars are studying public libraries and so many more are
interested in emerging fields like information science? What do we lose when most of the research
is focused on outstanding examples of success and the times the data fits the theory? Why is
scholarly work often times more judged on the basis of its interpretation of, or adherence to,
59

informing theory, rather than on its utility for impacting policy, or, better yet, being understood by
and affecting everyday people? I find that the discussion about how to answer these sorts of
questions reveals more about the value of my research than, say, if I were to attempt to reveal a
grand paradigm-shifting theory or a profound insight into the meaning of a singular process.

FINDINGS - STORIES
Over the course of many visits to many libraries I discovered a remarkable array of service
arrangements, stories, and strategies related to fostering digital literacies. This dissertation
illustrates only a small fraction of these, focusing on the encounters that most strongly relate to the
development of this project as scholarship. Each set of stories illustrates some of the most
interesting or frequently encountered (or frequently absent) situations and dynamics related to
library roles and digital literacy.
The names of every library, librarian, location and even particular programs have been altered in
order to make it difficult to directly identify specific libraries. This was done in order to protect
the individuals interviewed and to make it possible to discuss a range of tensions and challenges
as well as assets, innovations and stories of success.

AQUARIN
The director of Aquarin Public Library couldn’t explain it more explicitly:
“We are a cultural center for the city. I had two librarians from the Netherlands visit us one
time, and they talked to me about the library being storytellers for the community. And that
struck me. That’s what we’re really doing—telling Aquarin’s story to the world and we’re
bringing other people’s stories to Aquarin. It doesn’t matter if it’s in a book, if it’s on a
stage playing music, if it’s a video, or a text on a wiki, we are projecting ourselves into the
world and we are taking the world in to us and providing information access to it.”
Aquarin is an unusual and notable example of the degree to which a public library can transform
its mission to match the needs of their community in recognition of its embeddedness in a greater
information society. After moving from a limited and failing building situation, on the brink of
collapse and with a difficult financial situation, this library has dramatically altered resources and
policies to fit an ever-changing social role as a center for cultural production.
The traditional method of characterizing the library’s impact on cultural production in a given
community is to distinguish the knowledge and consequential informed-discourses it helps to
enable through the circulation of materials and provision of public space. In the academic setting
this might appear as a library that enables research with databases or in the public setting it might
61

be a library that hosts political debates. Aquarin takes a route that is entirely different from these
classical methods.
So how is cultural production here different?
ARRANGEMENTS OF POWER AND ASPIRATIONS
Aquarin’s organizational structure is foundationally different than many libraries. Its importance
to the community is evident in a stronger and more direct relationship to the city. As the director
explained:
“I’m considered a department head of the City of Aquarin, the way the fire chief and police
chief are, so I do things like go to the city department meetings when they’re had, with the
Mayor and all of the other department heads, so I hear it all. So when the police department
is talking about a new bust that they had I’m at the meeting… it also gives me insight into
it, thinking ‘oh that neighborhood is getting a little wonky, maybe we need to work with
the youth in that neighborhood and do some outreach there.’”
This position clearly privileges the library, but also holds it accountable to greater responsibilities
for service. In short, they act in some ways like a Park District might, providing programming in
tandem with a variety of organizations, going beyond (but also including) the ordinary type, like
schools, to match up with public television and departments within the government. They have
actively identified themselves as a “community service organization, not just a library service
organization,” built on a tradition where the assistant director is consistently charged with making
relationships and running events outside of the library to “make sure we always look good” in the
community, literally.
A good example of this that was on their mind at the time of the interviews was a large scale music
festival which happens downtown nearby the library on an annual basis.
“So we took this thing on, we’re partnered with the city to put on [music festival], and it’s
in four weeks, last year we got 11,000 people at this thing. And we work with volunteers,
from the community and the city, but the library is raising the money to sponsor it, our staff
is going out there to work it.”

62

An event of this size and reach is extraordinarily big for libraries of even entire cities to take on,
and the fact that the library was helping to fundraise, staff, record and broadcast the event over
social media is even more notable.
Opening with such an impressive example is an implicit dare to critical readers who would like to
exclaim that Aquarin is an outlier, an unusually fortunate consequence of luck and rightly-aligned
variables. While I cannot truly state the extent to which this may or may not be the case I can
distinguish them as an example of what’s possible within the set of just the public libraries I
selected for my sample. In a sense if we were to ask the questions, “How important could a public
library be in governance and the production of social and cultural good? What greatness might
they achieve in breaking out of their own walls?” we might very well come up with an answer like
the above.
TECHNOLOGY ASSETS
Behind the relative social prestige of the Aquarin Public Library lies a strong commitment to
infrastructure and assets.
“Our philosophy is that a lot of the kids in Aquarin get hand-me-down everything, from
clothes to whatever, and we wanted them to feel that when they come to this library they’re
getting first-class stuff and we want the technology to reflect that attitude…”
Based in a multi-story building in the heart of the downtown with ample space for expansion, the
library has arranged spaces to match its various strategies for cultural production. There is a small
space dedicated to local history artifacts and portraits of significance, a large auditorium and
adjacent conference space wired for movies, music shows and recording, multiple rooms dedicated
to AV production, equipped with powerful mac computers and Chroma key green walls and even
a reconfigurable laptop and instruction lab. Included in their array of equipment, which has been
built up over the past few years through donations and funds used from Project Next Generation
(PNG), 63 are multiple HD video cameras which can be loaned to local organizations.

63

Project Next Generation (PNG; www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/library/PNG/home.html), is an annual

grant, typically several hundred thousand dollars distributed to a dozen locations, funded by the Illinois State Library
and larger LSTA. The website at the time of data collection stated: “By offering a safe environment, creating multi-

63

They are also serious about intellectual property and rights, an additional sign that their library is
an active site of production. They have a policy for ownership of materials produced by staff, like
photography, art and video and also make a strong effort to protect the content produced by patrons
for various events.
Despite the impressive array of equipment at the time of interviews they did not have any
established curriculum or course structure beyond the computer and productivity software basics
found in most libraries:
“It goes from a class we call mouse and keyboard, which explains ‘this is the mouse, this
is the keyboard, you don’t aim the mouse at the screen, you have to put it on the table’ all
the way up through Excel.”
To some degree a measure of a library’s service roles manifests itself through spaces and objects.
Aquarin, like most libraries, has a large number of books, a computer lab, public meeting rooms,
a genealogy department and so on, but also an entire floor dedicated to digital media production
and public communications, with tools like lighting gear, props, cameras, and software such as
Final Cut Pro included, all in partnership with the local TV channel and in the service of recording
and promoting patron productions and community events.
BRANDING
Aquarin has a history of creating with the community and has developed itself as a sort of brand
name. The library has an identifiable logo, an introductory clip they place on videos and, more
importantly, a reputation. They have established a local history wiki, produced a documentary on
the town and run podcasts and patron-created PSA’s with regularity. In other words, their name is
out there. It’s attached to large music festivals, showing on the television and present on the
internet through social media. This certainly isn’t unheard of for libraries in Illinois, even in small
towns and cities; what’s notable about it is that it’s primarily patron-driven and communitycentered.

generational talent pools, integrating technology and advancing social values, Illinois libraries are bridging the
traditional with the innovative to impact the next generation.” PNG has been going on for over a decade and was
brought into existence by Jesse White, the Secretary of State and State Librarian.

64

This presence has secondary effects. By promoting their own image and that of the city they garner
attention and opportunities, despite adversity:
“Success breeds success, I’ll tell you that much. People want to be a part of success. People
with money want to be a part of success… Nobody can look at [town name] and say
‘They’re swimming in money, so that’s why they can do it.’ We have one of the highest
unemployment rates in the state… We have a few fans of our library besides the city
government, folks who have a little bit of money who are willing to throw in some bucks
to get us a couple more tablets or lights for the [film production] room and so forth.”
What the director is reflecting here, is that the library, in this sense, not only brands itself but also
the image of the community. The children’s librarian agreed with this sentiment, expressing that
they had to also connect the faces beyond the TV spots and logo:
“I don’t think we’d have half the attendance we do if we didn’t get out into the community
like we normally do and they see that we are the people you can find at the local Jewel or
Dollar Tree. We have a lot of kids come in because they know us, our library reflects our
community.”
CULTURAL PRODUCTION
Up until this point I’ve mostly focused on the high-level alternative service roles the Aquarin
library has chosen to undertake on the path to fostering digital literacies. The children’s librarian
helped me to understand a specific way this is implemented in explaining they seek to help kids
produce, not just read and pass tests. Like many libraries their programs for youth, especially those
in partnership with the school districts, are accountable to standards-based education metrics and
regularized evaluation of learning endeavors. Despite this they elect to deeply integrate digital
production technologies into the programs they run for kids.
One such program I was told about focused on showing kids how to access services of the library
by using iPads as e-readers. They learned to use the website and then proceeded to download books
of their own choosing. The librarian explained how she noticed some children were willing and
able to read books they would never ordinarily bother to discover just because they were available
on a technological wonder like an iPad. We both speculated this could be a particular advantage,
65

especially with tough populations like young boys who, in her library, were averse to getting into
reading books.
She also had children, including those with special needs who were behind in their test scores,
practice storytelling by recording videos of themselves, in order to help them do it in real life
performance. This sort of activity may not be all that novel, akin to reading to dogs, a common
story time activity in many libraries, but holds the added benefit of continued review by both the
reader and teacher. As we spoke about this the librarian flipped through pictures and examples on
the iPad in front of me, implicitly demonstrating her own ability to use the device. They had a
constantly changing set of activities working digital tools into programming each year:
“During Teen Tech week we have forty or fifty kids come in, we go to the schools and do
promos and work to determine what they’d like to see during Teen Tech week. Last time
they did three or four different digital projects. We brought the Macs down to the teen zone
and these kids were able to login and create jig-saw puzzle photos after taking photos of
each other. They used a website to manipulate their faces and then some took those back
to school and attached them to their school logo or printed them on T-shirts.”
This process is largely iterative design. They run assessments before and after program runs tied
to basic literacies and standards-oriented skills, and, if necessary, rework curriculum:
“There’s the pretest and post-test I mentioned. If we see improvement, when we’re
planning for PNG, we do these regularly, we keep it consistent and grow it. If it doesn’t
change we determine if we need more time and testing or if we need to go back to the
drawing board.”
And the children’s librarian wasn’t shy to explain to me that sometimes programs are a failure or
are frustrating. They often struggled with consistency of participation and preserving enthusiasm,
especially with older kids, some of whom would only go to certain kinds of popular events.
Teens also find outlets for expression through use of digital technologies, as exemplified in an
event the director explained to me:

66

“We had this big poetry slam, and we have a lot of kids who are under social and economic
stresses in this town. We had 200 people show up, and probably 40 kids read their own
poetry – we recorded it and one of our staff members edited it into a cool video, their
poetry, and it goes online. And so these kids, their poetry, they’re talking about dealing
with gangs, they’re talking about absent fathers, they’re talking about their dog. It’s funny,
their range—they still have these Mayberry concerns of, you know, I love my cat and I
don’t want to get hit by a gang. No matter what bad things happen they still have these core
little kid concerns, and at the same time they’re worried about pregnancy. I want to put that
all out there. I want people to see that and know we’re confronting that stuff head on. So
the kids, they express themselves, it’s on the web and now somebody in Madrid Spain can
listen to a poem from a kid in Aquarin.”
The process here is powerful because the program fluidly interconnects the ways these teens
leverage and experience technologies.
THE JOB OF A LIBRARIAN
I’d like to start with a quote from the director that I personally find inspiring but might be very
scary to others:
“We don’t hire people who’ve worked at other libraries. Unless they can divorce
themselves from whatever they have decided libraries are, because I see us as people who
are completely wiped clean of the meaning of what a library is and then I send them out to
change the world.”
The working group at the Aquarin library includes an educator who worked 25 years in a prison,
a transition librarian dedicated specifically to stranded youth ages 18 to 25 and a teen coordinator
“librarian” who wasn’t even a librarian by official professional standards:
“Our teen coordinator has two years of an associate’s degree at a community college, not
an MLIS or Bachelors. He grew up in this town and was practically raised in this library…
I know him, I know what he’s capable of, I know that he’s bright, creative and organized.
All of those librarian practice things you can learn we can teach him. But you can’t learn
to be a kid who grew up in the hood in Aquarin without a mother and who was homeless
67

for a while… Since we hire people from this community that by default gives us
programming that’s reflective of [the needs of] the community.”
All of these employees don’t fit the norm for the kinds of staff we typically encounter in libraries.
Not only are their credentials different but they’ve had to have positions created to match their
rather unique skills and access to the community. These were the same people (in addition to the
children’s librarian and others) who were working with patrons, from teens to young adults, to
engage in digital cultural production. They themselves needed to be versed in a variety of skills,
technical abilities and multitasking. The director told the story of a shelver helping a department
head with computer-based graphic design as an example of the sort of open learning environment
they promoted in order to foster digital literacies amongst the staff. Others sought resources online
through a subscription to Lynda.com or traveled to the Apple store and other off-site programs for
formal training. They were generally encouraged to work on side projects during their regular
duties, using free moments when off the desk to follow their passions:
“It’s amazing the productivity you can get out of people when you say “What is your
mission in life, what have you always wanted to do?” Answers like “teach kids, produce
videos, write a book…” They will cram the thing that they love to do into the smallest
amounts of time and do all of the library tasks you want if you will pay them to do that
thing they love to do.”
The approach sounds strikingly similar to the logic used by many academic institutions. They ask
a lot of their faculty, in exchange for a flexible and self-driven work environment. It can be
dangerous, lack of monetary compensation for additional work rendered in the name of love, but
it reflects the social norms of their library: self-empowered and passionate people need only dive
in.
I can’t say in truth that this is automatically different from many other libraries, there’s certainly
no shortage of dedicated and passionate professionals out there, but what does seem remarkably
different, and possibly dangerous, was the almost-libertarian approach to it. Workers were
expected to just be able to control the vast network of information and people around them to learn
how to use and leverage technologies for their jobs and the benefit of the community. Normally
I’d say this relies on people who’ve been brought up in a hugely privileged ‘geeky engineer’
68

background but in this case we see it amongst people who are very much anything but that. The
only commonality seemed to be that they had enough of an empowerment mentality to drive
themselves and others to learn, and enough interest and foresight to see digital technologies and
community services as an appropriate target.
SERVICE PHILOSOPHY
What is most striking about Aquarin is their overarching service philosophy. While most of this
was clearly relayed and stimulated by the director it could very much be seen in talking to the other
staff as well as observing programs and infrastructure in the library. Aquarin is constantly
questioning and redefining its image and service roles:
“What I see as library profession-oriented people, are people who believe libraries exist for
library’s sake. That you don’t need to justify yourself beyond the fact that you’re a library
and that libraries are inherently good, it’s something that they just see as self-evident. I
don’t. Because I’m a department of the city, we’re always talking about taxes, we’re always
talking about how high the taxes are in Aquarin, we’re always talking about how we’re
earning it.”
That the library in Aquarin is concerned about proving its value is nothing of note on its own;
hundreds of libraries face this challenge on a yearly basis. That it is willing to rethink how its value
might be expressed, how it might change itself to be valuable in other ways (as opposed to
measuring itself with other metrics) is more unusual. While this may not initially seem too
seriously out of line with how most libraries think, the director provided a much more potent
example in explaining the kinds of potentially drastic changes they’re willing to make to ensure
their role is justified, even if outside of norms:
“We don’t have a reference department anymore. We accepted the fact that Google has
murdered our reference department. Instead, we now have an adult services department
that does most of our programming and coordinates all of our community engagement.
We’re making a much bigger bang, impacting the community, giving much more service
back because of this adult services department than we would with a reference department.

69

This is the sort of decision that shocks other libraries when they hear about it. Aquarin is not just
going above and beyond to offer programming and cultural production from the community and
outside of their walls, but they are doing so at the cost of services that are often cherished and
considered central to the role of the library. They aren’t just riding the luck and profit of successful
networking and advantageous resources, they’re making sacrifices to make their operations
possible, without assuming they’re automatically good. Often reduction to the core collection of a
library is seen as an attack on the foundations of the institution, as the director relayed effectively:
“I’ve sat in library meetings and had librarians say ‘What are we going to do if the books
go away?’ And I say, ‘I don’t care’ and they think I’m being a smartass. And I really don’t
care, if the books go away then that means something better has been invented to get the
data to us, the information to people. We’ll use whatever that is, to carry information to
people, I’m not really frightened about my job prospects.
And this is really at the core of the issue, an understanding that the social roles of the library include
being in the business of disseminating information to facilitate cultural production, and that this
does not necessarily have to translate to being in the business of collecting, organizing and sorting
books. It positions the library in a more proactive role, being the institution to create venues and
relationships for information transfer—cultural exchange—instead of merely being at the mercy
of dependence upon a single medium or technique.
There are costs to this, clearly, as solid physical books provide a sometimes useful limitation to
quantities of information. Only one person can have a book at a time, and right of first sale is a
legal standard that makes it permissible to circulate materials after purchase. e-books represent a
potentially frightening challenge to this, as they are technologies imbued with external values,
proprietary norms and artificial limitations, as will be discussed in the story of the Shipton public
library. The same follows suit with cultural production through the creation of videos, web
resources and the hosting of events like concerts or conventions. The library must be prepared to
renegotiate the norms related to intellectual property, measurements of service value, and how to
equitably enable the community to engage with and express information in these forms.
Such a new arrangement is perhaps more of an optimistic embrace of the crisis culture Buschman
(2003) identified as central to the identity of librarianship:
70

“The editor of the newspaper was interviewing me and asked me about the future of
libraries, and I said I have no idea what the future of libraries is going to be, that’s what
libraries are like now, and what I told him was that I want to keep this library light on its
feet, not overly committed to anything, that way we can stop doing it and turn.”
This is where the model of digital literacies feels like it has substantial traction. The library must
be able to fulfill social roles, like acting as a cultural production center, not just in relation to the
varied needs of its community and patrons, but actually propelled by them. In other words,
librarians must be literate—adaptive and conversant—in digital technologies in terms of culture,
critique, construction, creativity, civic duty and more to constantly be transforming service roles.
These service roles in turn work to instill the same digital literacies within patrons and the greater
community.

SHIPTON
What is often considered the most sacred and fundamental service role of the public library is the
collection, organization and circulation of books. Though libraries have broadened their materials
categories over the past half century to also include various forms of audio, video and media like
microfilm, the book is still revered to be the foundational component of most library collections.
Books, as pointed out in the interview with the director of Aquarin, may not always be around in
such a prevalent physical form. During the time of data collection most libraries in the sample set
were struggling with the recent popularity and rapid adoption of e-readers. They faced a range of
difficulties with the devices, including managing and affording the acquisition of content,
identifying and supporting key audiences, understanding and operating interfaces as well as
actually purchasing and making the e-readers themselves available to patrons, either through
circulation or events.
Shipton Public Library faced the same challenge most of these libraries did, in terms of
determining how to best make books available in alternative forms for an evolving reader
population. What set Shipton apart, however, was their perspective in addressing this task. Their
approach showed signs of being both critical and adaptive with e-reader services. More
remarkably, however, Shipton’s services expanded to include an entirely different dimension:
directly supporting blind and low-vision users who were mostly home-bound in accessing
71

materials through the state-funded Talking Books program. Their struggles and strategies with
these service provisions revealed that their efforts fostered digital literacies as much amongst the
staff as they did amongst patrons.
E-READERS
In Shipton e-readers had been on the rise:
“I can’t tell you how many times around Christmas we get the knock at the door and it’s a
woman holding a Kindle and her kids bought her this e-reader, but the kids or the grandkids
never showed her how to use it.”
Regardless of whether or not Shipton wanted to be tech support for people with e-readers they had
become it. In a town with an unusually high number of elderly people and a large number of
unemployed persons in need of stronger technical skills, the library was clearly the place to go.
The director told me about some of their initial workshops, which were quite well attended:
“And this past year we had this other staff member, she was younger, and she was wired
in like everybody of her generation and one of the staff members in the Children’s
department has kids and they’re all wired with all kinds of devices and the two of them
asked me if they could do a workshop for people, breaking it down to Kindle Fire, Nook
tablets and iPads. They had between twenty and thirty-five people specifically interested
in those devices.”
The demand was so much that these same librarians eventually established a blog and series of
videos to help patrons and staff better understand how to use them. What’s equally notable about
the director’s statement here, is the perception that certain members of her team were ‘wired’ as a
result of their membership in a generation. This is reminiscent of the concept of digital natives, the
assumption that “kids these days” just automatically think differently and pick up technologies.
Though the director later expressed she was aware of the range of digital literacies possessed by
different individuals, as well as the role of socialization and culture in determining the adoption of
technologies, she was still frustrated with the way demand for digital technologies had strained
their capacities and the seemingly endless struggle to keep up to speed on the latest. The library’s

72

fight to help patrons make use of e-readers included an internal struggle to make sense of their
evolution themselves.
Shipton found that many patrons were ill-equipped to use online resources to learn how to use ereaders and so the adult services librarian I spoke to had prepared handouts to enable them to
download books through their web service:
“Initially there wasn’t as much help for it, so I did this thing [showing me the handout],
tailored to us, to our library. And a week after I got done with this they changed the
interface. And it’s still generally valid because of the concepts, but when I talk about
specific parts, like on the lower right corner in the blue bar… now it’s different, and I
haven’t changed those yet. But yeah, those are on our website, so I tell people when they’re
trying to do this, if I’m talking to them on the phone I say can you get on to the internet
right now and I guide them through and I show them the home page and I tell them to look
for an icon and so on. And this Kindle cheat sheet, because the way you acquire through
Kindle is different than other devices, this opens up another set of instructions. And this
one has changed too, unfortunately.”
As he said this to me I could sense a degree of disillusionment in his voice. He had set about the
task of teaching patrons who often depended on a background of ritualistic step-by-step learning
how to use a service and interface that required adaptive strategies and experience-based intuition
to operate, since it was always changing. A handout couldn’t be updated easily to reflect those
changes but it was necessary, since a library staff member couldn’t always be there to walk them
through it. They even prompted patrons to take a step back and ask if the e-reader was even
necessary at all. At the time titles were considerably limited, and the better solution might not have
been to learn the latest interface, but instead to think about the best source for the books they
wanted:
“When [the adult services librarian] last did a workshop on it he explained that My Media
Mall has 5000 titles and our library has 175,000. If you really want the full offerings we
have what’s in the library as a bigger fall-back.”

73

What these quotes reflect is both dedication and healthy skepticism. They had to be willing to
continually strengthen and update learning resources for users, but also know when it was worth
their time to do so. While Shipton didn’t always have the people or resources to fully address
patron needs for e-readers, they took a refreshingly proactive approach to a similar problem with
talking books.
TALKING BOOKS
Blind, disabled and elderly users sometimes have trouble getting to the library and even once
they’re there computer search systems may not be accessible. Many libraries boast home-delivery
services but these merely drop a stack of books on your doorstep, which is a problem if you don’t
have a library card, don’t know what you want or can’t actually read text. The state of Illinois
offers the Talking Books program, which is a first step towards addressing this issue, but the library
took it further, as the director explained:
“Our outreach department is the go-between with the talking books program. We do a lot
more hands on rather than just let folks deal with the computer alone. It is intended to be
computer-based so you can do it without a person, but the audience is different from what
they think. The blind or physically handicapped people may not understand or be able to
use the technology that ends up on their doorstep or in the mail.”
Previous generations of talking books were simple cassette players, but the latest iteration had
moved to a lower-cost digital model—a model which depended not only on users owning their
own computer, but being able to use it, sometimes requiring large-format displays or screen
readers, technologies that are far from commonplace. Shipton capitalized on the service
opportunity to establish an outreach department built entirely around bringing not merely library
materials to users in their homes, but the support and guidance of librarians as well:
“Well the overall service is if you can’t get to the library we’ll take books out to you.
There’s one on one, we have volunteers who go to 5 different houses on a route and deliver
books and pick up what they don’t want anymore and bring back requests and then a
nursing home or senior apartment complex they’ll setup in the activity room every two
weeks and spread out books and people come in and people can check them out remotely.
Now we have a Verizon wireless connection, they take a laptop out loaded with the
74

software to check things in and out and they can go live with our system to check things
out immediately… Well and sometimes they try to show people on the laptop during those
library sessions how to use our catalogs and services.”
The library reported serving between 200 and 400 people per year as talking book or special needs
home-bound users. They brought a variety of kinds of materials to them, including large-print
books, talking books and other audio books, but the experience was very much individualized.
Instead of being left alone to try to navigate hard-to-read interfaces or try to order items over the
phone they could work in-person with librarians and volunteers, establishing relationships that
enabled more effective readers advisory, and, consequently, higher potential for learning and
enjoyment. This is particularly appropriate with elderly users, who may not feel very empowered
to act on their own. The librarian I interviewed even reported that running the service this way
enabled patrons to remain more connected to their friends and family because they could inquire
about and seek out more recent titles, giving them something to talk about. Even if they weren’t
always able to operate computers themselves they could learn to indirectly leverage their potential
by using the librarians as proxies, making it possible to develop cognitive digital literacies without
reliance on computer basics like typing or using a mouse, or something that requires even more
training, like a braille interface machine.
STAFF PERSPECTIVES
The question remains: how did Shipton arrive at this service model? A consistent theme throughout
interviews with Shipton was their willingness to try a wide variety of programs and service
configurations, which involved a certain degree of risk-taking. They elaborated on many of the
typical challenges libraries in their position might face: establishing a permanent space for
computer classes, promoting robust educational and workforce development activities online (as
opposed to just flash games and social media), constructing and facilitating an effective teen space,
engaging students to help with technology as service learning, production of media through Project
Next Generation activities and more. On the one hand hearing about all of the things that needed
to be fixed reminded me of how crucial problem-solving and social services are to public
librarianship as a profession, but on the other hand it was uplifting to note just how empowered
they felt. It wasn’t just that they were facing an endless stream of problems, it was also that they
assumed they could be solved, and that with enough iteration and commitment they would be.
75

Both of the librarians I spoke to expressed frustration with the times it felt like they weren’t
breaking through but also grounded their evaluation of activities and services very much in the
recognizable cases where they did.
Beyond the optimism there was a hefty sum of placing their conditions in perspective. When asked
about why they were focused on moving beyond books the adult services librarian told me this:
“I think that, getting back to that idea earlier – this whole idea of public libraries picking
up slack and not just being a depository for books anymore, it’s an area where we can
remain relevant. Particularly since, unless you live in a university town or something,
you’re going to have to pay for [computer training] much of the time.”
The director said something similar:
“I see two things, one is helping people make the transition – or at least providing the tools
and information on the tools they need, and the other thing is to provide the most accurate,
reliable information we can… A new technology comes out, everybody is crazy for it, but
ultimately, they’ll find that ‘well it does this but not this… and so you have to also get this.’
And so I think ultimately for libraries we make room for the technology if it’s appropriate
for needs.”
Shipton identified guidance through both community engagement and teaching (or mediating)
technologies as part of their evolving mission. They didn’t see this as mission creep, but instead
as a refined form and appropriate use of limited resources:
“I think one of the mistakes we often make, one thing I got out of this [refers to book from
PLA training], when determining these service roles, they say ‘Oh we know what you’re
thinking, you’re thinking how can you do this on top of what you’re doing now?’ and that’s
the point you’re not going to continue doing all of the things you’re doing now – you’ll do
some of it—circulating materials for instance, but their point, which is a very good one,
many libraries try to be too much to too many people. Instead of doing 20 things in a
mediocre way it’s probably better to do fewer things and do them well.”

76

It was already striking that they were actively and formally engaged with considering the PLA’s
perspectives on new service roles (they had even had some staff members attend training), but
even more clear they had benefited from their integration. Shipton had limits in terms of its space,
staff skills and funding but managed to find ways to help underserved populations in specialized
forms regardless. They provided these services with critical consideration, with regards to the highlevel urging of the ALA and PLA, but also with their own internally-driven thoughtfulness. This
meant they were selective about what they adopted:
“I went to a workshop held by the Chamber of Commerce, and there was an accountant
who was going to explain doing accounting via the cloud, and it was really convenient for
them, because she could go to where the client was and tap into whatever she needed…
She explained that it’s very secure and your data is kept separate and if someone wants
access to your information they have to get a court order. And I said Homeland security
doesn’t need a court order.”
Later the director added:
“Now we’re subscribing to [a database] and we get access to 2500 magazines, so long as
we pay every year. So we’re paying for the same magazines, basically, every year, as
opposed to purchasing and having them forever here. If we can’t afford them anymore then
we have no magazines. It’s that easy to destroy a collection, it goes away, poof!”
The director’s perspective here wasn’t to outright reject these technologies out of fear or distaste,
but to note the real, identifiable disadvantages evident in them. To really empirically ground her
concerns she would need to reference data, but at least some preliminary material suggests she’s
correct, like the ALA’s investigation of the Patriot Act’s impact on libraries 64 or the influence of

77

companies like Apple and Amazon on e-reader and e-book formats and prices and the possible
impact they have on the market, affordability and access. 65
Formal research data may not always be the sole motivation for directing choices, of course. The
adult services librarian expressed to me that a lot of their struggle was comparable to their patrons’
experience:
“You know most people just appreciate that you take the time to try to answer the question.
I’ve found also that when I don’t know something, and I admit it, I don’t get somebody
with attitude who says ’well you’re supposed to.’ They almost always say ‘I hear ya.’”
Both librarians recognized the complicated social construction of people’s interactions with
devices. An interaction that was similar to what had been mentioned to me at multiple libraries
around the state was pointed out:
“Part of it seems to be that people are seduced by this stuff, not just older people, kids
too… the [nearby middle school] bought a whole bunch of Kobi readers and got several of
these things from a grant and they were loaded with public domain books and they
interviewed the kids – and these kids were reading books that they’d never read in print.
One kid was reading Moby Dick, one kid was reading Beyond Good and Evil by Nietzsche
and he said he enjoyed it! No kid in 7th and 8th grade is going to pick up these books and
read them ordinarily, but it’s the screen, something seducing about the screen. I don’t really
understand it and wonder if maybe it’ll wear off.”
This statement was the sort that underscored the library’s definite interest in taking an active
approach to enabling learning and information access. Corporations, governments and individuals
are all out to pursue different kinds of information-intake agendas; the library can be a
conscientious and community-minded player as well by continually seeking to understand these
forces and act based on directed inquiry and thoughtful observations.

Many articles exist on this topic, a fairly recent example was a lawsuit involving price fixing:

STAFF SKILLS
Shipton’s willingness to be flexible and adaptive with their service model was just one component
of the equation. Their ability to do this depended largely on digital literacy skills and competencies
within the staff—not just preexisting but also the ability to learn them. They would start with
something like a challenge to service, like long downloads for patrons who don’t even have
computers in the first place:
“And it [talking book files] takes forever to download, it must be real time or something,
so we’re still wrestling with how we serve people and deal with copyright and counting
issues that prevent service and circulation.”
And then start coming up with strategies to solve this problem that might require additional
learning or challenging the boundaries of the rules:
“…but the main problem is that most of these patrons don’t have computers, so what we
thought what if we had a download station in the outreach department and she could, on a
patron’s behalf, with written permission, download titles for them. We thought what would
be really cool would be to put multiple titles on a regular flash drive, so we got a cable, and
jury-rigged it to be able to plug it in, and reversed engineered this thing, but the problem is
that the player is setup so that if there’s more than one folder on there it won’t play
anything, not even the first one, so apparently it’s protected, which was a bust, but at least
we could buy a bunch of flash drives for cheap, and give a person five audio books on flash
drives, each with different downloaded titles, and then we could have blank drives here at
the library, and while he has five in the field we prepare five new titles to take to him when
we go to pick them up. They wouldn’t let us do that because we couldn’t get into the
patron’s account, even with their permission. It’s too bad, because the technology could
enable us to provide so much better service but we can’t because of these restrictions.”
Just reflect on what the adult services librarian is doing here. They’re way past the question of
determining the social role, enabling information access for patrons with disabilities, and even
deeper than the service role, providing audio-format books with guidance. In this instance the
79

librarian is refusing to accept the artificial limitations of the technology that ultimately end up
hurting the patron and attempting to reconstruct the meaning and purpose of the ‘technological
black box.’ Their endeavor is fundamentally representative of critical digital literacy and reliant
on community engagement. They even made efforts to ask for help from other libraries:
“I did talk to a state library person in [nearby state], because they bought machines and
found a way to get around the system, they evaluated what was out there and which would
work best for patrons, but it was a huge undertaking, because they were doing it in addition
to the talking books program. They were feeling like we did, they wanted to be ahead of
the curve, but we didn’t have access to the tools that would teach us so we could teach
somebody else.”
Ultimately, despite perspectives, networking and perseverance the library did find limits in terms
of their people:
“A lot of it comes down to people. [the library in another state mentioned earlier] had two
tech-savvy people. We were able to offer e-reader classes because we had two tech savvy
people. We could go forward in a lot of different directions, but when we have somebody
who already has an interest or skills in something then we can move faster on that particular
thing. You have to give people the world a piece at a time.”
Their recognition of this need came well before the OITP report on the importance of supporting
digital literacy in libraries. During the interview I felt like they were implicitly asking me for help:
“It’s great you’re doing research on this – because increasingly public libraries are picking
up the slack, for a lot of things that government used to do and is not doing any more, and
digital literacy or media literacy, it’s an important thing we need to be doing but we’re not
being given additional funding for this, we’re having to pick up the tab on our own time,
we’re having to train ourselves and that’s the challenge.”
And it’s true, I wished I could be there to help them. The real answer, however, is bigger than the
individual agency of the librarians providing these services. It also includes a dimension of
structural support and policy-based changes, issues I will develop more so in the discussion.

80

NORBURRY
Small towns in many states live and die as the result of investment by major employers. In some
cases a given city or town may depend completely upon the work opportunities provided by a
single manufacturer, institution of higher education, or military base. When a crucial employer
closes up or shrinks operations in one of these types of locations libraries often suffer. They
typically need to help large numbers of suddenly vulnerable and unemployed people find jobs by
searching and filling out resumes online and yet they must simultaneously deal with funding and
staff cutbacks due to decreased tax revenues. Librarians find themselves doing more and new
kinds of work, and may not always have the time to help patrons as much as they’d want or need.
And at the same time libraries also face demands to spur innovation in response to changing times
and technologies. Many librarians feel underequipped to know how to rapidly assess and adopt
technologies and others just don’t feel like they have time or money in the budget for R&D.
Community engagement, unsurprisingly, can provide a partial answer to this sort of crisis.
Libraries that have a strong referral network and relationships with social service agencies can
better transfer patrons to services outside of the library. Libraries can also be receptive to accepting
help in the form of volunteers and donations provided directly from the community. All of the sites
discussed thus far have been notable in how they’ve gone out of their way to break out of the
library building and get into the community physically. Community engagement does not have to
always look like this, however; sometimes welcoming and supporting community-driven assets
can enable libraries to improve their services roles to reach patrons in new or creative ways.
Norburry Public Library was precisely all of these things. Though their town was more than a
decade past the catastrophic closure of the former major local employer they were still dealing
with significant volumes of patrons with very limited computer skills. Like many other libraries
positioned in recovering or struggling communities they sought to find new and positive ways to
engage and aid the populace.
SOFTWARE POLICIES
The library director here was clearly nervous to talk to me. She knew I came from a town with
libraries running dozens of programs with the benefit of outstanding LIS graduate students. She
knew that my University background and context made me privy to thinking about programming
81

with the latest in digital technologies and most of all she knew that my experience in critical
scholarship meant I would ask a lot of “why” type questions. After spending some time reading
over my interview schedule, she felt comfortable and we began talking.
Our interview covered most of the basics, including service population, technology assets, the
future of the library and so on but the director was quick to admit that she did not consider herself
to be a very ‘tech savvy’ person, explaining “I don’t even have a cell phone.” She found herself
continually struggling to adequately assess and evaluate technology-based services for her library,
a task that required she depend on the expertise of others. Rather than rely exhaustively on
distanced outsourcing companies the library invested in individuals, such as their technical
librarian, a local consultant and volunteers, in order to put the community first. This line of
thinking led them to surprising policies:
“One thing, for our computers, a lot of people want the nicer Microsoft products, like
Microsoft Office, but those are sometimes out of our price range, so we don’t have those
software programs on our staff machines, instead we use Open Office, and just put the
more recent Microsoft Office on public workstations. We obviously need our staff
machines to be able to handle our needs, but we can deal with worse programs behind the
scenes, it’s more important to us to provide the better resources for the community.”
This attitude of putting community needs first, despite limited resources, was also present in the
composition and layout of their lab. They segmented several computers into study carrels and also
had a circle of computers for collaborative work in the Children’s section. More notable, however,
was that they deployed a number of operating systems, including OSX, Windows and Linux:
“Our library felt we should make the public more comfortable by providing more types of
machines, so they could use whichever they prefer. A neat thing, something else I like
about this library, is that we have Linux on some of our machines, especially for our
OPACs and the computers in the back in the network room, it’s a neat blend going on our
network.”
Of most of the locations I visited, open source software was not a frequent occurrence. Computers
that were individually managed and careful considerations of interface were not typical, and yet
82

here they were, in a library managed by someone who did not consider herself to be very digitally
literate. They were able to arguably provide better service for less economic investment.
SOCIAL CAPITAL
The secret behind all of this, of course, was a relationship network. The case of the computer
management policies outlined above was made possible by a consultant:
“We have a contract with a gentleman, he’s not library staff, but we ask him for two hours
a month to do computer work for us, sometime he works more, and he is interested in Linux
and that’s how we’ve got in to that. It’s really been fantastic, it’s saved us money and we’re
really fortunate to have his direction.”
This consultant provided his expertise for far less than what he made with his other job with a
nearby research center, as a kind of social service to the community. This was not an isolated case,
however; the library had been accepting donations and testing community-suggested policies for
some time now. An older example was a gaming machine that stood solo with a joy stick attached:
“The gaming machine is actually a flight simulator, and we have a Cermanski section, an
astronaut from Norburry, who died, and his family set up a memorial fund for him, and it
was purchased with those funds. All of our other computers, except for this one and the
card catalog computers we ask people to sign up with their library card – the flight
simulator we still ask people to ask at the desk before they get on it, but the family asked
that anyone be able to use it when they donated the machine.”
In some sense one could surmise that the library was just lucky to receive donations from the local
community, but the impression that I developed over the course of the interview was that it wasn’t
just ‘luck’ that got them equipment and time from people, it was that people knew they’d make
good use of it. Another story helped to illustrate this:
“This year we were donated five e-reader tablets, new, and a laptop, for our library to use…
it fell into our laps, this guy walks into the library with a box of stuff and says he’s donating
it to the library, and doesn’t want anyone to know who he was, and says it’s all brand-new
stuff and it’s yours and walks out. Thankfully someone on the staff knew who he was and
we confirmed it wasn’t something that fell off the back of a truck and it wasn’t stolen.”
83

Norburry may not have had the funds or interest to purchase tablets on their own. The person who
donated them knew not only that they’d be used, but also that he would be able to actively influence
the service directions of the library by donating them. Norburry was not a library with a fixed set
of ‘we just organize stuff’ sorts of services, it was one interested in being responsive and supportive
of community involvements. Clearly both of these donations still fit well within the general scope
of social and even service roles of their library, but they both pushed the library to offer small
innovations in their services. The tablet donation resulted in a petting zoo where patrons could don
touch-capacitive gloves to learn about the various ways to get e-books, and they were later adopted
by the Chess club for use as timers for bug house. It may not initially seem like a very big deal,
but it’s different from many libraries where staff are overly concerned about adhering to rules,
very specific understandings of asset use and are fearful of change. The community of Norburry
could more directly control the library, and in turn the library gained assets and improved services
as a result.
Social Capital can be defined in a variety of ways, 66 but is generally regarded as the notion that
networks of relationships between people have value. It is often thought of in one direction: how
a single person might leverage norms and favors to their benefit, but when enacted in and through
the relationships and services mediated by the public library it might be better characterized as the
production of social good.
VOLUNTEERS
Many libraries rely on volunteers to fill gaps in services, particularly the need to provide patrons
technology assistance. Norburry was no exception, as their technical librarian explained to me.

66

Coleman (1988) envisioned social capital as aspects within a given social structure that facilitate individual or

collective action; influence and change generated by networks of relationships, trust and social norms. This concept
is not particularly new, and has been complicated over the years, being famously problematized by Putnam (2000),
who theorized social capital in the form of strong relationships was diminishing in the American public sphere, and
Granovetter (1973), who suggested social capital might be measured in the form of varying strength of ties or
connections to others. Social capital lends itself well to social network analysis and is often considered one of the
ways we can measure community in a given context.

84

Frequently, however, patrons needed more time and help than a single librarian could give them,
especially if there were others in need of help. She told me about this with a story:
“We still continue to do computer tutoring with people, in fact today we had two of them,
and it’s funny because you were talking about how libraries help to define things, digitally.
We had someone come in today and she says “I’ve got to go on to an unemployment
website” and we get a lot of that so I have an idea where to find it, and she says “well I
understand computers, don’t worry,” so I go back to the front desk, but she picks up the
mouse and starts doing this, in the air. [Motion of waving the mouse around like a remote]
and I said ‘So have you used a mouse before?’ ‘Yes’ ‘Well have you used a mouse like
this one before?’ And ours don’t have track balls in them but even with optical mice you
need it on the table, and so I say to her let’s try it this way.”
She directed the patron to a Mousercize (an exercise with a mouse) website to help them get a
handle on the device:
“It’s good because it helps them learn but it gives them some dignity because they get to
be the one in control, and by the time they’re done they can control a mouse and cut and
paste. And this was a good hint from another library. I wish I had time for this lady today,
but I had to be at the front desk, but luckily we have volunteers, and I told them they’d be
able to help her learn to use the computer but she’d have to make an appointment, for a
dedicated half an hour appointment. But it’s frustrating, because I had a line of people at
the front desk, and I knew this lady was not going to know how to do this, but it’s difficult
to tell someone you don’t have time for them when you want to help them.”
You can get a good sense of how layered something like this is here. The technical librarian had
learned how to be respectful and patient with patrons, which was as important as having knowledge
about computer operation concepts. Her knowledge of existing resources allowed her to save some
valuable time, as well. She was able to setup a tutoring appointment with a library volunteer for
them, knowing that they’d need a considerable amount of help. Appointments were typically
customized for individual patron needs, which allowed them to better understand how to help:

85

“Today we had a young man who wanted to post things on YouTube and he had a whole
line of questions, but his mom isn’t allowing him to get a Facebook account until he learns
from us, which I thought was a good responsible parent thing, but later I found out the
reason she’s having him do this is because she wants him to get on Ebay and help them
make money for the family… He understands computers, he’s a junior high student, but
we’ve only worked with him for probably an hour, and I sent my volunteer out there, and
I’m getting to a point where I’m thinking I don’t understand this guy, my volunteer is a
male closer to his age and they might understand each other.”
This example is interesting because it shows how computer tutoring may not always be so straightforward. On the one hand there’s some concern for patrons feeling comfortable in learning from a
peer, and on the other hand there may be multiple agendas going on behind a patron’s interest in
learning. Navigating these sorts of situations requires more dedication than a librarian pressed for
time could offer.
Most of Norburry’s volunteers were assigned there to perform community service of some kind,
through schools or as restorative justice or similar programs. This meant many of them were
assigned tasks, which was fine, as they could fit into existing library service roles, but the more
exciting way that volunteers contributed at Norburry were the ones who brought in their own
influence to alter services. The technical librarian told me about one such unusual individual:
“We have people like the gentleman who does animatronics, which is great… he started
talking to me about some of the things he likes to do, and he likes animatronics and he
understood the summer reading program was ‘Reading is so delicious.’ He said ‘can I make
you guys something that will talk and you can record on it?’ and it took him a while to
figure out how he’d kind of do it, and it came together and at first we were skeptical, but
we were really surprised.”
A volunteer helped the library to advertise their summer reading program by actually building
them an interactive display, shaped like a gingerbread man, in the library:
“Yep, it’s made out of Styrofoam and computer parts and he had this old laptop that won’t
do much besides run the gingerbread man – and it sits in the closet and just runs this display,
86

and that’s it… He just came in and it’s one of his passions. At his church he’s built huge
turtles and controlled them and everything. And in reality everything he’s paid for – the
paint, the foam, the computer, the time – it’s free help and he’s been a real jewel for us.”
The contraption sat near the front of the library and used recordings made by the staff to announce
various activities and events. It was reported as being fairly successful at capturing the attention
of patrons for a variety of events over time but also as potentially becoming quite annoying due to
the sheer repetition of messages and interactions. What’s more notable was how willing the library
was to work with this volunteer to let his passions shape the space for the better. Though he didn’t
teach patrons to use digital technologies with this project he did help to engage and teach the staff
about what he did. At the time of the interview they were looking into determining if they could
do something similar as an actual program:
“He’s the kind of guy who wants to build stuff. He wants to do a steampunk style MIDI
synthesizer, for instance, okay, so this is his vision—he doesn’t understand the music or
how it works, but he said ‘I would love to teach a class here at this library on how other
people can do the same thing.’”
They were also considering relying on him to help teach their other volunteers, to build the
technology tutoring services of the library. His qualifications were as much about social skills,
confidence and cultural familiarity as they were technical competencies or fluency in digital
literacy cognitive models:
“And this guy is good with kids, too. In the military his job was teaching computers and
application, but this makes him good with kids – he’s a communicator, it’s one of his gifts...
The other young man volunteer, watching those two together is really great. It’s
generational and they really understand each other and they have a good time. They stand
there swapping stories and so on, exchanging knowledge and tricks, solving problems.”
Again the point here is not just that Norburry was lucky to have help from such skilled persons or
even that they presented strong evidence for the impact of social capital. The role of the library
that was so notable, in this case, was their willingness to facilitate, curate and explore how to offer
services to foster digital literacies.

DALHURST
Many libraries struggle to find ways to meet the needs of service populations who are absent from
their buildings. As seen in some of the prior examples, one strategy to address this issue is to run
programs in locations outside of the library, another strategy might be to facilitate volunteers to
help bolster and alter services within the library, and yet another strategy might be to bring library
information online for use by the rest of the world. Sometimes these efforts involve a dramatic
configuration of policy and library culture, but they don’t always have to be so involved. For
Dalhurst Public Library, meeting people where they are, both physically and emotionally, is central
to their daily operations. This perspective and associated service strategy might be a bit radical,
but the resultant library roles and activities were really down to earth. The difference lies in a
recognition of people’s emotional states, something that’s generally not addressed in any formal
statements about service. The director made the baseline for their inspiration for this quite clear
when I asked her about who her service population might be:
“My other beef, I’ll just say this while we’re at it, there are several states in the US, where
there is no underserved public. If we’re going to throw all of the libraries up in Illinois in
a huge upheaval as we have [a reference to the system reorganization at the time] then let’s
do it right and let’s revamp the legislature so that if you’re a citizen of Illinois you are
served. Because here we are, we’re a municipal library we’re only serving the citizens who
pay the taxes to support this library. Other people can come in to use this library, but they
can’t check out a book unless they pay a non-resident tax. We’re a rural library, we’re
surrounded by this huge rural community, but they’re not afforded the same access as local
citizens are. What I don’t understand is why that can’t change. Indiana has a county-wide
system, so anybody in a county can go to any library in that county, or really the state, and
find services. That we have such a large unserved public really frustrates me.
This frustration, the director’s drive to meet people in terms of their actual need, regardless of
surrounding circumstances, appears to be the philosophy behind many of Dalhurst’s programs.
This broad concern for people’s wellbeing is not uncharacteristic of libraries but its interpretation
is where it stands out.

88

E-READERS IN CAFES
One of the key demographics that is often less-present within the library is patrons ages 35-50 who
do not have kids but do have full time jobs and stable income. Many of these individuals might
commute in to a given location for work, staying there for many hours at a time, making it difficult
for them to visit a library nearby their home. These also might be the individuals who see the
library as less useful or relevant in their lives, the sorts who may believe the library is just full of
old books and that all recent and useful information is online. The Dalhurst library attacked this
by developing a program inspired by the Chicago Public Library, as explained by one of the
involved librarians:
“For the e-reader petting zoo we basically go out into various local businesses, usually
restaurants and coffee shops, because we’ve found we get the best response there. We take
e-readers and we have a tablet now, too, a Motorola Xoom, we got out of a Small Business
Administration grant through the Illinois State Library… what we do is go out into the
community with our e-book lending library software and we try to show people what they
can do and talk to them about the different kinds of devices that are available and how the
digital library works.”
Pop-up libraries and library programs in cafes are not strikingly new, but this sort of e-reader
outreach was somewhat unusual. When I asked about how they distinguished this from other
engagement activities, they explained:
“The difference is that it’s technology-based, we’re taking a laptop with us and signing
people up for library cards. We’re basically taking the library to places - a lot of people
don’t come in to the library, so that’s how we’re reaching people who might not typically
know what we have for services, and we’ve found that e-book lending is one of the things
that many people who don’t come into the library might be excited about. One of the best
ways for us to communicate about that is to go out into the community and raise
awareness.”
This was one of the first examples of Dalhurst meeting people where they were. The library wasn’t
necessarily out to convince them of the worthiness of paper books, or to try to pull them into the
building to drive door count. They knew that many of these folks wouldn’t have time or interest
89

for programs actually at the library, so they’d just meet them for lunch, and make their persuasive
pitch there. Setting up in a lunch-time break setting fits well with the concept of recreational
reading with e-readers, too. What’s equally notable, though, is that these programs were also a
way to foster digital literacies – helping patrons to access information via new mediums
intentionally and with guidance, through the library asset base. Though many of the patrons at the
cafes might have been on average more tech savvy this did not automatically mean they all were.
MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY WERE
When I spoke to the archives librarian, she went straight to the point with an impressive
declaration:
“Okay, well we have 11 thousand images that are digitized.”
The sheer image count was striking, especially in the context. Before me sat an older woman, a
veteran of this small town library. Surely, I thought, she must have had help, so I inquired.
“I did most of them myself, but I also had a volunteer, a former librarian, who would come
in, she was retired, and would come in one afternoon a week and worked on the negatives,
and I’d do the photographs and the glass plates, because I was worried she might break
those accidentally.”
So, in other words, her help was an elderly person, not some young guy from tech support across
the way. My surprise at this circumstance was revealing of my assumptions about digital literacies
and age, but as it turned out over a few years these women managed to amass a pretty impressive
community history collection. They did so largely in response to patron requests and with patron
input, soliciting photo donations from a variety of people around the town, sometimes having to
sift through hundreds contributed by just one person. What was more impressive to me is that it
drove this librarian to develop skills and competencies that she might not have ordinarily acquired:
“I taught myself through Adobe Photoshop for dummies and it took probably 3 or 4 years
to get them all completed, and once they’re on a separate hard drive and then I burn them
to discs, they’re stored off-site…They’re stored off-site, because the original library burned
to the ground in 1958 and took the archives with it, so they are now stored on disc as TIFF
files at city hall, so if the worst happens those photos are still there.”
90

The use of Photoshop for restoration and the concept of digital backup (as opposed to classic
archives and preservation typically found in small libraries) seems only natural, but is actually
considerably more than most libraries are willing or able to commit to these kinds of programs.
The traditional role of establishing and curating community memory through the library resulted
in digital literacies and professional development for this librarian that were both voluntary and
remarkable. At the time they were in the process of also learning how to best bring this collection
online for the public. The director indicated that it would be a good way to increase traffic to their
website as well as engage with populations not directly present in the library. The archives librarian
had noted that one of the reasons to make copies was that people valued the photos so much they’d
occasionally have problems with theft, demonstrating the emotional value of the photos to patrons.
They also noted the possibility for fundraising to continue these operations, as patrons could visit
to print out copies for themselves, but an online album order service might be compelling.
THE STIGMA OF COMPUTER BASICS
Like many other libraries, Dalhurst called upon youth volunteers from a local institution of higher
education. As the director explained:
“There’s tech tutors, that’s a volunteer program that we set up with Sawyer College.
Students over there are supposed to be involved in the community and so we have a little
program where they can come over, do some training, and then our patrons can call us and
set up an appointment with a tech tutor, for just about anything they want. It might be
hobbies, it might be setting up e-mail, figuring out an e-reader, and so they set up an
appointment and they have an hour of that tech tutor’s time. And they can ask for another
hour, and some of these young people, but mostly older people, end up building quite nice
friendships.
This arrangement was in many ways similar to Norburry and others that have these sorts of
partnerships with volunteers, but with the notable exception that their student help disappeared
during the summer. It did, however, allow them to work with patrons for longer periods of time
based entirely on their needs. The program had taken the place of computer basics classes, which
were reported as diminishing over time by the computer support librarian:

91

“We have offered basic computer training here, when I first started here I offered it
regularly and we had lots of people attend but that has slowly dropped off to where the
audience we target for those classes are smaller numbers. The local Goodwill offers
computer training for anyone who is a job-seeker, so people who want formal classes and
training we send to them. The classes we offer are generally for people like seniors who
want to be able to e-mail their kids. As I said we haven’t done those in a while, because
the audience is shrinking.”
This librarian, who had been there for years, noted that she didn’t think the shrinking audience was
primarily due to a decreasing lack of need or increasing aggregate level of computer literacy, but
instead frustration and shame. A long exchange explains it pretty well:
“L: The biggest problem, for us, is that they need it and they need it now. And that’s where
the tech tutors are very helpful. I used to do resume workshops, and it included how to
write a good one, how to do it electronically and then on paper, and almost no one ever
came, but we still get people who come to the desk and have nothing ready, no information,
they’ve barely used a computer, and they need a resume right now.
J: Do you think it’s that everyone is used to immediacy now, like McDonalds, you get your
food instantly, you go to Google you get your information instantly? Is it a culture of just
expecting everything to be easy and fast?
L: I don’t know, I could not believe it when it happened. I think some of it is this lack of
patience, I also think some of it is people who are embarrassed and don’t want others to
know how much knowledge they lack. There are people younger than me who don’t have
computer skills, it’s a taboo or something. I tell them that they’re not an idiot just because
they didn’t grow up like some people today. They shouldn’t feel bad about lacking
competencies, but it’s like illiteracy used to be, or is, people who are ashamed to admit
they can’t read. They have to do literacy tutoring in the basement, to hide it, and that’s the
way computers are going. Our society acts like everyone has a smart phone, everyone has
a tablet or e-reader, computer and e-mail, and that it’s all intuitive and that any idiot can sit
down and do this stuff, and I see that mentality as a problem, unless your library is richer
and has more staff to meet people one-on-one.”
92

The director also noted the degree of reliance on others for tech help needs, citing the example of
her 80 year old mother who wouldn’t be able to get airplane boarding passes in the future. To some
extent the elderly have and will always need assistance with some tasks in life, but this raises a
really key question when it comes to digital literacy and library roles. We often construct the issue
in terms of skills possessed and competencies gained, giving cursory attention to issues like
confidence or culture and instead focusing primarily on the comprehensiveness of services
provided, content issues in curriculum and various access mediums. However, what the librarians
stated here is that there are significant behavioral and perspective issues that complicate
confidence. You have people who are inhibited in their learning by fear, and who may just rely on
others to be a kind of access point and aide for information, introducing potentially problematic
dependencies. If the library is not open the patron cannot get help, if the volunteers are on summer
break then they cannot get enough help and so on. This ultimately defeats the idea of the library
as a bootstrapping model where patrons are empowered to help themselves, and instead creates
ritualistic and relegated relationships between patrons and services. In many cases in-need patrons
of many ages may come from backgrounds with inadequate education, where they were not
encouraged to learn through self-directed inquiry or problem-solving, but instead by copying and
following everything they were told or read. Some patrons may also be fighting even larger issues
than a lack of education and practice, such as learning disabilities or mental illness. It’s certainly
more acceptable for the elderly to be regarded as ‘naturally’ unable to use computers, but when
you have younger people who also run into difficulties but who hide it, there are systemic problems
that go beyond generation or access.

PADDOCK
The ALA states that “in order to assist individuals in the independent information retrieval process
basic to daily living in a democratic society” (ALA Council 2013, section B.8.7) they must include
instruction on the use of libraries as one of the primary goals of service. They encourage libraries
to approach this from a life-long learning perspective, working with children throughout their years
into adulthood with both professional and personal growth. The use of libraries, however, has
become increasingly complicated as services have expanded and information has taken on
additional forms. Instruction doesn’t just include learning how to conceptually and physically use
a card catalog system anymore, but also an understanding of computer-based input systems
93

(generally mouse and keyboard, but possibly touch and other interfaces in the near future) as well
as search systems for file management and the internet and the concepts that go along with it, like
that files and locations like the desktop are abstractions, that the internet has no official beginning
or ending and so on. As a result many libraries have felt the need to integrate formalized computer
instruction into their service offerings, especially those located in areas with substantial
populations and regular demand. Of the libraries I spoke to throughout my research all of them
serving populations greater than 40,000 had a dedicated computer lab and some kind of regular
course offerings, typically at least input and internet basics but also often resume workshops.
Paddock Public Library fit with this norm, being a library system serving a substantial population
through a number of branches. Instead of relying on tutoring by volunteers, like many of the
libraries previously-mentioned, Paddock chose to provide services through leveraging grants,
partnerships and responsive programs. In this way they were able to take existing assets and enable
them to go as far as they could.
Due to time constraints I was required to run my interviews with Paddock as a single focus group.
Participants are distinguished by a number followed after “L” in exchanges. L1 was the branch
manager for the location I was visiting, L2 was the system IT director, and L3 helped to manage
programs.
PROJECT NEXT GENERATION PARTNERSHIPS
Funding from Project Next Generation, the digital literacy state stimulus grant commonly found
at most sites, is flexible and different sites choose different strategies when allocating the money.
Many choose to invest in infrastructure that remains operational over the years, with only its first
use being for the kids in PNG. Items like laptops, cameras and e-books are in high demand for a
wide variety of library programs and so this makes sense as a cost-saving strategy for libraries.
Many libraries, however, find that equipment alone is not enough to create programs for learning
technologies and invest in supporting people from their community by hiring them as mentors for
youth participants.
Paddock leveraged a variety of assets to accomplish a scope of activities and acquire a wide set of
assets, which in turn enabled them to foster partnerships with different kinds of organizations.
They first explained the scope to me:
94

“L1: We did a whole lot. We’ve had computers, scanners, different types of cameras, in
almost like a classroom setting, where they’d take pictures, download them, and then
present them to parents in public. As far as computers, we’ve done many things, like
looking up materials, creating newsletters, Powerpoint presentations, etc…”
The program had historically been quite successful, due in part to its changing nature, and Paddock
had been involved since some of its earliest iterations for over a decade. The program was fully
packed every year out of necessity, as the branch manager explained:
“L1: It’s hard to say no, because of the clear need for parents in this community that may
not be able to afford a tutor or may not have a computer in their home.”
What it enabled, ultimately, when combined with a powerful social network, was partnerships,
like at the time of the interview a recent engineering program.
“L1: Working with the mentors and with the kids and we did an engineering program,
where the kids were able to focus on different aspects of what an engineer does, create that
data on the computer, and present it… We have several mentors, they’re all from [large
local company], one is an engineer and two are IT, so they’re very aware of the CAD
program and were able to instruct the kids on that. We all sit down, come up with the ideas,
what we’re going to do for each session, 10 weeks, and then we break it down as far as
what the kids are going to do in a particular week and we go with it.”
Through a combination of grants and funding sources Paddock developed what was a really unique
program amongst all of the libraries I surveyed, especially at the time: classes to teach youth from
diverse and underserved backgrounds engineering and software skills. Many of the libraries I had
visited ran programs with PNG but they were often lighter-hearted and more fragmented, without
the benefit of active technology professionals teaching them. When I asked about outcomes and
student engagement it became clear they were seeing at least some impacts:
“L1: I have a student page here who started the program in 6th grade and she’s now
graduating from high school, this is her first year at [college] and she wants to be an
engineer. The process happened because of volunteers – mentors - here and the ability to
access people with knowledge and insight that they might not ordinarily run into. It all
95

works out - I think that’s a testament to itself that the program is very successful in the
urban setting.”
Programs like this could justify the importance of libraries not only in affecting learners in terms
of life pathways and guidance but also in terms of expected measurable standards, like the
Technology and Engineering Literacy assessment in current development by the National Center
for Education Statistics. Clearly the library was able to benefit from having a high-tech
organization locally that was willing to work with them, but it demonstrates that cooperation with
businesses in areas of powerful economic growth and development might be a better strategy to
enable youth to develop new skills and explore career possibilities.
Paddock’s work with the local company was only part of the recipe; the other ingredient was of
course the participants themselves. For this they turned to the local schools for assistance, which
was revealed when I asked about their recruitment techniques:
“L1: Well there are several things we do. First there’s word of mouth, because we’ve been
doing this for 10 years now. We also do flyers which get passed out into the community
and in the schools— [laughter amongst the three]
J: I’m noticing some laughter, what’s all that about?
L2: At our all-staff meeting this morning the director singled out a comment that (L1) has
better relationships with the school teachers in the district than any of our other librarians
do.
L1: Yeah when I do flyers I’ll help to establish relationships, talk to the principal, maybe
get a list of kids who might really benefit by participating in a program with us and we
might take it from there.”
She related that it was more than just getting the word out by talking to people—all of the schools
in the area as well as other youth organizations—but actually offering substantial cost and resource
savings to partner organizations by pooling assets:
“L1: And those organizations are looking for a computer lab, a way to help the kids in the
area, looking for programs – from story times to where they read books to see if they can
96

find comparisons and create journals. I think the technology aspect will always be a part of
the library, and it will grow through the help of different organizations. We want to partner,
because in the area we’re serving here at [Paddock] there are so many different
organizations and they all have different agendas, and we had to go out and make it known
that we’re not competing, so we can partner and make kids’ lives better.”
In this way Paddock could both avoid taking away kids from other groups as well as target
individuals with known needs. Effectively this facilitated a referral and continuing support and
education network for the youth involved on a regular basis. They thought this was especially
important because the library was able to offer digital tool assets that many of these kids would
not otherwise have, compensating for a disparity which would put them at a disadvantage,
comparatively:
“L3: Well it’s a private school and they do some scholarships and things but still every
student has to have a laptop. So when we went there last week every kid had their books
and laptop.
L1: So now where does that put these kids here? At a disadvantage. That’s why we do as
many programs as we can in technologies and mentoring and all of that, so we can close
that gap just a tad, because they’re just so far behind when it comes to technology. So we
do as many programs as we can and without PNG I don’t know – we’ve been doing it for
so long, but I guess if we didn’t have it we would have created something like that, just
because of the need that’s in the community. I don’t know if we would have been able to
go on with it, because the money we’re getting, the computers, scanners, cameras, I don’t
know if we would have gotten all of that, but even without there would have been some
sort of structured class on teaching them something about technologies, because it’s just
such a huge divide between, which I think will always be there. I can’t see technology not
also being a part of the library.”
The private school the librarian is referring to above not only required students have laptops, but
Apple note-books at that. The price of a single one of those could provide two or three Windows
laptops, underscoring the sheer degree of advantage and difference between the populations of
youth. The branch director’s comments here are also revealing of their commitment to battling this
97

access and skill divide. They identified it as something they’d be willing to do even without the
grants and partnerships, it was just that important. In other words, Paddock’s commitment to
fostering digital literacies amongst youth through library programs existed on its own, but they
were able to make more impact by leveraging partnerships and grants.
RESPONSIVE PROGRAMS
Paddock, like most public libraries at the time of the research study, was invested in providing
computer learning classes for adult patrons as well as the evolving PNG programs for youth. The
benefit of having grants enabled them to find flexibility and learning opportunities in this service
provision. They offered what was a larger array of topics than most:
“L3: We were given computers under the agreement that we’d do classes, Microsoft
classes, a GED class – that was a failure, which is a whole other story—and a job skills
training class and a photography and Photoshop class.”
As indicated above, some classes didn’t work out so well, while others were considered a solid
success:
“L3: The grant enabled all of these. We did two sessions of that, the first session, the MS
class was booked full, and we had somebody from the community that we ended up paying
to conduct the class, but we had twenty stations and twenty people plus a couple of kids
that sat side-by-side with their parents and worked with them and stuff.”
When I inquired about why a given class or program didn’t take off I was told that much of it had
to do with finding the right talent. In the prior section it was clear that existing partnership networks
allowed the library to find the right people to both attend and run the PNG programs, but without
such an experience and network base they needed to spread out and experiment. The person hired
to teach the GED class, for instance, checked out a book on it just prior, read it, and then attempted
to teach it, without being sufficiently prepared. They also tried putting out a call for volunteers,
but it was difficult to find people with the right experience available at the right hours, and to get
them to be dedicated enough they needed to offer some kind of small stipend. They understood
they could be proactive, but ultimately community need and talent would be only somewhat
determinable:
98

“L2: Offering these classes is still a trial – a live and learn experience. We had never had
classes in that lab before, it’s the first time we had been able to run a program with
dedicated space like that before.”
Topics and instructors were only a portion of the battle, too, as they found too many similar classes
offered in a short time span would result in dwindling participant numbers. Finding the right
pacing and getting enough word out to match it proved to be an iterative process. They were also
willing to try to connect assets and strategies from the PNG programs to the adult services:
“L1: e-readers are popular for those who can afford them, because here I have had maybe
2 questions about e-readers, and so that’s hard. With this grant, PNG, what we had thought
about doing was purchasing e-readers, and so we think we can teach the kids how to
download and hopefully we can get enough where we can have a class outside of PNG, for
the public, we’re going to try to do that as well. We’ll start with PNG, because that’s the
first purpose for that money, helping the kids, but then we might be able to use the
equipment for other activities in the library. It’s a slow thing – my future for the [Paddock]
branch library, the digital future, it’s going to be a very slow process.”
Interestingly, what the librarian was illuminating here was how the process was both very rapid
and slow simultaneously. On the one hand they were constantly buying new technologies and
trying new programs, even some as cutting-edge as Photoshop or CAD, but they also had to
determine their outcomes and impacts over the course of years, tracking the development of kids,
watching participation numbers go up and down, and ultimately working with a range of people
and technologies to find the best fit. The rapid change was of course made more possible by the
grants, but ultimately these were also just a reflection of a lively library deeply committed to
improvement.

ALTURA
Altura Public Library faced a daunting situation. They were located in a town in the midst of
economic decline, troubled by rapidly falling real estate values and diminishing tax revenues. Their
financial situation meant that they would have fewer choices moving forward and would need to
seriously reduce their staff, and consequently their services. What they chose to do, given their
reduced funding, however, proved to be an interesting strategy: they decided to focus their limited
99

funds and place greater emphasis on online services, but with an investment in simultaneously
proactively supporting the public in making this transition. This included joining an e-book
provider consortium, increasing access to a wide variety of databases for patrons, offering
curriculum through a third-party online course service and investing in computer basics classes to
enable more patrons to participate in these evolving services. This approach is not entirely unique,
as many libraries across the US seek to reduce costs through outsourcing and by shifting services
online, but Altura’s approach to it was remarkable because they were keenly aware that many
users, often those most in need, would be unable to effectively make use of internet-based services
on their own. Unlike the wealthier suburban communities bordering Chicago many of their patrons
could not be assumed to have access to their own personal computers and smartphones. To
compensate for this they also invested a substantial portion of their limited personnel time in
forming community networks and teaching computer literacies.
LIMITATIONS
The director’s outlook was not exactly what you might call cheerful:
“I said I was optimistic about the future of public library service, because of the services it
provides to the disadvantaged. I guess this means I must be a pessimist about the notion
that we will not have the disadvantaged with us in the future, and I suppose that’s true.”
In a sense this statement accurately reflected the conditions in which the library found itself, a
town with closing businesses, empty buildings and significant populations of recently unemployed
persons. The library was even more important in struggling times, but found it increasingly
difficult to take a strong role in providing programming, due to staff limitations. As the director
described their digital literacy related services:
“Unfortunately, with the exception of a class here, a little extra help there, to me that still
adds up to a passive role.”
The library was quite limited in what it could do. Their full time staff had been reduced by two at
the time of the interviews and they were only able to offer part-time pay to the youth services staff
person, making it impossible for Project Next Generation to continue in future years. This

100

relegated them primarily to a role in providing access to materials, though the director hoped they
could remain flexible enough to alter this role in the future.
As with Shipton, the Altura Public Library director was also wary of subscription-based services
in general. They had chosen to settle on a consortium for e-books, for instance, to help lend weight
to the collective bargaining power of libraries in the area, but knew it was a risk:
“Do you know about [e-book] cooperative? Generally so it works so that you put your
money all in one pot—and it’s a good deal – but your public doesn’t have any priority for
the titles you buy.”
This kind of concern echoed throughout all of their decisions, as they worked to make up funding
cuts through contracts and alternatives. The director had come from a time when the library
possessed their collection and wasn’t against a transforming set of information resources, but was
reluctant to lose control. Less emphasis on their collection meant less justification for their
impressive building space.
ACTIVE EDUCATION
As stated Altura Public Library had dedicated money to additional online services in anticipation
of reduced staff and service offerings. The adult services librarian I spoke to explained their new
efforts. First, they made strides to increase their public computer access, through grants:
“We got $2600 and we targeted it to develop a learning center learning lab and we
specifically stated we were going to use it for training and jobs issues. We have it in place,
it’s a lab of six machines that are separate from the machines out here for the public. And
we use it for our computer classes that we’ve been teaching.”
This allowed them to do small but entirely dedicated classes for computer literacies. These were
the necessary prerequisite for their second objective, digital resources:
“In addition to the [computer] lab – we were able to purchase a few additional databases
that were jobs-related that we put on that, and that includes things like [bilingual career
database name] and [business news database name]. We added a database called [language
learning database] – it mimics Rosetta stone – it’s a training tool, and about 20 of the
101

languages offer a version that is ESL, so for people who are coming in to this country for
people that don’t necessarily have the best English skills it gives them the capability to
learn, but all of this is if a person wanting to do it.”
Many libraries offer self-serve databases, but Altura’s decision to invest in online learning
software as well as their decision to strongly promote and support it, was quite recognizable. Their
choice to enable and encourage patrons to take classes signified an actualized commitment to
envisioning the library as an active education-provider, even if it were an under-resourced one.
Their objective was not to directly compete with offerings of community colleges, but provide a
venue for life-long learning with more active and engaging online tools:
“One of the databases that we’ve got is called [online course service] and it has about 500
classes that people can take and they actually can be a for-credit situation, there is a
professor at the other end who grades you. You have, I think, four months to complete
them, typically… it’s everything from something like Excel and Word and PowerPoint and
Medical Record Keeping and Bee Keeping and using a digital camera. It’s not always
things that are truly ‘traditional’ educational in nature, but also things that are more
personal development. But all of them offer you an instructor at the other end who will
help you answer questions and grade you and everything like that… there are papers, there
are assignments; the digital camera class requires you upload photos and send them to your
professor.”
The motivation was fairly clear: the library considered active patron engagement to be essential to
successful use of their services. This is decidedly different than the position many libraries often
take, which is to consider their collection and databases as a read-only resource. A librarian might
refer a patron to a book or get them started online, but in traditional settings it is up to the patron
to summon up motivation and guide themselves through the data. This depends strongly on a preconstructed set of self-teaching skills and independent personality, traits that some people from
backgrounds with less education or privilege, like elderly or unemployed blue collar people, may
not have, especially with regards to technology. The adult services librarian even went so far as to
explain the fundamental tie between active education and information resources explicitly to
learners:
102

“When I teach the class one of the first things I ask is ‘why am I in a library teaching a
computer class?’ And the answer is two things, we have a computer-based catalog to find
books, first of all, so if you as a patron come in and can’t use a computer you have to
depend on librarians to find things for you, which might be an issue, if people are reluctant
to ask a librarian about an issue, there are a lot of topics people are just not comfortable
with, talking to a friend or a stranger about. By not having that capability is that people
limit their ability to get to information. The other part of it is the databases, we made a
decision here to not purchase print copies of items, and move to databases instead, so if
you can’t use a computer part of our collection and services are inaccessible to you. We
want to make sure that if you walk in this door you can use what we’ve got here. It enables
people to get the most value out of the library.”
In summary, the library approached the issue by (1) ensuring online resources weren’t just lists of
documents, but also included guided information experiences and (2) trying their best to teach
patrons to use their entire collection as more of it was shifted online. But they also knew this was
not enough.
A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CAMPAIGN
One of the major benefits to the migration of services online was that cardholders could make use
of resources from their homes and other public computing locations by logging in. The Altura
librarians knew this wouldn’t actually happen unless they found ways to make sure people were
both aware and equipped to access the various online classes and databases, and so they did what
libraries often do to advertise and started posting flyers and leaving advertisement bookmarks in
lent materials. They were still very concerned, however, that this wouldn’t be an ideal way to reach
populations that were not present in the library, not very wired at home or simply not able to make
use of web applications on their own. They worked to address this issue by working with a network
of local organizations:
“I’ve already started to talk to the offices in town like the employment security office, in
fact we’re going to do a program with them. We’re arranging for those kinds of support
offices to have library cards so people can sit and use them in their office and get access to
some of these tools. I have talked to [acronym], the regional office for disabilities, and they
103

were very interested in it, I need to do the training for their staff. I’m going to talk to our
housing authority, too, because they have multiple buildings with labs. They need to know
they can get to the website and use the resources we have online, because everyone there
is a resident, but even still the building will have a card for them. We’re going to talk to
the Boys and Girls club and we’re going to do formal presentations for all of the schools.
I’ve been talking to people at the Adult Ed program and even some unemployment
agencies. We really want to get people to the kinds of materials and resources we’ve
included in the online services.”
They also made efforts to work with the local business development council and chamber of
commerce to encourage both employers and employees to make use of the online services. At the
time of the interviews much of this engagement was either in-process or about to begin, and as a
result they didn’t have any use numbers or specific plans for collecting feedback. As a community
organizer who has observed many organizations create online resources under the motto “build it
and they will come” I actually thought their approach was appropriately proactive and
simultaneously shared a healthy degree of skepticism. The librarians expressed that they would
have appreciated having the staff and funding to actively lead more classes using more of the
online resources, either in the library or elsewhere, but determined their only reasonable approach
given limited staff resources was to educate opinion leaders and organizations. Ultimately,
however, they knew that successful use of their resources depended upon patron and partner
participation. Whether or not it worked out, as well as the reasons for that outcome, is a chapter
for another study.

BOZEMAN
So far most of these sections have illuminated strategies from a perspective of examining the
composition of activities and equipment assets that relate to fostering digital literacies. Some
attention has also been given to libraries and librarians who have let their perspectives drive their
institution in new directions by being flexible, particularly cognizant of social injustices, or quite
proactive in engaging their communities. Bozeman Public Library was akin to many of these
libraries in these regards. They were actively involved in their community, so much so that they
even coordinated city-wide events that featured as many programs in the span of 11 days as many
libraries do in a half a year. They were successful with raising grant funds, found organizations to
104

donate assets like laptops, and even ran workshops on building websites or photo editing. They
were also keenly aware that buying new technologies could only be accomplished responsibly if
they were also deployed with appropriate plans for maintenance and human staff to teach and
engage patrons with them. The library made use of a volunteer from a local university, much like
Dalhurst, and cooperated with important anchor institutions related to health, public media and
social services, similar to, but on a less-involved level as Aquarin. While all of this was notable
and impressive what actually struck me as the story to draw out from this library was a pair of
policy implementations that seemed to elicit an oppositional set of values: freedom versus
restriction.
PERSPECTIVES ON INTERVENTION
The director seemed to exemplify a person who was seriously invested in keeping an open mind
and maintaining transparency. We spent most of our interview time in one of the only separated
parts of the library, but the rest of the building was almost like a large studio. From the outside it
wasn’t quite apparent: the library had thick stone walls and not a lot of windows, with a sort of
boxy feel, but from the inside it was another place entirely, as the director explained:
“There’s nowhere to just sit and be isolated, but at the same time I think it offers something
different. You can stand in the middle and see everyone who is in here and there’s all this
natural light and all of these high ceilings, that offers a certain kind of symbolism, that this
is a community space, it’s not a space to go be isolated and quiet and just read a book—
you can be like that if you want to, but you don’t have to be that way, it’s easy to feel
connected. You can see the entire spectrum of Bozeman all in one moment.”
They went on to explain the variety of people they’d see in the library, from students and professors
to the recently unemployed and homeless, to moms picking up books with kids after school, to
outpatients from a local health facility seeking a place to rejuvenate intellectually. Besides keeping
an open rapport with a wide network of community organizations in town the director wanted to
keep a good rapport with people in general, by facilitating a space that would be truly open to all:
“You see a lot of people in here using the computers, and a lot of people in here using their
own computers with the wifi, and I don’t think it’s because they don’t have access at home,
I think it might be because they don’t want to live on their couch—they want to be
105

somewhere. Our library, and I think libraries in general, are moving more in the direction
of being a community center, that is focused on education, recreation and communitycenteredness, dialogue and that kind of thing. Some of the programs we have here have a
community salon type of feel, where we bring people together and talk about what’s been
going on in the world, or what we’ve been through as people, a collection of stories from
people and being able to talk to one another. It’s also the only place you can go to and not
have to consume anything. You don’t have to buy a coffee to be here, you don’t have to
buy other things, you don’t have to interact with other people, but you can if you want to.
Most of the places you go in the world you can’t just loiter or hang out, but you can come
to the public library and just be.”
This perspective really seemed contrary to what I was hearing more and more frequently in other
libraries. Most staff at other institutions regarded interactions between different populations to be
frequently problematic, like kids making a racket and bothering the elderly, and didn’t see this as
an opportunity for interaction or for being ever-present in a place teeming with life. This notion of
the lively and welcoming library opposed the traditional dominion of the “shush” librarian that
many of us might have in our heads. It was also different than the idea of specifically targeting
certain populations through policy or space design. Instead of segmenting departments and
sections the space might have felt more like a commons or plaza. This clearly wasn’t without costs,
as the director mentioned they’d have to do traffic control sometimes, but it was a resoundingly
positive view for the relatively small but open space they had.
The youth services librarian I spoke to offered a similar view in her strategy for engaging the kids
in Project Next Generation. They had spent several years trying to bus kids in from low-income
areas and more-or-less forcefully recruited participants and enrolled them in a rigorous schedule
of activities. They eventually found that they were spending so much time on behavioral problems
that didn’t want to be there that leaving it open to whoever wanted to join would create a much
more stable mixture of participants from a variety of schools, classes, races and backgrounds. What
was most notable, however, was their time schedule: open with a 15 minute snack, followed by 30
minutes of a guided activity that could be changed on the fly if required and completed with a full
45 minutes of free time for homework or games. In other words, the majority of the time was open
to create a sort of unstructured teen hangout zone that happened to have technologies:
106

“The kids want to be here, they want to do what they’re doing. They feel like they own this
place. They’re here to have fun – if they’re not having fun then we’re going to do something
different. I want them here just to relax and have fun.”
[she laughs]
I laugh because it’s not relaxing.”
She went on to state that she felt it was alright that they were largely playing games and that
ultimately everyone was happier, parents, librarians and kids alike, if they focused first on
achieving a certain atmosphere for the space and activities, and let learning goals be a second
objective.
She also chose to approach general computer help in a similar manner. Rather than hold
specifically-scheduled classes and workshops, something they had done from time to time with
limited success, she regularly hosted open help hours for whoever wanted to come in. My
expectation was that she would often be overwhelmed by people seeking help, as I am when I’m
assisting classes of people at a time with computers, but when I asked about this she explained it
had never been too much to handle:
“I have this nightmare, where I get 20 people in here and I can’t help any of them. Really
that’s never happened. Almost everyone leaves with at least tools. A problem with a lot of
technology classes is that they just educate ‘the steps,’ but I try to show them how to do
things on their own, how to do research, how to Google.”
The more I inquired the more I understood her method – she would help people one-on-one, with
enough assistance to get them started and working on their own. It wasn’t a rush to meet everyone’s
needs instantaneously, it was a setting in which learning happened incrementally, without a rush.
This tactic worked well for the elderly adults in her computer basics classes, while the ‘hands-off’
method succeeded with the kids. It may have been actually less about the specific issues at hand,
but more about how their own attitudes shaped the learning processes: they were relaxed and
accepting, so people felt more comfortable and, consequently, accomplished more.

107

PERSPECTIVES ON RESTRICTION
The previous arrangement of examples would have been much less notable if it weren’t in
juxtaposition to a series of policies that, on the flip side, seemed very controlling. When I asked if
their internet was filtered, the director told the story of her colleagues at a former library:
“The level of sexual harassment in that library system was pretty intense… from patrons
printing out and picking up sexually explicit materials so the librarians would see it,
watching hardcore porn and sitting in the station and masturbating. It took a while before
they setup a policy, they had no policies whatsoever that restricted what anyone did, but
when I was still there they set up a policy that dealt with public display… since the public
can see what you’re seeing you couldn’t look at sexually explicit material on the library
computers because you’d be showing it to everyone.”
I could tell the director was pretty bothered by what had happened there. In the case of the library
she had spoken about the staff had revolted and were considering legal action, so far as she knew.
Clearly this was a situation where the “live and let live” sort of outlook illuminated earlier would
not stand:
“To me, having a filter has not been the ethical dilemma that I assumed it would have been
and it has actually made it so we don’t have to approach people. If someone is looking at
porn on an internet computer so that they can get a rise out of someone and if it’s your job
to walk up to that person and tell them to stop then you are basically putting yourself in the
position of being the target of their harassment. To ask staff to do that, to approach a person
that’s being sexually deviant on purpose—you’re putting them in an unsafe situation.”
She went on to explain that filters did much of the policing work for them, and that they hadn’t yet
run into a patron who hadn’t been able to access the content they needed. The assistance from
automation wasn’t present only in the form of filters, they also employed a time management
system and had become advocates for it:
“I would tell any library this, if they’re looking at getting a time management system on
their computers and they’re looking at the cost, I tell them it’s for the safety of their staff.

108

If they get mad at you or don’t want to get up you have to tell them again and again until
they get angrier and angrier at you.”
Clearly they felt these systems helped to save them work as well as maintain a positive rapport and
atmosphere in the library. Restrictions weren’t just present on devices inside of the library,
however. The youth services librarian explained their willingness to circulate e-readers to the
public depended upon content restrictions they had imposed on them.
“J: It’s unusual you’re willing to loan out Kindles in an area that has what we might identify
as a substantial distressed or underserved population.
L: Right, with no deposit, too. We’ve just started though, we may not get them back, we
don’t know. There is some psychology with it, we’ve found. Most of them have books
already loaded, and the concept is that a patron that’s not very tech savvy might find it
intimidating to download, so it’s okay for them. If you’ve purchased books to customize it
you might be less likely to return it because you’ve put your stuff on there, giving you a
sense of ownership, whereas if you don’t have an account and you’re just reading some
irremovable samples, you’re more likely to bring it back. This is why libraries want to
block patrons from putting books on there.”
Obviously they hadn’t established a track record to determine if theft or hacking would turn out to
be a problem, but this way of ‘demo-ing’ the e-readers by providing a static selection limited the
use in a way that presumably would be manageable for the library.
So what do these two sets of policies mean, when positioned with one another? Is Bozeman Public
Library inconsistent in its policies? In my view this isn’t the case. What lies behind each one of
these is a reliance on letting conditions and policies structure experience, as opposed to people
directly impacting it. The architecture of technological, physical and information arrangements
helps to determine the way people learn to use technologies, participate in programs that involve
them, and otherwise become socialized into a more digitally-literate self. The process through
which patrons engage with the library relies on their comfort, and all of these policies were in the
service of creating safe and stable circumstances.

109

PLAINVIEW
The very first library I visited taught me to ask a very important question that wasn’t originally on
my interview schedule: who do you consider to be your service population? The reason, of course,
was that this library had a very different take on their service population than most, but it turned
out to be a useful area to explore with most libraries because it revealed something about who they
were most concerned about serving. Some libraries were very hardline about it, claiming to only
serve people within the borders of their specific municipality whereas others expressed a desire to
serve everyone in the area but admitted they could not really do that. Other libraries interpreted
the question in terms of their presence in different demographic groups or used it as an opportunity
to discuss the ways they ran programs outside of the library. Plainview stood out from all of these,
because, as it turns out, Plainview isn’t a stand-alone library, it’s a branch with something of a
double identity. Plainview’s ambiguity in its labeling, service area and interpretation of service
roles made it not only one of the most unique cases I encountered, but arguably one of the most
successful libraries reaching in-need populations with emergent technologies.
THE SERVICE POPULATION
The first thirty minutes of my interview with the system director were filled entirely with the story
of how she and the library came to their current circumstances: a two-building system covering a
strip of service area with pockets that dipped into several municipal territories, led by a rather
outspoken former school teacher. This identity, as it turns out, was the main impetus behind the
library’s unusual arrangement. She explained to me:
“Chicago doesn’t really feel this as much because most of their library areas butt up against
one another so they all have library cards and service. Down here it’s a little different, rural
areas, farms, most of us became libraries through municipalities. I personally think this is
a symbiotic relationship that does not work. My driving force was that everybody could
get a library card without having to pay at the front desk. Kids would come in from a local
school or visit and want a book and I’d have to tell them that their parent hadn’t paid for
service, which would have been part of their taxes and so they’d have to pay it at the front
desk and it would become a key issue, because they’d refuse or be unable to pay. The kids
were hurt by this and parents didn’t understand this. Districts are so political, you have to

110

be aware of why the school district is separate from the city that you’re in which might be
different from the library.”
What the director wanted was a single, unified library service for all people in the neighboring
school district area. When the library split from the municipality to become independent they drew
up coverage such that there would be as few library service gaps as they could handle, so that
service would cover a range of different types of people in terms of ethnicity and class. This
resulted in the construction of a branch library, the Plainview City Library Center. This sort of
decision is strikingly unusual in comparison to most libraries, who often try to arrange their service
boundaries on the basis of optimal taxes or funding within civic borders. In the end, the system
ended up serving two populations, one that was 95% white with 17% below the poverty level and
another with 72% of people of Hispanic, mostly Mexican background and a poverty level of 40%.
This is notable considering the pattern of racial and ethnic segregation in Illinois, as neighborhoods
and even towns tend to be mostly black, mostly Latino or mostly white. Library programs and
assets were able to be shared amongst all locations, with the objective of making the most out of
them for all people, and also to encourage mixing of ideas and patrons. The local director for the
Plainview City branch explained that they had to be careful with this expansion, though, because
they didn’t want the people of Plainview to feel as if they were being colonized by a neighboring
community:
“We’ve also tried to convince the community to take ownership of their library, even
though it is a branch, so we named it of the community, “Plainview City Library Center”
because we wanted the community to embrace us, which was difficult in the beginning,
because this community keeps to itself. To get them to embrace an outsider group that
comes in is harder.”
The hesitation is somewhat unsurprising because of the likelihood of immigrant and
undocumented worker populations in the area. The service gamble and particularly activist
director, however, seemed to have paid off well for this library system and the community as a
whole. It allowed them access to a very wide variety of grants, including a playground donated by
a large sports team, a transparent skeleton anatomical model that could loaned out to schools and

111

a host of technology and literacy-related grants. The system director, of course, attributed this
largely to a very supportive and visionary library board, in addition to her committed team.
COMPUTER-AIDED ACTIVITIES
When the Plainview City library first opened up, they not only had to gain the trust of their
surrounding community, but they also had to establish their own brand:
“Some of them didn’t really understand what a library was, and many were disconnected
from technology. 50% drop-out rate for high school, adult literacy issues in the area, we
had to start from ground zero, forget technology, we had to help them understand what the
library could be for them. The fact that they could come in and get a library card and reach
out to information through our internet terminals was a huge impact for them, in this small
community.”
Internet was generally not very available in this area, as it was largely rural and not a very enticing
market for the big telecom service providers. The grants brought in by the library system enabled
the construction of a pair of T1 lines, which actually made the library the most powerful internet
in the area, but much of the community was not in a place where they could make use of it, yet.
When I asked the branch director about what kinds of programs they ran related to technologies
she told me a couple of stories to help me understand the sorts of information and literacy needs
that were present in the community. The first, was a sort of reference question:
“I was asked about an animal in their backyard. They wanted to know what it was, if they
should be scared of it or if they could eat it. So we used books on animal identification for
this area. Most of the people here are Hispanic, from Mexico, the animals they might see
here are different than the animals they may have previously seen, and this was a very
important question to this man. So that helped me to determine how to grow my collection.”
In most libraries these days this kind of question would be quickly answered by paging through a
few bursts of Google image results, but this patron wasn’t yet ready to learn how to use a computer
or surf the internet, they were actually still learning the language and local context. The director
would work with patrons interested in fixing cars, identifying foods at the grocery store and even
starting a community garden, typically information inquiries that were a little more old-fashioned
112

and DIY. Another, more unsettling story, was given when I asked about how the kids were
engaging with technologies within the library. She had asked the local school board how she could
best prepare kids for participation in school, and was busy considering activities like geometry
basics or song games and instead was told:
“I was absolutely amazed with the answer they came back with when I asked them, was
they asked me to teach the kids to read, write and recognize their name. This was
preschool.”
So her first story for me, in response to my questions about digital literacy, was that she helped the
kids learn how to spell and write down their names so they could sign up to play on the computers.
Many of these kids didn’t have parents who could read to them at home, either as a result of lack
of language and basic literacy skills, or as a result of working multiple jobs just to make ends meet:
“We do use technology with them for school. Since their parents are Spanish speakers they
don’t really have homework help at home. When they need homework help they come
here, and I told them whatever they need to succeed to ask for it here. So we put together
this whole cabinet full of homework supply help – pencils, binders, paper, crafts items,
poster board, calculators—because they would come to us with these homework
assignments and then not have what they needed at home to do it. So we’d go over how to
plan out their assignment and do it and I’ll let them print for free if they need it. This way
we’re helping them to incorporate art and technologies into their classroom projects, so
they can keep up with kids who might have these at home, already… It was a big thing
when they figured out they could print in color... we at first had just black and white
printing at 10 cents a page and then later added color printing at 25 cents a page. They
would print off photos in color or pictures they had created in MS paint or something else,
and then they’d want to laminate it, so we got a lamination machine.”
And this is what was perhaps so interesting about this library. I went from a meeting with the
system director on the first day, when I was shown a pile of advanced tools like digital video
cameras, graphic drawing tablets and e-readers, to a meeting with the branch director on the second
day when I was told many of the people here were totally new to “the culture” of technology. The
kids had enormous access to resources but were starting from a very disadvantaged position to
113

begin with. This made for an especially opportunity-filled setting, one the library had begun to
learn how to exploit by designing library participation incentives. The first, which had apparently
regularized the body of kids that I observed that day and was told was ever-present in the library,
was a video game hang out space. They gathered several console videogame systems via
donations, equipment many of these kids would never get to have at home, and would roll them
out for gaming sessions. They were so successful because of attendance and noise that they actually
had to start segmenting the times of their availability, to give other patrons some peace and quiet.
At the time of interviews the new system being considered was reliant on kids accumulating points
via participation in library programs, points that they could spend on items like digital cameras at
the end of the series. I was told that some kids had accumulated so many points that they weren’t
sure if they’d even have enough places to spend them, the program was actually that popular,
convincing kids to essentially live at the library.
Plainview wasn’t only helping kids by easing them into use of technology resources, they assisted
adults, both patrons… and even librarians:
“We work with a group called the [immigration assistance organization] and they
experienced cutbacks too and now their closest office is in [city], which is about 3 hours
away. So we devised a way to do Skype meetings, so we use this room here, and bring in
a computer and whoever the appointment is for and I get the computer and Skype started
for them and they usually have very little in the way of computer skills and it’s just amazing
to them that they’re talking to someone far away on the screen with Skype… The most
amazing story about that, is because I thought I was servicing the immigrants here, from
Plainview City, but I actually had a person walk in here, and there was a delay, we were
waiting for people on the other end, and so I started talking to the person who was waiting,
it was a family, a mom, a dad and a child, just small talk and it turns out they were from
[small town an hour north], and I said ‘why would you come all the way to Plainview
City?’ for a meeting with someone who is maybe only 2 hours north west of them, but
their answer was that that difference of an hour was significant and this was the place to
go. As a librarian you can imagine what my next move was. I picked up the phone and
called the library in Jerseyville and asked if they knew they had this need and the librarian
had no clue they had any immigrants in their town whatsoever. So I gave her the contact
114

for the [immigration organization] and if this family needed any follow up help they could
do their meetings from that library… Our small town of 2600 is servicing someone from
an hour away.”
It was common for Plainview to help teach whole families. Often they’d see children of all ages,
so their aims for Project Next Generation were rather versatile but also exceedingly optimistic:
“We’re starting on the very basics here but they will hopefully take the kids as far as their
imagination can take them.”
Their goal, ultimately, was to engage kids with varying ability levels and experiences with digital
production activities that might lead them to careers. Their plan was pretty vague, as it was still in
the works at the time of the interviews, but their general scheme was to get the kids to learn to
make videos, meet guest speakers from all over the area, and Skype between the two library
locations to collaborate.
Plainview is the sort of library that makes it clear to me as a researcher that constrained studies
like this have to be just the beginning. How did their PNG plan work out? Were the adults able to
start using Skype on their own after regular orientation? How well did the tablets and media
production equipment hold up with so many patrons using them? What did the kids do with the
30+ cameras they earned with points? Many libraries I encountered in my sample had only just
begun to actually take advantage of more recent digital technologies with Project Next Generation,
despite its relative age as a grant program. The section on Grand Ridge Public Library reveals part
of why this might have been the case, but my impression is that another significant reason was that
we had reached, for many communities, the tipping point in terms of social norms and production
technologies: they felt they had to be more than public computing access.
TECHNOLOGY AS SPECTACLE
The social norms, unfortunately, also reveal questionable associations in the social consciousness
of patrons. While the videogames were an excellent way to get a mass of kids engaged with the
library, initially, one also has to consider: the kids were in the library to play—consume—games,
not learn from books and the internet. It’s not necessarily a problem when the library becomes a
center for entertainment, but when its core definition becomes this to some patrons we might
115

wonder where some of the other perhaps more noble social roles slipped off to. The point
incentives were similarly troublesome, in their own way:
“One of the items they can work towards was this camera, for 30 points, and immediately
being teenagers they were trying to devise a plan to get the most amount of points for the
least amount of work, to basically game the system. So one little boy checked out 30 items,
thinking he could get a point for each, but then had to find out you can only get a maximum
of one point per day for check-outs.”
While the point system did seem to genuinely get more involvement from some kids, it also
detracted from the intrinsic value and motivation for others. They weren’t in the library for the
sake of programs or perhaps even reading the books they borrowed, they were after points for a
camera. The spectacle and desire for the shiny new technology device was the lure, not the
knowledge, learning or time spent with friends. The library was certainly aware of some of the
problems with the social norms surrounding how people learned to adopt these gadgets into their
life, and tried to construct programming to help prepare them to deal with it:
“I had the Plainview City Police come in and talk to the children about internet safety,
because it’s a topic their parents can’t talk to them about. Their parents may or may not
even be using the internet or know what it is. To talk to children about the proper way, the
proper etiquette of using the web in a positive way, when they were done they were given
a little homework assignment where it gave them scenarios they had to respond to, like
bullying online or people they don’t know reaching out to them online and all of these
different scenarios and the kids would have to say what should be the proper response to
those things.”
On the one hand this activity might have helped to inspire critical perspectives, but on the other
hand I get the impression that it might have been unrealistic. From my experience working with
kids in a sea of internet norms and technologies that change on a daily basis, I suspect kids could
encounter cyberbullying in games and through memes that the police officer wouldn’t know how
to help them to identify. It required years of experience studying social informatics and being a
member of the UIUC campus for me to successfully decipher racism behind the complicated “Ima

116

Chargin’ Mah Lazar” Chief Illiniwek meme, 67 something that most undergraduate college students
never picked up on. It’s not always bad to meet people on the internet, either. Learning these
nuanced concepts and contexts would not be the kind of thing that can be accomplished in the span
of a workshop, but instead via consistent socialization. The library’s intentions were of course in
the right place, but just like their deployment of various advanced technologies, they all depended
on their work with the kids on a regular basis over time.
The main reason I bring this all up is that it seems like Plainview was struggling with the fearspectacle dynamic with technology that many other libraries were at the time. On the one hand
they knew it contained such amazing possibilities, ones they didn’t fully understand and perhaps
even feared, but on the other hand they were sometimes unsure how to most appropriately deal
with them. In light of this I thought the director said something that was very wise:
“I’ve been here since 1995. So I told my husband I’m looking at 2015 as my retirement
and that would be 20 years, to be here that long and hand it off to the next generation. I’m
looking for next generation librarians to be here. My time will have been, I’m still creative
and pushing forward, but I’m having to have a lot more help than I used to have, I used to
understand technology like the back of my hand, but I sometimes can’t even start
anymore.”
The trend for many directors is to stay in place for as long as they can, for many, like Belle Terre,
into their 70’s or older. This means many libraries have veteran staff that may have been overrun
by the rapid change that’s transpired in the past few years. Some react by defending themselves
with Unions, as was seen in Grand Ridge, others just ignore it, as was the case with Eastover, and
still others build their entire strategy around it, like Altura, but it seems like relatively few reconcile
that their time has passed and pass on the torch. It’s even more interesting that this system director
wished to do this, given how unusually successful and groundbreaking she had proven to be.

LEARNING
When I was told many of the patrons were learning technologies for the first time and came from
another culture without much exposure, I naturally asked if the library found some interfaces and
associations were more natural than others for their population. At the time there was a lot of talk
on the impending departure from the use of metaphors in interface, like the Windows 8 move to
clean and bold minimal layouts, compared to Apple’s textured calendars that looked like a real
object. Clearly much of this is just associational, as no one actually searches with a magnifying
glass or saves to floppy disks. Yet we still use these as icons, and it is possible metaphors were
very important for people coming from a totally different social background and/or language. The
branch director indicated that without metaphors, they wouldn’t have been able to teach them at
all:
“Teaching them the concept of virtual e-mail versus real life mail is hard, but if you don’t
have those metaphors they’d be lost entirely.”
She explained that the hardest part in helping the adults was breaking the language barrier with
metaphors. You could use a translator to help with words but concepts, ideas and phrases don’t
always transfer directly, which meant she had to spend more time helping each one. A source of
frustration was that it might be the only time she’d see such a patron, as their schedules wouldn’t
permit attendance in classes. The previous method for libraries would of course be that the
traditional reference librarian would hand the patron a book and “empower” them to learn on their
own, but it really didn’t work like that for people at this library:
“You can’t exactly be a self-learner on technologies, there’s a gap there… You can’t just
give them a book – if you hand them a huge book and then tell this person, who may or
may not speak that language very well that they need to read this huge book, which many
native speakers would struggle with, to figure that out they’re in trouble. Just about by the
time they figure that out a few months from now there’s another book this big that they
have to read about the new version that’s better than the other one, but you don’t know
why. It’s just moving too fast for books with this.”

118

Truthfully this is probably the case for most technology learners, not just those who are ELL.
Books were equally unsuitable for many of the kids when it came to how they learned technologies,
too:
“I think a lot of it has to do with the generation we’re seeing right now and culture. Instant
gratification and how they get there is they absorb so much through visual interactions.
They don’t have the patience or time in mind to read a book, they might get all of that in
the flash of a picture… If there’s something they want to learn about or do they will go
look on YouTube and find a visual of it through image search. When we’re doing
homework assignments I’ve done the same thing, I do a Google Image search to try to help
them explain what they’re looking for, paging through images to identify ideas goes much
faster sometimes, faster than reading websites or flipping through books. The kids are
doing this kind of thing all of the time – they won’t read about how to do ‘such and such’
on a bicycle, they’ll want to see a video of it. I don’t see adults doing that. I see them
coming in asking for books or spending time reading, but that won’t always work for
technology.”
These information-seeking behaviors are nothing new to scholars; it may be faster to convey
information visually with pictures rather than text. Some might see the lack of reading as a
representation of the downfall of our educated society, but I’d probably just advocate we have to
have tools to shortcut the information overload and this is one of them, with its affordances, good
and bad. The attitudes among learners the branch director saw were quite typical of the same
contrast found in just about every other library, as revealed in an exchange:
“If I put one thing on the screen the adult will sit there and ask me every single question
on every single thing. “What’s this, what’s this, what’s this?” Heaven help me if I have a
desktop full of icons. They’ll want to know what each one does and then not end up getting
anywhere, they won’t try anything or explore, they get locked in their seat. By this time
the kids would have tried 20 different things. If the adult gets to something and it doesn’t
work they want to know why, they want to know why it’s not working. Kids may not care
why.

119

J: Those are both important approaches though, right? The kids exhibit a lot of flexibility
and curiosity in their computer use, and might be faster or more efficient, but the adults are
more inquisitive and critical in their thinking. The ideal is a person who is able to do both,
simultaneously, right? I guess both need a person who is persistent and motivated.
D: I think what I see more is the adults getting frustrated, and wanting to throw their
computers out the window into the backyard. I end up seeing the children evolving, they’re
more okay with having less control and reacting, they have no fear. They are also able to
ask each other about how to solve problems and share knowledge and suddenly three kids
are working on solving it, while their parents sit there totally afraid of it.”
I could only speculate as to if this difference between adults and kids was compounded by language
and immigrant culture shock issues or if really it was more prevalent. Perhaps new generations
just learn to be more adaptive and collaborative across the board.

BELLE TERRE
As an institution the public library is stuck somewhere between influencing social structures and
being subject to them. The difference individual librarians make is of course important, but at the
same time libraries establish service roles to ensure impacts are more sustained and regularized
beyond any given individual. Much of this text so far has focused heavily on libraries that are
making advances in library services in ways that are flexible, unusual, and driven largely by the
unique innovations that individuals within those libraries and communities produce. It’s worth
considering, and examining, however, the cases when libraries are unable to do this, either against
their best intentions and attempts or as a result of entirely different conditions and perspectives.
A SLIGHT VARIATION ON CLASSES
Belle Terre Public library is representative of the former. Located within one of the most
impoverished areas in the state, the library is more like a rural location in some ways than a small
town. The director and staff told me about their arrangement of computer classes, which were
enabled largely as a result of savvy grant writing:
“Well the adult programs we’ve had – we got an EDD grant – Eliminating the Digital
Divide. I’ve been working with a group from [acronym], we work with [college], and they
120

teach classes, and they’re rather expensive but it was kind of nice because they bring
laptops from the outside and then we set up a computer lab, and I have people sign up for
classes. Last year I think they taught 10 classes, and I think I’m going to do the same thing
this year, because that’s really helping the community a lot, because a lot of people come
in here and they don’t know how to turn on a computer, how to create an e-mail, they just
need so much attention, very little background.”
These classes were nothing out of the ordinary, just covering the typical computer basics
encountered at most libraries—word processing, e-mail and internet—but they were somewhat
unusual for a library of this size because they were taught by external organizations that were
brought in and participants were provided laptops for use during the class, making it possible to
do without having a specifically dedicated lab space in various parts of the library. The director
required that staff lacking computer basics skills also attend so that they could better help patrons
one-on-one later on. The staff noted to me that they not only learned about the various software
programs in the classes but also how to best teach the concepts to learners – leaving space for
questions, organizing the presentation of information logically, providing handouts, and more.
When I inquired about the composition of attendees I was led to understand that the context they
were dealing with was different than many libraries. The participants weren’t always the elderly
typically encountered in computer basics classes in many other settings. Instead they were often
impoverished individuals who needed the experience badly to get jobs—some of whom might
have also been elderly. She explained:
“Yes, I sign up something like twenty because I’m lucky if 12 come. I understand why
airlines overbook flights, because so many people never show up, and I call them and
remind them that class is happening tomorrow and they say “oh hey I’ll be there” and then
they still don’t come. I guess because it’s free they don’t care as much.”
She said it was a challenging mix—she would call patrons in advance to remind them and find that
their phones were disconnected. They’d be able to make one class one day but not get off work to
come on another. Part of the reason she chose to bring in outside help was that they could provide
a certificate showing that participants had learned something, an item very prized amongst
individuals who were quite desperate to find jobs. She said she wasn’t even sure that all of them
121

were going to be able to use their newly learned skills without practice but just having the sheet
would provide some measure of confidence. The library staff explained to me the kind of patrons
they often worked with:
“Some folks – we have a literacy program here – what you have is that they don’t have a
GED yet and they have children, so when they come in to take their tests they’d be about
2nd or 3rd grade level abilities that are adults now, that’s the hardest part, when they’re real
low level. A lot of times when they’re filling out applications they don’t understand what’s
being asked, besides knowing how to get through the program or knowing what it is.
Reading itself might be difficult for them.”
In other words the library wasn’t just providing services for a diminishing generation of elderly
persons, but a steady stream of people who had been underserved for much of their lives. This
matched my experience working with libraries locally in Champaign, where some of the folks who
would need help went beyond just a lack of familiarity, but actually faced learning disabilities and
a lack of literacy to start. This isn’t to say the users felt all that disempowered; in fact they also
behaved in ways that matched the teens I encounter on a daily basis:
“The computers are so slow, and then what happens, is they’ll click-click-click until it
freezes entirely because they think it should be going faster, or they’ll get out of something
because they think it’s not going to go, they don’t have the patience sometimes. Or they
jump from computer to computer because they think another one might have faster internet
and we have to explain that they’re all on the same system.”
What’s notable in this series is that the library faced an audience that altered the ways we might
talk about fostering digital literacies. Patrons needed opportunities to develop confidence, establish
cognitive models and learn to effectively problem solve, but they found these within just the realm
of computer basics. There was no advanced video editing, deployment of e-readers, comprehensive
digital archiving or anything like that, and yet the library could still be said to be tackling part of
the question of digital literacy.

122

STIFLED COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS
Not every library has the advantage of a collaborating local university or other supply of talented
volunteers. The director had made some efforts to engage the local high school for help, but had
not found much support:
“I’ve been trying to set something up with the Kiwanis here in town but it hasn’t gotten
very far. A lot of the people coming in to the library want to write resumes and apply for
jobs online and don’t have a clue what to do and so I’ve been trying to get something out
to them, because they’re always looking for something for their high school kids, and I’d
say ‘High School kids they know all about computers, they were raised with them’ so what
I wanted to do is have a clinic and have people come in to the clinic and have the high
school kids sit with them and help them apply for applications. So far it hasn’t gotten very
far, but I thought that would be a mutually beneficial thing.”
It wasn’t clear how much she had actually continued to pursue a collaboration, but it was apparent
that the perspectives of the individuals in question mattered. It wasn’t an issue of if high school
students had the requisite knowledge (if they were ‘digital natives’ or not, an implied assumption),
it was an issue of motives to volunteer in the first place. Much of the town seemed reluctant to
fully engage in the library, despite the director’s efforts to reach out to them. Another example was
explained when the director spoke about a digital camera they had been provided from a grant to
promote small business:
“D: I try to play up the library, I went to the Chamber and told them about all of the
equipment I have, and they said that was good but nobody from there has contacted me.
J: What did that look like? Was it a meeting full of people you didn’t know, and it was hard
to present?
D: That’s kind of what it was, I just made an announcement, and they almost brushed me
off just saying ‘alright that’s good, thanks.’”
It seemed that she may not have been taken very seriously by this group. All of the reasons are of
course not entirely clear—it’s possible partnership would require long-time relationships or
perhaps these organizations had different needs, but the librarian was at least trying to be pro123

active. This led me to wonder about the general reputation of the library. When I asked the director
about her perspective I unearthed a really important exchange:
“J: Do you think the role of librarians is going to change? From being like archivists who
are just book providers from behind the scenes to public librarians who have to connect to
people actively in their service. Do you think that’s going to be the change?
D: I think that’s going to be more part of our future than it used to be. We’re not just going
to sit behind the desk and stamp the dates anymore, we have to enhance their lives in a
different way rather than offer them different reading materials.
J: You sound a little sad about that.
D: No I’m not sad, it’s just scary. Now, I worry about that in our community, that I’m not
reaching enough, that I’m not feeling their needs enough.”
This moment seemed to represent what I felt when I visited many libraries around the state. The
library was a long-standing institution in most places I visited. It had a brand, a reputation and a
way of doing things. Even when a given librarian or director wanted to cause a shift, they were
still doing this amidst their surrounding conditions. This director certainly felt pressured to find
ways to alter their services and community connections, and indeed she had overcome much of
the funding barrier through assistance from grants, but she still faced other structural issues. I
continued by asking her about the differences between the library staff and her patrons:
“D: I wish I had more African American employees, because the ethnic make-up of the
village has changed so much, it’s 75% African American now and I only have one person
on my staff that’s African American.
J: Is that more about number of people applying? Why do you think that is?
D: A lot of people just haven’t left. I’ve been here 7 years and I’m the newest member of
the staff, we just don’t have much of a turn-over. One woman is 80 and she’s worked here
35 years.
J: Wow.
124

D: I have another woman that’s 76 and she’s worked here over 20 years. A lot of people
have been here over 10 years. So I mean the community has changed since then, but…
whatever. Most of the people are local.”
This seemed to suggest a partial answer to my inquiries about the library’s struggles. On the one
hand it was a place of stable employment for people who had been living in the town for decades.
They had invested in this place, made it their own and established its meaning in the eyes of their
community. On the other hand it meant that when the community rapidly changed around them it
caused a significant gap between employees and patrons, certainly in terms of race, but also quite
possibly in terms of class, age and education as well. Likewise while the community changed
demographically the job market and knowledge economy shifted as well. Computers, the internet
and cell phones had become parts of daily life and information access—but only for some, it was
not even throughout this community. Understanding the varied needs of the individuals and
connecting these up with rapid technological change was therefore difficult. The director was
aware of this, and tried to find ways to reach out, retrain staff and otherwise guide the library, but
this was all in the face of a confused array of conditions subject to fluctuating community
composition and broader social norms. This particular case of attempting to overcome structural
hurdles was a good reminder that the redistribution of money and personal agency is not always
enough.

GRAND RIDGE
Most of the challenges faced by libraries reviewed in past sections have had a great deal to do with
structural factors and limitations. Many libraries are understaffed or under-funded, or face rapid
demographic or technological change that outpaces their own rate of change. A lot of the stories
highlight particularly adaptive librarians and Project Next Generation programs that successfully
responded to digital literacy needs amongst patrons. Grand Ridge Public Library showed evidence
of challenges when it came to adaptive librarians and PNG programs. Their issues seemed to be
rooted primarily in internal library dynamics.

125

COMPUTER CLASSES AND COMPUTER REFERENCE
Despite its troubles Grand Ridge was well-established in providing classes related to various
technologies for patrons. This matched the views of the then Adult Services librarian, who
explained why she positioned her services as she did:
“Just to be able to be a good citizen, you need to be able to know how to access certain
things that you can only get through your computer and if you don’t have one at home,
you’re going to come, hopefully, to use one of the computers here. So to me that’s one of
our main missions, is to be able to help people to be better citizens and if they need digital
tools to do that, then we need to be the ones that help them get there.”
One of the librarians who worked for her echoed the sentiments, further explaining the scope:
“We’re trying to get them at least to the basic levels of media and computers… but then
also knowing the cutting edge. Because we do, also, have people who come in and ‘Hi, I
want to switch my computer over to Linux. ‘Do you have a book on this? How do you
interact with the Ubuntu Desktop?’”
Providing guidance and instruction was so important that they had actually recently split their
reference service into two desks, one facing the open computing area and the other facing the open
floor and stacks, for general reference inquiries. They had hoped this would result in a better
division of labor, but it hadn’t worked as intended as much as they would have liked:
“Everyone who is at the desk has to be knowledgeable about this thing to be able to help
the patrons. I would say, of the questions we get are on those two desks, it’s probably easily
50% having to do with some sort of technology of any kind.”
Some patrons didn’t want to wait in line for help so they’d just stride over to the other desk and
ask for computer help there. The reason they separated the desks was twofold: first to try to
innovate in layouts and arrangements to better meet patron needs and second to address labor and
skill considerations, an issue that I will return to in a moment.
The range of regular computer classes the library offered in its separate dedicated lab was
impressive, to say the least:
126

“Every month, try to do computers 101, keyboarding and mouse use, usually a Word one,
and basic internet, those are kind of the four core classes. We almost always do those four
and then we have more advanced classes, mostly based on what our patrons asked for. If
they say, ‘Gosh! We don’t know about Google Docs’ we will develop a class on Google
Docs. We are now doing a blogging class which has been sold out for the past two months.
We’re just teaching them, 'how to use Blogger' and talking to them about ‘What is a blog?’
We almost always do a Kindle class, we do EBay, we do images, external jump drives,
how to buy a computer, 'how to just defrag a computer and clean it up.' People want to
know about security and stuff like that, so really, it’s everything."
Most of the classes were well-attended, the other librarian I spoke to remarked that they had three
times the anticipated demand for their initial e-reader classes. I was intrigued at how they stayed
connected to patron demand and so I asked how they went about developing courses:
“If you've decided, you got patrons asking for a class on e-Bay, how would you guys go
about will people instruct that class?
L: First, we probably say, besides and send an e-mail saying, “Hey, we’re really getting a
lot of questions about eBay. Does anybody know anything about it?” and, inevitably, one
of my staff members would say, “I don’t really know, but I’m interested in learning.” or
somebody would e-mail back and say, “I know a lot, what do you need?”
This process, however, sounds easy when it’s encapsulated in limited quote snippets like those
above. It’s as if the library offered this astounding array of classes and help and just invented the
programs as they needed with a little bit of extra work and knowledge networks. Or, so we might
think, until we dig in a little deeper.
A DIVIDED SHOP
I was initially surprised at how openly frustrated the librarians I spoke to were about the working
conditions at their library, until I started to read more news reports from the Public Library
Association (PLA) publicly recognizing some of the tensions. It was clear the struggles were fairly
public, so they didn’t have anything to hide, but at the same time they were likely representative
of similar issues at other libraries that might be less willing to discuss them openly.
127

Unions fill an important function in most industries as they protect the labor from profit-motivated
decisions that are detrimental to employees, decisions often motivated by disconnected groups like
stock holders or hedge funds. Library unions are a little unique in this regard, as the public library
is not a for-profit institution and generally has a heritage of great respect and value for its workers.
The recent two decades have seen continued reframing of library goals in terms of economics and
“the bottom line” (Buschman 2003), however, and this, combined with the library’s increasing
common ground with IT service related fields, where unions are less frequent, has resulted in what
I contend are alternative circumstances. In a sense the requirements of the field have changed: we
need librarians who can fill a wide variety of roles and carry out many kinds of tasks, technical,
human and materials-related and who can quickly adapt to new contexts in order to fit the
continually transforming needs of the public. This issue isn’t only related to the information
revolution: public libraries have also become a more prominent part of the social safety net as
other components have shrunk ever since the Reagan administration. As discussed in previous
sections libraries often employ much older workers who may not have had an education that
prepared them to deal with constant change, especially change in technologies. Library science is
also impacted by an inconsistent credentialing system, as there are a few types of Master’s degrees
and degree-holders may differ greatly in the kinds of skills they possess, and may or may not
belong to a library-connected Union based on their qualifications.
In the case of Grand Ridge it was explained as a significant tension:
“We’re a divided shop here. I have union staff that do not teach, four of them. One of the
four does teach. Then, I have 5 librarians that do teach classes. Of course, I can force them
to do whatever I want. I can say, “Here’s a classroom and topic. Teach it.” But, library
assistants, if it’s not part of their job description, they can volunteer to teach it, but I cannot
ask them to teach a class, even if they have great knowledge in that area.”
The issue in Grand Ridge, as it was explained to me, had a lot to do with both staff technical skills
as well as Union solidarity. On the one hand it would seem fair that a contract should be
renegotiated if a person’s job duties were to change substantively, but on the other hand for this
renegotiation to require a system-wide change with months of bargaining seems unreasonable.
There are requirements to protect the labor, such as if they’d be supplied training resources, paid
128

for their training time and given ample time to learn what they needed to. There are also
requirements to make it possible for the library (employer) to successfully provide services, like if
they’re able to move staff between divisions, alter their mission profile to fit new needs without
incurring prohibitive costs and, perhaps most important in the case of Grand Ridge, if they’re
simply able to operate a collaborative and comfortable environment where workers wouldn’t be
afraid to pool resources and communicate. Individual employees were able to volunteer their
services, but this was a little dangerous as one wrong move or miscommunication could cause fallout and disputes:
“I have one union employee who’s just very interested in doing these kind of things, wants
to and comes to me and says, “Can I teach this class?” or “I want to do this.” As long as I
verify that they’re coming to me and they’re willing to do it, then I can, but I couldn’t then
go to the person sitting next to him and say, “Okay, you are going to now do it, too.”
Because then, I would get a grievance against me that I was making them do something
outside of their job description.”
In many libraries this might be related to technical and social skills. It seems cruel to ask an elderly
woman to learn how to teach MS Excel when she’s just barely figuring out e-mail and has never
taught a class on anything before, but in Grand Ridge it wasn’t exactly an issue related to abilities:
“And what’s interesting is that anyone of the people in my division, regardless of if they
are a librarian or library assistant, could teach any of those classes. They are all
knowledgeable enough to teach, all of them. It’s just that I can only make certain ones of
them teach them.”
It seemed as if it was a matter of pride and solidarity for some employees to respect the boundaries.
There was also evidence, by the way both librarians spoke about cross-library programs, that
communication between departments was also complicated by the Union-imposed limitations.
There are times that coordination between services would have certainly helped:
“There’s no internet access upstairs [in the children’s section]. There’s no public computer
that they can go and their kids can play while doing their thing. All that’s up there are

129

restricted game computers. I’ve got kids literally walking across tables downstairs that I
have to manage and supervise because their parent’s trying to get something done.”
The fractured staff made it hard for them to have a coherent sense of identity. The Adult Services
librarian expressed that it was a challenge to define their roles in part because they were pulled in
so many directions, even just by requests for classes alone:
“I struggle with that a little bit simply because I do want to be everything to everybody. If
they come and ask me for this, I want to be able to help them with that. But, I think
sometimes we have to say, ‘Okay. What are the resources involved in doing this? Does
anyone have knowledge about it? Is it something we can reasonably offer to an audience
that, is there enough of an audience? Is this just one person wanting to know how to build
a website? What’s their motive?’ If it might be for small business, that might be different
than ‘I want to start a family blog to share with my grandkids.’”
When I asked her about how the director went about establishing library service objectives, and if
they included a vision of the library as an information production space or education provider, she
elaborated on the reason why each department felt pulled in a different direction:
“I don’t think that she has a clear direction from her board either as to which she should
solidly be working on or focus towards… a good library has to know what it wants to be
and where it wants to go and then they have to anchor everything on that. We don’t have
that here. We’re kind of grasping at straws as to what our bigger picture and our role even
is.”
Some of this appeared to be related to the library’s responsibility to the city. When I asked how
the library staff roles were determined it was indicated that it was a complicated process that took
place, in part, in city hall. As I understood it this made for a sort of politics-style type of
management, where many players and forces helped to determine what the library did, as opposed
to just the director or board. As much as I’d like to liken this to democracy it was more adversarial
than that.
The director left not too long after my visits to this library; it was clear that the tensions were one
of the reasons she didn’t want to meet with me individually. I would have to go back to conduct
130

more research and interviews, but from what I could tell from reading news reports the situation
worsened, reached a breaking point with negotiations and layoffs, and is now on the slow road to
recovery.
PATRON DISCONNECT
One of the other struggles Grand Ridge faced, besides issues with internal communications and
job assignments, was conducting and acting on feedback and evaluation. It seemed, like many
services, the library varied some in its operations. The Adult Services Coordinator indicated she
collected feedback from classes, but when I asked one of the other librarians about her process I
was given a different representation:
“J: What are the hallmarks of success? How do you go about evaluating whether or not
services are working? This can be formally in classes but also like these moments that
you’re helping—
L: Haven’t
J: Say again?
L: Haven’t.
J: Oh, you haven’t? You haven’t been able to evaluate most of your tech help?
L: Yes. The only evaluation I have is if they don’t come back for more questions.
J: Okay. In the classes, do you guys do evaluation sheets or there?
L: Used to.
J: Not anymore?
L: Usually the evaluations were rate stuff like 1-5 and whether handout’s useful and was
the teacher. And people are like “It was great.” “That’s nice.” “What class do we have?”
“These are great.”
J: So, it doesn’t feel like it’s all that valuable?

131

L: Right. You’re like, “Well, I didn’t do horribly. Yeah.” But you’re not really sure what
you could have done better.”
This seemed to indicate that providing patrons with questionnaires after classes was a much worse
way of understanding their needs. The Adult Services director seemed to assemble most of her
information from talking to patrons and from the kinds of questions they were getting at the desk.
On the one hand this quote suggests libraries ought to seek out patron needs via different methods
than just asking them, but on the other hand it successfully relates what was an issue that seemed
to come up a few times in the interview: the library staff had trouble connecting to the patrons in
general.
Some of this may have had to do with the language and approach, as I consistently heard the phrase
“customer service” uttered in interviews, which might have implied thinking of patrons as users
of a product, as opposed to members of a community. The patrons might have in turn seen the
librarians as service-agents like a person in a check-out isle at a grocery store, as opposed to an
educator or guide. I was given examples of times patrons expected the librarians to write their
resumes for them, or:
“I’ve had a lady pushed her phone across the desk at me, she looked at me and she said,
‘program my voice-mail.’”
One of the staff members I spoke to seemed to be generally frustrated with the activities of the
users she had to deal with on a day-to-day basis. I asked her what kinds of technology service
changes she’d like to see in the library and was told:
“Probably having a dedicated staff person who is always on the floor to sit the computers.
For the people who are like, ‘Whoa!’ that need you to discourage them from clicking on
the blinking thing that says ‘You have a new message!’ or ‘You have won!’ You don’t
click on that. Sort of as a one-on-one for the people who aren’t going to improve their own
education about the computer. They might be pretty content with playing online poker and
Facebook. Then, they don’t really want to interact with anything more than that.”
This led me to ask her if the patronage of the library and services she provided there matched her
expectations coming in:
132

“I think I was surprised at how many people don’t know where the spacebar is on the
keyboard for job searches. It was overwhelming and sad… I knew that they are going to
come in for job searches. But I didn’t know that you would have to teach them how to use
the mouse first.”
Upon inquiring about her experience in her Masters program I was told that she had grown up in
a different sort of library-service context. Going from her experience elsewhere, to school and then
to the Grand Ridge Public Library was a severe shift:
“[Library school] was really great at fostering enthusiasm and sort of a shiny concept of
what [libraries] could be. Then, you come into the library and you’re like ‘I think I have to
go flush that toilet.’”
The Adult Services director relayed that she often encountered staff who had trouble understanding
patrons or who were less than excited about certain parts of her job. She explained that she grew
up in a town that was considerably more diverse and wished she could see more of that diversity
amongst her staff. She spoke well of the library staff person who was willing to help with the
computers:
“I’ve got one African-American staff member, I really wish you could meet him, he’s the
library assistant but he’s going to library school. Very non-traditional, served in the army,
has a bachelor’s in – his minor’s in African-American studies but his bachelor’s was in I
want to say it was Sociology so it wasn’t humanities but he has a very different background
rather than a traditional, right out of college student. He’s an excellent staff member and
just has an interesting way of coming to libraries, but was hired in as a library assistant so
he didn’t work his way up. I would say, he’s probably, of all my staff, the one that’s most
kind of in touch with what folks need out there, especially in terms of the using the
computers and how to help them with that sort of thing.”
This was the same staff person who was willing to volunteer outside of their Union duties. It was
likely his connection to the needs of the patrons was part of his willingness to make his job to
provide services for them, as best as he could fit in with the rules.

133

PROBLEMS WITH PNG
So far every story I’ve told about Project Next Generation has been about its success in connecting
kids to digital literacies. PNG at Grand Ridge had been in action for quite some time, but
apparently faced some harsh difficulties along the way. Much of it appeared to be due to internal
communication and responsibility issues. The people in charge of the program varied from year to
year as it was passed on by those at higher levels of the organization. One of the librarians I spoke
to explained:
“I don’t like the program. Because I work with teens, I had to go with it for the two and a
half years that I have to before I finally got out of it. I’m rather glad that it’s been cancelled
as a program because I don’t think it quite worked. I think one library that I've seen—
Aquarin, they did exactly what the program was supposed to do and it’s fantastic. For the
rest of us, it’s very frustrating because librarians who don’t use digital cameras, don’t do
editing, don’t know even the software, or how to try it out and then mentor kids about it.”
At the time of the interviews several libraries thought PNG was potentially going to be canceled
state-wide, and others simply thought it was going to get moved from them to another library. One
of the aspects of the grant, for better or for worse, is that it did not stipulate specific uses for the
funds. Libraries were allowed to apply them flexibly to cover the cost of staff, infrastructure like
broadband or for buying equipment to support programming. This meant that the success of the
grant was largely left in the hands of the individual library. Most libraries I spoke to had the same
problem Grand Ridge did with enrollment:
“We have the highest enrollment of teens when we did movies and digital cameras and
how to edit because that’s the cool thing to do. We tried to do that over and over again.
But, because none of us knew how to do any of that, didn't work out so well... people get
burnt out because the students aren’t engaged. Sometimes they get dumped here, the
parents just dropped them off after school”
One obvious approach to solving the recruitment issue was partnership with community
organizations, which Grand Ridge also tried, with limited success:

134

“This last semester, it took a very long time to get it organized and find a group that was
willing to work with us…we’ve done it both ways, where we just kind of put out an all call
for whoever wants to be involved.”
And later added:
“They kept having to cancel because they had other activities that they had planned for the
kids. They did not place enough importance and priority on the project either.”
Beyond the acquisition of a reliable audience they also ran into problems with the technologies
and the skills to use, teach and trouble-shoot them:
“We have lots of problems. They’re a lot to do with technology. The video cameras that
we have, can only be downloaded on one computer in the building. And when that person
is no longer a mentor…”
Or another time:
“And then, the day before that software would have been erased from the lab computer
without letting us know. So, suddenly, we couldn't do that. There were some problems in
the structure.”
I asked if she felt like they were given enough support to develop the skills and documentation for
curriculum over the years it sounded like it wasn’t adequate:
“We were given plenty of time and support to learn it ourselves but are not familiar enough
with windows movie maker or what have you…They’re just expected to do amazing things
with technology that you should be learning over a semester in a college course and we
just didn't have time because we usually only met for maybe an hour a week.”
I explored the topic further by asking about guidance provided by other libraries and the state
library itself:
“We do meet once a year and then maybe twice a year, interact with the other PNG
locations around the State. I’ve seen things that really worked and we each steal each
other’s ideas of things that work. I have seen it work and I have seen it not work so well.”
135

The Adult Services director hadn’t been very involved in PNG, possibly as a result of its fractured
deployment, but had high opinions of it based on her experience with it at her prior library. She
highlighted some other dimensions:
“There are other funding and administrative issues with the state with the program that
make it difficult to carry it out, i.e., they don’t give you the money until two years after
you’re supposed to be carrying out the program. That’s an issue for a library that doesn’t
have the money up front to do the program. There are also internal administrative issues
with it, in that, it’s written because we so desperately need the equipment for other stuff.
They think ‘Oh, by the way, we’ll make it work for PNG also.’ We internally here call it
the slush fund because it’s used to upgrade and buy equipment that we need for everyday
services… it’s frustrating when we see, you know, this really should be going specifically
towards these kids.”
Grand Ridge’s experience was different from most of the other stories I encountered. While many
faced the same issues, like staff skills and youth engagement, most locations didn’t view it as a
failure. It seemed that in previous years a lot of the funds might have gone towards general
computer services instead of youth-specific allocations (like broadband or purchasing laptops), but
a lot of the recent implementations involved hiring staff or purchasing multimedia equipment that
wasn’t purposed for general library use. There were many issues indicated here, however: lack of
a dependable participant base or partners, lack of consistent objectives or programming, lack of
staff skills and investment, varying contexts that made information and strategy sharing
troublesome, as well as administrative and implementation issues.

ROWLAND HEIGHTS
On paper Rowland Heights had a population of about 6000. The director estimated, based on the
numbers she was given from the school district, that it was actually around double that. The library
was faced with an unfortunate Catch 22: they were serving a larger population than they had
funding for, but simultaneously needed to develop effective and innovative ways to reach out to
and effectively help the immigrant populations in town. The situation was similar to what many
libraries across the US are now facing: a single large employer in a relatively rural area with recent
waves of immigrant workers, some undocumented. Many of the immigrants lived in fear of
136

deportation (INS raids happened occasionally), many of the white people who had been living in
the town for decades didn’t know what to think of them, and the library was stuck in between all
of this. The library was also positioned as an intermediary between generations, as the older
residents who were on the library board sometimes took issue with the younger patrons making
more use of digital technologies (which had access to resources in more languages) instead of
books. Given all of the various people and interests in the town, the Rowland Heights Public
Library needed to establish itself as an ambassador. They did this through addressing several of
the aforementioned dimensions: being flexible for immigrant groups, encouraging dialogue,
helping the youth to connect tech to traditional library roles like archiving and intentionally hiring
locals with specialized skills.
GENERAL STRATEGIES FOR SERVICE
Many of the strategies the library undertook as part of its role as an ambassador were not directly
related to fostering digital literacies. If they were to get patrons into the library in the first place
they needed to help the library to suit their needs and make them feel comfortable. One of the
immediate issues was of course library cards. Many immigrants did not have any form of
identification that reflected a permanent address. They would move frequently and live in
temporary housing and often did not have drivers’ licenses or stubs from utility bills, so the library
established an alternative card assignment program: they would mail a registration card to a patronprovided address and when the patron came back in with the card they would be verified and
provided a library card. Another story she told me involved a patron who asked to repair a damaged
mailbox in order to write-off their library fines. Though they weren’t an immigrant the director’s
willingness to bargain was an example of the kind of flexibility that was common. She also did
her best to casually observe what people were doing in the community, so she could better grow
her non-English language collection, in order to get patrons to actually make use of the book
collection instead of just the computers. One such example was when she realized many were
buying houses in poor condition and fixing them up. She soon ordered a few books on home repair
in Spanish and explained to me that they had been checked out non-stop ever since. Though this
helped to boost circulation a bit it wasn’t the only way she could connect immigrant groups to the
older residents. A small group of seniors regularly met for a discussion roundtable and she made
efforts to invite representatives to come talk and share information about their cultural background.
137

Though the effort was just with a few people and featured mostly safe topics it was still a symbolic
recognition of the value of exchange of ideas and coming together as a community.
DIGITIZING THE DEAD
Rowland Heights was also a recipient of a Project Next Generation grant, and consequently sought
to help underserved youth learn digital technologies to improve their chances of a bright future:
“Our hope is that they’ll go on to college instead of just seeing [local employer] as their
only option.”
It wasn’t just about teaching skills, however, it was also about making strides to connect together
different parts of the community:
“Our kids in that group out of 10 to 12 kids usually 8 to 10 are of Latino descent, a lot of
them are 1st or 2nd generation well a lot of them are 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants… The
kids are a lot better at mingling and talking to each other and doing things together than
the adults are so it’s kind of funny to see the difference between the two.”
Every Friday night they’d participate in projects, this year involved media production and
archiving:
“I take them out a couple of times a year to the local cemeteries and we take pictures of
headstones, which sounds really morbid and weird but the kids love it. I wasn’t sure at first
if it would go very well but they absolutely loved it, they thought it was the coolest thing
ever.”
They’d then upload pictures from the PNG-purchased digital cameras to findagrave.com and
provide information about the photo. They’d learn about metadata, history and get to run around
outside and release energy. The first run was setup to help the kids discover that the town used to
be dominated by German immigrants, to help them understand that the current immigrants there
were not the first, nor were the old folk the true ‘natives.’ The next assignment was even more
interesting:
“They’re each going to pick a prominent business person that we can find a headstone for
out there and then research them and find out where their business was. We can look those
138

up in the old city directories and see what’s there now and where they lived and what was
their family like and if we have a picture of them in the high school yearbooks—we’ve got
those back to 1909. At the same time that helps us digitize our archives so it kind of helps
the library but the kids think it’s really cool too.”
Not only were the kids learning to use a set of information resources, digital and physical, in a
mystery-solving context but they were secretly being turned into volunteers who would learn about
community history—learn about the history of the older people in town who didn’t know what to
think of them. At the end of the series they’d then present what they did to their parents and the
director was considering how to best show their work online.
HIRING
It was clear, though, that the director could not do everything she wished to do on her own. Many
libraries determine that they can reach out to Spanish-speaking populations simply by hiring staff
who are bilingual, but what Rowland Heights found is that they needed staff who were bilingual,
able to reach out and gain trust, provide effective instruction and have a solid baseline of technical
skills. This is a bit of a departure from the ordinary bill of talents for libraries that typically might
involve items like cataloging, reference, love of books and so on.
The PNG staff (mentors) were temporarily hired for the project, and both local. The first was
someone the director had known as a high-schooler who was enrolled in community college nearby
and the other was a teacher at one of the local schools. They were chosen largely on account of
their connections, as much as their credentials:
“For PNG I have two really good mentors that work with PNG who are fully bilingual and
who know the community really, really well... they tell the parents who their kid is going
to be with and where they’re going to be and what they’re going to do and they get consent
and they actually visit the home… in a lot of Latino cultures that’s how you do things you
don’t just send the paper home.”
Despite all of the work with cameras and staff gaining the trust of the parents they still weren’t
able to overcome the fear of posting photos. They were also only present for PNG, which is why
the director eventually hired a similar person on to her staff. Finding someone proved to be
139

difficult, as most could make comparably more money with the major local employer, or travel
elsewhere if they had more specialized technical skills. The director eventually hired a family
friend who was young but just technical enough to learn how to teach and do many of the things
the library needed with digital literacy related services. His description of the job was fairly typical:
“When people come in and they need to use the computer I help them get logged in and
sometimes they need some assistance, like navigating the web, so I help a lot with that,
show them step-by-step where to go. Recently since we’ve started e-book services we’ve
had people come in asking how to work their devices and we go through the help website
from our computer, we go through the steps. Sometimes we bring out Kindles and we give
them some help on that.”
What was less typical were the kinds of questions he fielded:
“J: Can you be more specific about the kinds of information people are searching for?
Health information or job postings or other examples?
L: Well those two right there, a lot of immigration information about citizenship and
residence, too.”
It was clear that he had gained the trust of even some of the undocumented workers in town, by
nature of his own background and investment in the community, and also because of other
structural factors, as the director begrudgingly explained:
“If they had their choice between a Spanish speaking woman and a Spanish speaking man
they would rather ask a man.”
A lot of the immigrant population’s trust relied on an image of what a person qualified to help
them might look like, which unfortunately also included a dimension of sexism.
He indicated he wanted to see others like himself have the ability to express more ownership over
the space:
“I lived in [location in Texas] and there it’s a big Chicano population, back in the
depression era there were giant murals painted to express heritage. There was a library
downtown that was all covered in murals, it was a lot of books and things that represented
140

literacy. Here in town I’d like to see something like that, a group of people could show
some pride by painting a wall with what they think represents the town.”
This vision of a mural contrasted to the one that adorned the wall in the room adjacent to us, one
that had been donated and featured a kind of generic fantasy theme familiar to many people who
had grown up in the US. It wasn’t a bad mural by any means, artistically it was impressive enough,
it just wasn’t representative of the kinds of stories or folklore many of the recent immigrants might
have appreciated more.
Somewhere near the end of the interview, as I was being told about his aspirations to teach himself
more about computer maintenance to save the library money on consulting, he made a remark that
stuck with me:
“The only reason I never got into being a librarian in my hometown is it required a degree,
you had to go to City Hall and take a test. Here in town I just apply and it’s about what I
know, not the degree.”
This is an issue I will return to in a future section, but it’s interesting to contemplate what
knowledge he meant. Was it about his network of who he knew and what he knew about a typical
library patron’s culture? Was it that he was able to teach himself how to fix computers or that he
was a good one-on-one tutor for information searching online? Or was it just that he knew Spanish?
How many of these things can be taught or represented with a degree?

OTRANTO
As libraries face more and more challenges framed in economic terms they have been turning to
alternative service models to cut costs. Two common strategies are (1) to outsource infrastructure
services, such as IT support, and (2) to consolidate library branch systems by merging locations
and shifting collections online. Otranto Public Library resisted both of these trends because they
felt the benefits of localized support outweighed the cost-savings of substitutes. This is remarkable
because, at first glance, it seems like these decisions are in opposition to a vision of a new,
streamlined and technology-powered library of the future but upon closer inspection they instead
illustrate a different interpretation of it.

141

THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS A SYMBOL
As useful as it may be to identify underserved populations within a given location with the use of
census tracts and statistical or GIS analysis tools, they don’t really reveal the meaning of what it’s
like to live in these places. The librarian representative at Otranto explained it to me in a way that
someone who has lived there would:
“At Otranto there’s this divide, it’s more than just the digital divide or the economic
divide… there’s this river and there’s the west side and the east side, and you will see if
you drive over there, you can see a lot of new homes, new businesses, new construction
and it does look as though the resources are all targeted to the east of the river. The west
of the river, the founders started there, the college used to be here, the YWCA, all of that
has moved east. The boys and girls club even moved out, instead of using these beautiful
buildings and land over here, all of the resources, to create more updated facilities they just
shut down and move east.”
In some towns it’s the railroad tracks, in others it’s a big road and in a few it might be a municipal
boundary, but the theme is the same: the low-income people of color live on this side, and the
privileged white folk live on the other side. While the sundown towns of former eras have been
formally eliminated, the echoes of these demographic arrangements often still remain. Otranto
historically relied on a branch library system to provide services in specific locations around town,
to help deal with these disparities.
At the time of the interviews they had been taking heat for considering a plan to weed out a large
portion of the collection and offer more services online as well as potentially close some locations.
For some public libraries this kind of plan appears as the optimized path to the future. In the
Chicago suburbs of DuPage County, for instance, some municipalities are dominated by patrons
who, on average, not only own their own computer, but also a tablet or e-reader and smart phone
as well. These patrons rely on owning a car to commute to work or get around town and typically
have powerful broadband at home. In these settings a consolidated single library location with
substantial services online might make a great deal of sense; they could drive a ways to get to the
library and would appreciate all-hours online access of information and “on-the-go” self-checkout
systems based on RFID. Many of them might be wealthy enough to prefer buying all their books
142

and media, rather than invest taxes in collection resources for everyone. In Otranto, however, it
appeared that neither population, east or west of the river, was ready for this sort of future just yet.
The librarians I spoke to were almost scared to talk to me about it because they didn’t know what
was going to happen due to the blow-out that had resulted in swamped town hall meetings and
published articles. It seemed none of them were directly responsible for the plan, and though they
saw merits in it, they were saddened because the public took what was a draft to be a given reality
and revolted. The situation escalated as the Union got involved and misinformation was a danger.
As a result of the scuffle the library was under a lot of scrutiny and, as usual, they were facing
everyone’s favorite insufficient evaluation metric, circulation:
“[Otranto] is smaller, and politically you have board members who look at numbers, how
many people come to the library, they’re looking at the statistics, and they point out that
the circulation is not high… what they don’t see is the community. When people come here
it’s a community experience.”
And this is what the librarians at the Magnolia Branch expressed to me was most-often overlooked.
Their location was generally under-resourced and had faced potential closure in years past. Their
circulation counts were poor, but their door counts, and more importantly level of engagement in
the space were worth noting:
“You have a group of people who come and read the paper and sit around the tables and
talk about the news and that’s the daily thing to do. When the children come in they all
know each other, they all gather around the computers, they work with each other. It’s a
neighborhood, it [the library] lives inside of a neighborhood, and those are numbers that
can’t be captured, the content of the interactions that happen here are different than what
might happen out in the east branch, which is in a retail area, by Target and box stores, it’s
not a neighborhood feel.”
The librarians took ownership of their space, which is why the recent drama was particularly scary
for them. I got the impression that without this branch the west side of town wouldn’t have had
any representation or influence in the library system. It felt to me much more like relationships
than ‘customer service.’:
143

“It’s a difficult thing, because I’m African American, so I’m invested, it’s my community,
it’s my area, if it hadn’t been for a library like this—you think about how do we become
librarians? We had to have a great experience – we had to go to a library where we saw
people like us and welcomed us and we had to have that experience of finding out this is
what we want to do.”
The staff also indicated they didn’t have enough powerful advocates, either:
“You don’t have board members or directors or people who can make change happen
[here], they’re not necessarily invested in the community here, there’s a disconnect… it’s
not personal for the board. The city appoints them, and all that.”
So given this dynamic the library had to go to bat for itself:
“We also need the people-people and those who know how to go outside of the library to
bring people in to the library. Not only that, if we’re going to bridge any gaps we’re going
to be out there. We can’t just be behind our desks, so that’s kind of what I do. I try to make
sure I’m out in the public, doing a lot of outreach, sitting on boards, talking to people,
begging for resources…”
This was followed by nervous laughter, as the program coordinator didn’t literally beg for
resources, but indicated it sometimes felt like she had to go to great lengths to build numbers in
order to rally support for the library, and it wasn’t always very easy to figure out just how to do
that:
“If you’re not dedicated to pushing the numbers your library branch will suffer, because
that’s how their resources are based, but what can we do? What class do you go to know
how to raise the numbers? It doesn’t exist. You might have to go to the minister’s
fellowship and the community centers and pack bags of books and check them out there,
make displays, do programs outside of the walls, but you might not know how to do that
unless someone comes in to teach you.”

144

What this truly was about, the program coordinator alluded to, was cultivating the library as a
symbol in the community. This status was what was really important to them and how they chose
to evaluate their success:
“Even though maybe the community doesn’t necessarily come in and check out a lot of
books if they feel the library is going to be closed or if it’s threatened they will speak up
and they will fight for it, because they really love and value it. And they value it for other
reasons than just the fact that they want to check out books or use computers, that’s the
part that the rest of the community doesn’t get.”
Just as a public park might give a people a sense of pride or a kind of local identity, the library
provided this as well as a place for people to gather, exchange information, and, most importantly,
feel like they belonged. This atmosphere was crucial to enabling people to come into the library in
the first place and likely contributed to successful and frequent use of the computers, which, like
most libraries, were in use much of the time. It also provided the foundation for the kind of
technology-driven future the librarians at this location had in mind.
LOCAL IT
Most of my interviews were conducted with directors or youth and adult services staff, but at
Otranto I was able to talk to a dedicated IT staff person. Many libraries didn’t have someone like
this, even those the size of Otranto. I was able to ask all kinds of questions specific to IT policy
decisions, but most of them had the kinds of answers you might expect:
“In terms of computers I’ve got a budget, for all locations, and what I do is I always try to
make sure the equipment is up to date. I go through this RFP and I fill all that information
out and tell them I want a certain processor and so on.”
Other than helping the library to make more efficient and customized IT provisions the tasks
seemed pretty similar to other institutions. At the time of my visit they were discussing how to
best integrate charging stations for cell phones of various sorts, as many patrons who visited the
Magnolia branch didn’t bring their own laptop but did bring along a smart phone. I thought this
was relatively insightful back in 2012, as the demand has only grown since then.

145

Perhaps more interesting, however, was that the IT services librarian was also responsible for a
great deal of the training. They didn’t teach patrons technologies, but instead ‘taught the teachers’
in advance and let them develop more patron-specific programming:
“Every time we get a new technology that’s going to be implemented in the library then
we go ahead and do the training. That way the staff are more comfortable using the
technology. We don’t want to just let them go on their own to work with it, so we do have
some structured classes.”
A recent example that was on-going were e-readers, which Otranto was beginning to loan to the
public, which meant many staff needed to know how to support them. The librarian also explained
to me that it was better to conduct training in-house so that they could edit and remix existing
training materials (with permission) to actually match their specific needs and circumstances.
When I remarked that I was surprised that their IT was not outsourced I was given a somewhat
surprising reply:
“I’m glad we’re not, it’s a benefit to have us here because when you outsource something,
especially with IT, you have that concern with security. I think it’s safer to have your own
IT staff, and there’s a type of dedication though that you run in to.”
I was expecting and unsurprised by the dedication. Clearly people from a community are more
likely to be committed to it and better understand its needs (like user populations who use cell
phones instead of laptops) but I thought it was unusual that they also felt it was more secure to
have internal IT. For Otranto it seemed to indicate a certain degree of trust, as it’s more comfortable
to have people you know being given access to sensitive issues like patron data. I also suspect it
facilitated better training, as they could ask questions as colleagues, rather than as students for an
external consulting expert.
ANOTHER LIBRARY OF THE FUTURE
So if Otranto wasn’t destined to become the outsourced digital library media hub version of the
future, what was to come of it? The program coordinator had some ideas with a different spin:
“I’d like to see a mini YOUmedia center, or some kind of setup that uses advanced and
emerging technologies, just a mini center, so that people here could do job searches and
146

creative things with their own talents, the musicians, the poets, the authors, because you
have people who do everything from repairing cars and houses to you know, who come
here, they all use the computer… if we had laptops or tablets available for people,
something for people to use other than just the computer, other technologies to upload
videos and do Photoshop and more databases and a variety of things, built into regular
computer classes here.”
She also added that these kinds of changes would offset some of the issues related to computer
time-limits, as it would provide more entertainment and dedicated machines for long-term tasks.
Similarly (but separately without prompt) the librarian tasked with IT weighed in on the idea:
“More like meeting rooms, social gathering areas, as a community center. The physical
building will get smaller. Also programming will change. It will be more important to have
different programming available, as opposed to just strictly computer classes. We’ll offer
activities like digital photography. We’re in the process of trying to get [auditorium space
in town], it’s more of an artsy thing, right across the street from the main location. It’s
actually getting donated to us, we’re going to have an event to see what the public’s
opinions are on what we should do with it.”
Both of these visions share some aspects in common. They suggest that the library would like to
expand its role as a place of community gathering and increasingly organized education, as well
as involve itself more actively in the production of culture and media as well as application-specific
computing. I will return to these topics more in the discussion, but it’s important to note that they
were recognized as strategies that were compatible with the branch system and also that they differ
strongly from the stereotype of the “drive-thru online library” model.

AND THEN MY RESEARCH MODEL BROKE
For the majority of the sites I visited data collection worked out as planned. A letter was sent in
the mail in advance, e-mails and phone calls followed, interviews were scheduled, and site visits
were arranged. Sometimes a given site did not respond immediately, usually under the impression
that they would not qualify as a result of a lack of cutting-edge technology programs, but in most
of these cases once I made it clear my interests were in the full scope of activities and perspectives
they were willing to receive me.
147

Still, there were a few locations I could not visit. Rather than drop or dismiss these places as
“outliers” I thought it more appropriate to consider them as an opportunity to discuss some of the
gaps and drawbacks in my research and analysis. It would be too easy to let them be yet again
skipped over and not turn a critical eye on myself as a biased investigator. It’s easy to talk about
successes. It’s not easy to talk about challenges, but it’s still possible. What this section focuses
on is neither: these are occasions when my framework or approach didn’t work, along with some
valuable findings related to this.
HAZARDOUS ASSUMPTIONS
The first of the missed sites came up quickly, when I was declined by Glassbrook Public Library.
My standard preliminary research on Glassbrook found a library located on the edge of a river in
a town with a continually conflicted history. According to census data it fit most qualifications of
what I had considered to be ‘underserved’ demographics: an ethnic minority community in a rural
setting with high rates of poverty and unemployment and also troubled by crime and a declining
population. A few months prior they had been assisted by the US Army Corps of Engineers, when
the decision was made to destroy a set of levies to alleviate flooding, at the cost of destroying
several nearby farms on the other side of the river. News coverage of the event suggests that the
occurrence revealed tensions related to racism in the region. I later discovered a recent
documentary about the town, read through a number of articles, and found additional evidence of
severe poverty, racism, and, most pertinent to me, a distrust of outsiders. The community had been
mistreated as a sort of spectacle by many writers, chronicled as a kind of abandoned town and
preserved piece of history. A telling example was the Tired Pony, a Portland-style coffee shop,
bookstore and co-op, pushed by Redditors, 68 that had tried to establish itself in the town to help
the locals but eventually failed due to a lack of support, theft and other economic challenges. What
the people of Glassbrook wanted and needed, it seems, was not an indie coffee shop, but at the
same time the majority of the material written about them online was from outsiders, not locals,
so it was hard to tell.
To me, this didn’t seem like a fair evaluation. Who was I to walk in to the town with assumptions
about the importance of the internet, digital tools, the needs of patrons and questions about the

68

148

roles of the library? It’s difficult to determine when inquiry about an institution as a collection of
people, policies, activities and infrastructure becomes an unwarranted judgment from a privileged
outsider culture. The ALA provides guidelines for global service objectives but the trouble with
such sweeping standards is they may not adequately or appropriately address the conditions in
every given local context. Let me be clear: I can’t surmise anything about Glassbrook Public
Library’s reasons for declining participation in the study or make any significant statements about
its services, but this does function as an important reminder of my position as a researcher as an
outsider who may come from a dramatically different culture or background, a status that will
impact me even before I set foot in a given library. It is also a demonstration of the sheer range of
conditions in which public libraries operate. Any discussion about the service roles of the public
library likely includes assumptions about what libraries should do and what libraries are capable
of doing, but not all libraries may match these assumptions and we can likely learn a great deal
from those who don’t.
DIFFERING CONDITIONS
I ran into similar circumstances during my work with public libraries in the Hopkinton county
area. At one library, the director was changing over at the time of my contact. They were so hard
to get in touch with over the phone and e-mail (presumably busy and understaffed) that I eventually
had to give up trying to track down a good time for an interview, though I was approved for a visit.
I did stop at the site over a year later just to make my regular observations: number of computers,
layout, software, literature on computer classes and so on, which still contributed to the comparison
in the next section. Upon walking in, before I could say anything, I was told that the event I was
looking for was just down the hall. From what I could tell I was the only white person in the front
of the library at the time; peering down the hallway to the meeting room, I saw a notice about some
kind of political organizing meeting. Obviously I wasn’t a regular at the library, but I also believe
I was at least partially identified as an outsider because of the color of my skin and because of the
way I was dressed. I don’t feel this was any sort of negative prejudice, probably just an assumption
of why a person like me might be in this library, but I found this was often the experience when I
visited libraries in underserved communities—I was pretty obviously identified as an outsider right
as I walked in. This underscores my prior point more poignantly: my ability to get robust or reliable

149

data from interviews and observations was in part influenced by my ascribed identities and cultural
fluencies.
While waiting for a computer guest pass at the same library I found myself in line behind an elderly
lady who was asking the staff person at the desk for help to scan an advertisement for a choir. The
staff person explained that they didn’t know how to help, and when I later asked them how many
of the library staff were qualified to help patrons with computers they told me just one, and gave
the name of the director. When I probed about activities I was told the director was responsible for
all of the technology-related programming in the library. Meanwhile, I felt bad for the patron who
wanted to scan the flyer, so I attempted to help them, but we found the power supply for it was
missing and the computer it was next to didn’t boot. This story has at least two points of
significance. First, it appears like it could be another example of a library where only one person
has the skills to help with even just computer basics. This isn’t all that unusual, except this library
served a much larger population and employed a much larger staff than most of those that are so
limited by human-capital. Second, my ability to observe and inquire was often altered by my
interest in actively helping to solve problems, even when I wasn’t asked to. This reflects a sense
of privilege and agency, but also a potential blindness: I may be sometimes too interested in
unpacking the problem to solve it, rather than see how they make sense of and otherwise deal (or
not deal) with it. Had I asked the staff person who helps patrons before I went about trying to solve
all of the issues I might have yielded a very different response. Similarly, if I had been more clearly
from their community or shared other identities in common they might have presented other
information.
Another library in the area made clear other kinds of issues that might make research difficult.
While driving around looking for its location I became lost as a result of outdated Google Maps
records. My car was rushed by a man who tried to open the door at an intersection and while
driving in an adjacent neighborhood in what appeared to me to be a low-income housing project I
was told “Go home white boy, you’re in the wrong part of town.” When I did finally get to the
library, which I had never been able to reach through phone calls or e-mail, I found the door was
guarded by an angry looking stray dog. I couldn’t find any hours on the door and it looked like it
was closed, and had been so for some time.

150

I don’t write about these experiences to solicit pity or to provide fuel for negative judgments. I
include them because many researchers would dismiss them as ‘outliers’ or scrap them on the basis
of not being rich enough in data. These experiences help illustrate some of the sheer variance in
conditions and opportunities present in Illinois for those seeking to gain access to library and
computing resources. The state ranges from some of the richest communities in the nation, found
in places like DuPage County, to the places like the urban prairie of Hopkinton County. Part of the
reason locations like the Hopkinton area remain underserved is that they are not always fully
included in research studies, like this one, that may inform policy makers and program developers.
The last location in the area that I visited wasn’t an official library. Instead, it was a volunteer
operation that had risen up in place of a library that had closed its doors a few years ago due to
financial issues. It was housed in a converted church, adjacent to a youth outreach program tied to
a larger non-profit, and was run by volunteers. A couple of years prior I had visited the operation
to help update and install computers and to assist volunteers in organizing and cataloging their
book collection. I couldn’t formally interview the library staff because there were none, officially,
but I did talk to some of the people there and go through my usual process of computer observation,
note-taking, photos, literature collection and map-making, with permission. Despite little funding
or formal organization, this library had at least still managed to remain open and had even taken
steps to better integrate the youth organization and the library service area over the years. The
sign-in sheet was perhaps most-telling, however. Patrons were required to sign-in and indicate
what they were doing during their visit, and a look down the sheet for the day revealed about a
dozen names, all with the description of either ‘volunteer’ or ‘computers’ written next to their
name. This isn’t to say that the book collection was going unused, as this was simply a one-time
visit, but it does suggest that the computers were a pretty important part of the library’s service. A
look-over of one of the workstations exposed they hadn’t had their software updated very much
since my earlier involvement, and had numerous personal document and image files saved to them,
but they clearly were still working and being used. My impression was that at least in the case of
this volunteer library, even in its barest form with minimal support, the library provided three
identifiable services: a place to hang out, books and magazines to read, and public internet access
and computing.

151

INFRASTRUCTURE ALONE…
There was one other location outside of Hopkinton County that I would have liked to include
stories from but was unable to. It was dropped due to incomplete data in the form of corrupted
interview recording files, but is worth mentioning because the site still held a valuable lesson. This
library was one of the few with ample space and also had a larger staff size and funding base. They
faced significant challenges in terms of serving a sporadic and often low-income population, but
the way they handled it seemed to account for some portion of their struggles.
A restructuring in years prior had resulted in the closure of one or more branch locations, and the
echoes of this decision were still evident. The tone of the interview with the director (the only data
that wasn’t corrupted) was unusual, as the central issue with this library is that it seemed to situate
itself as in direct competition with other social institutions in the area. It went beyond just the fear
of competition with other organizations, but actually included direct acknowledgment of and
participation in rivalry itself. As a result, the school system and even nearby bookstores chose to
independently run their own reading programs and local political disputes disrupted literacy
initiatives involving the library. An informal “local” library had cropped up on the edge of town
and other people were willing to drive to alternative library locations out of protest. Evidence from
the interviews strongly suggested the library was struggling with community relations.
The director identified the purpose of library programs as primarily a way to drive circulation
counts, their main chosen measure of success, which generally overall resulted in less
programming. They explained their library had been positioned differently in previous years, as
another director before her had put it, as a “cultural center,” which they had intentionally moved
away from. When I asked about the conception of the library as a production space or place of
education, I was told that it was to be a “school of the people” but not a social services center, and
that they were not in the business of actively teaching but instead providing a kind of self-service
location. There were small sets of isolated computer carrels scattered about, but no dedicated
instruction space, save for a small appointment-based career center, which was matched by
minimal digital literacy related programming. They had a teen space filled with magazines, but
noted that it generally went unused, as it also wasn’t a significant place for programming. The
director felt that “kids these days” just were not able to sit down and read like they used to. She
further explained that people who did not attend their location often did so because they were
152

looking for a smaller, “local” feeling atmosphere where they could feel at home and connect to
people they knew. The director then went on to speculate about the poor qualifications of the
people volunteering at other informal library locations, suggesting that their backgrounds were
questionable and that they might cause people to receive a bad impression of librarianship.
It might be possible to condemn this library as a “straw man” of sorts, but we should think about
it in the same way other challenged locations have been considered: in terms of its context. The
difference is that in this case the library itself was not subject to severely limited infrastructure or
human resources, but instead the philosophy and policies embedded in it as an institution made it
less compatible with my set of questions and assumptions about digital literacy. Their emphasis
was fundamentally on the storage and circulation of traditional library materials.
WHAT THIS ALL MEANS
This gathering of missed data-collection locations is itself a source of information. In order to
foster digital literacies libraries must have regular open hours, operational equipment, staff with
time, skills and resources to enable activities to happen, and, most of all, an acceptance of the
importance of emerging norms of technological, educational and civic participation. It is not a
coincidence that some of the most low-income communities with the largest proportions of African
American populations were those with libraries not well represented in my study. Their views and
understandings of digital literacy, their strategies and programs related to digital tools and their
efforts towards community engagement are not accounted for as dedicated sections in the site
findings, and as a result this research suffers. I cannot claim to tell a comprehensive story of these
underserved communities, by any means.
My identities and perspectives as a researcher are notable in part because they limit my chosen
method of research. I’m a resident of Illinois, but not of most of these individual communities, and
I most certainly have biases and privileges. For many research sites I could visit and assume a
regularized level of professionalization amongst LIS-educated individuals, but not all sites had
people with MLIS degrees, and many of them had earned their degrees three or even four decades
ago and had not kept in touch with the academic culture or network. In the case of Aquarin, this
de-sync was good, as it allowed them to break institutional and service boundaries, but in the case
of most of the libraries that were “incompatible” with the assumptions beneath my method, it
153

seemed to be more of a problem. This affected my ability to walk in and “talk the talk” in a
significant way, about as much as being white, male, relatively affluent or young might have.
Ultimately, I think this all demonstrates the importance of context and culture in determining
library service roles. Many of the patrons in these communities did not choose to—or were unable
to—spend limited financial resources on internet service at home, though some may have had it
through cell phone service. A few years prior I went door-to-door collecting survey responses for
a broadband grant proposal targeting a nearby region and about half of the respondents I spoke to
indicated they simply didn’t use the internet on a regular basis, either by lack of need, interest or
access. It seems absurd to talk about ideas of helping patrons like this build their own personal
website, program an Arduino, 69 or use internet databases or e-books in place of visiting a library
in search of physical materials. This is not to say they couldn’t or wouldn’t be able to ever do these
things, it’s instead to stress that all of my exciting talk about digital literacies is housed within
certain assumptions of culture that may preclude those in less-privileged areas. The gap is
illustrated through my personal identity as a researcher and LIS professional, in terms of socioanalytic categories such as race, class, age and other possible identifiers, and also through policies,
expectations and structural conditions that determine life for those facing structural oppression in
this part of our state. It serves as a reminder that the role of the public library, in fostering digital
literacies or doing anything else, needs to be determined by the context of the community. On the
one hand we can look at a library’s ability and willingness to conduct community engagement, but
on the other we can look at a community’s capacity or opportunity to have a functional library and
digitally-minded staff in the first place.

FINDINGS - LIBRARY COMPARISONS
The trends and issues found in the individual site stories were often recurrent and they were also
not the only variables I examined during my visits. As stated in the research design I spent time
drawing maps of spaces, counting and testing computers, and poring over printed and electronic
materials. Considered together, combinations of these attributes represent a general impression (or
metric, even) of the state of these libraries. The measures in this section are not intended to be
exhaustive, rigorous or comparable to all types of state or national data, and that’s the point, really.
The subjectivity and variance revealed in their collection as well as the dimensions they represent
that are otherwise absent in other larger official studies not only reveal drawbacks, they implicitly
form a critique. Number of computers or time spent on a computer will never determine the quality
of an information experience, just as circulation counts will never render the value of an individual
book for a given patron. Nevertheless overviews provide an interesting lens when discussing
recurrent themes found in interviews and site observations.

OVERVIEW
The following data comparisons are from the summer and fall of 2012 and as a result may not be
current representations of each library. Clearly libraries vary considerably in physical size, and
some locations employed branch systems, whereas others were centrally located in a single main
library. See the table on the next page.

Library

Table 3 - General library attributes related to service population and funding, in no particular order. Populations have
been rounded to the nearest thousand and incomes to the nearest hundred thousand, in order to supply an additional
degree of anonymity.

System Legal Service Area Population – As of 2012, based off of the official state data at
https://harvester.census.gov/imls/search/index.asp, provided to give an indication of the kind of
scale of community the library serves. This differs from a library’s actual capacities, such as
building size or number of branches, but does help establish a sense of “how big they are” as it
relates to how many people they serve.
156

2010 Census Block Service Population Estimate – The population of census blocks in the area
surrounding the library that included people likely to seek service there. In many cases this
included blocks that were not part of the ‘official’ service area but that did not have another library
nearby. All blocks were mutually exclusive and selected based on what librarians indicated was
their primary patronage. This measure was especially important for branch libraries, where they
were not intended to serve the entire community—the block estimate gives a better understanding
of the size of the community they more specifically serve as compared to the whole system.
Total System Operating Income and Total System Operating Expenditures– Provided to give
a sense of the financial assets at a given library’s disposal, used, unused and with possible external
subsidies or savings revealed. Per-capita estimates are not given, as they rely on official (not
actual)

service

populations.

These

data

at

https://harvester.census.gov/imls/search/index.asp. Note the wide range in available income and
expenditures, which is not always in direct proportion to population served.
Official service populations are often different than actual. This was revealed in several stories,
such as invisible undocumented worker populations or people from rural areas with no library
nearby who would drive in. Readers will notice the aggregated populations for the census blocks
immediately surrounding the library differ considerably from the endorsed service population in
several cases, most of the time illustrating how the library is likely under-resourced relative to its
need. The estimates here are conservative, as they only count census blocks bordering the library
area; towns without libraries just down the road would only increase this number further. The fact
that I could even do this is one reason this study has a relatively unique sub-state level of analysis.
In dense urban areas (like Chicago and the surrounding suburbs) library service zones all bump up
against one another and so it’s not entirely clear who might use which library. In small urban
localities and towns it’s pretty easy to look at a map of the metropolitan area, note the single library
that serves the entire location, add up the total population there, and determine if the official service
population is dramatically different. In those cases it’s pretty likely that there’s a portion that is
not being recognized for service.
It was unclear what the difference between library income and expenditures always represented.
Many had additional sources of funding or mandates, through grants or other municipal
157

arrangements that complicated these values. It’s particularly striking to note the differences
between libraries of similar size populations, however. For instance, both Aquarin and Stony Point
serve about 29,000 people but the former has about 10 times the expenditure budget of the latter.
This is one indication of the sheer wealth disparities in Illinois because both of these libraries had
fewer assets than most of those located in the suburbs of Chicago.

INFRASTRUCTURE
A reminder of the original conception of the digital divide, a library’s ability to foster digital
literacies among patrons is determined to some extent by the resources and equipment they have
available. While I was able to compare some attributes to those collected publicly by the Public
Library Funding and Technology Access Survey (Bertot et al. 2012) I specifically sought out some
unique measures. See the table on the following page.

Table 4 - Digital literacy related assets by library, as observed during the time of visit.
* Possible to easily isolate a small group of computers.
** Status in fall of 2013
*** Based on Bertot et al. (2012)

Dedicated Computer Instruction Lab – If an isolated room was available for teaching dedicated
computer classes. Some libraries were able to isolate small groups of computers for classes by
using laptops or offering classes during times or in spaces that were not ordinarily open to the
public.
159

Dedicated Teen Space – If the library had a separate and dedicated teen space of notable size
where youth could hang out and carry on activities besides reading (not just a teen “collection”
space) that involved digital technologies like consoles or computers. Some libraries converted
public meeting rooms and auditoriums to fill this role on a regular basis.
# of Public Use Computers – The number of desktop computers, internet-capable or not, available
for both adults and children. This should be considered an estimate; at any given site some
computers might not have been functioning or it is possible I might have missed some when
making my floor plan maps. Does not include laptops or card catalog access machines.
Classroom Set of Laptops or Tablets – If the library had a set of 8 or more laptops or powerful
tablets of a non-e-reader type, like ipads available for patron use. Patrons could be children, adults
or both. Libraries with sets of laptops demonstrated considerably more flexibility with digital
literacy related programs in and outside of the library.
E-readers & e-books – Simply a measure of if the library offered e-readers for patrons to borrow,
either within the library or to take home, and if they subscribed to some kind of e-book provision
service, like OverDrive or other consortiums. If a library offered readers it typically had to support
them by teaching patrons and staff how to use them.
Examining the commonalities and differences in some of the infrastructure present in the observed
libraries reveals some points of interest. Branches attached to larger systems had a disproportionate
amount of resources, in their favor. Plainview, for instance, wouldn’t have even existed without
help from a neighboring town. Paddock’s Branch had a spacious, brand-new computer lab and
instructors who came in, both of which were setup and maintained by people at the main location.
Otranto could draw on the e-reader resources and IT support of the whole network. In other words,
library systems with branches enable a more equitable spread of services and assets throughout a
community, especially those with large populations or service areas.
Public computer terminals and broadband internet access appear to be near-ubiquitous in Illinois.
It was essential in even the most under-resourced and rural libraries I visited, though there were
significant variations in internet infrastructure. For this set of libraries the number of public use
computers did not appear to scale proportionately with population. One of the premises in the
160

sample selection was that state-wide averages would make it difficult to make comparisons
possible for individual libraries. In Illinois less than half of libraries reside in densely populated
urban locations, whereas the others are serving small towns and rural areas. If the Illinois average
for public internet workstations is 18, how does a small library know it has enough computers?
Similarly, how might a larger library know it has too few? Clearly one sound answer to this query
is to measure open computer time and frequency of use, but the data here allows us another way
to evaluate what might be “typical” or “expected” for a library. The form in which the computers
are arranged is also not represented by the total number: different layouts promote different kinds
of services and experiences.
Libraries with dedicated computer labs, laptops or spaces that could be isolated were better able
to offer formal computer classes, typically for adults. Many libraries built these spaces in response
to program and service needs, but to some extent it worked the other way around: dedicated and
flexible computing spaces opened up opportunities for new kinds of activities like tech-driven teen
spaces. Whether or not a library has a computer instruction lab supplies a crucial layer of detail
when addressing the question of how many public internet access workstations a library offers—
it directly relates to how they can be used. Some libraries have a lot of computers, which might
cause people to assume they also have a lab, but this is not always the case.
While some libraries had dedicated teen spaces, they often appeared to just be for a space to make
available books and magazines of possible interest to teens, not spaces designed to help teens feel
comfortable and engage with information or learning activities. As a researcher I found it
particularly odd—when have the majority of teens ever, technology or not, been excited to come
read quietly in isolation in a library? The temporary teen spaces assembled in meeting rooms and
auditoriums seemed to automatically benefit from the unassuming format because they weren’t
built around text materials as the focal point, they were built around desired social and learning
activities and interactions. Many libraries recognized Chicago Public Library’s YouMedia as an
exemplary teen space, both because it’s teen-driven and because of its seamless integration of
technologies, but many libraries didn’t know how to achieve anything comparable. The reasons
included the typical reasons like lack of funding, space and equipment, but also other less
distinguished factors, like a lack of staff with teen-friendly personalities, digital literacies, diverse
demographics or existing networks with teens.

When I asked about technologies and programs related to digital literacy nearly every library
explained they were offering e-readers. This frequently resulted in teaching patrons how to use the
devices or make informed decisions about which ones to buy, but also meant that they weren’t
really teaching active information production, instead just another form of consumption. Since
many libraries weren’t able to offer many e-books, due to a lack of strong bargaining positions
with publishers, they were effectively encouraging patrons to buy books online instead of get
physical ones at the library, a service that ultimately was hazardous to the social norms of their
own institution.
Libraries in my sample set were also often afraid to loan out e-readers (or multimedia equipment
of other kinds) to patrons, as they expected the devices were costly and could be stolen or damaged.
I did not speak to any libraries that had tried this and found it to be cost-prohibitive; they were all
too new to the service.

Broadband Test – A simple demonstration of broadband download speed at the time of visit,
using www.Speedtest.net. This rating was not rigorously tested but instead values are provided to
163

demonstrate the sheer variation from quoted speeds during a typical operation time. The
particularly low values (Grand Ridge, Wrightsville) were probably situations in which the entire
internet pipeline was being utilized by some kind of intensive bandwidth-demanding application,
like Netflix or a virus. I did ask libraries if their wireless shared the same line as their desktop
internet but they didn’t always know. Blank values were circumstances when I was unable to
actually test this on a computer.
Wireless Test – Another simple demonstration of broadband download speed gathered at the time
of visit, using the iOS application version of Speedtest.net on my iPhone 4S. Only one measure
was taken and always with the main public wifi network (there was never a case when there was
more than one available). Higher numbers could indicate sites with either more powerful wireless
or less use of wireless devices, and may also be related to proximity to the router. Plainview timed
out because the network was being hijacked by someone outside of the library, likely. The director
was trying to figure out how to stop this at the time.
Office Version – Some libraries chose to invest time or resources into more recent office versions,
while others saved costs by use of open source. Many libraries expressed an interest in keeping up
with the latest Microsoft Office production software, so when they ran classes they could better
prepare learners for getting jobs.
Operating System (OS) – The operating system available on computers. At the time of data
collection Windows XP was still being supported by Microsoft, but was considered obsolete
nonetheless, as it was over a decade old. Only Norburry deployed Apple computers or Linux.
Alternative Browsers – The installation of alternative web browsers (as opposed to Internet
Explorer, the Windows default) may be a reflection of more knowledgeable or conscientious
systems managers. Chrome is lighter weight and better for older computers and Firefox is open
source and facilitates a well-established range of plugins. Technical individuals often see choice
of web browser as a cultural indicator of expertise. Older versions of Internet Explorer were
common on many of the Windows XP machines and were a possible security vulnerability.
No library had the most-cutting edge equipment across the board. Even those with Office 2010
and Windows 7 were not the latest generation of hardware. Many libraries were running XP to
164

maintain compatibility with their imaging, security and other software solutions, but this aging OS
was increasingly vulnerable, representing a certain irony in this relationship. Several libraries even
fielded equipment that dated as far back as 2005 or 2006. I was able to run a variety of operations
at many libraries that could have been used to exploit machines or steal patron data, such as
executing applications (a keylogger, 70 for instance). Many shortcuts were not blocked if you knew
the run commands. In some cases computers may not have been actively managed at all. I was
able to find personal files dating back several months or saved passwords on popular websites. In
other cases the opposite was the case, computers were overly restrictive, causing problems like
users being logged out when they clicked the start button, to find that they didn’t have the password
to log back in and that they had lost all of their remaining session time.
Broadband was often very strained and could easily be hampered by HD video streaming if rate
limiting systems were not in place. It never measured in at full-speed at any location I visited.
Similarly I counted both fewer and more available and functional public-use workstations than
were reported in databases online. This means reported numbers were likely often estimates or
simply inaccurate reflections of reality. This is important to note when trying to determine the
value of a library’s IT assets in a comparative manner. The average broadband speed at public
libraries may not mean very much if the average available broadband while under duress is
considerably volatile. Likewise it’s great if a library has the potential for 20 fully-operational
internet computers, but if 5 of them are consistently bogged down by viruses or spyware the
measure becomes more questionable.

PEOPLE
Whether or not people were available to help patrons with learning computers or other digital
devices helped to determine if a given library was able to foster digital literacies.

Table 6 - Number of people who support learning digital technologies.
* Status in 2013-2014

Dedicated Computer Help Staff – Librarians or regular staff who had substantial time (half [0.5]
or full [1]) for patron technology assistance, programming and classes directly woven into their
job descriptions. This included staff who would teach classes or commit to previously-arranged
computer help time with individuals. It did not include staff who were part of the larger library
system but that did not spend the majority of their time at the branch I visited, or who just trained
staff.
166

Technology Volunteers – People who did not work for the library but who provided services for
free of their own accord, or as a community service or class requirement. This included volunteers
who would help patrons to learn technologies as well as library staff themselves, and sometimes
included youth and college students.
Nearly all libraries had reference staff who would provide point-of-access assistance but few were
able to afford or find qualified librarians who could teach or run digital literacy programs as their
dedicated role. This role was in demand at nearly every location but was typically not high-enough
priority for libraries to replace other staff, retrain them or dramatically rearrange funds. I did not
specifically count staff who trained only other staff, as this was too murky of a measure—many
staff would share knowledge and take part in this process somehow, no library had any one person
in charge of teaching everyone else. If there was an IT department usually these people would take
on much of this responsibility, while in other cases outside help would be hired.
Good volunteer (or even paid) help was hard for libraries to find. Many had volunteers to help
with shelving or events like book sales but few had those with the skills and appropriate time to
help with digital literacy programs. Other libraries had issues with volunteers being unreliable or
lacking in teaching skills. Volunteers also varied considerably by location, as described in the
findings sections, the only consistency was individuals attached to universities or colleges with
service-related missions.
Many libraries found people (and other resources) to help with digital literacy services through
partnerships with community organizations. This frequently occurred in the form of youth provider
organizations connecting youth to Project Next Generation programs, but also took place in
instances like Aquarin’s partnership with the local Public TV station. This finding also matches a
general rise in partnerships across the state (Bertot et al. 2012).
Volunteers were often hired in to the library, unsurprisingly. Sometimes they would start out as a
teen helping people with computers or as a student working there as part of a class. The volunteer
work was a way for them to establish connections and demonstrate their value.

167

ACTIVITIES AND POLICIES
Many activities and programs happen in public libraries that reflect the development of digital
literacies. These were sometimes formal events and other times informal—but regular—
occurrences. They most often occurred in the form of individual computing, workshops or classes
but were sometimes reported as clubs or as facets of other activities.
There’s certainly no way to directly and universally measure a digital literacy ‘policy’ in a library
but I did make an effort to look at some of the factors, internally and externally driven, that do
impact the creation of library policies that influence how a library might foster digital literacies.
This included factors like grant-imposed agendas, the way(s) the library approached helping
patrons and the extent to which they were invested in facilitating digital content creation. See the
following page.

Table 7 - Grants and programming specifically related to addressing the digital divide/literacies.

Project Next Generation or Eliminate the Digital Divide – These were the two most impactful
digital literacy related grant programs that provided resources in libraries in this study. Upon
applying for and accepting grant funds recipients had larger obligations, such as providing internet
access for more patrons or helping both youth and adults learn skills. Nearly all of these libraries
expressed a sense of digital literacy that matched at least that of the Digital Literacy Task Force
(American Library Association: Office for Information Technology Policy 2013b), if not several
elements of the Belshaw (2012) model, and had expanded their technology portfolio beyond
simple desktops and e-readers.
169

Digital Literacy Programs for Youth – Organized activities specifically for teaching youth how
to use recent digital technologies such as computers, cell phones, video production equipment and
associated software. These most frequently happened in the form of Project Next Generation
events and typically were for older kids, grades 6-12. They were different than classes for adults
in that they typically did not focus heavily or exclusively on office production software and
generally assumed participants knew how to type, use a mouse and navigate the internet or e-mail,
activities that were the foundation for computers basics provided to adults. Only a few libraries
offered similarly advanced activities like Photoshop or video production to adults and these were
rarely organized classes.
Beyond Basics for Adults – Defined as activities and programs to help adults learn technologies
beyond the basics of device concepts and operations. Activities such as how to type, use a mouse,
employ a word processer, navigate the internet and e-mail were not counted, neither were activities
like learning how to download an e-book to an e-reader, play simple flash games, chat on the
internet or transfer pictures off of a digital camera. Eligible examples would include media
production with Adobe Premiere, building computers and installing an OS, learning to program
(code), setting up a website or Ebay postings for a business or editing pictures or graphics with
Photoshop.
Without the Project Next Generation grant almost none of these libraries would be able to conduct
digital literacy related programming. It was the most influential structural condition beyond the
sheer influence of changing social norms, and the equipment purchased by it was almost always
used by libraries for a multitude of programs and services. The grant was particularly effective
because of its decade long history of resource provision, which supplied a kind of sustainability
vital and rare for many libraries. A few libraries also benefited from Department of Commerce
and Economic Opportunity “Eliminating the Digital Divide” grants, which typically supported
internet, computer and instruction resources. These were less consistent and often went to other
organizations in a given community rather than the public library, but when present were often
described as just as impactful.
All libraries taught computer basics, but there was a difference of what ‘basics’ meant to each of
them. Typing and mouse use was always considered basic. Operating System interfaces and file
170

management as well as searching the internet for information were also often considered basic.
The category could also expand to include e-mail and using MS Office programs. Given frequent
patron needs I personally would advocate that we add internet chat (or Skype), file transfer to USB
drives or cameras and use of social media services to the list of “basics.”
The general theme with digital literacy programming in libraries was ‘advanced fun stuff’ for kids
and ‘basics or essentials’ for adults. This seems, at first glance, a little odd, as the people who teach
kids to create videos could probably do the same with adults, but what it suggests is that the general
audiences who use the library are in different places. Adults who want to learn skills like computer
programming or graphic art design with tablets go to organizations like community colleges,
whereas a lot of teens can’t find enough of this in their school curriculum. Perhaps libraries, like
society, aren’t as invested in life-long learning as they are in K-12 education.

Table 8 - Library survey comparable measures of computer assistance.

Point-of-Use Assistance – Libraries where reference librarians or other staff would help patrons
informally with computers as they happened to have questions. This help was short-term and
typically involved easy tasks like printing or finding a resource online. It was comparable to the
national survey (Bertot et al. 2012) but higher amongst libraries I observed (nearly 100% as
compared to the state-wide 78.7%). This is perhaps the case with my sample because it did not
include many extraordinarily small and rural locations, due to the poverty and ethnic population
requirements.
172

Formal Classes – Dedicated classes for learning computer basics or other skills related to digital
literacy, taught in a dedicated lab setting at an arranged time. This number was comparable, both
in terms of definition and frequency, to the state-wide average.
One-on-one sessions – Computer or e-reader tutoring sessions arranged on a case-by-case basis
with patrons. Librarians would be wholly dedicated to the patron during this time. This measure
was also both comparable in terms of definition and frequency to the state-wide average.
Similar to the notion of “computer basics” there’s a spectrum from incidental walk-up help and
one-on-one tutorials. Classes may be more like open exploration sessions or involve one-on-one
help too. It’s interesting that, in my determination, virtually all libraries were providing walk-up
help, but other measures roughly matched the averages throughout the state. Part of the reason
point-of-use assistance occurred regularly is that it is typically simply part of library reference
services now. Reference desks were located nearby public computing labs in nearly every library
and a large volume of reference questions relate to computer and internet information-seeking
tasks.
Many librarians, especially directors, wished they could offer formal classes. This suggests that
many libraries, whether they realize or embrace it entirely or not, have come to see themselves as
part of the educational infrastructure in their communities. The “do it on your own with a book”
philosophy may be increasingly supplanted by a “do it on your own with Wikipedia” perspective,
but too many patrons need to learn socially to actually establish adaptive literacies. Libraries
throughout the study were facing such regular requests for computer help and instruction with
devices that they frequently felt it was expected of them to get people the education needed to get
online. It wasn’t that there weren’t other education providers in the area who could help with
computer basics, as many locations had nearby community colleges or social service
organizations, it was the library had many inherent advantages: an automatic and diverse audience,
free access to existing infrastructure, and, more importantly, a known brand and duty to promote
literacy.

Table 9 - Activities related to digital production by library staff.

Tutorials and/or Literature – Many libraries stocked how-to guides in paper format related to
computer and e-reader use. These were especially important for at least two reasons: (1) they could
give them to patrons to get them started when a librarian was too busy to provide long-term or
dedicated help and (2) they acted as a kind of reference or reminder for patrons who had forgotten
what they learned previously. Many libraries also used these materials internally to train their own
staff or as notes to teach patrons. Interestingly the Bertot et al. (2012) study looked only at online
tutorial resources, which were relatively infrequent in libraries across Illinois (22%), as contrasted
to the 44% paper-providers encountered in my sample. Note that these may be a low estimate, as
174

I both physically searched for and verbally requested tutorial materials, but some library staff may
not have known about all that was available.
Facebook – If the library had an active (posts made at least once a month) Facebook page at the
time of data collection. Facebook is (and was) a part of daily information-intake for many patrons,
and many libraries used it to post photos and information about events as well as patron-driven
content. In fact, some libraries chose to use Facebook instead of their own website. One of the
cultural components of digital literacy is the adoption of technologies on an everyday basis.
Libraries could both engage with and teach patrons to be active participants in social network
systems. Low activity was less than one post per month, on average. Generally pages were either
entirely dead or vibrantly alive.
YouTube – If the library had a YouTube page and published videos with patron-driven content.
This could be considered a sign of patrons communicating and expressing stories with digital tools,
a typical measure of literacy.
Digital Community History or Archival – Many libraries had centers and online resources
dedicated to the preservation of local history. These typically involved the digitization of content
(patron-contributed or pre-existing collections) with scanners or cameras as well as the provision
and support for services like Ancestry.com. In some cases it extended into collaborations with
local museums or historical societies.
It seemed like most of the computer and e-reader help literature was written in applications like
MS Word, instead of on web pages that could be printed. Most libraries had only just begun to
migrate to providing these documents in both digital and printed form. Much of this had to do with
how libraries treated their web presence: if they saw it as a warehouse of information and
broadcasting platform or place of co-constructed learning and conversation. Even those that
leveraged resources like wikis still had problems generating and sustaining patron participation.
Facebook and YouTube presented interesting challenges for libraries that revealed some about the
norms of the institution. On the one hand patrons both used and wanted to learn about these
services but on the other hand the ways that people use them, notably sharing and processing
experiences through a range of content mediums, was sometimes interpreted as oppositional to the
175

traditional role of the library. Librarians were often very worried about patron privacy or
perceptions of “neutrality” and did not want to post photos or strong opinions on their pages. Some
libraries dodged this issue by allowing patrons to post or tag their own content to the library page,
but this introduced a layer of liability, about as much liability as those who posted photos of their
own events assumed. A lot of small libraries got away with posting photos of participants and
library events with informal agreements or understandings and, as of the time of my interviews,
nobody had ever been sued, only, at worst and in rare cases, asked to take photos or posts down.
This may mean the laws about privacy and image rights may be out of sync with social norms.
Chicago Public Library may yet shake this trend up with their recent shift to a webpage that
resembles Pinterest, complete with staff-provided reviews that liven up and diversify Readers’
Advisory.
Digital community history and archival operations were present in about half of the libraries. They
varied some in how much content was patron-produced and how much was curated by librarians.
They often involved classes or tutoring for how to use Ancestry.com. Sometimes projects
culminated in physical displays in the library or virtual displays online. These kinds of programs
provided a motivation for many elderly persons to learn more about digital technologies.

HARD-TO-MEASURE VARIABLES
I regularly asked about or sought to measure several topics that proved to be too hard to pin down
as categorical variables. Sometimes these turned into stories, but not always, so this section
addresses the remainder.
As mentioned in my research design, I did try to test the security and privacy limits on public
access machines. While I could say something about the success and failure of certain techniques
I think it is better not to—I have no interest in encouraging unethical or criminal behavior. The
main point is that a lot of libraries had security vulnerabilities and they should take care to inform
patrons of the risks that should be associated with public computers in a way that will enable them
to be reasonably mindful, not fearful. Libraries were already reporting numerous elderly patrons
who were afraid of—but generally ignorant about—identity theft.
Most libraries were increasingly forced to be a replacement for government and social services.
Not every library indicated they understood e-government as a concept, but many gave examples
176

of helping patrons to find forms and learn how to use service interfaces. Generally e-government
needs were so diverse that they could not offer standardized classes, most of it required prolonged
one-on-one support and referral to other community agencies. What’s more is that a lot of the
librarians expressed that they felt stressed and strained by all of this—they were not qualified to
act as a consultant for a person’s taxes or help them with mental health care or legal advice. On
the one hand they knew they might be the only person who could provide assistance for these
vulnerable patrons, but on the other hand they were afraid of liabilities and frustrated with the
absence of human-provided government assistance.
Many libraries, not just Grand Ridge, had Unions that played a large role in determining library
policies. These affected issues like work conditions and hiring practices, as might be expected, but
also decisions related to librarian training, volunteers and general determination of services. Like
e-government, the struggle to balance supporting and controlling unions reflected diminishing
protections and social safety nets broadly in society. In some ways they represented an invisible
third faction in determining policy, beyond the library staff or administration and general public.
Videogaming was present in the form of programs and/or dedicated consoles or game computers
in several libraries. It certainly has a lot of cognitive benefits, like inspiring problem-solving,
persistence building, collaborative information sharing or learning various computer and visual
interfaces, but game design is even more beneficial. Putting together a game, electronic or
otherwise, involves computational thinking and technical writing for the determination and
implementation of rules, art and graphic design for the production of assets, imagination and
critical inquiry for the development of stories or settings, or marketing and persuasion to generate
adoption. And this is just to name a few outcomes. Professor Scott Nicholson of Syracuse
University has researched the topic comprehensively. 71 Libraries might start with bringing games
into the library in general, and move towards game design in tandem with other media and
information production activities.
Games also represent a potential hazard for libraries as much as they might a boon. Unlike most
print literature (or even movies on DVD), which is produced by a wide scope of people and on a

71

See http://www.scottnicholson.com/ for publications, examples and other material on this topic.

177

vast array of topics, popular computer and console games are often related to competition and
violence and are designed with boys in mind. 72 This is changing as the field of types of games and
gamers widens but many libraries that deploy games as a method to bring in youth find themselves
with spaces dominated by aggressive boys. It may be possible to guide and curb this, as is indicated
in the study of Bozeman, but it takes a high degree of investment, time and familiarity that many
youth librarians may not have.

72

And they might reinforce any number of other structural inequalities related to race, gender, sexuality or nationality.

Though many scholars have written on the topic I think the most accessible, relevant and recent commentary can be
found in the work of people like Anita Sarkeesian (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Edgk9RxP7Fm7vjQ1dcDA) or Bob Chipman (http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/4719-Gender-Games).
Videos like these, while not recognized by peer reviewed journals, will go a lot further to convince skeptics and reach
more gamers than a lot of feminist scholarship.

178

DISCUSSION
Every library I visited had at least one unique story to tell. These individual stories, as partially
revealed in the library comparison tables, were often representative of recurrent themes that I
encountered in many locations around Illinois and that have been recognized by the ALA and in
formal publications. Collectively considered, the findings reveal a number of important
dimensions of library service roles and constituent factors like infrastructure, people, policies and
activities.
This discussion section is just the beginning of what might be said about my research. It presents
some of the theories that might address the “why” behind the findings and also helps readers to
think about how they can apply them in the context of the field of library and information science.

TOWARDS BUILDING A BETTER THEORY
One way to determine the value of a dissertation lies in recognizing its connections and
contributions to theory. I believe my work goes beyond conceptual models for digital literacy or
ways to assess library programs. It is data on what libraries are actually doing in a particular kind
of context, what’s working and what’s challenging. What happens when we consider this data as
if it is in conversation with the existing and developing theory on digital literacy? What are some
of the other areas of scholarship and theory this might relate to? What questions does it open up
that were less visible before? This section searches for answers to these questions.
FROM DIGITAL LITERACY TO DIGITAL LITERACIES
In my initial proposal I posited that digital literacy is best understood as a fuzzily bounded and
dynamic set of social practices that foster critical social awareness, as well as measurable
knowledge of and creative command over relevant digital tools. This resulted in the qualified
critical and creative digital literacy that became the impetus behind my initial investigative focus.
While this definition retained a lot of persistent value, I continued to seek a better framing of the
concept throughout my dissertation research. 73 Engaging with the ways public librarians think and
73

The word ‘creative’ is often understood in the sense of creativity, the process of hatching worthy and original ideas,

which actually would lend itself considerably to the critical awareness component, a mindset that requires some
measure of divergent thinking to be performed well. At the time I did not require that ‘creative’ include uniqueness or
discovery, just conscientious construction of objects and ideas, with the possibility that they may also be innovative

179

talk about the concept, as well as consulting a framework provided by Douglas Belshaw (2012)
highlighted several major issues that are worth considering when working to define digital literacy:
1. Digital literacy certainly has more dimensions than are captured in my first definition,
which, despite being broad, assumes or de-emphasizes too much. As a concept digital
literacy continually changes in response to current technologies, social norms and both
scholarly and every-day conceptions of literacy in general. The goal ought not to be to try
to invent one literacy to rule them all, as Belshaw relates, instead it is more appropriate to
acknowledge the intersectional and fluid nature of the study of digital literacy and think
about the conceptual assemblage as digital literacies, in the plural, as introduced earlier in
my literature review and in Belshaw’s thesis (2012). Belshaw’s version commands an
additional degree of utility, because it promotes a comprehensive yet easily accessible set
of eight elements: cultural, cognitive, constructive, communicative, confident, creative,
critical and civic—to which I would like to add one more, curious.
2. Examples and heuristics really help others to understand what digital literacies entail.
Fostering critical social awareness, for instance, requires an understanding of the
surrounding cultural context and what might make a given application or expression of
information relevant, adaptive, or even revolutionary. A solid way to drive home the
meaning of these very subjective terms is to explain them with, or in relation to, evidenceladen stories.
In other words, this calls for a simultaneous broadening of the scope as well as a simplification of
the terms. My purpose is not to craft yet another definition, it is to help us better understand existing
ones by looking at the context of the library.
Let us just explore the topic pragmatically, for a moment. Literacy, as a term, is often used as a
word that is interchangeable with ‘competency,’ but it is most useful when it is rendered in a social
context. If we say digital literacy is like computer literacy, for instance, we might arrive at metrics
like the ability to click quickly and accurately with a mouse, or type a certain number of words in

or even deviant. In fact it is probably better to think of it as two distinct elements: creative (divergent thinking) and
constructive (building).

180

a minute. While these tasks are notably measurable, they quite clearly fall short of really measuring
your actual ability to comprehensively or even appropriately use a computer. They’re really just a
kind of gauge of ‘input skills,’ and it’s hard to draw distinctions related to knowledge or learning
with them. Should we also worry about how fast someone can text on a cell phone? How about
their ability to use a TV remote or touch-screen e-reader? Drive a car safely with a GPS on the
dash? Inputs and even rituals with various technologies are not what literacy is about, though they
may be a prerequisite, similar to access. Literacy is about knowing how to think and knowing what
a given tool, device or medium means in a performative context. Not just being able to know,
create and express, but to know, create and express with a purpose and in an adaptive manner as
an intentioned process. This understanding is consistent with its frequent presentation in
scholarship (Belshaw 2012 in citing Carneiro 2002 and Holme 2004, Finn 1999, Freire 1970,
Taylor 1993, and many others).
We might, for instance, say digital literacy is the ability to use ICT’s or networks to locate,
evaluate, use and create information. But this doesn’t really capture digital storytelling, 74 in its
entirety, does it? Someone is not just “creating information” when they make a digital story, but
they are also creating an experience—cultivating a relationship to an audience or fostering
reflective personal development. They do this in kind with achieving the effects they want from
an arrangement of tools and media. Another example might be building an “internet of things”75
device at a makerspace. There are tasks in this kind of project that involve digital environments
and interpreting media, such as programming an Arduino or designing and then printing a custom
case in 3D, but it’s not just a one-time application of knowledge, it’s an iterative prototyping
progression that requires conceptualizing a problem or need, imagining an answer and then having
the attention, patience and persistence to reimagine it many times and explore the multifarious

74

Expressing a story with multimedia by using tools like digital cameras, Photoshop and AV recordings that can be

deployed in a variety of mediums, from podcasts to websites.
75

The “Internet of Things” refers to individually identifiable devices all connected together through wireless networks

and artificial intelligence. This includes conceptions like a ‘smart home’ where you might inventory your refrigerator
at home from your computer at work, which might in turn tell the backseat of your car to reconfigure to fit more
groceries. In other words devices that can all talk to one another over the internet to respond to needs and
circumstances.

181

knowledge and skill dependencies uncovered throughout the process. Digital literacy is a
composite and interactive process.
My favorite way of exploring what I mean above is by discussing what I’ve been lovingly referring
to as the “Twidale Heuristic.” 76 Most people in OECD countries learn how to read when they’re
young. Later on in life when they get a new book they don’t go to take an entire class on how to
read the new book, they already possess the ability, such as strategies for sounding out syllables
and making sense of sentences in context, to read it. Digital literacies should be much the same
way, and yet, in a peculiar fashion people often lack the abilities that would enable them to just
pick up a new technology or interface and “read it like a book.” The issue is of course doublesided, the object or interaction structure is equally to blame for such troubles, but ultimately what
the constellation of digital literacies represents is this: literate people should ideally be able to pick
technologies up and learn with, engage and find value in them on an ordinary basis.
It’s a lot more complicated than this, as my use of the word heuristic would imply, but I think it
gives a clearer goal. It may seem like magic when a kid is just able to start fiddling with a cell
phone or computer and quickly begin to leverage its functionality, and indeed this is part of what
inspires some of the notion of digital natives, but it’s not at all magic, it’s a combination of a
variety of digital literacies. We certainly don’t think it is magic when a person picks up a book and
starts reading it. I’d like to strive for a worldview where we don’t regard digital technologies with
fear and classify them as sorts of mystic and undecipherable things.
The book comparison is also interesting because it very easily lends itself to complications.
Literacy in its traditional form is reading as well as writing, but people learn how to write in
different formats or for different audiences. We read and write in different languages or with
different nomenclatures that really do require classes and even with all of the classes in the world
I’m not convinced I’ll ever fully understand the writing of scholars like Michel Foucault. The idea
here is not to elicit a perfect analogy but to promote the goal: a solid foundation of digital literacies
that enable day-to-day functionality as well as adaptive learning, expression and so on. With this
in mind, let’s cover the eight C’s I introduced in the beginning of the section.

76

Because, as you might guess, Professor Twidale first explained it to me this way.

182

EIGHT ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF DIGITAL LITERACIES, PLUS ONE
Douglas Belshaw (2012) tackles the question of defining digital literacy head-on in his aptly titled
thesis “What is Digital Literacy.” Covering a wide variety of sources and perspectives, many of
which overlap with the material previously encountered in my own research, the text thoroughly
demonstrates the “continuum of ambiguities” in which varied definitions of digital literacy reside.
The term not only means something different depending on your field, context and culture but it
has also changed over the course of time and may be a spectrum state of being within an individual.
Interestingly, it continues to be an amalgam that is used and expressed with some evident
explanatory value and practical impact, despite not constituting a single coherent social theory.77
Ultimately, Belshaw promotes a matrix of intersecting digital literacies, with emphasis on the
plurality and lack of hierarchy, grounded heavily in his comprehensive review of the literature.
They are as follows:
1. Cultural – Similar to the ‘negotiation’ concept proposed by Jenkins et al. (2006), literacies
are socially constructed and given meaning within a social context. Technologies help to
define, and inversely are defined by cultural discourse. A person’s ability to fluidly use and
benefit from digital technologies has as much to do with their knowledge of and
participation in the surrounding culture and expectations as it does their specific set of
operational skills or access to gear. For instance, Twitter is a remarkably simple use of an
expression medium but to comprehend and leverage it effectively requires embedding
oneself within a given internet-based culture and structure for expression – # tags, @
replies and retweets all arose in a largely organic fashion, and Twitter requires a degree of
familiarity with audience interests and platform capabilities to know what’s worth
tweeting. It will likely keep changing rapidly, which is also part of the culture. It is
remarkably different, and yet similar to, other information exchange environments like

77

For digital literacy to be a valid definition, framework and theory Belshaw suggests that it must feature a consistent

measure of utility (actionable application), a retrospective element (credence to the underlying concept of literacy),
metaphorical element (situated) and digital element (dedicated to the medium). He finds that it fails to do this as a
unitary construction.

183

Wikipedia, where co-construction of knowledge also happens with a varying level of
formality. Learning how to learn, to apply or develop cognitive models with digital tools,
is reliant on situating oneself within social contexts. It’s not just recognizing what the
digital tool or medium can do, literally, but how people accomplish activities with the tool,
why and what it means.
2. Cognitive – Perhaps the mainstay of traditional literacy, a person’s ability to employ
cognitive toolkits or mindsets to engage with information, mediums and physical tools.
This pertains to a person’s psychological composition and may also include behaviors that
are in part cultural, like the ability to direct and sustain attention effectively (see Rheingold
2012). From my perspective cognitive literacies would address the bulk of skills and
competencies most often associated with information literacy, such as identifying and
locating data with strategies like recognition rather than recall. For instance, you might cast
it as a person ‘thinking with the internet’ by expanding their memory and personal
knowledge by taking advantage of knowledge networks to obtain, inventory and apply
information more rapidly (see distributed cognition, in Jenkins et al. 2006, or some social
practice-based examples in Harlan et al 2012 or El-Zanfaly 2013). Other examples might
include computational thinking (Papert 1980) or metaphorical conceptualizations to enable
the effective use of abstract interfaces (Kress 2003).
3. Constructive – Part of the problem with phrases like “apply information” or “create with
information” is that they do not imply digital literacies should go beyond ‘purely digital’
constructions. Part of what I assert literacy entails is that people be savvy enough to create
and assemble information, dynamic digital artifacts (or texts) and also work with abstract
constructions that aren’t singular or static concrete entities, like ideas or relationships. The
process of construction, for instance, could include moving from brainstorms to sketches
to digital blueprints to physical prototypes in an environment like a Fab Lab or makerspace.
Most of these sorts of processes are iterative by nature and thus it would include comfort
and familiarity with remixing, reappropriation and a permanently beta 78 state (Lessig 2006,

78

Permanently beta (Neff and Stark 2004), in this context, refers to the regular state of instability of digital products.

Take Google: it never has a final released version, but is instead an interface with a continually changing and wildly
complex set of databases behind it. What’s more is that the consumers, the users of Google, have a strong role in

184

Neff and Stark 2004, and Jenkins et al. 2006 address versions of this) and overlap with
comprehending and employing systems of inheritance and attribution. Constructive digital
literacies, as I conceptualize them, rely on a key condition: the ability to generate, modify,
repurpose, remix and otherwise assert control over the mediums these ICTs depend on and
exist in. This requirement may be extreme, but can be cast as a long term goal, much as
justice and equity might at first seem farfetched. If individuals can program, design, hack,
and build software and hardware then they have greater control over the means of
knowledge production. They can participate in liberating movements like Open Source
(Chopra and Dexter 2008), dismantle oppressive social structures knit into digital
architectures 79 (Lessig 2006) and help to maintain the innovative context that enabled the
proliferation of the internet to develop in the first place (Zittrain 2008).
4. Communicative – Just as a simple definition of basic literacy embraces reading as well as
writing, digital literacies fundamentally involve expression. Constructing something may
not preclude having that something actively or purposefully convey information, though
often these dimensions overlap. It likely relies on the shifting forms of input abilities, like
using a mouse, typing, tapping on touch screens and so on, but requires social
apprehensions such as awareness of an audience, grasp of message formulation processes
or subjective bits, like tone and implication, or signs and signaling. More restrictive
definitions of media literacy that categorize ‘digital technologies’ as just ICT’s likely focus
heavily on communicative literacies.
5. Confidence – Another kind of attitude or perspective, one clearly tied strongly to culture,
a sense of agency enables learners to practice, experiment, inquire, speak out, and engage
in all of the other activities that comprise application of the digital literacies outlined here.
Knowing that an action in MS Word can be rolled back with the “undo” button or having
the experience to recover deleted files can lead a person to approach tasks in digital
environments differently. Much of the debate on digital natives has revealed that what is

influencing the way the system develops. The internet is made up largely of these kinds of feedback and innovation
systems.
79

To reiterate, Lawrence Lessig argues that the internet heeds four constraints: social norms, the flows of markets,

law, and the way its systems, interfaces and channels are constructed; their architecture.

185

actually determining or mitigating learning and action in digital environments is fear (or
lack of it). Belshaw suggests that “individuals who successfully capture the Confident
element of digital literacies understand that such literacies are mutable.” As an activist
scholar who believes agency is the optimistic and alternate point of attention to structure,
I cannot stress enough how much confidence matters in determining literacies: it makes us
consider how to empower an individual, in addition to adjusting structures. The result is
paying more attention to the emotional and affective components of the process of learning
with digital technologies, as well as their effect on motivation.
6. Creative – A topic explored with Robinson (2011) earlier, creativity is often cast as a kind
of elusive and rare skill that is bestowed to people ‘naturally’ or ‘as a gift’ (Ferguson 2011).
In some ways this false discourse might just be a reflection of the fear people have in some
dynamic or unstable mediums or contexts, due to never having been taught or encouraged
to be creative as a child in formal schooling (Robinson 2011). Generally creative literacies
revolve around at least two main characteristics, (1) divergent thinking, the process of
generating contrasting and non-sequitur ideas and (2) doing this with a functional balance
of frequency, persistence and reflection. In other words creativity can be both taught and
practiced by coming up with a lot of new ideas in an iterative and rapid fashion. 80 Clearly
these literacies tie into many other social dimensions, like dealing with failure, the fear of
change or aversion to risks, self-efficacy or social agency, inquiry and experimentation and
more. Creativity connects to a wide variety of other literacies, as it typically involves the
process of copying forms or ideas, transforming these and then combining them into
something different or redefined enough to be called new (Ferguson 2011).
7. Critical – Belshaw touches briefly on the critical literacies component by noting the
transformation of literacy practices over time and throughout various semiotic domains,
citing Walter Ong (2002) and Laura Gurak (2001), but I believe it’s actually much bigger
than this. Other authors identify literacies that may be similar, like judgment (Jenkins et al.
2006) or crap-detection (Rheingold 2012).

80

Advocates for Design Thinking (Brown 2008, Fawcett et al. 2013, and IDEO 2014, to name just a few) identify a

variety of methods for this.

186

Critical social awareness is the component that keeps this model outcome-oriented. It is
not unlike the objectives of critical pedagogy expressed by Finn (1999), suggesting that
educators must work vigorously to decipher and dismantle the oppressive structure that has
come to characterize modern stratified education and push for authentic dialogue between
teachers and learners. This need for a critical mindset goes beyond teaching young students
in schools, extending to people of many ages and cultures, 81 and also beyond the domain
of skill acquisition—to aiding learners in becoming aware of their right (and capability) to
transform reality (Freire 1970). In order to empower, literacy should be an avenue for
individuals to better understand how their identity and agency rely on, and produce, cultural
forms. Contemporary introductory sociology classes refer to what is essentially the same
concept when they teach students about C. Wright Mills’ (1959) Sociological Imagination:
critical consciousness of the relationship(s) between experiences, of individuals and
communities, to social structures and processes.

In other words, people become more digitally literate by approaching technological tools
critically, 82 and this process deals with a moving target. What has been liberating literacy
in the past—simply knowing how to read—has become domesticating literacy, a mere
requirement to be plugged in to the system, but not command power within it (Finn 1999),
and there is no reason to think this trend will not continue with each generation of digital
technologies that involve communication. I would posit leveraging the internet is the new
facet of this issue. People ought to engage in making sense of information access,
communication and production tools in terms of some relevant fundamentals:

81

I mean this in the same sense as explained by Braga (2007): Resistance Theory (Giroux 1983, 1988) compels us to

move past issues of ‘social reproduction’ to rescue notions of agency and resistance, as motivated by the work of
Gramsci (1971). It is therefore important to engage all social groups in the process of social critique to forge alliances
that promote progressive political actions – a clear connection to the following civic component.
82

Banks (2006) refers to this as critical access: “Members of a particular community must also develop understandings

of the benefits of the problems of technology well enough to be able to critique, resist and avoid them when necessary
as well as using them when necessary” (42). To frame critical analysis of ICTs as access is a cumbersome appropriation
of the digital divide rhetoric. It is probably more accurate to describe it as literacy, even if the critical qualifier may
be redundant.

187

•

The ways they affect their capacity to assert identity. Which people and discourses are
excluded? Is there possibility for meaningful communal participation or collaboration?

•

Recognition of the limitations and opportunities afforded by the cultural context
surrounding a given tool. How might power or social norms be structurally embedded
in devices? What steps could be taken to change or improve the situation?

•

Meta reflection on this process of sense-making and evaluation: how is it we come to
see certain discourses, and why might this matter?

There are certainly more avenues of critical inquiry than explored here, the above are just
a few examples. Your average youth is not going to look at a video game and automatically
think about it in terms of power, but they might be able to learn to ask questions, like why
Mario is always saving the princess and not the other way around, to start them down the
path of this sort of consciousness. Scholars like Haraway, Bijker, Cowan, Pinch, Wajcman,
Vaidhyanathan and many more in the sociological field of Science and Technology Studies
(STS) provide countless examples of these kinds of critical perspectives.
8. Civic – And, finally, as is implied by the relational nature of critical and communicative
literacies, we do not operate within a vacuum, our experiences take place within the context
of a civil society, hopefully one whose development we influence and support. Social
innovations like Wikileaks or the use of Twitter in the Arab Spring are not only interesting,
but they’re intentional movements that represent (and require) a degree of digital literacies
in the participants and content producers. Recent research suggests the process of civic
engagement happens as a fluid mixture of online and offline activities (Smith 2013). In
many countries E-Government is on the rise, sometimes even required for citizens, and the
scope and boundaries of civic participation may even be gradually bursting out of national
boundaries. A recent Partnership for 21st Century Skills report (2014) aptly states:
“Citizenship today means more than understanding the roles of government and voting
in elections. It means making sense of local, national, and global events, trends and
information, and acting safely, responsibly and ethically in online forums. Citizenship
requires a wide range of knowledge, 21st century skills and experiences for effective

188

and productive participation in the democratic process, community life, education and
workplaces.”
In my view this element represents an agenda to build empathy, perspective-taking, civic
duty or participation and advocacy into the array of digital literacies; it pairs quite well
with the aims of community informatics. 83
9. And, as a modest attempt as a scholar to help advance, clarify and strengthen this
framework I would like to add one more: Curiosity. Now in some sense to say ‘curious
literacies’ doesn’t really sound appropriate, but if we think of curiosity as the mindset and
lifestyle that embodies and emboldens inquiry it becomes a different quandary entirely.
Every single one of these literacies and derivatives can involve the formulation and asking
of questions, even if just implicitly. So much so that curiosity can actually act as the basis
of an entire model for learning: inquiry based learning. If we conceptualize curiosity in this
way we are provided with a process that is situated, personal, action-based and social
(Bruce 2009, Bruner 1965, Bruce and Bishop 2002), a cycle of developing and engaging
with knowledge relationships in a range of settings. See the figure below:

Ask
Reflect

Discuss

Investigate

Create

Figure 3 -The Inquiry-Based Learning cycle, as presented by Bruce (2009).

83

As well as calls for action by other sources, such as The National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic

Engagement (2012).

189

Clearly one activity does not have to explicitly lead to another, and not all steps are always
necessary, but it’s easy to see how the eight elements of digital literacies characterized above could
fit into the cycle. I believe curiosity can successfully provide the impetus behind the learning and
socialization of many if not most of these dimensions of digital literacies. A wonderful example is
found in the process of play, which I will later revisit, but for now I mainly want to underscore
that thinking about curiosity helps us to add a component to the conversation: motivation. The
reasons people wish to learn, what allows them to develop patience or be persistent or guide their
attention is a crucial part of the topic.
SPOTTING THE EIGHT ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS
So the question remains: is Belshaw’s matrix a useful frame for thinking about what public
libraries were accomplishing in the stories from the previous sections? Does this work support the
notion that it’s really digital literacies and not digital literacy? I believe this to be the case.
Aquarin was a remarkable mixture of the elements and powerful example to lead with. Grade
school children were taught to leverage interaction and expression with devices like ipads for
digital storytelling, helping them to work on cognitive and communicative literacies as well as
develop confidence with tech tools at an early age. They learned navigation by touch and icons or
how to tell stories and give opinions about books. The teens who participated in the podcast poetry
slams added a cultural component by learning how to prepare their words and experiences for (and
into) the culture of the web. Involving patrons in public TV production contributed a constructive
component, as participants filmed and remixed media, which also took on a creative aspect with
tasks like designing effective PSA’s. The staff that guided them through all of these activities were
largely driven by their curiosity and willingness to let inquiries into technology lead them to
advancing literacies and library programs.
Shipton, though a very different context, also featured a similarly strong array of literacies. The
librarians themselves showed a willingness to critically assess technologies through critiques of
the progress narrative, proprietary controls and reliance on the web for services like the cloud or
talking books. They worked to spread this knowledge to patrons as part of their service as
information experts. Bringing volunteers and tech services to the homes of patrons who might
otherwise be excluded enabled them to develop awareness, familiarity and eventually confidence
190

using online systems. It also represented a grasp of civic literacies through a strong commitment
to digital inclusion: blind and elderly patrons were being signed up online in their homes to
participate in the library.
Norburry had staff and external help with the critical and cultural literacies to enable them to
position open source software and provide a variety of computer types to optimize patron
interaction preferences. The volunteers who built the talking gingerbread man supplied an injection
of creativity, construction, and deviant communication, which was all driven by the thrill of
inquiry. One identified benefit for participants in this project was the development of
computational and design thinking with the iterative creation of circuits and interaction systems.
Dalhurst met patrons where they were, both figuratively and physically, working to provide
confidence with technology to those facing stigmas or limited opportunity for experience. Their
digitization operation was not only construction of digital community history to be moved online
but it was also a way to inspire civic participation with digital tools: patrons were invited to
contribute to and draw upon the heritage of the community. It embodied a degree of cultural
literacy too, as patrons learned ways computers might be relevant to them or how they are entitled
to be a part of remembrance and representation on the web.
Paddock chose to instill confidence in young learners through mentoring made possible by
partnerships. The kids in their PNG program might not have ordinarily been able to foster the
constructive literacies related to engineering, but they were exposed to them by the facilitators
from a local corporation. The library staff’s willingness to experiment running different kinds of
technology-related programs in an iterative fashion also suggests a form of cultural literacy as well
as curiosity-inspired discovery.
Altura critically recognized the cultural shift to provision of information and education services
online and reconciled this by reaching out to social service institutions and in-need populations to
ensure their participation, which reflected civic literacy. They knew that in order for their new
services to work patrons required cognitive models, cultural familiarities and confidence to depend
on web-based systems. Participants in online-learning also supported communicative literacies,
such as the ability to connect to others within a class that is distributed, asynchronous and largely
participant-initiated.
191

Bozeman revealed an opportunity for curiosity and creativity through their free-form PNG
programs. The library’s understanding that the learning of technology often happens informally
may have also been a kind of cultural literacy, membership as believers in the DIY method. On
the other end of the spectrum the structured computer interaction systems might contribute to
instilling values like equal opportunity participation in the web, with a duty to preventing
harassment or infringing on the rights of others.
Plainview worked with an immigrant population with very different needs in terms of cultural and
cognitive literacies: they didn’t think about what technologies meant or did in the same way. They
opened the door for the library to help use Skype to enable communicative literacies or Head Start
curriculum to raise awareness of civic participation happening with the web and notary services.
The kids started with applying basic uses of technology for school projects in a generative manner,
like printing.
Belle Terre took to the fostering of computing logics by crucially affiliating themselves with
mobility as a model, while still striving to boost confidence with input and software basics. Their
stifled attempts to connect media production technologies to businesses and schools represented a
dedication to civic literacies.
Grand Ridge featured the same computer essentials available at many libraries, designed to
deliver patrons experiences for iteratively tuning cognitive literacies and building sureness, but
capitalized on these to offer those in social media and multimedia production that could promote
cultural and communicative literacies, as well as possibly civic participation through e-government
assistance. Their Union challenges and issues with PNG also may indicate a lack of curiosity and
confidence amongst some staff, particularly with regard to constructive literacies.
Rowland Heights needed to fight to match up the social implications of technologies with the
underserved parts of their population by hiring people better positioned to be ambassadors. Their
PNG program digitizing the dead in turn yielded a really clever experience that thrived on
curiosity, drove communication and related participants to facets of culture.
Otranto operated an in-house IT team that engaged in constructive remixing to better
communicate with and train staff on technical systems. Their vision of a YOUmedia type space
192

indicated a desire to bring patrons into a participatory digital experience with their library, so that
the identity and ownership they exerted through situating the library as a symbol might be extended
to the web and beyond.
The examples above are incomplete. They represent only a small fraction of the ways the
framework might be applied to each of the sets of stories. The purpose of it, like any other
typology, is not to treat them like checkboxes each site or activity should seek to fulfill, but instead
consider them as lenses to consult or spectrums to bear in mind. They fuel questions librarians and
scholars might ask. How is this program requiring or affecting communication skills? Does this
policy for digital tools underscore a commitment to certain civic values? What is the extent or limit
a person is being constructive (generative) in performing an action with a tool? In each story we
can see evidence that some component of the library institution—people, policies, infrastructure
and activities like programming—is influencing how patrons develop digital literacies.
Spotting potential is really only the start, however. To some extent seeing what patrons create or
taking note of what librarians understand and do is itself a measure, but following the process of
how digital literacies are fostered in any one individual (or community!) is grounds for another
(perhaps my next) study.
The 8+1 C’s framework is important for another reason, besides the story analysis it supports. It’s
inherently value-laden: the stories it draws out suggests that digital literacies are often intrinsically
social or participatory as well as generative. This may indicate an alternative vision for how the
library affects the construction of knowledge or the arrangement of power in society. This is
particularly pertinent for the sites that did not appear like they were heavily represented above, the
vantage point of just considering digital literacies doesn’t address the full story.

193

A TYPOLOGY OF SERVICE ROLES
I’d like to return to the first part of the central research question: the role of the public library.
Throughout data collection participants conceptualized it in a variety of manners. An incomplete
list of metaphors for library service, as encountered in interviews, includes the following:
The Public Library is…
•

Here to provide or facilitate information access

•

In the business of disseminating information

•

A space that is a community center

•

A collaborator network (or negotiator of this network)

•

Functional DIY education

•

An education provider

•

Opportunity for exposure to new perspectives

•

An advocate and authority on critical inquiry

•

A place of information storage, preservation and discovery

•

A place of production—information, knowledge, culture, ideas and even objects

Readers will probably notice I’ve intentionally arranged these conceptualizations, all of which
were explicitly encountered in interviews, in pairs that may seem a little contrary. This is because
they reflect an ongoing tension that was persistent in nearly every library I visited: the extent to
which the library has an obligation, or right, to be an active player. Invariably when I asked
questions about the library’s role in promoting critical or creative digital literacy 84 I was met with
a representation of this dialogic relationship. On the one hand libraries often wanted to be in a
position to offer unfettered and unjudging access to materials on controversial topics like sexual
health but on the other hand they also at times wanted to take a stand in advocating on issues like
literacy or the importance of book-driven learning. The conflict, considered in the context of all of
the research sites collectively, was bigger than the age-old debate over neutrality in collection

84

Once again, the roles identified in the literature review that fueled my interview questions: (1) enabling the

acquisition, critical evaluation and need-relevant use of information, and (2) encouraging the expression of creativity
through the creation and sharing of multimedia content.

194

building embodied in selection versus censorship (Asheim 1953), it infiltrated nearly every service
or social role the libraries considered. It is less, as Buschman (2003) suggested, that the library is
in a permanent state of crisis over how to reconcile the integration of the information revolution
into its identity, and more that the public library has an identity crisis in terms of its need for
proactivity. Just as literacy is arguably incomplete if you teach someone only how to read and not
also how to write, fostering digital literacy requires more than opportunities for access to
information and materials, it is realized and reflected in information use, expression and relation
to relevant application in daily life.
To understand what I mean, let’s think about some examples from the site visits to assemble a list
of library roles.
1. Assisted Public Computing. The notion that libraries are expected to provide broadband
internet access for free is nothing particularly radical or new. Within the sites I visited all
of them, even those who were struggling with funding or staff or other limitations,
maintained that this basic service was essential. In other words, the barest and most
minimal definition of the library was that it was books and internet, not just books.
However, this reduction to materials and tools neglects perhaps what is really the most
essential component of the library: librarians. A more contemporary vision of the most
fundamental service role is that the library is a place of guided public computing. That is
librarians were tasked with bringing some of the same service roles familiar to them—
organizing books, sharing materials, helping people learn to read—to the context of using
the internet and digital technologies. They struggled with some of the same questions, like
censorship as a corollary to internet filtering, or how to best design patron experiences with
information. Whatever the issue was, in the end the library’s role became a negotiation of
how much intervention or proactivity was required by librarians. In Bozeman they opted
for structural enablers and limitations built into systems, like time management software
or unstructured open time for teens. In Norburry they relied on providing patrons a choice
between different operating systems and offering them a mixture of open source and
proprietary office productivity programs. In these cases librarians attempted to assist the
general public in their computing operations by avoiding direct interaction or intervention.
They felt it was best to guide from behind the scenes through policy and architecture. By
195

contrast in Grand Ridge they recognized active help for computer users was so important
that they even dedicated a specific computer help desk to it. In Paddock, Altura, and Grand
Ridge they offered a variety of classes to ensure that every patron could not only visit the
library to find free internet access but also visit the library to take a class on how to use the
internet for activities from doing budget spreadsheets to photography. Similarly Dalhurst,
Bozeman, Norburry, Rowland Heights and Paddock used staff and volunteers to enable
long-term one-on-one guided computer tutoring sessions. Not all libraries managed to
accomplish this service objective, however. Some were unable to keep up their equipment
to make it possible for patrons to use it successfully without intercession with a librarian.
Others simply didn’t have staff with skills or time to ensure assisted public computing
could always be available. In most of these libraries it wasn’t assured for all populations.
The sample set for this dissertation relied on socio-analytic (census) categories to identify
and qualify socially-excluded populations but the field experience suggests that these are
just a start. Some libraries did well to help teens and kids learn about technologies, while
others helped out-of-work patrons fill out resumes and still others ran computer basics
classes with the elderly. Typically a given library wasn’t able to get to everyone in need
they might have wanted to: undocumented workers, people with disabilities, undereducated
elderly, troubled teenagers, people of color and more. The assistance part of the public
computing service broke down when librarians were ill-equipped to connect to those who
were in-need, and, as underscored by the deficit-focused language in the categories
employed in the last sentence, unable to see them in terms of assets and opportunities.
Sometimes the library recognized assistance limitations and took efforts to minimize it,
like Grand Ridge or Aquarin’s non-traditional hiring, but most of the time those who
weren’t able to be helped either weren’t present or were simply ignored. Ultimately the
way we might best see the first form of service role would be to frame it as assisted public
computing for all.
2. Community Networking. A phrase I heard consistently throughout interviews was that
the library was going to become more of a community center in the future. Much of the
time when this was explained librarians were thinking of it in terms of space for activities,
which is the classic implementation and role, but increasingly it was more in terms of the
library acting as a community services hub. In this sense the library was the source of
196

assets, people and ideologies, but it was also charged with the role of meeting people where
they were. In the case of Plainview this meant literally installing a new branch location in
an area without any service and driving exchange between locations. In Belle Terre it was
structuring the computer lab as laptops (and bringing in external teaching groups) so it
could be a more fluid service. In other places it was about bringing library resources out of
the library and directly to people, like the Shipton talking-books delivery to homebound
patrons, the Dalhurst e-reader lunchtime workshops for people with 9-5 jobs, the Altura
database training at social service institutions or Aquarin’s wildly popular library-led music
festival. In all of these cases the library acted as a leader and expert: they helped organize
the effort through formidable sets of relationships and advocacy and also enabled it to be
stronger by providing people with technical expertise. I use the word leader because this
networking often involved a dimension of significant risk-taking and vision. Many of them
tried out arrangements continuously and iteratively, consistently refining their objectives
and building a better model of service. In Paddock this meant entirely renovating the set of
libraries and trying new programs each year, but continually doing so with pre-established
ties, like partnerships with the local schools. Even in Belle Terre, where attempts to lead
collaborations with other groups in town didn’t work out, the library was still invested in
this role as a community technology mediator and enabler. A community networking
vision was behind the volunteers in Norburry and Bozeman that helped to allow those
spaces to be more welcoming and robust community centers. Aquarin had rebranded itself
so well that people in town began to associate the library as an uncontested community
programming entity and in Otranto the library’s integration with the local neighborhood
and role as a symbol resulted in people’s willingness to fight for its existence, when
necessary. All considered, the second form of (emergent) service role would be to act as a
leader in community networking, in order to fulfill the library’s role as a community center.
3. Generative Learning. The newest of the roles set in relation to proactivity was the
question of how to best foster learning. Libraries have long affiliated themselves as allies
to education in providing information to help understand and solve problems but the foray
into digital technologies and associated digital literacy services has positioned them to now
promote tools, relationships and experiences to enable better practice-based learning.
Sometimes it was little steps, like Rowland Heights providing books on home repair or
197

Plainview giving kids free multimedia homework supplies. Other times services were
entirely reorganized around production-based erudition. Aquarin had digital storytelling
with podcast teen poetry, video book reports on ipads and youth-designed public TV clips.
Rowland Heights and Dalhurst invited community members (kids and adults, respectively)
to participate in discovering, organizing and presenting community history through
archival and digitization tools. Norburry moved into physical production with experimental
and rapid prototyping techniques, like the talking gingerbread man comprised of small
soldered electronics and a computer controller. The third, and in my opinion most exciting,
form of service role was to become an active and practice-based education provider.
Once again my ordering here is intentional. Being a leader in community networking wasn’t
necessarily reliant on being able to assist patrons in public computing activities, but ideologically
they build upon one another. A library cannot just give a patron a computer, they have to help them
with it, too. They can do more than just participate in a community program, they can help lend it
expertise and leadership where appropriate. They can move beyond merely immersing patrons in
exposure to culture, they ought to help them learn how to understand and intentionally produce
reflections of their own culture. In each instance we see libraries taking on more responsible and
assertive roles.
This conclusion is especially important for libraries that work in underserved communities. These
libraries may have had fewer resources and greater challenges but they often took this as an
opportunity to provide better services. The patrons they aided were more than willing to help
themselves and their communities, but they also benefited more from the digital assets, guidance
and networks found in the library. The stories in this dissertation illustrate the complexity and
scope of driving innovations and managing struggles in places without all of the odds stacked in
their favor.
It is this core challenge, encountered time and time again, that leads me to what is perhaps the
most fundamental implication for theory in this dissertation: fostering digital literacy is a
function of community engagement. In other words, a public library’s role in promoting and
cultivating digital literacies is predominantly a result of their active community engagement. At
first glance this may not appear to be a particularly earth-shattering point of discussion. The reason
198

it’s important is not the content of the statement, but the order—the causality. Digital literacy itself
is not a given or static role. It is not the same as safely assuming books will promote literacy if
merely made available, because we can expect everyone knows how to read and write. Schools
ensure people are literate but they cannot currently ensure people are digitally literate, and there is
even less assurance for people outside of the formalized education system. Just as I would agree
with Finn (1999) in advocating that we need to make literacy dangerous again by ensuring it
includes the ability to think critically, I would also assert that merely providing opportunity for
information access through internet terminals, e-readers and computer basics classes that just teach
patrons how to follow scripts to operate software programs is insufficient. Grappling with this
reality is truthfully what inspired me to broaden and deepen my understanding of digital literacy
in response to my data over the course of two years. It is also what led me to the work of David
Gauntlett, a scholar who interprets my favorite explanation for why I believe community
engagement is tied to digital literacies, because it connects theory to practice.
MAKING IS CONNECTING
Gauntlett’s thesis, based largely on the ideas of John Ruskin, William Morris, Karl Marx and Ivan
Illich, is well-encapsulated by his book’s title: Making is Connecting (2011). Fundamentally, he
argues for the significance of creation, the generation of virtual and real things by everyday people.
Like Robinson (2011), Gauntlett attacks the idea that the world of thinking (theory) should be
separated from the world of doing (application) in some kind of archaic industrialism-era fashion.
He suggests that to have creativity and craft contained in (or by) formal institutions and fields, like
professional art, theater, dance, programming, writing and more, is to further the illusion that
everyday people cannot be part of meaningful cultural production, when, in fact, they’re perhaps
as responsible for it as any news media, educational or governmental force. The explosion of
interest and sensation over the Web2.0 “brand” (Scholz 2008) represents a challenge to many
traditions of cultural construction, and Gauntlett is careful to note some of the downsides, such as
the danger also identified in Baym and Burnett (2009), that collaborative production may be

199

unrewarded or exploited labor, of a kind. 85 Nevertheless he makes three points that are worth
elaborating:
•

In the case of creation, both on and offline, we need to think about more than just tools of
craft, but instead underlying values, structures (he calls these platforms) and communities.
The ease of use, access and affordances or capabilities for a given tool are certainly worth
noting, but Gauntlett’s book is intentionally full of examples of people connecting to
people, by making in various contexts, in relation to certain norms and cultures. It is not a
case study of any particular technology of the moment, it is all about emphasis on learning
and meaning-making experiences.

•

Imperfection and amateur work is not only acceptable, but it actually may make us happier.
Unfinished works, failed first-time and iterative learning activities, rough remixing
projects, and so on are all potentially productive. What is most often important is the
personal and affective aspects of a work or use experience, which effectively spur an
increase in valuation (Norton et al. 2011). Gauntlett finds ties in the literature on individual
happiness to the process of freely-chosen, goal-oriented creation projects, including
emotional support, communal recognition and social, mutual appreciation in feedback,
self-awareness and more. As is also noted by Singer et al. (2006), happiness is strongly tied
to motivation and successful learning in formal education, as well as the process of lifelong learning.

•

Gauntlett’s analysis emphasizes that making necessarily leads to connecting. The general
assumption of participatory or maker culture is that it is inherently social, because
individuals usually share and learn from others in virtual and physical communities. For

85

In their study Baym and Burnett noted that often respondents didn’t see things this way. Not all activity must be

rewarded in a monetary form. In fact sometimes the best rewards are not possible to quantify in that way. Scholz gives
an argument similar to what Castells or Buschman might say: the discourse and ideological framing around Web2.0
as a zone controlled by the everyday person is a tool of those who control the space of flows, the technocratic promarketization elite. Substantively, ability to contribute content and establish connections does little to disassemble
structural oppression like racism, sexism and the like. The alternative demographics of the web (which has in part led
to the digital natives scare) and the existence of powerful counteractive forces like international hacker communities
do make for some social change, but not the egalitarian liberation it was once dreamed (or purported) to be.

200

some perhaps the act of making may involve periods of isolation, but it is ordinarily
conducted in response to (or embedded in) social and cultural contexts. Indeed “art for art’s
sake” may not even be possible. No ideation happens in a pure vacuum, nor are anyone’s
actions totally irrelevant or immune to relation to social constructions. Creation and
learning with or around other people, is not the limit or fundamental driver, however. It
starts, fully, with inquiry and assistance: individuals that help one another along the way
in their projects. This is the very same reflexive, inquiry-based learning process identified
earlier. In this process people forge meaningful connections by establishing and
transforming ties with one another, which in turn affects social capital. Though tracing the
importance of social capital is challenging, Gauntlett suggests that this is how to best take
a sociological viewpoint on aggregate wellbeing. If we are truly moving more towards a
society with democratization (and ubiquitous capability?) of production and people are
better connected as a result, then we can use social capital as a measure of this more
empowered public, both in terms of ideologies and capacities.
Gauntlett finishes with a chapter on Ivan Illich’s work on deschooling 86 and the social roles of the
tools of creation. 87 An education system based on connecting by making would look radically
different than our current artifact of the industrialization era, and would involve more direct skillsharing and exchange-based teaching, and peer matching or mentorship. Public libraries in this
system could be essential and proactive facilitators of life-long learning provisions and programs.
The vision behind this, which I think beautifully captures the necessity for digital literacies, and
the possibilities of making as connecting, is stated best by Illich (1973:21) himself:

86

In Deschooling Society (1971), Illich effectively anticipates the crisis of education as presented by Robinson, only,

as would be reasonably expected, without emphasis on information society. He proposes a radical reformation of
education.
87

Titled formally, Tools for Conviviality (1973), the book is largely about having the power to shape one’s own world,

the dangers of organizing human interests into systems and institutions, and the way that tools could apply to both of
these issues. Illich defines tools rather broadly, from individual instruments used to produce or effect something, to
larger entities such as a hospital, all of them are means to an end.

201

“Tools are intrinsic to social relationships. An individual relates himself in action to his
society through the use of tools that he actively masters, or by which he is passively acted
upon. To the degree that he masters his tools, he can invest the world with his meaning;
to the degree that he is mastered by his tools, the shape of the tool determines his own
self-image. Convivial tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest
opportunity to enrich the environment with the fruits of his or her vision…a convivial
society should be designed to allow all of its members the most autonomous action by
means of tools least controlled by others.”
In this statement Illich demonstrates the necessary connection between critical self-awareness
and active creation. When people become cognizant of their desired and imposed identities they
are better able to act with direction and conscience—critical perspectives provide the impetus to
envision the world, and one’s part in it, as they wish it to be. Gauntlett and Illich propose a vision
of society filled with empowered, confident, self-directed people, who purposefully use tools
largely of their own design or control. These participants connect with one another, not just in
terms of communication or information sharing, but also through making and remaking 88 both
content and the technical systems through which it flows.
The views espoused by Gauntlett and Illich might seem a bit lofty, but they were both ahead of
their time. Illich illustrated the possibilities for learning, as well as the possibilities dismantling
of traditional institutions of education, that are ever increasingly coming true in emerging
contexts like the web. The public library’s many roles in facilitating the development of digital
literacies are another example of this. The vast majority of the stories in this study included the
connection between patrons and librarians, and while the ties varied considerably from case-tocase they collectively reflect a measure of the health of these communities. Not health in the
traditional sense of the medical condition of individuals, but health in the sense of what Gauntlett
means when he identifies that the learning of tools or technological systems is fundamentally tied
to structural conditions and emotional outcomes. There are a wide variety examples of
connecting by making, some quite literal, such as the volunteers and librarian who became better
88

An alternative phrasing of this might be subverting. Finding and making “hack-arounds” to systems of content

sharing is a way of remaking and exerting control on them.

202

friends at Norburry while building a talking gingerbread man, or Aquarin’s partnership with
public TV to deliver teen-created PSA’s. Other stories included the questioning and remaking of
systems of content delivery, both socially and technologically, like Shipton’s efforts to hack their
talking books and directly deploy library computer services in the homes of users who might
otherwise be socially excluded, or Altura’s dedication to providing guided online learning
system access to every social service organization in town. Often the best cases of libraries
playing a major role in fostering digital literacies through community engagement involved
instances of connecting by making that were positive in both political and emotional terms.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
An important question remains: what should public libraries make of all of this? To start, let’s
return to the recommendations presented by the ALA task force on Digital Literacy (2013b):
“The nation’s libraries reach and serve individuals of all ages, income levels, and
ethnicities. They serve as information hubs, conveners, and collaborators within their
educational and community contexts. They provide venues in which patrons and students
can engage with, discuss, share, remix, and create information, going far beyond access to
research and materials.” (pg 3)
Many of the research findings in this dissertation not only seem to verify the quote above, but also
directly support the ALA’s proposed guidelines. The only objection I might make to this statement
would be that I don’t believe libraries are just venues to facilitate information transfers. A strict
definition of information might reduce the conceptualization to “facts” or sequences and patterns
of things, while broader understandings recognize it to be a resource, commodity or even
constitutive force (Braman 1989). All of these descriptions emphasize information with a sort of
impersonal level of abstraction that, in my opinion, deflects attention away from very real physical
objects and people that interact in a space with ideas or information. To suggest that libraries play
a role in promoting and cultivating digital literacies is to also suggest they can and do have an
impact on the making of things and relationship building between individuals. I revisit the ALA’s
guidelines below with this distinction in mind.

203

INCREASE INVESTMENT IN DIGITAL LITERACIES
It goes without saying that increasing investment in digital literacy would help libraries to better
foster it, but it’s more nuanced than this. Libraries can start by considering Douglas Belshaw’s
(2012) set of digital literacies in terms of their own context. The ALA guide naturally focuses a
great deal on cognitive and performative components often already associated with understandings
of information literacy and, though they also emphasize inclusion and participation, they don’t
break it down in the same way. Asking librarians to consider how they might inspire curiosity or
confidence or cultural exchange with technology-related programs will yield different results than
if one simply suggests they help people to work on software operation skills for job opportunities.
As several of the interviews reflected, it seems much of the reason libraries don’t offer advanced
computer learning classes for adults is that they haven’t even thought about what they would do
in them. In other words, investment begins in helping library staff and patrons to think about what
digital literacy entails and means to their public in the first place. The stories exhibited in the
findings section go to lengths to demonstrate some of the variations this might include.
Project Next Generation and the Eliminate the Digital Divide grants provided by the state were the
main reason any digital literacy related programming besides computer basics was happening at
any of these libraries. These state-supported initiatives propelled interest, awareness and ability
through funding libraries and by connecting them to concepts—for over a decade! The long-term
commitment by the state enabled sustainability as libraries were able to amass equipment initially
on a regular basis, allowing them to shift investment to people and programs in later years. It is
important to note that the state reached out and invited groups to apply, to ensure money went to
some of the places it was needed most, even if these places were not entirely equipped to seek
support on their own.
Hiring staff to teach and run programs with digital technologies, or dedicating large portions of
current staff time to these tasks, really influenced the stories and examples I encountered. Nine of
the libraries I visited had someone doing this at least half-time and all of these libraries offered
either one-on-one help sessions or classes or both. Libraries who are less able to find funding to
pay staff directly may be able to dedicate effort to finding effective volunteers. This strategy didn’t
always work out in all cases in my sample, but a given library won’t know if it’s possible until
they try. Staff training is equally important, in this regard. Investing in professional development
204

should go beyond teaching librarians about how to work certain devices or software but also
include teaching them how to instruct and engage, how to relate to patrons and how to learn tools
on their own. Just as it is important to teach patrons strategies and not rituals, it is important to
enable librarians to be adaptive and proactive.
If we look back over many of the case study examples we can find several instances where digital
literacies intersected with “traditional” library service roles: preservation of community history,
helping users to better access and get more value out of reading materials, establishing the library
as a community center, assisting in research and so on. Increasing investment in digital literacy
related services does not mean uniquely forming and supporting isolated or individual “computer”
or “maker” programming, it can—and should—be done in parallel with the development of other
service role investments.
DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN PARTNERSHIPS
The majority of stories libraries told that had to do with digital technologies included partnership
with some sort of organization. Sometimes it was public schools who would refer participants for
PNG, other times it was institutions of higher education that might supply volunteers.
Circumstances were better for seeking grants or donations or having sway with the local
government for many libraries that actively pursued partnerships. In a sense this is just a reflection
of social capital, the value of relationships of varying strength between people and organizations,
but I observed it playing a part in library capabilities and orientation in nearly every location. In
addition to organizations it was also often ties between individuals specifically.
Several libraries found that their collaborations in the community included an added benefit on top
of offering more programs or finding specific audiences: they reestablished the brand (or
reputation) for the library. When libraries would run an event at another location or go to a patron’s
home or post patron-created materials online, they would alter how people in the community saw
them, and what they thought their roles entailed. This was one of the ways they could enable new
partnerships and open up avenues for new sources of funding. In this way they enacted what I
mean when I say “be in conversation with your public.”

205

STRENGTHEN RESEARCH AND ASSESSMENT
I was definitely the only university researcher to visit most of these libraries in the past decade, if
ever. Only a few regularly sent employees to ALA conferences or were even aware of the digital
literacy task force. The academic world would do well to focus more research on libraries far away
from major cities or Universities—we’d learn just how limited some of our ideas are to an
absolutely crucial realm of practice. The “ivory tower” stereotype is too often true in the scope of
LIS, where we spend a great deal of energy investigating abstractions and dispensing critical
perspectives.
Most libraries reported that the main modes of assessment imposed upon them were related to
numbers like circulation and headcounts. They were not equipped to measure patron impacts by
other means, some hadn’t even thought about evaluation at all. Project Next Generation, the grant
that was responsible for remarkable digital literacy activities at over half of the locations, had
recipients send in reports that mostly included limited descriptions and budgets. The grant had no
standardized format for report presentation and comparison, or publicly recognized measures of
success. They posted no pictures or examples of projects created by youth at various locations,
though they did later add links to a few library-run PNG websites, and were unable to send me
outcome data when I requested it. State-based efforts like this should help to provide guidelines
for evaluation and then act as platforms for dissemination of that information. Ideally evaluations
could be tied to related standards, such as Common Core objectives in education, and also
reflections of inclusion like participation and diversity. Taxpayers need to know if their money is
being invested well, and, more importantly, such sharing of information could inspire other
libraries interested in embarking on similar projects.
That said, libraries shouldn’t be deterred from taking their first steps to foster digital literacy, even
if they don’t fully understand what they’re doing. Most libraries indicated that doing something,
going from 0 programs and 0 patrons to some was better than nothing at all, especially for
something this important and that they wouldn’t be able to learn in any other way. The system
director for Plainview stated it in a manner that reflected the wisdom and drive she had accrued
over the years:

206

“If there isn’t anything and you add something and one person learns something then that’s
a success already. When you’re in a community that has nothing you give anything and
open their mind up. With a 50% drop out rate for high school, these children talk about it
as ‘if they graduate’ and never about college. If we can open up their minds in any way,
shape or form by any exposure and they have one spark that produces them to be the first
one in their family to go to college that’s a success. I can’t measure that in this moment in
time, but I can hope I can plant a seed that will cause this to happen in their lifetime. I don’t
worry about measuring that success, I trust that it’s going to be there.”
The kinds of long-term studies required to determine the impacts of learning with technologies
were outside the range of possibility for a lot of these libraries. Instead, libraries took risks and
then figured out if what they did was working in an iterative fashion rather than plan formal
evaluations in advance. This meant they often operated reflectively and reflexively, not always in
a formulaic fashion.
One trend that might help public libraries in the task of research and assessment would be to engage
in “Design Thinking” as a strategy for the development of programs, spaces, staff capacities or
patron engagement. Many examples and models exist that can apply to specific scenarios, such as
how to foster inclusion and technology learning in collaboration with immigrant youth (Fawcett
et al. 2013) or establishing community-planned spaces for making and media engagement (IDEO
2014).
Please see Appendix C for some additional potential guidelines for program evaluation.
INCREASE ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING
Libraries can invest in spaces that meet patron needs. Displacing collections to reduce shelf space
for repurposing can be challenging or complicated, but adding a dedicated computer instruction
lab or teen space with computers will go a long way to helping a lot of underserved patrons get
more value out of the library. Circulation counts aren’t exactly comparable to program
participation, but many more libraries in the study had more trouble having enough computers
available all of the time than having enough books in their collection for everyone. Most of the
locations that reported success with fostering digital literacies had made significant changes to
their spatial arrangements that met changing service priorities.
207

Possessing equipment besides desktop workstations and e-readers often stimulated libraries to run
unique programs and offer new services that could promote digital literacies. Scanners enabled
digitization of community history, video cameras led to patron-produced films (cultural
production), laptops allowed instruction to occur in new places, ipads swayed kids into digital
storytelling and so on. The affordances of other devices can contribute to the realm of what’s
possible, especially when combined with the right person and context.
Literacy was a continuum for most libraries. Teaching a patron to search their e-mail required they
knew how to spell a given word. For the libraries with immigrant populations or kids who weren’t
getting enough opportunities in school, teaching fundamentals came first as a requisite point of
“access” to programming. Home-bound seniors sometimes needed to understand what the internet
was before they’d learn to type and use online services or databases. For many it was more about
getting over fear or learning to ask questions that was needed. It was always important, for the
libraries I spoke to, to meet people where they were, and then go from there.
IMPLICATIONS FOR LIS EDUCATION
The help desk manager at the UIUC Graduate School of Library and Information Science, Jill
Gengler, once said that the kinds of people she wants to hire (and inspire) are “positive problem
solvers.” I don’t have enough words to express how much I agree with this sentiment. These are
the attributes of the people I met in my research who truly helped to foster digital literacies and
enabled their libraries to have visible impacts. Throughout the process of the dissertation I couldn’t
help but compare my experience with graduate studies in LIS to what I was observing in the field.
I had the privilege and honor of attending and working with one of the highest ranked institutions
in the world in several capacities: as a student, researcher and instructor for several years.
Throughout most of the period I frequently struggled with feelings of being an outsider or rebel
because of my consistent desire to focus on practice and optimism (solutions), which was often
regarded as unscholarly, naïve or arrogant. At one point it even led me to reject affiliating myself
with librarianship entirely, but the better answer, I later determined, was to take ownership over
what I wished for my area of study to be. In that vein, I posit that LIS must address several major
issues:

208

Identity. LIS has a branding problem. Too many people think librarians are the rigid old ladies
who go “shuuush.” They think libraries are boxes full of books and inert silence. They don’t think
of public TV production centers, talking gingerbread men or the building as a hard-earned symbol
of social justice for an African American neighborhood, or as many of the other possible
associations present in the stories of my site visits. We need to alter what libraries and library and
information science means to people, and we can do this by teaching—socializing—our future
public librarians with professionalization that emphasizes human and technology services as much
as reading materials or organization. Libraries should bust out of their walls and into their
communities and on to the internet to be heard and seen differently. 89 As a field of research we
need to think and talk about ourselves differently as well. Instead of defining the field as being in
a state of crisis over information needs, we can construct it as being in a state of proactive
responsiveness. We are not the handmaidens for information merely here to serve other fields, we
are innovators and leaders with all things connecting people and information.
Diversity. Public libraries serve patrons of all kinds, and yet library science is continually one of
the most homogenous areas of study. This is true in terms of nearly every socio-analytic category
(race, class, gender 90) and often in other ways, like personality types or disciplinary background.
The impacts of our lack of diversity is sometimes surprising, like when it results in intolerance for
conservatism, Christianity or optimism, and also sometimes very unsurprising, such as
assumptions of default whiteness or expecting every student to own a smartphone with an
unlimited data plan and penchant for checking email. Of the librarians I spoke to over half of them
expressly and independently indicated they did not come from a background in the humanities.
They were from fields like IT, business, education, social services, art and communications. Some
of them were even a little disorganized and many of them showed that they appreciated change
and yearned to be flexible. A few even said they weren’t all that excited about books. Above all

they were able to connect with patrons as diverse as they were, and found assets and opportunities
in the knowledge and needs those patrons had to offer for library services. Our ability to relate to
communities, patrons and technologies, as well as our motivation and capability to teach and
innovate, is reliant on our diversity. 91 There are many trajectories for tackling issues of diversity
in LIS institutions, including altering recruitment strategies, better supporting and sustaining
students, recruiting and funding faculty of different backgrounds and crucially working
recognition of the importance of diversity into curriculum, particularly information science classes
and projects.
Research and Teaching. A large share of research that comes out of iSchools appears to be on
academic libraries and academic topics. Much of the curriculum and body of publication focuses
on critical analysis of important issues, like discourses in literature or methods of information
organization and abstraction, but not active and direct implementation of solutions and services in
fields related to information. If the study of library and information science is to actually inform
what goes on in public with information professionals then we should be working more actively
with institutions beyond the academy. This includes researching with partners like corporations,
schools and community libraries and emphasis on areas like community informatics, digital
literacy and usability. Practicums and internships are a well-recognized method to engage master’s
students in this, but PhD and faculty-level research and scholarship must follow suit as well. Like
many areas of study PhD’s in library and information science often do not go on to fill tenuretrack positions at research universities, and consequently experience in practice-based and
teaching settings can be very important, it ought not be seen as a ‘distraction from true scholarship.’
On the other hand, research methods are not evenly taught in many institutions. Master’s students
may not get the opportunity to learn about how to conduct social science (or other kinds of)
research and PhD’s are often not familiarized with action, participatory and community-based
methodologies common in fields like health, education or psychology.
Several times throughout my research I was asked by librarians (who already had a Master’s
degree) if my school offered any continuing education for librarians who wanted to better

The ALA explicitly promotes this ideal with examples like the diversity standards for the ACRL,

understand what they were doing or who wanted to develop innovative programs like makerspaces
in libraries. There is an enormous opportunity for life-long learning in LIS education that can be
built upon pre-existing frameworks like online course systems or organizations like the OCLC to
ensure that a given librarian’s degree doesn’t have to be stamped with a certain vintage. Just think
of what might happen in an LIS research center explicitly set up to be a public (or corporate or
school) library program and systems innovation lab! 92

THEMES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
A good dissertation provides both insight into processes and knowledge as well as opens up
questions for future scholarship. This section addresses several themes and paths of inquiry.
FROM A SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE
The research goal of this dissertation is to better illustrate and understand the role of the public
library in making digital literacies possible. This capacity and process cannot be considered
independent of the larger social structures that determine the norms, boundaries and potentials of
the institution, however. In essence, it is important to note how one individual library or another
triumphs or struggles, but also what these stories might mean sociologically.
One important but unsurprising high-level observation was the diversity of the underserved and
socially excluded people aided by digital literacy related programs. My sample was built largely
on the premise of rather sweeping and generic census categories, but did not include a focus on
specific age groups, disability status, education or kinds or degrees of employment and class, other
than unemployment. Throughout the case study stories we can find examples of concern for people
of many socio-analytic categories that ought to be considered underserved, including the elderly,
people with unstable work conditions, non-residents from rural areas, undocumented workers,
ELL immigrants, drop-out teens or kids with limited educational opportunities, individuals with
multiple jobs, GED-seekers and more. These identities and conditions were often overlapping and
complicated but nevertheless they nearly all needed a degree of help from the library in developing

92

The Harvard Library Innovation Lab (http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu) might be an example of this. Admittedly

I’m more excited about the development and deployment of in-person programs than online systems. The Center for
Digital Inclusion (http://cdi.lis.illinois.edu/cdi) here at the University of Illinois may be an example of this.

211

digital literacies. The lack of familiarity with culture, processes and techniques related to the use
of information technologies was even referred to as a kind of identity and disadvantaged category
itself, but was so varied in its occurrences that it was impossible to think of it in the terms of
“digital native” and “digital immigrant.” An obvious conclusion that might be made based on this
observation is that LIS scholarship should continually examine and renegotiate the shifting
categories and patterns of social exclusion found in underserved library service populations in
order to best address the needs of many kinds of individuals. Another, likely more interesting
avenue could be to push our scholarship to advocate and actively reform the conceptualizations.
In other words, rather than responding to predetermined categories of need we might assist in
spotting emergent and intersectional statuses, such as how digital literacy needs might specifically
manifest in relation to socio-analytic categories like race or poverty, and set the stage for the kinds
of strategies that might be employed to respond to these challenges, as well as the pitfalls and
inhibiting normative conditions. I believe my research does some of this, but really each situation
could merit its own specialized study.
Management structures mitigated the degree to which libraries were able to innovate and respond
to different dimensions of patron need. Most library directors brought up their relationships with
their board as one of the primary drivers or deterrents of change, especially when it came to
developing service roles and responses to technology. The social organization and leadership
culture of the library in general, such as how much authority and responsibility was distributed or
decentralized, or the degree to which people communicated with and trusted one another, locally
or through the web, played a key role in shaping outcomes. On the one hand the case was frequently
made that people, activities, policy and infrastructure that supported digital literacy were hampered
as a result of structural boundaries such as funding inputs and external rules, but on the other hand
social norms, structures and policies were seldom identified as enablers. Instead the stories of
success typically emphasized the individual agency of librarians and stakeholders over state or
nation-wide grants and agendas, even in situations where grants were involved and very likely did
provide the basis for progress. In several of the case studies the library director offered little in the
way of leadership to pursue funding for digital literacy programs or support staff in activities or
with appropriate policies, but if they were sufficiently hands-off with a team comfortable operating
independently they were able to yield notable results regardless. In other words, there was no single
212

chosen model for strong leadership, in terms of centralization or distribution, or IT systems
adoption or control of information flows, but it did have to be driven from somewhere. The
libraries stuck at a point of near-collapse were largely so because of a complete lack of supporting
individuals at all, much less ones with leadership traits (team players, outreach-oriented, processaware, flexibility-inclined). A lack of consistency or consensus over successful management
models best suited to the cultivation of digital literacy suggests a very open question, one that
could be of particular interest to scholars in social informatics, as the inception of the area was
based largely on the study of ICT’s affecting the structures and processes present within
organizations (Kling et al. 2000, Day 2007). Naturally this might also fall into the realms of
business informatics or information systems, where the focus might typically be on impacts of
computerization or information systems strategies in corporate or traditional government settings,
instead of libraries struggling in underserved settings with ad hoc arrangements of people,
technologies and services.
In some sense this may be a form of what Eric Von Hippel (2005) refers to as the “democratizing
of innovation,” when users and direct service providers alike are increasingly able to innovate for
themselves, in coordination with existing assets, to match their exact needs. It may represent a
transformation of the library as a ‘provider with patron needs’ to something more like a collective
that leverages and negotiates a combination of internal and external resources to match problems
at multiple levels: library as customer, patron as provider, or many types of library staff members
as providers of many kinds of services. The mere everyday use and reappropriation of technologies
by (or in relation to) marginalized groups has been frequently identified as a form of overlooked
innovation (Eglash et al. 2004). Scholars have explored the topic in the realms of education (Eglash
et al. 2014), communications (Harlow 2014), media production (Fouché 2012) and more. As wellindicated in this study, libraries represent yet another site where the investigation of these
processes may take place. Comparison to the actions and activities in other settings could make
for a compelling meta-analysis.
Money was also an issue of concern in most of the cases. One would logically expect most of the
case study sites to be locations suffering under economic stress, as they were selected on account
of poverty levels and unemployment, but there was also a great deal of innovation that would not
have otherwise occurred if it weren’t in response to huge financial constraint. In a sense many of
213

these libraries resembled a sort of micro-entrepreneurship type environment, and several of them
might have employed techniques encountered in, or that might be valuable to, those invested in
the social entrepreneurship context. No business would ever think they could thrive by merely
cutting a number of services without investing in new areas or taking risks with new enterprises.
Grant-writing and cost-sharing for many included collaboration with new organizations, many of
which didn’t fit the classic ‘library partner’ role. Others let volunteers shape emerging services
and provide free labor and donations. The libraries that did well in the cash-strapped conditions in
these case studies were those who moved forward less conservatively. Those that could not be
adaptive were less able to produce compelling stories. Furthermore, the responsive startup model
for libraries is intertwined with the fragmented identity crisis, much like it might be in business
settings. As the library reinvents its brand in many communities it does so in direct response to
information-related problems (the easiest way to innovate, in a sense, is to work on the problems
at-hand), and these problems vary widely from community to community. Fostering digital
literacies might be a common goal in the majority of cases, but it’s still a leap from the traditional
notion of the library being a contained place of books. Reforming roles and pursuing new paths
for financial sustainability might run in-kind with other radical philosophical arrangements, such
as re-envisioning the library as an entity in conversation with its public(s), as opposed to a docile
facility or education reference apparatus. In a sense it summons an intriguing question: what might
a responsive startup look like if it weren’t a company positioning its identity in the name of selling
a service or widget, but a government entity seeking to further knowledge and social inclusion?
Both are seeking money that is not assured to them, but for different purposes and with different
sorts of investors. How might strategies between corporate and library models be shared, contrast
or otherwise inform one another?
The measurement of social capital is sometimes considered a way to judge the extent, composition
and condition of communities. The theory of the strength of ties (Granovetter 1973, Gauntlett
2011), for instance, is an interesting way to go about measuring community engagement and
impact of public libraries. For instance, what characteristics do librarians consider to make for
‘strong ties’ to a partner or collaborating institution? In the general literature on social capital we
find people are most willing to ask their strong ties for financial assistance, perhaps the library is
the same. Possessing a diverse arrangement of weak ties might enable a job-seeker to find
214

employment faster. Would a library with many weak ties do better than one with fewer strong ties
in accomplishing some tasks? It’s possible that some sets of ties might help a library fit better into
emergent roles, such as having a diversified funding base or reliance on volunteer labor, or
conjuring up enormous sums of funding to build computer labs or campaigning to keep a small
branch open when threatened with closure. The literature on libraries and community engagement
certainly recognizes social capital (Vårheim 2014, Cox et al. 2000, Griffis and Johnson 2014,
Johnson and Griffis 2009) but, to my knowledge, it rarely attempts to construct comparative
strength of tie metrics for large-scale or systematic comparison. A study of the library as an
institution, in terms of its roles, could fit well with a strength of ties analysis.
The history and culture of the locations I visited determined a great deal. Obviously any town has
a story and an arrangement of forces that has shaped it over the years, but the relatively small and
rural locations with dependence (or former dependence) on a specific industry or two frequently
determined the way of life for libraries and their users. For locales with universities and colleges
this seemed to result in some ability to transcend traditional issues of geography and power (as
Castells’ might put it, nodes in the space of flows) and thus necessitated more of a desire and need
to build resources and services around facilitating digital literacies. For others this meant they were
off the grid in multiple ways: regionally remote or isolated, with shrinking populations and
diversity as a result of outbound migration, and also separated from culture, knowledge,
communities and ideologies present on the internet. In some ways this situation was reminiscent
of international aid operations, where some piece of infrastructure or social program might be
brought in to solve problems without first understanding what people in a place are actually doing
and requiring to improve their lives. Libraries were better positioned in their own settings to
identify gaps in human and physical resources and to create self-sustaining operations with enough
support for learning and use by those affected. In many cases, particularly those with a mixture of
flows of resources and influences, external assistance was unnecessary and even unhelpful, but in
some cases, such as those where basic infrastructures and human capacities weren’t even present
at all, it was possibly the only hope for change.
Shifts in demographics and labor are often spoken of as reflections of changing economic
paradigms. There is the idea that the industrial revolution gave way to the service economy and
eventually the information revolution. Education institutions like libraries have regularly regarded
215

themselves as key components of workforce development in each economic landscape. And indeed
in previous eras this may well have been true, but, as is noted distinctly by C.G.P. Grey (2014), in
reference to ideas posted by Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2011), Cowen (2013) and Pistono (2014),
the proportion of newly created ‘technology’ jobs has been relatively small in comparison to the
total number of laborers in other longer standing service and goods-producing fields, such as retail,
food and transportation. 93 Increasing automation at all levels, including computers that can drive
cars or serve cups of coffee as well as artificial intelligence that can find, organize and interpret all
kinds of information, or pen news articles and even write code is likely going to cause massive
rearrangements of the labor force. In one sense the library is already dealing with this issue as it
seeks to work with and in relation to the internet, but in another sense the growing population and
reduction of labor needs in key fields is bound to spur more unemployment and need for life-long
learning. Some of the librarians I’ve spoken to have acted as if it is only a matter of getting past
helping to get the elderly online but these upcoming fluctuations in jobs and disparities will affect
many people of all ages for several generations. There will be a great need for research into
revitalizing economies in small town and rural settings most affected by the amplification of
automation and the library could be a site of study for this. I am certain that scholarship related to
usability and the learning of information systems will grow in-kind, as for every new technology
we add new problems surface and new gaps in knowledge arise. Library and information science
fits neatly into this niche.
DISCOURSE INTERSECTIONS
One of my original dissertation proposal ideas was to examine the ideas apparent in the discourses
exhibited in interviews. In a sense the philosophies and topics discussed in interviews can be seen
as if they are in conversation with larger conceptualizations apparent in literature. Digital literacy,
for instance, is clearly one of these, but there are others.
Buschman (2003) writes about disentangling the “language of economics” from the mission of
acting in the public sphere, and nearly every librarian I spoke to felt compelled to both engage in

93

The top ten largest occupations in the US include very few areas that deal directly or specifically with advanced

computer

technologies,

216

the language of economics (referring to library ‘customers’ or ‘value per user’ and similar phrases)
as well as number-based metrics. Librarians rarely verbally indicated they had to be accountable
for a given book, computer or program’s value to a patron in terms of its ability to enable them to
be a more successful member of society but they frequently spoke about how much money they
saved patrons by possessing materials or offering free classes. They went about considering
services often in terms of ‘government versus business’ and were quick to express their interest in
avoiding competition. The frequently-mentioned notion of the ‘personalized online library’
seemed to indicate interchange with the idea of the unlimited customization and specialization
promoted in Anderson’s (2008) presentation of the long tail or Von Hippel’s (2005)
democratization of innovation, where providers and users are tied together in the co-construction
of new and effective services. Libraries considered themselves a key part of democratizing the
tools of information distribution and, to some degree, digital production, leaving only the need to
connect supply to demand in order to fill niche interests. As it was encountered in discourse, library
directors typically spoke with an assumed facet of our changing economic landscape: that the
internet and digitized information will provide individualized solutions for all of us, including what
to read or even more controversial proposals, such as providing the “right” information.
There was also a lot of recognition of structural barriers and oppression. Many of the interviewees
spoke about poverty in terms of its pervasive effects on communities and its embedding in systems
of politics and economics; seldom did I ever hear a librarian blame the ‘poor’ based on
shortcomings or attitudes (Rank 2005). Given that the library is an institution charged with
promoting social good this is perhaps unsurprising, but it’s still an important participation in a
specific progressive discourse. Even still there were times that librarians would refer to a kind of
‘us’ and ‘them’ in reference to certain socially excluded communities. Sometimes this was on
account of simple differences in staff or ideological composition, but it was also likely telling:
unity was not always present in language, much as it was not always present in practice. When the
topic was shifted from ‘those in need’ to the question of digital tools there was considerably more
variance in the same kind of acknowledgement of structure in technological systems, like Lessig’s
(2006) concern for architecture. This contrast was somewhat interesting—it wasn’t the user’s fault
that they were in poverty, but it was their fault they didn’t know how to use the computer. We’d

217

blame the “system” for their relative oppression, but not the (computer) “system” for poor
usability.
In many interviews when I asked participants about their definition and understanding of digital
literacies they confused or conflated the term with computer literacy, media literacy or information
literacy. Some redefined the term while others questioned its utility or even speculated about its
possible role as a vessel for other discourses or agendas (and with good reason, Belshaw 2012
confronts this challenge directly in his dissertation). Grasp of a specific definition did not seem to
consistently impact arrangements of services or policies; vague arrangements of “digital” concepts
were enough to inspire action, which lends weight to the notion that a plurality of literacies is ideal.
In a way I interviewed a variety of people in massively under-resourced settings who might often
be considered deprived and 'backward' and yet they were frequently thinking deeply about issues
of library roles and identities as they relate to the ways people ought to leverage technologies.
Most of these libraries did not have the funding or interest in participating in larger library and
information science conferences, but the absence of representation of their wisdom and
experiences may be a significant loss for the field as a whole. In particular the libraries referenced
in the section on “when my model broke” should be telling, as the stratification in resources and
ideologies permeates our profession. It is difficult to win grants by focusing on fundamentals like
funding to keep the doors open and the staff paid but for many libraries fulfillment of these
essentials would enable them to take the next steps to enter into the conversation about responding
to needs for digital literacies. There is likely some room for critical analysis here. Much like
Virginia Eubanks (2007) found very important intersections and insights for challenging
assumptions about the digital divide by calling upon voices that often go unheard, librarians in
many settings and with many backgrounds could help to inform the way we make sense of digital
literacy (or digital literacies). I believe my work sheds some light on this, but additional questions
might include the best ways to include their wisdom into the construction of policy or questions
and assumptions driving future research.
Some librarians referred to digital natives explicitly but many others spoke as if ‘they’ were a kind
of assumed reality, less in the way that Palfrey and Gasser think of it, as a defined population
(2008) with certain characteristics and determinants and more as Bennett et al. (2008) characterize
it, as fear and moral panic. Not only were their cherished book collections under threat, but the
218

entire profession (and even perhaps their way of life) was at stake as a result of the ‘technology’
generation, the ambiguous group typically spotlighted as digitally literate when I asked about
definitions. Many librarians and patrons alike regarded this same vaguely-defined technology,
especially e-readers and smart phones, as a kind of momentous spectacle. They referred to it as a
causal force with agency and unstoppable momentum, invoking a progress ideology that had
cadences of technological determinism, futurism and globalization all rolled up into one.
Participants were often fearful or mystified, or both.
Clearly the way librarians talked and thought about these kinds of ideas would make for many
opportunities for a very academic-oriented study. Comparing libraries on the basis of those that
challenged or accepted certain discourses would make for a deviant, but likely brilliant, theoretical
sample. What happens when you take all of the libraries who, say, choose to emphasize a
personalized and online experience at (or with) the library and see if their users are reading more?
Would these same libraries manage to persistently help a broad and inclusive arrangement of
patrons, or would it just be those who identify with ‘internet culture’ or other classifications to be
explored?
MODELS FOR LEARNING
A central theme of this dissertation (and the supporting literature review) has been the role of the
library as an alternative education provider. Perhaps the biggest on-going challenge to the
relatively old, but continually radical idea of “Deschooling” society (Illich 1971, Papert 1993) or
other similar fixes to the stagnant public education system is to present realistic and achievable
visions for what modern learning contexts might look like. The library may be a happy medium
for this sort of innovation, for two reasons. First, it is an established institution with a kind of brand
name and value set friendly to investing in literacy and learning. It gives a human face and a
physical space that make new models of ‘DIY learning with the internet’ easier to adopt. 94 Second,
the library itself needs to be subject to much of the same caliber of revision as the public education
system. Innovations in digital literacy curriculum development and the design of information
experiences require risk-taking and experimentation, which can be done with much lower stakes

219

and broader life-long learning opportunities in the library context. Libraries, if nothing else, tend
to be good at studying data to organize and document it, which is a clear and present need for this.
One example might be emphasis on play. Play has long been recognized as an effective method of
real-life modeling and “learning by doing” which is free of the daunting or dramatic effect of tests
or graded materials (Singer et al. 2006). In the revision of Papert’s original Mindstorms (1993) it
was noted that iterative and interactive (constructivist tinkering and play) learning with use of
computers not only impacted cognitive development but also made an affective impression,
ultimately conjuring up motivation where it wasn’t present before. Clearly this was explained in
Gauntlett (2011), and scholars have already begun to investigate the implications for play and
learning specifically in the library setting, where it has grown considerably (Nicholson 2009).
Most of the activities driven by Project Next Generation involved a significant dimension of play,
but many of them went unevaluated. The regular gaming events and activities that occurred at
Aquarin and Plainview were typically recognized in terms of their enrollment and participation
but not their learning outcomes. It is here we find what I believe to be a compelling area for
research. Do gaming and play occur differently in the library setting than they do elsewhere? Might
the intrinsically social and public environment alter its composition or participants? Does the
library’s dedication to archival, multiculturalism or literacy impact which games are made
available and what is expected of them? Are libraries able to act as “readers’ advisory” for games
(an arguably greater source of cultural influence for many youth), or better yet are they able to
promote remixing and creation of games themselves? More radically how can libraries invoke
games and play with services beyond youth? How might “play” be recognized as a principle behind
adult services or in creating systems for information reference? Why has this, as of yet, proved to
be too challenging to be commonplace in Illinois public libraries?
On the other side of the fence in nearly every library I found examples of what was often referred
to as “training” but perhaps should have been conceptualized as learning. Using the reference
frame of digital literacy helped to chase respondents away from credentials associated with certain
abstract sets of knowledge (e.g. engineering, computer science), and instead focused them more
on skills and practices, but only reflected and unearthed their perceptions on processes of learning
in a sort of tertiary way. Information overload was explicitly and implicitly identified as a recurrent
220

challenge, and in most interviews the challenge of librarians themselves needing systems for
absorbing, sharing, managing and generating with information technologies was forefront—many
had the natural tendency to want to achieve a certain level of mastery themselves before desiring
to offer knowledge to the public. The “let’s jump in and go and learn together as we go along” that
matches many participatory cultures on the internet starkly contrasts with the “well-read people
know how to find you all of the answers” context sometimes preferred by librarians. I suspect there
is potential for a great deal of study within just the internal world of the library. “What is the role
of the library in fostering digital literacies?” could be more specifically developed into “How do
structural conditions, cultural forms and individual personalities shape a librarian’s ability to
develop their own digital literacies?” Even in just a single library this would be chock-full of
material, but a comparative setting between widely contrasting libraries could yield data that would
extend and strengthen what was begun in my study.

CONTINUING TO CLOSE GAPS IN DATA
The case studies related many examples of struggles with the growing metric culture surrounding
libraries. As suggested earlier, directors were quick to enumerate the ways funding was tied to
various measurements, which was entirely expected, but a more compelling inquiry lies in
determining how to better address the issue. While airing grievances and formally recognizing
them in research studies such as this might on some level be useful in its contributions to awareness
or of cathartic value to participants it’s not much of a realistic solution. Likewise urging society
(or researchers or librarians) to shuffle away from relying too much on quantitative
comprehensions of the world might fit in stride with trends in postmodernist humanities and social
science of the past decade but it’s not entirely realistic for a civic institution influenced by forces
beyond the public.
A third answer may lie in designing metrics that better address outcomes and impacts, and that
will be actively understood and adopted by municipalities, library boards and directors. In the field
of education this sort of evaluation quandary is dominated by discussion about standards (as are
certain conversations within library and information science, such as standards in data and
collection organization and sharing protocols) and a great deal of resistance has been one of the
results. There are certainly consultants and advocacy groups (like the ALA) that are striving to
221

make for change based on research but, as observed by the relative isolation encountered in so
many locations, their wisdom isn’t always hitting the ground.
From the very onset I felt my study on whether or not the library played a recognizable role in
fostering digital literacies had to be measured, at least in part, by evident impacts on patrons. Most
libraries of course had examples of how they determined they were affecting people, which
generally spoke for themselves, but I wanted to also directly observe what patrons were doing and
saying to get a better handle on this. I took this pursuit with me into an additional case study at a
local library that directly connected to the work exhibited in this dissertation but ultimately chose
not to include it here simply because of issues related to data quality and the fact that the research
subjects were in a setting that was not distinctly underprivileged in terms of the same conditions
like poverty and social exclusion found at other locations.
Next iterations of my scholarship could easily focus on interviewing, observing and examining
works produced by patrons to get an idea of where they stand with (or what they think of) digital
literacies. Ideally, as was painfully learned in my related local case study, this would be done in
connection to existing programs, but in a capacity as a dedicated researcher, not a role as a primary
leader or technical support. It’s hard to walk into a situation knowing a lot about how to make
digital literacy happen and to instead merely study it, warding off frequent requests for help by
community collaborators. Nevertheless, studies of spaces where underserved patrons share it with
those who are more privileged could offer a unique and compelling angle, especially with regards
to solution-focused research like my own.

IN CONCLUSION
I believe the resounding impact of my research is what it reveals about the aspects, process and
importance of public libraries in engaging their communities in a multitude of ways, in order to
foster many kinds of digital literacies. I hope readers will find the case study stories and overall
work to be action-inspiring as well as thought-provoking. For me personally this knowledge has
led me down the path of university public engagement, where the ideas and questions raised by
my scholarship have a daily and identifiable impact. I urge others to find similar modes of utility
for the text, and continue the mission of inquiry with and for communities.

APPENDIX A: INTERVIEW SCHEDULE
This question list varied by interview and changed in response to evolving needs and findings as
research progressed. Questions marked in bold were always asked of at least one librarian at each
location.
[Confirmation of hours, location and service area, data that might be missing from pre-visit
research]
1) I’d like to learn about programs and activities that have happened in the last year in your
library that made use of digital technologies. When I say digital technologies I want to stress
that I’m interested in use of both equipment owned by the library, like the public access computers
or library-loaned cameras, and also personal devices, like mobile phones or laptops that people,
volunteers or librarians might bring in for a program. Follow-ups could include:
•

Can you tell me a little more about that program? What are its goals? What kinds of people
participate (age, interests, not things like names)? Who organizes it?

•

How does this program benefit from use of digital tools?

•

What kinds of problems do programs run into because of their use of digital tools?

•

Optional, if they, or I, get sidetracked: I want to make sure I get a full representation of the
programs in your library that use digital tools. Can you give me a list?

•

How are programs and services like these marketed, documented and evaluated?

•

Why do these programs happen?

Realistically, I’m not expecting a big list from most libraries. In fact some libraries will probably
say something like “nope, we don’t have any programs that use the computers,” which will make
me resort to probes like:
•

What programs, in general, do you do?

•

Are you sure?
o Does someone ever look up information online during programs?
o Do you take pictures of events? Are those ever shared online that you know of?
o Are there any library activities where people make things?

•

Do any programs (or services) take place, in full or in part, online? (homework help?)
242

•

Are there temporal patterns to programs? Afterschool, summer, seasonal jobs, etc…?

•

Are there any programs you’ve heard about that you would like to do?

2) Are there any informal groups or organizations, like say a Boy Scout troop, club, or
visiting class of students that run programs in your library that use digital tools?
•

How did they come to be connected with the library? Why is the relationship in place?

3) Does anyone (staff, volunteers or an external organization) help patrons with the
computers or other digital devices? Are there classes or tutoring?
•

For staff who help with the computers:
o What are the sorts of things people seem to be doing on the computers frequently?
o What kinds of questions/requests do you get the most? Are there any needs for help
that go unfulfilled?

•

Who takes care of the library computers and other digital equipment?

•

Why do you think these things do/don’t happen?

4) [For the library director] How does the library see its mission in relation to digital
communication and media production technologies?
•

How are library digital technology policies determined?

•

What factors influence the decision to acquire more equipment? (space, cost, maintenance,
staff, bandwidth, electrical outlets, adequate already)?

•

Can you think of any big factors that encourage or discourage your library from running
new programs that use digital technologies?

5) What are the restrictions for use of the public internet workstations or loan-equipment?
Possible follow-ups:
•

Time limits?

•

Security on workstations (login, wipe policy, can users save files)? Internet filter or
firewall?

•

Who are the computers available to? Any requirements (age, library card holders)?
Informal contracts with users for use? Do librarians actively encourage use?
243

•

Do you have any rules for people who bring in their own devices or data?

•

For all of the above: Why?

At this point I’ll have heard about a lot of the library’s infrastructure through stories. These
questions may be changed or omitted depending on what I already know.
6) Finally, I wanted to ask just a few short questions about your library’s infrastructure.
•

What kind of internet do you have? (wireless, broadband speed)

•

Are headphones, speakers, a projector or a scanner available for patrons or programs?

•

Any assistive technologies for people with disabilities?

•

For all of the above: Why? What enablers/points of prevention?

APPENDIX B: RURAL AND IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES
IN ILLINOIS
This section is included for transparency reasons and because it might also be helpful for scholars
looking to qualify areas for study as I did.
I was unable to find a single 95 satisfactory measure of rural poverty in Illinois, so instead I have
relied on data and definitions from multiple sources. In a national perspective Illinois is a relatively
rich state, especially compared to the southern US. We only really catch the tip of the Mississippi
River poverty chain, and most of the US Census sanctioned poverty research groups 96 don’t
include Illinois in their focus. Southern Illinois is the site of our worst rural poverty, but it is also
covered in state and national parks, which obscure accurate data analysis. Rural census tracts vary
considerably in size for their populations, and may have very uneven densities throughout.
Collecting accurate data becomes a delicate balance between depth and breadth, as the more
granular the investigation the higher the margin of error (few data points), and larger areas (countylevel, for instance) cause impoverished areas to be blurred out, and, further, they may have multiple
public libraries within their boundaries. Beyond this, definitions of rural vary somewhat even
within the census data, and at the time of the sample selection we were on the cusp of yet another
update to the standards. 97 To compensate for the complexity of what it means to be rural I have
selected census tracts on the basis of a categorization scheme generated by the Rural Health
Research Center 98 at the University of Washington, known as the Rural Urban Commuting Area
(RUCA) codes. These codes, based on Census 2000 data and 2004 ZIP codes, are a way of showing
commuter traffic flows between census zones of metropolitan, micropolitan, small town and rural
status. In other words, the areas with the highest codes, small town and rural, are the ones furthest
away from major populations; they are the people who live furthest from resources and who have
to be the most self-sufficient. I cross referenced the RUCA list with the census tracts with the

95

See http://www.raconline.org/info_guides/ruraldef/ for a fairly comprehensive breakdown. Three government

agencies, the US Census, the Office of Management and Budget and the Economic Research Service of the USDA all
employ differing definitions.

highest ACS 2005-2009 measures of poverty99 (over 20%), food stamps 100 (over 20%) and rates
of unemployment 101 (over 14%) to identify rural areas that are likely to contain underserved
individuals. I then, finally, confirmed areas visually and on the basis of census definitions. 102

99

Percentage of families and people whose income in the past 12 months is below the poverty level, all people; the

ACS 2005-2009 estimate.
100

A measure of income and benefits (in 2009 inflation-adjusted dollars), the total households with Food Stamp/SNAP

benefits in the past 12 months; the ACS 2005-2009 estimate. For reference, the Illinois average is around 8.4%, and
is probably lower in the areas outside of Chicago.
101

Percent unemployed of those in the civilian labor force; the ACS 2005-2009 estimate. For reference, the Illinois

average is around 8%.

definitions of rural applied to Illinois, using the Census 2000 Summary, see http://www.ers.usda.gov/amberwaves/2008-june/defining-the-%E2%80%9Crural%E2%80%9D-in-rural-america.aspx#.VRjvuuGOUZw.

APPENDIX C: A MODEL FOR PROGRAM EVALUATION
The series of sections in the discussion are vague and focused a great deal on scholarly concepts
and literature. Like the ALA report I presented some guidelines, albeit ones backed by the stories
and data in this dissertation, that serve more as ideas to jump off of rather than concrete steps from
which to proceed. I felt an obligation to go further than that. Based on investigations done during
later related research, and on the different programs and methods I heard about during interviews,
I’ve assembled a series of questions a librarian could ask themselves about a given program to
help think about how it might foster digital literacies from the Belshaw (2012) perspective. This
measure is not intended to supplant the ordinary consideration of goals and outcomes, but
supplement them.
1. Which tech skills did patrons practice or develop as part of this program? Think in several
frames: applications (Windows, Internet sites, Photoshop), activities or competencies
(device operation, programming, graphic design, 3D modeling, information seeking), and
disciplinary

concepts

(geometry,

formative

inquiry,

logic,

design,

iterative

experimentation). This will allow you to identify value from a variety or perspectives, and
better present or negotiate its purpose with different parties. It may also help equip you in
considering what skills or areas should be considered prerequisites or next steps. These
abilities should not be limited to cognitive (computational thinking), however, which leads
to the next category.
2. What were the social dimensions of the program? Was there teamwork or collaboration?
Was the communication process about negotiation, persuasion, dialogue, inquiry or other
forms? What social dynamics (groups or identities) did participants bring in to the program,
and how did this impact it? What knowledge and cultural assets did patrons have? How did
participants focus their inquiry? For instance, were there questions that went beyond “how
do I do ____” and expanded into those related to control, power and assumptions? If so
then this might be a dimension of critical pedagogy. See this as a chance to think about this
program in terms of its meaning to participants, and its meaning more generally in your
community or our society.
3. What individual perspectives or behaviors did patrons display? Were they persistent,
focused, patient, fearful or curious? Give examples. How might this relate to motivation?
247

What seemed to determine confidence? How were ideas shared, remixed and given
attribution? The way participants interact with one another and reflect emotions may play
a key part in impacting how they learn and what they get out of activities. We often focus
a lot on digital literacies just within the realm of ‘what users are doing on the screen when
we should be thinking about their whole process of interacting with the devices and people
involved.
4. What are your measurable outcomes? How many attended and did you take pictures?
What did patrons design or create? Is there multimedia or expression that can be shared or
compared? Did they come in asking different questions than they left asking? Did they
have a next project or next step in mind? Are they able to learn on their own or teach others?
How do you know? Does this program contribute to civic participation or social good? Do
patrons know that? If it’s not the first program in a series, have patrons begun to change
the questions they’re asking?
Clearly this is a whole lot to consider for a given program or event. What I’d suggest, is to pick
just a single category or one or two questions from each and use those to create a preliminary
metric. The choice of questions and evaluative focus will certainly be determined by the goals and
agendas of the library, but also will certainly be influenced by what fits the event, instructor and
participants. Start by trying to fill it out yourself and then think about ways to build it into data
collection, like observations, surveys, computer log analysis or casual exit interviews. Make sure
patrons are aware of your evaluation efforts and invite them to include their voice if they feel it
should be. Most important: collect feedback in stages and regularly, so you can learn to do it better
over time.
