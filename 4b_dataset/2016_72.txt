CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
Introduction to the Problem
Academic librarians are increasingly called upon to create information literacy (IL) objects
for online learning, thus it is important that they use effective instructional design principles to
guide them in their efforts to maximize the learning experiences of the users of these IL objects.
Using instructional design (ID) principles as regular practice by academic librarians is an emerging
issue in the creation of objects used for online literacy instruction; however, there is insufficient
preparation of librarians for this instructional task. A large number of academic librarians are
responsible for instruction but most have only a limited knowledge of pedagogical theory and
instructional design. The use of instructional design principles can help bridge that gap (Davis,
2013).
A small field of literature is available which addresses the use of ID principles by academic
librarians when designing online information literacy objects. Most of this small body of literature
erroneously uses ADDIE as a design model. In the field of instructional design ADDIE is
considered a framework (Bichelmyer, 2005). The mnemonic ADDIE is used to identify early
instructional design procedures and emphasizes the five core elements of the ID process: analyze,
design, develop, implement, and evaluate (Richey, Klein, and Tracey, 2011). While some of the
body of literature addresses the importance of using an instructional design (ID) model when
creating instruction, little research has been conducted in the field of academic librarianship which
examines the best practices or strategies for creating IL objects.
The dearth of training of academic librarians in online learning and the lack of an
instructional design model to guide the creation of IL objects begs for research which will help
identify best practices for these purposes. Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction will introduce

2

instructional design principles and Bonk and Zhang’s R2D2 framework, which organizes online
instruction by four identified phases of learning activities and considers learner needs and
preferences will provide the tools necessary for academic librarians to create IL objects. This
design-based research study will explore the tools and activities available in the Web of Learning
which can be a guide for academic librarians to create IL objects for online instruction. The study
will endeavor to discover recommendations for best practices and future implementation and
incorporation by academic librarians of Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction and R2D2.
Statement of the Problem
Academic librarians are increasingly called upon to create objects for IL instruction which
will be used for online learning. Since few academic librarians have had formal training in either
face-to-face or online instruction, it is imperative that design principles are identified which will
be most effective when creating IL objects for use in online instruction. This study will explore
the use of Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction and the R2D2 framework by academic librarians
when creating objects for online instruction in information literacy.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this design-based research study was to explore the role of instructional
design principles using Merrill’s First Principles and R2D2 to increase academic librarians’
awareness of said design principles and learner preferences when creating IL objects. The
framework of the study is Bonk and Zhang’s Read, Reflect, Display, Do Model (R2D2) which
“integrates various learning activities with appropriate technologies for effective online learning
for a diverse array of e-learners (Bonk & Zhang, 2006, p. 249).
Research Questions
For the purpose of this study, the following questions will be addressed:

3

1.

Does the use of Merrill’s First Principles facilitate the design of information literacy
objects for online instruction? If so, how?

2. Does the use of R2D2 facilitate the design of information literacy objects for online
instruction? If so, how?
3. Does consideration of learner preferences facilitate the design of information literacy
objects for online instruction? If so, how?
4. How does the IL Object Design Guide facilitate the design of information literacy
objects for online instruction?
Definition of Key Terms
For the purpose of this research study, the following definitions will be used:
1. academic library and academic librarian- libraries affiliated with institutions of higher
learning such as community college, undergraduate and graduate schools and the librarians
who work at those libraries.
2. design-based research- “combines research, design , and practice into one process,
resulting in usable products that supported by a theoretical framework” (Bowler & Large,
2008, p. 39).
3. information literacy- “Information literacy is the set of integrated abilities encompassing
the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced
and valued, and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating
ethically

in

communities

of

http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework

learning”

retrieved

4. instructional design- “the science and art of creating detailed specification for the
development, evaluation, and maintenance of situations which facilitate learning and
performance” (Richey et al. p. 3).
5. learner preferences- in this particular study the term refers to the learning activities
preferred by learners in the four phases of R2D2.
6. learner needs- in this particular study the term refers to the diversity of online learners and
encompasses age, comfort and experience with digital tools, prior learning, gender, race,
socioeconomic status and the individual needs created by this diversity of learners.
7. learning object- “small instructional components that can be reused a number of times in
different learning contexts” (Wiley, 2000, p. 144). “...quick items of instruction or
information...designed to support the learning objectives of the course or training module
and at times become the primary means of delivering the lesson. The whole premise of a
learning object is developed around four basic goals; reusability, interoperability,
durability, and accessibility” (Keown, R., 2007, p.75).
8. Read Reflect Display Do (R2D2)-“a practical model, or framework, not an instructional
design model…to help online instructors integrate various learning activities with
appropriate technologies for effective online learning for a diverse array of e-learners”
(Bonk & Zhang, 2008, p. 4)
9. Web of Learning- “learning related uses of online resources and technologies” (Bonk and
Zhang, 2008, p.v).“a plethora of educationally relevant and continually evolving resources,
tools, and learning materials, a focus on what is available online” (Bonk & Zhang, 2008,
p.1).

Theoretical Framework
This study was informed by the research and theory of the field of instructional design,
especially Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction. Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction, which
were identified after an exhaustive review of instructional design theories, are prescriptive design
principles common across different instructional design theories and models. Merrill’s First
Principles of Instruction are:
1. Learning is promoted when learners are engaged in solving real-world problems.
2. Learning is promoted when existing knowledge is activated as a foundation for new
knowledge.
3. Learning is promoted when new knowledge is demonstrated to the learner.
4. Learning is promoted when new knowledge is applied by the learner.
5. Learning is promoted when new knowledge is integrated into the learner’s world.
(Merrill, 2002, p.43)
The interrelation of Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction is a four-phase cycle
consisting of activation, demonstration, application, and integration. For instruction to be effective
it should include each of these activities which can be repeated as necessary (Merrill, 2002).
Awareness of the cyclical nature of these principles will be fostered for the academic librarians
through the iterative nature of design-based research using the framework of R2D2 to guide the
creation of IL objects for online instruction. Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction were chosen
as the instructional design cornerstone to guide this research because they are commonly
prescribed in instructional design theories and models, are intentionally general and have
innumerable variations (Merrill, 2002). This generality allows the principles to be applied in
diverse instructional settings and using diverse instructional products; hence, it will be highly

6

relevant for academic librarians applying design principles and using R2D2 as a framework to
create IL objects for online instruction.
Bonk and Zhang’s R2D2 model is not an instructional model. It is a framework or lens
which provides instructors a focus while using Web of Learning activities. Addressing learner
preferences using the infinite resources and activities available within the Web of Learning
empowers students to achieve their goals. R2D2 proposes an integration of four types of learning
activities: (a) Reading/Listening; (b) Reflecting/Writing; (c) Displaying: and (d) Doing (Bonk and
Zhang, 2008). Each of these four types of learning activities is aligned to a specific type of learner
preference. Read is for auditory and verbal learners who prefer words, spoken or written
explanations. Reflect is for reflective and observational learners, who prefer to reflect, observe,
view, and watch learning: they make careful judgments and view things from different
perspectives. Display is for visual learners who prefer diagrams, flowcharts, timelines, pictures,
films, and demonstrations. Do is for tactile and kinesthetic learners who prefer learning by active
doing, experiencing, hands-on and often also group work (Bonk and Zhang, 2008).
Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction will serve as the instructional design lens through
which this design-based research will be conducted. Bonk and Zhang’s R2D2 will serve as the
framework to guide the creation of IL objects for online instruction which address learner
preferences and harness the vast resources available on the web of learning to empower learners.
Rationale and Significance of Study
The figure below represents the separate fields of instructional design and academic
librarianship and the common elements which serve as a bridge between. This study will serve to
highlight these common elements to academic librarians resulting in greater incorporation of

7

instructional design principles and R2D2 framework by academic librarians when creating IL
objects for online instruction.

Figure 1. Instructional design and academic librarian commonalities

Limitations
Limitations of this study might be the lack of a sufficient number of librarians with the
time and/or willingness to participate in study. The librarians may not understand the principles of
instructional design, may not see the need to use a framework which incorporates learner
preferences when creating IL objects for use in online learning, or may believe the solution rests
not in a revised IL object, but rather with revised learning habits by the user. Another limitation of
the study is the short life span of IL objects because of the rapidly changing nature of the web of
learning and factors such as platform host, compatibility conflicts, and device neutral design
considerations.
Summary
Academic librarians are increasingly called upon to create information literacy objects to
be used in online learning for an ever diverse student population. Academic librarians have had
little training for instruction, especially in online learning, so a clear need exists for guidance in

8

this task. Utilizing instructional design principles could help guide them to more effectively create
IL objects. Using Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction to inform the use of R2D2 as a
framework, the knowledge of instructional design principles and adoption of practices of academic
librarians will increase as they become more aware of instructional design principles while
simultaneously practicing them when using R2D2 in their creation of IL objects.

CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW
Introduction
This review of literature will look at the practices of academic librarians at libraries of
institutions of higher learning such as community colleges and universities. The topics of this
literature review include the need for the creation of learning objects for online information literacy
instruction; academic librarians’ preparation for instructional activities or lack thereof; learner
differences and preferences and why they must be addressed in the creation of IL objects; and the
importance of using instructional design models for the creation of online IL objects.
Need for IL objects in online learning
Online learning is now a ubiquitous element of post-secondary education. In 2013 there
were 6.7 million students taking at least one online course in the United States (Allen & Seaman,
2013). Regardless of the type of program or institution in which a student is enrolled- distance,
blended or face-to face learning-most students experience an element of online learning as part of
their post-secondary education. The use of course management systems and online access to
university supports and programs such as academic libraries is predominantly the norm. This
makes virtually all students online learners at some point in their education regardless of the type
of learning program in which they are enrolled.
As early as 2004 it was recognized that remote access to library resources was becoming a
significant issue for academic libraries for two main reasons-the expansion of online learning and
increasing expectations of students to be able to access library resources electronically (Tobin,
2004). Indeed, Su and Kuo (2010) further emphasize the need for online learning because of
shrinking resources and flourishing distance learning which can provide a cost-effective solution
for the diverse information literacy needs of college students. Diverse information literacy needs

10

of students vary depending on factors such as familiarity with their institution of higher learning,
previous experiences with digital media and their comfort with online learning (Kumar, Ochoa, &
Edwards, 2012).
Information literacy is more than just digital access to library holdings. The Association of
College and Research Libraries defines it as: “Information literacy is the set of integrated abilities
encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how information is
produced and valued, and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating
ethically

in

communities

of

learning.”

Students need to be instructed in information literacy and the vehicle for that process in
online learning is termed an information literacy (IL) object by academic librarians. These IL
objects, created by librarians, are reusable, digital, and often web based instructional resources
used to deliver instruction. (Mestre et al, 2011). IL objects have many purposes some of which are
to provide instruction, measure prior knowledge, individualize learning, provide practice of skills
and ultimately stretch thinned financial and human resources (Mardis & Ury, 2008).
Increasingly, students are confident in their ability to use technology, but often use only
internet search engines for scholarly research. They lack the literacy skills necessary to evaluate
the information found online. This has been referred to as the “Google effect” (Brabazon, 2006).
This “effect” often results in the students using the first few “hits” of an Internet search with no
differentiation between fact, opinion and scholarly research (Frand, 2001). This documented habit
further emphasizes the need for information literacy instruction which is increasingly
accomplished through IL objects.

11

Despite a student’s high confidence level with technology, IL objects are necessary
because of the intricacies of using library resources such as electronic databases, Boolean search
terms, etc. Good information literacy instruction also encompasses evaluating resources,
plagiarism, style manuals, Libguides, etc. IL objects can be created which help students learn better
and maximize their academic experience. Good IL objects will help students succeed academically
and incorporate the traits of lifelong learners. Examples of IL objects include, but are not limited
to podcasts, tutorials, blogs, surveys, quizzes, and screencasts. In 2015, aware of the research
habits of younger students and their changing role and responsibility in creating new knowledge,
the Association of College and Research Libraries issued a new Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education consisting of six information literacy concepts. The six concepts
which anchor the Framework are:
1. Authority Is Constructed and Contextual
2. Information Creation as a Process
3. Information Has Value
4. Research as Inquiry
5. Scholarship as Conversation
6.

Searching

as

Exploration

Simply being aware of the Framework for Information Literacy or providing online access
to library resources is not enough to make students information literate and lifelong learners.
Students must be instructed in information literacy using the resources of the web of learning so
they are able to fully utilize the library resources thus maximizing their academic success and
ability to continue to learn throughout life. By developing learning objects which incorporate web

12

of learning tools librarians actively engage students using learning activities which guide the
students to mastery of information skills (Mestre, 2011). However, creating IL objects for online
learning is not enough to guarantee information literate students. To be truly effective, academic
librarians must create IL objects for online use which not only provide introduction to and practice
of information skills but are reflective of learner differences and preferences.
Learner differences and preferences
Students at post-secondary academic institutions are quite diverse and this diversity is
reflected in their learner preferences. The typical undergraduate student who attends university
soon after graduating from high school is very different from an older student who is either
attending university for the first time or who perhaps left academia a number of years ago and is
returning for further training for workplace advancement or a career change. A student’s
information literacy needs are a result of several influences such as familiarity with the educational
institution, prior experience with digital resources and comfort with online learning (Kumar,
Ochoa, & Edwards, 2012).
Regardless of their comfort level and experience with online learning, students have a
variety of learner preferences. Some learner preferences are generational and all reflect the
learner’s previous knowledge and experience in addition to the diversity of demographics in
gender, race and socioeconomic status. Educators who are aware of learner preferences have the
ability to be flexible in the choices they make when creating IL objects. (Mestre, 2010).This
flexibility answers the learning needs presented by various learner preferences.
Younger students who have recently graduated from high school are often referred to as
digital natives, or depending upon their age, Generations X and Y and Millennials. The term digital
natives refers those who have been born in the digital age, which began in the late 70’s, and was

13

followed by the exponential growth of information with the advent of the internet in the 90’s. They
are for the most part immersed in digital activities in their daily lives socially, for communications,
for music and for education (Ng, 2012). Such students have grown up with digital devices and use
them more intuitively than previous generations. They are usually more comfortable with using
the web of learning and most likely have already done so in educational settings.
Returning students and older students from generations before the digital natives have
different experiences with technology than their younger classmates. While they have more life
experiences and prior knowledge to draw upon, their confidence and experience with using the
web of learning is usually less than that of digital natives. Adult learning, andragogy, is also
different than the pedagogy of child learning. Adults learn better when previous experiences are
relevant for new learning, when they can use internal motivation to learn and when instruction
includes active learning (Stern, C. & Kaur, T., 2010). Even when these older students do consider
themselves technologically savvy, they often lack the information literacy skills and experience
with scholarly databases to access or critically analyze their search results (Kumar, Ochoa, &
Edwards, 2012).
Understanding the diversity of student learning preferences is an advantage for academic
librarians and will aid them when creating IL objects. Considering learner preferences helps
librarians create pedagogically sound IL objects (Mestre, 2010). The advantage for academic
librarians to understanding student learning preferences lies in their ability to help students find
information and interact with and process that information. An awareness of learning preferences
presents flexibility for librarians when creating IL objects (Mestre, 2010). The multitude of web
of learning tools and instructional approaches when creating IL objects increases the opportunities
to reach students with a variety of learner preferences (Nicholson & Eva, 2011). Luo (2010)

emphasized, after studying integration of Web 2.0 technology in information literacy instruction,
that librarians who developed a keen sense of students’ needs were better equipped to choose the
best web of learning tools when creating IL objects.
Befus and Byrne’s (2011) study Redesigned With Them in Mind: Evaluating an Online
Library Information Literacy Tutorial IL further highlights the need for awareness of learner needs
and preferences when designing IL objects. The results of the redesign of WSU’s IL tutorial,
known as Searchpath were disappointing based on assessment of student learning, satisfaction and
confidence indicators. Explicitly, the study’s conclusion is that there needs to be additional
research into how IL objects can be refined so they have a more effective learning rate among the
end users. Implicitly, the study supports the notion that even the most smartly and extensively
designed IL object cannot be made suitable for all. The study highlights the diverse range of the
learning preferences of the student population and makes clear the need for some customization.
Indeed, the cumulative message from this study, if not of most of the literature on this subject is
that, when it comes to IL objects, one size does not and cannot fit all. The results of the Befus and
Byrne’s study explicitly and implicitly support the need for further research on effective methods
of creating IL objects, especially using methods which consider leaner preferences as R2D2 does.
Mestre’s 2010 survey of academic librarians further supports the need for a greater
awareness of learner types and preferences when creating IL objects, “Only 6% of the respondents
indicated that they develop their learning objects to accommodate all modalities of learning” (p.
820). In the same survey respondents reported choosing tools to create IL objects based on personal
learning style, ease of usage or availability. These practices and attitudes demonstrate a need for
a framework to guide academic librarians when creating IL objects for online use which
incorporate activities that appeal to and challenge the four type of learners identified by Bonk and

15

Zhang. Successfully creating IL objects tailored to various learner preferences promotes better
information literacy skills (Rapchak & Behary, 2013).
Academic librarians’ preparation for instruction and creation of IL objects for online
learning
Academic librarians are increasingly called upon to create IL objects for online use for
students in programs which are distance, blended or face-to-face. As such, librarians are often the
only instructors for students in information literacy and thus it is significant that they have both
the training and the tools for success (Mestre, 2010). However, few librarians have training in any
type of instruction, let alone in online learning. In a recent study by the Online Learning Research
Committee of the Educational and Social Sciences section of American College and Research
Libraries only 28% of 92 librarians surveyed had previous coursework or a degree related to
teaching. (Mestre et al., 2011). Mestre et al.(2005) also reported the librarians have minimal formal
training or for creating IL objects. As a result of this dearth in preparation for instruction, academic
librarians lack the skills and background in instructional design to effectively use the web of
learning to successfully create online literacy objects which will both maximize student academic
success and create lifelong learners. To best achieve integration of good IL skills in students
incorporate sound principles instruction and educational theory, design and practice (Johnson,
2006).
Online teaching and learning is very different from a face-to-face instruction encounter.
Online learning differs in many ways from face-to-face instruction because of the plethora of tools
and activities which are available for use in the web of learning. Using principles of instructional
design models greatly improve the effectiveness of IL objects for online use by students which
will have the result of better overall student success and achievement. Design principles consist

16

of more than simply transferring face-to-face instruction to an online platform (Mestre et al., 2011).
In an Education and Behavioral Sciences Section’s Online Learning Research Committee survey,
“respondents indicated a need to learn how to work with tools to effectively engage learners and
promote learning” (Mestre et al., 2011, p. 237). This study has brought to the forefront the need
for training of academic librarians in best practices and sound design principles for creating IL
objects for online instruction. The authors of this study concluded that IL objects which are created
using pedagogically sound design principles afford students a variety of ways to learn. This
conclusion reinforces the need for both training of academic librarians in creating IL objects and
the use of sound design principles in that creation.
Shank and Dewald (2012) found in their survey of academic library administrators’
perceptions of four instructional skills that the responsibilities of librarians have grown markedly
because of evolving instructional technologies and the expansion of information literacy.
However, in that same study, academic library administrators ranked instructional design skills the
lowest importance as a knowledge domain in Future Newly Created and/or Redefined Positions in
their libraries. Starting at the administrative level, neither the instructional design skills nor the
training to use the educational technologies required for creating IL objects for online instruction
is valued or encouraged. This serves as further evidence that training of academic librarians to
create IL objects is a pressing need.
Use of design principles by academic librarians in creation of IL objects for online learning
The use of instructional design models by academic librarians for the creation of IL objects
is limited based on recent reviews of current literature. IL objects lack goals and ignore learner
preferences when instructional design principles are not used. Using instructional design principles
ensures IL objects have clear instructional goals and learner preferences are considered which

17

results in more active engagement by students (Davis, 2013). As Davis suggests above, there is
growing awareness of the advantages of using instructional design principles when creating IL
objects; however there exists scant literature or research that examines or supports this practice.
ADDIE, which is considered only a framework, not a model, by the instructional design field, is
most often referenced in literature pertaining to design and IL object creation (Koneru, 2010;
Davis, 2013; Farmer, 2011).
Recent articles on information literacy in academic libraries examine Web 2.0 technologies
and the web of learning but do not examine what, if any, instructional design principles were used
by the academic librarians who used the Web 2.0 technologies and web of learning in the creation
of IL objects. (Hew & Cheung, 2012; Magnuson, 2013; Su & Kuo, 2010; Luo, 2010). Both Su and
Kuo (2010) and Luo (2010) studied Web 2.0 technology integration and found advantages to using
the web of learning for information literacy instruction.

Yet neither addresses the use of

instructional design practices to effectively implement Web 2.0 tools which are part of the web of
learning. These studies are evidence of a growing number of academic librarians who are using
the web of learning to create IL objects, but they are doing so without an instructional design model
or framework to guide them in their decision making and creation.
Magnuson’s 2013 study titled “Web 2.0 and Information Literacy Instruction: Aligning
Technology with ACRL Standards” serves as an example of the above mentioned deficiency in
much of the creation of IL objects-a lack of instructional design principles when creating IL objects
for instruction. Although the author examined potential use of Web 2.0 technologies for
information literacy instruction, the term Web 2.0 technologies is somewhat misleading in its
scope. The study was limited to four tools within a course management system and did not examine
any elements of instructional design principles. The study concluded that choosing proper Web

18

2.0 tools is important when creating IL objects but provides no instructional design principles. The
advantage of R2D2 is that it provides a framework for academic librarians when creating IL objects
using these and other tools from the web of learning while providing options which are sensitive
to learner preferences.
Recently, a model for embedded information literacy instruction was proposed which has
some applications for academic librarians when creating IL objects. Mullins (2014) IDEA Model
was designed for embedding information literacy instruction into academic courses and was
specifically intended for use at the author’s university. Although the author considers limitations
of the model are that it was beyond the scope of individual IL objects and it did not focus on a
particular delivery method, her conclusions support the need for the use of design principles by
academic librarians when creating both embedded instruction in information literacy and IL
objects (Mullins, 2014).
Many of the above mentioned design models have limited application and are effective for
creating basic IL objects using only screen casting tools such as Camtasia. However, there are
many other methods of instruction and tools which can be incorporated in IL objects. Bonk and
Zhang’s R2D2 is well-suited for the creation of IL objects because of the unique and useful way
it provides a framework for instruction. Bonk and Zhang’s R2D2 is a framework using design
principles which by addressing learner needs and preferences students are better able to express
themselves in different ways and for different types of learning.
In summary, academic librarians at institutions of higher learning are being called upon to
create IL objects for distance learning. They often have received little or no training in instructional
design principles or online learning so there is a great need for guidance to increase their awareness
of and use of instructional design practices to produce high quality IL objects. The students using

19

these IL objects have diverse learning needs and preferences, which need to be addressed when
academic librarians are creating the IL objects.

20

CHAPTER 3 METHODOLOGY
Introduction
The purpose of this design-based research study was to examine the use of instructional
design principles by academic librarians using Merrill’s First Principles and Bonk and Zhang’s
R2D2 (2008) as a framework to develop IL objects for online learning. The goal of this designbased research study was to promote greater awareness of instructional design principles and the
benefits of using the framework of R2D2 which is cognizant of learner preferences. The use of an
iterative approach to design, implementation and evaluation will result in increased awareness of
academic librarians of instructional design principles, the usefulness of R2D2 and the importance
of considering learner preferences to create better IL objects.
The following sections provide a description of the study’s research methodology and
details of: (a) rationale for designed-based research, (b) setting and participants, (c) research design
and (d) data collection method. Before proceeding with this study, I obtained permission from
Wayne State University’s Internal Review Board and met any additional requirements needed to
conduct my research.
Rationale for Design-Based Research
The research design for this study was design-based research. Design-based research was
chosen because of its distinct characteristics, most notably collaboration between the researcher
and practitioners in the field to achieve research goals that adequately address the complex nature
of the problems presented. This collaboration between researcher and practitioner extends to not
only the understanding of the problem but also to the design, development, implementation and
evaluation of the results of the research. (Barab & Squire, 2004).

21

Bowler and Large (2008) recommend design-based research as a method of study for
researchers and professionals in library and information science. There are three reasons for this
recommendation. The first reason is a growing awareness among professionals of the role social
and cultural contexts play to influence the information literacy behavior of users. The second
reason is a shift in the field to designing information services and products which are user-centered.
The third reason the authors recommend design-based research for use by professionals in library
and information science is the increasing interest of librarians in practices which are evidence
based and supported by scholarly research.
The clear lack of the use of design principles by academic librarians when creating IL
objects and the dearth of applicable theoretical frameworks for practice was another indication that
design-based research was appropriate for this study (Wang & Hannafin, 2005). The two fold need
of academic librarians for both an increased awareness of instructional design principles (theory)
and their application (practice) in creating IL objects created the perfect synergy for using designbased research in this study. With design-based research, simultaneous refinements of both theory
and practice occurred through the iterations and subsequently refined applications so that new
theory and educational practices emerged reciprocally (Bell et al, 2004). Introducing academic
librarians to Merrill’s First Principles and R2D2 through design-based research further
demonstrated the advantages of using instructional design principles in tandem with the practical
advantages provided by R2D2 to create IL objects. In design-based research the theory and practice
are iterative, participative and situated thus, the design and research activities cannot be conducted
separately (Wang & Hannafin, 2005).

Setting and Participants
This design-based research study was conducted with librarians from two academic
libraries of an urban university located in a large city in the Midwest. Wayne State University is
the third largest university in the state of Michigan, with an enrollment of over 27,000. Located in
the heart of the museum and cultural center in Midtown Detroit, WSU is Michigan’s only research
intensive urban university. At Wayne State, 89 percent of undergraduate students come from the
Metropolitan Detroit area. However, WSU is the most diverse university in Michigan, with
students representing 49 U.S. states and more than 60 countries. More than 46 percent of WSU’s
student population is minority. The university is divided into 13 distinct colleges and schools,
offering more than 400 academic programs including the College of Education, School of Business
Administration, College of Engineering, a Medical School and Law School. Degrees are awarded
at the bachelor, master, and doctoral levels (“About WSU, Fact Book 2015”, n.d.). There are eight
libraries at WSU. These libraries are an undergraduate library, a graduate library, a law library, a
medical library, a science and engineering library, a business library and two extension campus
libraries. The libraries at WSU serve both undergraduate and graduate students. They have a digital

23

collection of resources and rich archives which can be accessed online. Participants in the study
are librarians at the Purdy-Kresge and Undergraduate academic libraries located at Wayne State
University. These librarians create IL objects for online learning for students which are accessed
through the library’s internet portal. My sample size of six librarians was determined by the
number of academic librarians who agreed to participate in the research project.
Data Collection Methods
The research process consisted of four iterative cycles of an intervention in the form of an
IL Object Design Guide designed collaboratively by the researcher and librarians. The
interventions were guided by Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction and incorporated learning
activities suggested by R2D2 to create new IL objects. The IL objects which were created by the
academic librarians reflected greater awareness of Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction, the
plethora of tools available on the web of learning and the learner preferences emphasized in
R2D2’s four phases. Data collection consisted of a literature review of previous literature on the
subject, artifact analysis, semi-structured interviews, and reflective journal keeping.
Data Sources
This study collected qualitative data which provided insight to and rich descriptions of the
design process of academic librarians when creating IL objects. The librarians used Merrill’s First
Principles of Instruction and Bonk and Zhang’s R2D2 to guide their creation of IL objects which
were reflective of their greater awareness of instructional design principles and learner preferences.
There were four main sources of data used in this study. The first main data source was previous
literature on the use of design models and principles by academic librarians when creating IL
objects for online learning. The second main data source was an analysis of IL objects conducted
collaboratively with the academic librarians. The third data source was semi-structured interviews

24

with the academic librarians who were creating IL objects at academic libraries. The fourth main
data source was the researcher’s reflective journal.
Literature Review
The literature review was used to prepare the researcher for the collaborative nature of the
study. Because the researcher was also a participant in the study and was working with the
librarians to create both an IL object and a guide for future use when doing so, it was imperative
that the researcher was well-versed in the major facets of the study. The literature review
acquainted the researcher with R2D2 and with Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction. It explored
how R2D2 had evolved and how it had been validated in other studies. The literature review
explored Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction and how it had been used to guide instructional
design. That information was used to design the first iteration of the study with the academic
librarians and to devise a guide which incorporated Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction and
R2D2 for future use by academic librarians when creating IL objects.
IL Object Analysis
IL object analysis was conducted by the researcher and the librarian participants using a
series of questions. Those questions were used to determine to what extent the academic librarian
used Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction and the framework of R2D2 when creating an IL
object. The IL object analysis also examined the extent to which learner preferences were
considered in the creation process of the IL object by the academic librarian and which Web of
Learning activities were chosen as well as the justifications for those choices. (Appendix B).

25

Semi-Structured Interviews
Semi-structured interviews were conducted by the researcher before and after the
collaborative creative process between the academic librarian and researcher. The initial semistructured interview provided insight in to the professional education of the librarians, their
previous awareness of instructional design principles, their previous experience creating IL
objects, their initial approaches to creating IL objects and their overall thoughts on IL objects. The
concluding semi-structured interview provided insight to the librarians’ experiences using “the
Guide” to create IL objects including its usefulness, suggestions for its improvements, the use of
Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction and R2D2 during the creation of IL objects, and the
librarians’ increased awareness of instructional design principles and learners preferences when
creating IL objects.
Researcher Journal
The researcher kept a journal to use as a reflective tool, as an organizer of information and
as a record of the progression of the study. The researcher made ongoing entries into the journal
after meeting with the librarians for each iterative cycle. The journal aided in identifying any
barriers or challenges that occurred during the research process. Journaling also helped to recount
in detail the process of the study and what did and what did not work. Throughout the study the
entries helped the researcher reflect and analyze various situations to generate ideas or to make
additional improvements throughout the design study. By maintaining these notes, the researcher
was able to reflect on initial thoughts, allowing for comparisons and connections to be documented
to generate further ideas and revisions throughout the research design.

26

Data Collection and Analysis
Data Collection Procedures
The iterative nature of DBR is one of its distinctive characteristics. As such, there were
four phases in which data was collected. These phases and the specifics of the data collection will
be detailed in the following paragraphs. The research study consisted of iterative cycles of an
intervention designed collaboratively by the researcher and librarian. Initial field work and
preparation was followed by three iterative design phases with recommendations for future
strategies for successful creation of IL objects.
Phase 1
Phase 1 consisted of an initial orientation of the researcher to the problem. The initial
orientation consisted of a literature review, a field investigation identifying possible academic
libraries and librarians and the mailing of invitations to participate in the study to various librarians
identified in the field investigation (Appendix A).
After determining a participating academic librarian, Phase 1 drew upon the collaborative
nature of DBR with the researcher and principal collaborator meeting to discuss the research
process. The researcher made notes in her researcher’s journal. After the introductory meeting the
researcher created the first iteration of the Guide and met again with the principal collaborator to
discuss it. At this meeting the researcher introduced the librarian to the instructional design
theories of Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction and R2D2 using the Guide. The researcher
conducted a semi-structured interview to gain a better understanding of the librarian’s background
and previous training which the academic librarian brought to the study. The purpose of this
interview was to determine the education, experience and the comfort level with technology and

27

web of learning tools of the participant (Appendix C). Understanding of this information enhanced
the prospects for effective collaboration between the researcher and the participants.
After the semi-structured interview the researcher and collaborating librarian examined the
librarian’s existing IL objects by using the IL Object Analysis (Appendix E) tool. The purpose of
the analysis was to identify the topic of the IL object, utilization of Merrill’s First Principles of
Instruction, the phase of R2D2 the object addressed and the Web of Learning activity used. It
served to introduce the librarians to Merrill’s First Principles and R2D2 using the tangible
examples found in the IL object. These meetings were approximately one hour long.
At the conclusion of that meeting, the researcher used the information gathered from the
interview to prepare a guide for librarians to use when creating IL objects. The creation of the
Guide was the centerpiece of Phase 1. The Guide was used to introduce academic librarians to
instructional design principles using Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction and R2D2 and served
as a framework when using Web of Learning tools to create IL objects.
Following the creation of the Guide by the researcher, the researcher and librarian met a
second time for approximately one hour to discuss the Guide which was to be used in future
iterations by librarians to create IL objects. The researcher and the principal collaborating librarian
worked collaboratively to determine potential recommendations for improvements to the Guide
for the next iteration of the study. The researcher transcribed the interview and sent it to the
principal collaborator for verification. After receiving verification of the transcript the researcher
coded the transcript and the researcher’s journal. The researcher modified the Guide using the
feedback from the principal collaborating librarian and the researcher’s reflective journal in
preparation for the next iteration of the study.

28

Phase 2
The second iteration of the study commenced with introductory letters to a

group of

academic librarians suggested by the principal collaborating librarian based on her knowledge of
her colleagues and their previous openness to collaborate with others. The letter introduced the
researcher and the study and requested their participation in the study. Eight letters requesting
participation in the study were sent to librarians at two of the libraries in the Wayne State
University system-Purdy Kresge Library and the Undergraduate Library. Two recipients of the
letter declined to participate, one never responded and five responded positively indicating their
willingness to participate in the study.
After the participants were identified, the researcher scheduled the first collaborative
meeting with each of them. The purpose of the meeting was to introduce the researcher and the
research topic to the librarians, conduct the pre-intervention semi-structured interview, introduce
the librarians to instructional design principles using Merrill’s First Principles and R2D2 by
examining the Guide and finally to use the Guide to analyze an IL object which the librarian had
already created. These meetings were about an hour in length with each of the five participating
librarians and consisted of the same format each time. At the conclusion of each of these meetings
the researcher made changes to the Guide based on recommendations and observations gleaned
from careful analysis of the interview transcripts and her own researcher’s journal before the
following collaborative meeting.
At the beginning of her first meeting with each of the collaborating librarians, the
researcher first conducted a semi-structured interview (Appendix D).

The purpose of this

interview was to determine the education, experience and the comfort level of the librarian with
technology and web of learning tools as well as to gain a better understanding of the education,

29

background and previous training the academic librarians brought to the study. Awareness of this
information was meant to enhance the prospects for effective collaboration between the researcher
and the participants.
Following the semi-structured interview, the researcher used the Guide to introduce
Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction and R2D2 to the librarian. To introduce the Guide to the
librarians the researcher read through it aloud stopping for discussions and questions from the
librarian. Next, the researcher and librarian used the IL Object Analysis tool (Appendix C) to
collaboratively examine a pre-existing IL object created by the librarian. At the conclusion of their
first meeting the researcher tasked the librarian with creating an IL object using the Guide.
Following the meeting, the researcher made entries in the researcher’s reflective journal recording
reflections of the meeting and transcribed the interview. The individual transcription was sent to
each of the librarians for verification. After receiving verification from the librarians the researcher
coded each interview and reflective journal entry. It was at this point that the researcher made
modifications to the Guide based on careful analysis of the data collected during the most recent
collaboration and in preparation for the next collaborative meeting This process was followed for
each of the five meetings which were part of phase two.
Phase 3
Phase Three consisted of meeting again with each collaborating librarian to conduct a postintervention interview and to examine the IL object the librarians created with the Guide using the
IL Object Analysis tool. The purpose of this second meeting was to gather the librarians’
reflections and experiences after using the Guide to create an IL object. The researcher hoped to
ascertain to what extent they had incorporated Merrill’s First Principles, R2D2, and learners
preferences and to gather further observations on the Guide which would enhance its usability for

30

future librarians when creating IL objects. This process was followed for each of the five meetings
which were part of Phase Three.
After a time interval during which the librarian created an IL object using the Guide for
reference, the researcher and librarian met for a second time for approximately one hour. At this
second meeting the librarian and researcher examined the new IL object using the PostIntervention IL Object Analysis tool. After examining and discussing the IL object, the researcher
conducted a semi-structured interview with the librarian especially focusing on the participant’s
reactions to the design process, Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction, R2D2, and further
recommendations for improvements to the Guide (Appendix E). The researcher made notes in her
reflective journal after each meeting with the librarian. Following each of those meetings the
researcher transcribed and coded the interviews and her research journal and sent the meeting
transcription back to each of the librarians for verification. This process was followed for each of
the five meetings which were part of Phase Three.
Phase 4
The central focus of Phase 4 was the refinement of the Guide. The researcher met once
more with the principal collaborator to discuss the final version of the Guide. The Post-Intervention
Semi-Structured Survey was used to guide the discussion. The researcher made reflective entries
in the researcher’s reflective journal. The interview was transcribed by the researcher and returned
to the principal collaborator for verification. After the principal collaborator approved the
transcript the researcher coded the transcription and her research journal. The researcher then
reviewed all of the data collected in Phases One through Four which consisted of all previously
compiled research including semi-structured interviews, IL object analyses, and the researcher’s
reflective journals. The researcher then conducted a summative analysis of the intervention

31

iterations and made further revisions necessary to create a final version of the Guide. This final
Guide can be used for future research and by academic librarians in creating IL objects.
Data Analysis
Data analysis in qualitative research is an ongoing interrelated process (Creswell, 2014).
The iterative, reflective nature of DBR also prompts continuing data analysis throughout the
research process. In this study, qualitative analysis consisted of identifying patterns through coding
of collected data. The collected data included semi-structured interviews, IL Object Analyses and
the researcher’s reflective journals. These sources were transcribed and coded by the researcher to
identify themes or trends which could affect collaboration between the researcher and the librarians
in future design processes.
Qualitative data was collected in this study through the use of semi-structured interviews,
analysis of IL objects and the researcher’s reflective journal. The constant comparative method
was used to code, categorize, organize and analyze the qualitative data collected throughout the
study (Smith, 2002). This method allowed the researcher to simultaneously code and analyze data
and to make comparisons among categories to identify similarities and differences, and
consistencies among participant responses (Smith, 2002). Microsoft Word was used to build tables
to prepare and familiarize the researcher with the qualitative data, and to develop a simple coding
system to categorize the data (Ruona, 2005). This information was used in the four design
iterations that made up this study. The researcher coded the material herself.
There were four iterations in this design-based study. As the study progressed revisions
were made to the Guide prior to the next meeting with a collaborating librarian. The table below
displays the research questions and methods used which helped answer the research problem.

Validation of Findings
Triangulation of data was used to validate the findings. A multiple methods approach
increased the internal validity of the research through the collection and comparison of previous
literature on the topic, semi-structured interviews, IL object analysis and the researcher’s reflective
journal. Common themes emerged through the triangulation of the collected data which helped to
establish credibility and reliability. A thick, rich description served to describe the setting and
creative process thereby endeavoring to include the reader in the collaborative creation experience
and increase the generalizability of the study by providing inspiration and suggestions for creation
of future IL objects.
Summary
This design-based research study collected qualitative information from academic
librarians at an urban university in a large city in the Midwest. The collaborative effort between

33

the researcher and librarians examined the creation of IL objects for online use utilizing Merrill’s
First Principles of Instruction and Bonk and Zhang’s R2D2 as a framework. Research and
collaboration occurred within the design environment of the academic libraries. Four iterative
design phases formed the foundation of the study, resulting in documented recommendations and
a guide for librarians to use for future creation of IL objects. The well-developed data collection
and analysis plan helped to realize the over-arching goals of the study: to increase the awareness
of academic librarians of instructional design principles, R2D2 and learner preferences when
creating IL objects.

CHAPTER 4 RESULTS
This chapter presents the data analyses of this study. It starts with a description of the
participants. It proceeds to describe the iterative nature of design-based research that resulted in
four separate phases of data collection which are then described. This rich and thick description of
the four phases of data collection is followed by an analysis of the findings for each research
question. The chapter then concludes with a summary.

The librarians who participated in the study were all academic librarians with Masters in
Library and Information Science from accredited graduate programs. They had extensive postgraduate academic experience. Five of the six had other master’s degrees, often in fields which
they were supporting as academic librarians. All of the librarians had continued further academic
enrichment by taking graduate level classes or attaining specialty certificates. It is to be noted that
only one of the librarians had any coursework or training in instructional design. Two of the
librarians had mathematical and engineering backgrounds and had worked in those fields before
becoming librarians. The other librarians had backgrounds in the humanities, social work and fine
arts. There was a vast range of library work experience among the librarians ranging from one year
to thirty years.
Phases of Data Collection
Design-based research was chosen for this study because its iterative nature allowed the
researcher to modify the Guide on an ongoing basis thus maximizing the benefits of the
collaborative process and the individual experiences and expertise of the participants. There were
four iterative phases, each of which is described below. Data was collected in each of the four
phases. See Table 3.

Phase One
Phase One commenced with a thorough literature review exploring the need for preparation
of librarians in instructional design principles. It was found that academic librarians are woefully
underprepared to create IL objects because of a lack of training in both education as a whole and
especially in instructional design principles for online learning. The researcher perceived a need
to introduce librarians to instructional design principles which would aid them when creating IL
Objects, particularly because academic librarians are increasingly being called upon to do so. The
researcher also introduced the academic librarians to R2D2 which would act as a framework to
increase both their awareness of learner preferences and the plethora of tools available on the Web
of Learning to help them when creating IL objects.
The first meeting with the principal collaborating librarian (PCL) was informal and served
to introduce the research topic and to plan future meetings during which the researcher and PCL
would collaborate to develop the Guide. The Guide was to be used in future collaborative iterations
with the other academic librarians. The researcher also conducted the Librarian Pre-Intervention

37

Semi-Structured Interview during this meeting, (Appendix C). Data collected at this meeting
consisted of notes and reflective entries made in the researcher’s journal and the responses to the
interview. Following the initial introductory meeting with the PCL the researcher analyzed the
notes and developed the initial draft of the Guide.
The second meeting between the researcher and the PCL was another collaboration and
discussion during which the researcher showed the PCL a preliminary draft of the Guide and they
discussed limitations to it and advantages of it. Data collected at this meeting consisted of notes
and reflective entries made in the researcher’s journal. Following this meeting further
modifications were made to the Guide to limit narrative, create prompts and to make it more
visually appealing.
The third meeting between the researcher and PCL was also a collaborative brainstorming
session during which the Guide was again discussed and examined. The previous experience of
the PCL in creating IL Objects was called upon to provide perspective on the usefulness of the
Guide. Data collected at this meeting consisted of notes and reflective entries made in the
researcher’s journal. The PCL also provided the researcher with the names of eight librarians who
were potential future collaborators and participants. The researcher wrote the suggested librarians,
explained the study and asked them to participate and collaborate. Of the eight academic librarians
who were contacted two did not reply, one declined to participate and five agreed to participate.
The fourth meeting between the researcher and the PCL was the final meeting of Phase
One. It was during this meeting that the idea was formulated by the researcher to create tables with
pre and post-design questions to use as prompts for Merrill’s First Principles and to include the
table and figure from R2D2. Data collected at this meeting consisted of notes and reflective entries

38

made in the researcher’s journal. Following this meeting the researcher made final modifications
to the Guide based on careful analysis of the research journal notes. This concluded Phase One.
Phase Two
Phase Two began with setting up appointments with the collaborating librarians. It was at
the first meeting with a collaborative librarian in this phase that the researcher decided to introduce
the Guide, take notes on suggestions during the introductory process and to modify the Guide
following the initial meeting with each of the collaborating librarians. The decision to include
modifications to the Guide as an ongoing process in Phase Two was made for two reasons: the
suggestions and feedback being given on the Guide in the initial meeting were so helpful that it
made sense to immediately incorporate them and the timeline for the use of the Guide between
each librarian was so long as to not be useful or conducive to the research process. Too much time
would have elapsed between when the researcher introduced the Guide and when the librarian
would actually use it to develop an IL Object and then meet again with the researcher. By
incorporating initial suggestions on an ongoing basis the researcher was able to maximize the
effect of the iterations of the Guide when introducing it to the next librarian and thus keeping the
momentum of the research progressing. The focus of the study became whether introducing the
librarians to the Guide, Merrill, and R2D2 helped them create a better IL object by raising their
awareness of instructional design principles, learner preferences and web of learning tools.
At each individual meeting with the five collaborating librarians, the researcher conducted
the pre-intervention semi-structured interview. The researcher then introduced the Guide to the
librarian, reading it over aloud and discussing any questions as they were raised in the course of
the conversation. Following the introduction of the Guide, the researcher and the librarian used the
IL Object Analysis (Appendix C) to examine an IL object created by the librarian, referring to the

39

Guide to help answer questions. Data collected at these meetings consisted of the interview which
was recorded, transcribed and analyzed by the researcher and the notes in the researcher’s journal.
This process was repeated for each of the five librarians. Before meeting with the next librarian,
the Guide was modified using the librarians’ suggestions, researcher’s journal and decisions made
by researcher after careful analysis of each set of coded data after each meeting. At the end of each
meeting the librarians were asked to use the Guide to create a new IL Object following which the
researcher and librarian would meet to discuss their experiences using the Guide to do so. Phase
Two ended after the researcher had met with each of the five librarians as described above and
analyzed the data.
Phase Three
Phase Three commenced when the librarians completed the new IL Object. The researcher
scheduled meetings to discuss the librarians’ experiences using the Guide to create a new IL
Object. At this final collaborative meeting with each librarian the researcher again conducted an
interview using the Post-Intervention Semi-Structured Interview followed by an IL Object
Analysis. Final suggestions and recommendations from the librarians were recorded. Data
collected in Phase Three consisted of the Post-Intervention Semi-Structured Interview, IL Object
Analysis and the researcher’s journal. Phase Three was concluded at this point.
Phase Four
The researcher had a final meeting with PCL to share the recommendations of her
colleagues, reveal the final iteration of the Guide and to discuss suggestions based on the final
model of the Guide. Data collected at this meeting consisted of researcher’s journal notes and a
semi-structured interview. The researcher reviewed the notes from the researcher’s journal and
semi-structured interview and made final changes to the guide.

40

Data Analysis
Data analysis was conducted in a continual process throughout the data collection and
various iterations using the constant comparison process. This section describes the data analysis
procedures and is organized by data source. The data sources consisted of the Pre- and PostIntervention IL Object Analysis, Pre- and Post-Intervention Semi-Structured Interviews with the
collaborating librarians which included the evolving Guide, and the researcher’s reflective journal.

Data was analyzed by constant comparative method using qualitative coding for data
analysis. The constant comparative method was used to code, categorize, organize and analyze the
qualitative data collected throughout the study (Smith, 2002). This method allowed the researcher
to simultaneously code and analyze data and to make comparisons among categories to identify
similarities and differences, and consistencies among participant responses (Smith, 2002).
Microsoft Word was used to build tables to prepare and familiarize the researcher with the
qualitative data, and to help develop a simple coding system to categorize the data (Ruona, 2005).
The Microsoft Word tables provided the organizational structure for the coding of the interviews
and In Vivo coding (Miles, Huberman & Saldana, 2013) guided the researcher when developing
the codes. The In Vivo coding was chosen to code the data for two reasons. The first reason In
Vivo coding was chosen was because it allowed the researcher to code the data using the recurring
phrases and themes which were present in the semi-structured interviews. The second reason In
Vivo coding was chosen was because it is particularly well-suited for studies which “prioritize and
honor the participant’s voice” (Miles, Huberman & Saldana, 2013, p. 74).
After transcribing the data and member checking the transcripts for accuracy, the
researcher manually coded the data by identifying recurring phrases and themes. The themes were

41

developed around the research questions. The researcher looked for statements and phrases which
were divided into the following ideas listed in Table 4.

First Data Source: IL Object Analysis

The IL Object Analysis was an instrument developed by the researcher with a number of
purposes in mind. Its initial use as part of the Pre-Intervention Semi-Structured interview had two
distinct purposes. The first purpose was to raise awareness of the collaborating librarians of the
principles of instructional design represented by Merrill’s First Principles, R2D2’s emphasis on
learner preferences and the suggested tools available on the web of learning, all of which are
presented in the Guide. The second purpose of the IL Object Analysis was to focus attention to
areas of the librarians’ own IL Objects where the above mentioned principles were or were not
present. In the Post-Intervention Semi-Structured Interview the purpose of the IL Object Analysis
was to highlight if in fact the librarian had adopted any of the suggestions from the Guide and if
so which ones.

42

Pre- and Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis
The Pre-Intervention IL Object Analysis took place following the researcher and the
librarian’s semi-structured interview and after the researcher introduced the Guide to the
collaborating librarian. The researcher and each of the participating librarians examined an IL
object, created by the librarian, using the IL Object Analysis. The goal was to identify if and where
the librarians had incorporated Merrill’s First Principles and R2D2’s learner preferences and web
of learning activities. It was hoped that by raising the librarians’ awareness of the instructional
design principles espoused in the Guide the librarians would consider and include them in the
creation of new IL objects.
The Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis was conducted during the second meeting with
the collaborating librarians. The purpose of this meeting was to determine to what extent the
librarians had incorporated Merrill’s First Principles and R2D2 into their newly created IL objects
for online learning.
The tables below show the results of the Pre- and Post-intervention IL Object Analysis.
They are followed by a discussion of the data.

Principle 1: Learning is promoted when learners are engaged in solving real 3 times

Principle 2: Learning is promoted when existing knowledge is activated as a 1 time

Principle 3: Learning is promoted when new knowledge is demonstrated to the 5 times
learner
Principle 4: Learning is promoted when new knowledge is applied by the 3 times
learner
Principle 5: Learning is promoted when new knowledge is integrated into the 2 times
learner’s world
Principle 1: Learning is promoted when learners are engaged in solving real world
problems was identified by librarians in three IL Objects. The collaborating librarians had differing
opinions on the definition of real world problems. Some interpreted the term to mean it was
something relevant to the student’s current life such as a research tool or device for a current
academic assignment. An example of this was librarian 3’s observation: “…it is helping them find
the resources they need to complete the assignment..” Other librarians interpreted the term as a
tangible “world” problem such as hunger or poverty. The librarians with that view of real world
problems did not identify this principle as being present in their IL Objects. Librarian 6 expressed:
“I’m not solving real world problems, its’s not for that type of course” They also expressed that
they thought it would be difficult to incorporate that principle in a future IL object.
Principle 2: Learning is promoted when existing knowledge is activated as a foundation
for new knowledge. Only one librarian identified this principle in the IL Object Analysis.
Librarian 3 did so because the terms used in this IL Object were ones the students should recognize

44

and have interest in because of previous course work: “…it is trying to use phrases that are things
from the past and the audience very likely has interest in”.
Principle 3: Learning is promoted when new knowledge is demonstrated to the learner.
Five librarians identified this principle in the IL Object Analysis.The overwhelming reason they
gave in support of this identification was because the purpose of the IL Object was instruction of
some type and these IL Objects were all intended to be instructional. . Librarian 4: “That’s why
we change the screen the way it does so you can point out the steps to how you get to something.”
Principle 4: Learning is promoted when new knowledge is applied by the learner. Three
librarians identified this principle in the IL Object Analysis. Reasons for their identification of this
principle were that it had been designed with the intention of it being used by the students in their
future studies. Librarian 3 supports this: “I know that the 4th one happens because they tell me they
use it in other classes.” Librarian 6 identified Principle 4 in the IL object because: “…they’re
supposed to apply their new learning from this IL object to write their research paper”. Librarian
4 did not identify it in the IL object because: “…they don’t really get to apply any of the
knowledge”.
Principle 5: Learning is promoted when new knowledge is integrated into the learner’s
world. Two librarians identified this principle in their IL Object. . Librarian 3: “I can’t see online
that they have integrated it, but when they are able to find an article later for the class then I guess
that means they’ve applied it.” In further discussion they both observed that it is difficult to know
if the information imparted in the IL Object had in fact been integrated in the learner’s world other
than hoping that the new knowledge would be used in other course work: This was the same
observation the other three librarians made about Principle Five and the reason they gave for not

45

identifying it in their IL Objects. Librarian 5: “I’m not sure I know that students are being engaged
by learning objects.”

Principle 2: Learning is promoted when existing knowledge is activated as a 2 times

Principle 3: Learning is promoted when new knowledge is demonstrated to the 3 times
learner
Principle 4: Learning is promoted when new knowledge is applied by the learner 2 times
Principle 5: Learning is promoted when new knowledge is integrated into the 2 times
learner’s world
Principle 1: Learning is promoted when learners are engaged in solving real world
problems. This principle was identified by librarians three times in their post-intervention IL
Object. They used the need for the knowledge included in the IL Object as a real world problem
of the students. Librarian 3: “The real world problem is the assignment and they have to use the
resources in the IL object to successfully complete it.”
Principle 2: Learning is promoted when existing knowledge is activated as a foundation
for new knowledge. This principle was identified by librarians two times in their post-intervention
IL Object. They designed the IL Object with the intention of activating prior knowledge from

46

courses in which students had already been enrolled. Librarian 3: “…from second part of course
and I focused on activating what should have been the students prior knowledge from previous
course material.”
Principle 3: Learning is promoted when new knowledge is demonstrated to the learner.
This principle was identified by librarians three times in their post-intervention IL Object.
Demonstrations to the learner included presentations created with PowerPoint and Camtasia to
guide the students through a particular task. Librarian 3: “I was able to do a fair amount using
PowerPoint.” Librarian 4: “I used a voiceover with PowerPoint.”
Principle 4: Learning is promoted when new knowledge is applied by the learner. This
principle was identified two times by librarians in their post-intervention IL Objects because
opportunity for practice of the new knowledge was included in the IL Object. Librarian 5: “Part of
the game based activity requires the students to solve engineering problems.”
Principle 5: Learning is promoted when new knowledge is integrated into the learner’s
world. This principle was identified two times by librarians in their post-intervention IL Objects.
Both of the librarians expressed being pleasantly surprised that they had been able to incorporate
this principle having previously expressed the difficulty of doing so in the pre-intervention
discussions. Librarian 5: “In this game based activity the learners are applying the knowledge and
integrating it into their world which is solving engineering problems.”

Figure 3 IL Object Analysis Merrill’s First Principles Pre and Post Interventi
In summary, the identification and use of Merrill’s Third Principle of Instruction decreased
between the Pre-Intervention and Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis as did Merrill’s Fourth
Principle of Instruction. The identification of Merrill’s Second Principle of Instruction increased
from the Pre-Intervention IL Object Analysis to the Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis. The
identification of Merrill’s First and Fifth Principles of Instruction remained the same from the PreIntervention IL Object Analysis to the Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis.
Pre and Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis for R2D2
In both the Pre- and Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis the librarians were asked to
identify for which phase and type of learner the IL object was designed and which Web of Learning
activity was used. The tables below show the responses of the librarians to the questions of which
R2D2 phases were present in their IL objects and which Web of Learning activities were used in
those same IL objects. The tables are followed by a discussion of the findings and a summary.

Read was identified as a phase four times by the librarians. Librarian 2: “The content
involves a lot of reading.” Some of the activities from this phase which were included in the IL
Objects were PowerPoint presentations, e-books, and online journals. Librarian 5: “…the object is
textual in nature and a combination of online pdf documents”. Librarian 6: “online journals and
providing databases help with number 1 Read….”.
Reflect was identified one time as a phase by the librarians. . The activity from this phase
which was included in the IL object was an online exam. Librarian 4: “After the listen to it there
is a very short ten question quiz which they take.” The librarians expressed Reflect was difficult
to incorporate in an online Il object
Display was also identified a phase four times by the librarians. Librarian 2: “…this is
heavy on the visual because it relies on imbedded videos.” Librarian 3: “ I always think of things
in terms of visually. I always think of video” Some of the activities from this phase which were
used in the IL objects are online charts and graphs, a timeline and video. Librarian 5: “…for

49

students who prefer visual learning there will be some video tutorials…”. Librarian 6: “The
timeline would satisfy for visual learners.”
Do was identified as a phase one time in the Pre-Intervention IL Object Analysis. Librarian
3: “The session itself accommodates the tactile because they actually do touch the keys and
actually do the search, not just watch examples of it’” All of the librarians expressed that it would
be very difficult to incorporate activities for the Do phase of learning. This was attributed to several
technology constraints which exist within the library’s electronic system and the nature of online
delivery of the IL objects. Librarian 5: “I have nothing like that online, nothing such as hands-on
learning or simulations.”
Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis R2D2
The post-intervention interview and IL Object Analysis occurred after the collaborative
librarians used the IL Object Design Guide to create a new IL object. The results of the PostIntervention IL Object Analysis are found in Table 8 below.

Read was identified as a phase three times by the librarians in the Post-Intervention IL
Object Analysis. Librarian 2: “I have a lot of reading that you can do.”. Some of the activities from

50

this phase were PowerPoint presentations, e-books, and online journals. Librarian 5: “This is really
text intensive.”
Reflect was identified as a phase two times by the librarians in the Post-Intervention IL
Object Analysis. In this instance a video, normally considered Display was used for Reflect
because the video was of a discussion panel. Librarian 2: “I thought the videos of a panel discussion
about a biographical documentary represented the reflective side of things.” This is the same phase
which librarians expressed difficulty incorporating in online IL objects. Librarian 3: “I got hung
up on the reflecting part which I think is difficult to build in to what I’m doing in an online object.”
Display was identified as a phase three times by the librarians in the Post-Intervention IL
Object Analysis. Librarian 3:” My focus is usually on Display because that’s what I prefer as well.”
Some of the activities from this phase which were used in the IL objects were virtual fieldtrips and
tours, online charts and graphs, and a timeline. Librarian 2: “I wasn’t sure what thing I could get
into this category, it was kind of difficult, and then I found an online tool which makes a timeline.”.
Librarian 5: “…the charts here seem to be putting the information in to a visual format and I would
think the video also…”.
Do was identified two times by the librarians in the Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis.
Librarian 2: “The link to the Smithsonian Collection was hands-on because you could go in and
explore a little bit. And Zotero as well because you actually do something with it.” Some of the
activities from this phase which were used in the IL bjects were simulations and online games.
Librarian 5: …Engineering Village is a game-based simulation that’s really suitable for this.”

Figure 4 Pre- and Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis R2D2
In summary the collaborating librarians reported using a greater variety of resources from
the Web of Learning in the Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis. They also increased the use of
two phases of R2D2 in the Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis.
Second Data Source: Semi-Structured Interviews with Collaborating Librarians
Both the pre-intervention and post-intervention semi-structured interviews were
transcribed by the researcher, member-checked for accuracy and then manually coded by the
researcher. It became apparent early in the research process that all of the participants were in
overwhelming agreement on the helpfulness of the Guide and the information it was intended to
impart. Because of the consistency of these views the researcher then looked for differences
between the collaborating librarians which served to illuminate how individuals used and
perceived the Guide and its contents. Part of the semi-structured interviews included discussion of
the Guide and suggestions for revision. Therefore, the second part of this section contains a

52

presentation of the data collected during the different phases of the research concerning the
contents, iterations of and revisions to the Guide.
Semi-Structured Interviews
The data from Pre- and Post-intervention semi-structured interviews is presented together
because they are largely consistent with no meaningful contradictory or other significant
difference. Presenting the results together also helps to highlight the pre-intervention and postintervention findings of the same themes resulting in better understanding and comparisons. The
same reasoning applies to the description of the limitations that the academic librarians offered on
each theme. Those limitations were also so similar and overlapping between the Pre- and Postintervention semi-structured interviews that they too are also presented in one section.

Description
Collaborating librarians were unfamiliar with
Merrill’s First Principles and all but one had no
training in instructional design principles. The
overarching application of instructional design
principles was well-received by the
collaborating librarians who as a whole said it
was very helpful knowledge.
Most academic librarians have little or no
training in teaching. R2D2 was included in the
Guide to provide a framework for the
collaborating librarians to aid in their creation
of IL objects and provide suggestions for
sample technology resources and tools
available on the web of learning. The
collaborating librarians found R2D2 to be
helpful.
Learner preferences and types of learner are a
significant aspect of R2D2 and one of its
unique attributes.
The Guide, in all its iterations, was wellreceived and deemed helpful by the
collaborating librarians.

The matrix and graph displaying the responses of the collaborating librarians to the
overarching theme of Merrill’s First Principles are shown in Table 10 and Figure 6.

As noted in the literature review and supported in Table 2 most academic librarians have
little or no training in either instructional design principles. Merrill’s First Principles, with its
overarching application of instructional design principles, was well-received by the collaborative
librarians who as a whole said it was very helpful knowledge. There was a growing level of
recognition of Merrill’s First Principles and how they can be used in the creation of an IL object.
Merrill’s Principles became guideposts for the librarians in assessing how they could better convey
knowledge to their learners which would lead the learners to integrate that knowledge into their
world.

Figure 6 R2D2 Occurrences
As was also noted in the literature review most academic librarians have little or no training
in teaching. R2D2 was included in the Guide to provide a framework for the collaborating
librarians to aid in their creation of IL objects and provide suggestions for sample technology
resources and tools available on the web of learning. The collaborative librarians found R2D2 to
be helpful. There is an increase, albeit slight, in the number of occurrences between the preintervention and post-intervention. However, what is unmistakably present is the appearance of
more detailed and thoughtful understanding of R2D2 during post-intervention. It demonstrates a
clear growth of awareness as well as depth of understanding of the R2D2’s focus on learning
preferences. What is equally apparent in both pre-intervention and post-intervention comments is
that the librarian participants were not only receptive to but were actually welcoming to these
concepts.

Figure 7 Learner Preferences Occurrences
Learner preferences and types of learner are a major aspect of R2D2 and one of its unique
attributes. There is a pattern of an increasing level of understanding of learner preferences in the
pre-intervention phase and increasing depth of comprehension of learner preferences in the postintervention phase. The post-intervention responses revealed a greater level of awareness and
appreciation for the significance of learner preferences when designing IL objects.

Figure 8 IL Object Design Guide Occurrences
One of the two overarching goals of this study was to create an IL Object Design Guide
which could be used by academic librarians when creating IL Objects. The Guide, in all its
iterations was extremely well-received and deemed helpful by the collaborating librarians. The
number of occurrences in the pre-intervention phase to the post-intervention phase showed a
dramatic increase in the number from 10 to 37. There were numerous and very positive references
to the helpful aspects of the Guide. In addition to the increased number of the occurrences, there
was unanimity among the librarians about the robust and beneficial qualities of the IL Object
Design Guide.

Critical Response to Merrill’s First Principles
Critical responses to Merrill’s First Principles were consistently expressed over the
difficulty to create IL objects which incorporate Merrill’s Fourth and Fifth Principles and the
inability to determine if a learner is applying or integrating new knowledge.
Critical Response to R2D2
Critical responses to R2D2 centered on the librarians’ perceived difficulty to create IL
objects which incorporated activities in the phases of Reflect and Do. Also, frustration was
expressed because many of the activities suggested in the Sample Technology Resources and Tools
were not conducive to adaptation for use in IL objects.
Critical Response to Learner Preferences
Critical responses concerning learner preferences were consistent. The common criticism
of learner preferences was that while it was useful to learn about the phases and types of learners
it was difficult to tailor the IL Objects to different types of learners. The librarians found it difficult
to do so mainly because they often did not know the specifics of the audience for whom the IL
Object was being created.
Critical Response to IL Object Design Guide
Critical responses concerning the Guide were limited which reflects the overall satisfaction
the librarians expressed both pre-intervention and post-intervention. The main criticism was that
it contained a lot of text and lacked examples.
Iterations of the Guide
A critical element of this design based research was the incorporation of improvements to
the Guide in each step of the process. More specifically, at the conclusion of each of the
collaborative research sessions with the collaborative librarian the researcher made improvements

67

to the Guide after careful analysis of suggested revisions from that librarian. The revised guide
was then presented to the next librarian as an introduction to instructional design principles through
Merrill’s First Principles and an introduction to types of learners and Web of Learning activities
through R2D2. At no stage of the iterative process, when suggestions for improvement were
elicited from the collaborative librarian, was there any prohibition or direction of any kind from
the researcher as to what permissible changes were allowed. In other words, there was no built-in
bias in the study towards the preservation of earlier made changes. In that way, everything was in
play for further revision.
In the table set forth below is a summary of the revisions to the Guide which were
incorporated following each of the research episodes. This table is followed by a detailed
description of the revisions to the Guide and exhibits.

Iteration One
Iterative Cycle One consisted of a number of revisions to the Guide during its development
by the researcher in collaboration with the principal collaborating librarian. The Guide started out
as a word document which consisted of a paragraph which introduced R2D2 and Table 1.1 from

68

Empowering Online Learning (Bonk & Zhang, 2008). At that point, although Merrill’s First
Principles were being used to introduce the academic librarians to instructional design principles,
no decision by the researcher had been made to include them in the Guide.

Figure 10. IL Object Design Guide 1
Iteration Two
Following a collaborative meeting with the principal collaborating librarian the Guide was
revised and consisted of three paragraphs-an introductory paragraph, and paragraphs describing
both Merrill’s First Principles and R2D2. Table 1.1 was not included. See Figure 12.

69

Figure 11. IL Object Design Guide 2
Iteration Three
The third revision of the Guide incorporated major changes to both the content and the
appearance of the Guide. These changes included making it two-sided so Merrill’s First Principles
were on one side and R2D2 was on the other; creating a table incorporating Merrill’s First
Principles and pre- and post-design questions to serve as either pre-design prompts when

70

creating the IL object or as post-design checks to ensure the Principles were considered by the
librarian when creating an IL object; Table 1.1 was included on the R2D2 side as well as Figure
1.1 which shows the phases of R2D2 and types of learners. See Figure 12.

Figure 12. IL Object Design Guide 3 (Front and Back)
This concluded Phase One. The researcher used the final revision of the Guide developed
in Phase One to launch the meetings and collaborative design process of Phase Two.

71

Phase Two
Phase Two of the design–based research process consisted of collaborative meetings with
each of the academic librarians during which the researcher introduced the librarian to the study,
conducted the semi-structured interview, introduced the IL Object Design Guide and then
examined the participating librarian’s IL object using the IL Object Analysis Instrument. As part
of the discussion, the participating librarian was asked for thoughts and suggestions for
improvements to the Guide. These observations were considered by the researcher and revisions
were made to the Guide before meeting with the next collaborative librarian. This model was
followed with each of the five collaborative librarians in this phase. Below is a summary of
changes made to the Guide after each meeting.
Iteration Four
Following the researcher’s meeting with the first collaborative librarian which followed
the model above the researcher added a definition of instructional design. See Figure 13.

72

Figure 13. IL Object Design Guide 4. (Front and Back)

73

Iteration Five
Following the researcher’s meeting with the second collaborative librarian which followed
the same meeting model the researcher made grammatical corrections, added a prompt to explain
how to use the Merrill table and improved the quality of the graphics for figure 1.1. See Figure 14.

Figure 14. IL Object Design Guide 5. (Front and Back)

74

Iteration Six
Following the researcher’s meeting with the third collaborative librarian which followed
the same meeting model the researcher modified Table 1.1 from Bonk and Zhang’s Empowering
Online Learning (2008) and included a description for each type of learner. See Figure 15.

Figure 15. IL Object Design Guide 6. (Front and Back)

75

Iteration Seven
Following the researcher’s meeting with the fourth collaborative librarian, which followed
the same meeting model, the researcher made a major format change and created a pictogram
which was in color and included graphics. Content that changed was the inclusion of a prompt at
the top of figure 1.1 to guide use of R2D2 and a change from the term “Web of Learning” to “the
web”. See Figure 16.

Figure 16. IL Object Design Guide 7 (Front and Back)

76

Iteration Eight
Further refinements to the pictogram were made and it was printed in color. See Figure 17.

Figure 17. IL Object Design Guide 8 (Front and Back)
Phase Three
Phase Three consisted of meetings with the collaborative librarians to discuss their
experiences using the Guide to create a new IL object. As occurred in Phase Two, the researcher
met individually with the collaborative librarians for the Post-Intervention Semi-Structured
interview and the Post-Intervention IL Object Analysis to examine the new IL object created using
the Guide. Suggestions for revisions to the Guide from the collaborative librarians were recorded
but no modifications were made to the Guide in Phase Three.

77

Phase Four
Phase Four consisted of a final meeting with the principal collaborating librarian to discuss
the revisions to the Guide made by the researcher in Phase Two. Following this meeting the
researcher made a final change by colorizing the R2D2 cycle and the Guide was finalized. The
final version of the Guide is below. See Figure 18. Appendix E is the full-sized version of the
Guide.

Figure 18. IL Objects Design Guide 9 (Front and Back)
Aspects of the iterative process of developing the Guide which should be noted are the
following: 1. There were no subsequent changes in the later revisions to the guide which negated
previously made revisions. In other words, the revisions were a continuing process and consistent
with prior revisions. 2. There was no backward movement in the revisions to the first version. The
absence of any movement backward or of any subsequent contrary revisions in effect demonstrated

78

that all of the subsequent commentators were satisfied with the previous revisions. Therefore, the
editorial process further endorsed the effectiveness of the Guide as it grew stronger.
Third Data Source: Researcher’s Reflective Journal
The researcher’s reflective journal was a Google document in which the researcher kept
notes, memos and reflections throughout the research process. Entries were made after each
meeting with the participating librarians and other times in the research process when the
researcher analyzed the data, prepared for meetings with the collaborative librarians and worked
on iterations of the Guide. The reflective journal served as a gathering place of ideas which
became a record of the timeline and development of the research process and the Guide.
Analysis of Data with Respect to Research Questions
Research Question 1: Does the use of Merrill’s First Principles facilitate the design of IL
objects? If so, how?
Although the librarians used it in different ways, Merrill’s First Principles, with its
overarching approach to instructional design, was a helpful introduction to instructional design
principles, of which five of the six collaborating librarians had no formal training. The practicality
of it was part of the success of its introduction to the librarians and its use in the Guide. “It sounds
very practical; I appreciate the idea of it.” Other expressions of the usefulness of Merrill’s First
Principles by the librarians included: “It’s more like a goal and the more you get hopefully the
more effective it will be.” Another librarian expressed a similar sentiment, “It’s a principle, kind
of an ideal thing which we should aim for.” Numerous times librarians observed that Merrill is
“good”, “useful”, or “helpful.” The six librarians in the study commented positively on the
usefulness of Merrill’s First Principles 21 times.

79

Critical observations from the collaborative librarians focused primarily on the difficulty
of applying Merrill’s Fourth and Fifth Principles when creating IL objects for online instruction.
The librarians expressed this because of their inability to determine when new knowledge is
applied or integrated by the learner in an asynchronous, online environment. A librarian reflected
in the post-intervention survey: “It’s not realistic to expect to be able to interact on that level with
people using the IL object.” It was not necessarily a criticism of Merrill’s First Principles, but an
acknowledgement of some of the constraints of online instruction.
Research Question 2: Does the use of R2D2 facilitate the design of IL objects? If so, how?
There were 15 occurrences of R2D2 being mentioned positively in the pre and postintervention Semi-Structured Interviews. As with Merrill, there were some librarians who
preferred one over the other, but all of the collaborative librarians overwhelmingly found R2D2
helpful in many ways when creating IL objects. As one collaborative librarian noted: “The Guide
spoke to me more through R2D2.” Read and Do were the phases which were most used by the
librarians: “I liked the sample technology and tools, they were really helpful.” Another librarian
stated: “It introduced me to some different ways to get my point across.”
Critical responses to R2D2 expressed the difficulty of addressing some learner phases and
types in an IL Object for online learning: “Some of the aspects of R2D2 I found difficult with these
types of literacy objects.” “I get hung up on the reflect part which I think is difficult to build in to
what I’m doing.” This difficulty does not rest entirely in R2D2; instead it rests in part on the
constraints imposed by technology available to the librarians at that specific school and in the
nature of online instruction as a whole.

80

Research Question 3: Does the consideration of learner preferences facilitate the design of
IL objects? If so, how?
They overwhelmingly professed a need to be conscious of learning preferences, as is
expressed in this comment: “I realize that different students have different preferred ways of
learning”. Awareness of learning preferences helped one librarian “find alternative materials
which would appeal to different types of learners”. It was mentioned 21 times in the Pre- and PostIntervention Semi-Structured Interviews. Interestingly enough, despite the emphasis on learner
types and preferences emphasized in R2D2 and the Guide, some of the librarians still referred to
learning “styles” when discussing this term.
The consistent critical response from the librarians concerning learner preferences was the
impediment created by not knowing either the learners using the IL Object or their learner
preferences. Many of the collaborating librarians expressed similar observations: “I don’t know
who my students are.” And “I might not know what the learning preferences are of my audience.”
Again this can be viewed not as a shortcoming of learner preferences or R2D2 but a constraint
resulting from the nature of online education and the intended audience of the IL objects.
Research Question 4: How does the use of the IL Object Design Guide facilitate the design
of IL objects?
There were 47 occurrences of the Guide being mentioned positively in the Pre- and PostIntervention Semi-Structured Interviews. As one librarian noted, the Guide “perfectly packages
the framework of resources.” All of the collaborative librarians indicated they would use it again
and that it would be helpful to other librarians when creating IL objects: “It strikes me as a
tremendous resource;” “The Guide helps me accommodate other learning styles;” and “I
appreciate the variety in the Guide rather than it being very prescriptive.”

81

There were only four critical responses offered by the collaborative librarians concerning
the Guide. Two of the responses addressed the presentation which was “too wordy in some of the
text boxes” and two requested examples, especially for the design prompts. These responses were
addressed as part of the iterative improvements to the Guide.
Summary
The goal of this study was to explore the usefulness of introducing academic librarians to
instructional design principles to help them create better IL objects for online learning. This was
accomplished by working collaboratively with them using desig- based research methods to
develop the IL Object Design Guide. The conclusions, implications and recommendations for
future research are discussed in the next chapter.

82

CHAPTER 5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This chapter discusses the research and practical implications of the study. Final
conclusions about this research are drawn in this chapter and recommendations are shared to
benefit future researchers and practitioners in the development of IL objects.
This study was conducted to explore the role of instructional design principles using
Merrill’s First Principles and Bonk and Zhang’s R2D2 to increase academic librarians’ awareness
of instructional design principles and learner preferences when creating IL objects. Major findings
are summarized below by research question:
1. Does the use of Merrill’s First Principles facilitate the design of IL objects for online
instruction? If so, how?
2. Does the use of R2D2 facilitate the design of IL Objects for online instruction? If so,
how?
3. Does the increased awareness of learner preferences facilitate the design of IL objects
for online instruction? If so, how?
4. How does the use of the IL Object Design Guide (the Guide), facilitate the design of IL
objects for online instruction?
Research Question 1: Does the use of Merrill’s First Principles facilitate the design of IL
objects for online instruction? If so, how?
Yes, Merrill’s First Principles facilitated the design of IL objects for online instruction.
Qualitative data analyses of the data sources which included the pre- and post-intervention IL
Object Analyses, the researcher’s journal and pre- and post-intervention Semi-Structured
Interviews revealed that the collaborative librarians found Merrill’s First Principles helpful when

83

designing IL objects. This positive concurrence was evident in the number and variety of responses
collected during the research.
Using Merrill’s First Principles in the Guide facilitated the creation of IL objects for online
instruction in a number of ways, but most importantly by introducing the academic librarians to
instructional design principles of which they were previously unaware. 83% of the academic
librarians who participated in this study had no previous training in instructional design. As
supported in Davis (2013), using instructional design principles ensures IL objects have clear
instructional goals and learner preferences are considered which results in more active engagement
by students.
Mullins (2014) IDEA Model, which was designed for embedding IL instruction into
academic courses at the author’s university, was considered limited in its application because it
was beyond the scope of individual IL objects and it did not focus on a particular delivery method.
Merrill’s overarching principles which are in themselves guidelines, but not prescriptive, were an
excellent vehicle for an introduction to ID principles without the added complications of
implementing a traditional design model. Providing succinct, guiding principles for instructional
design was a further way Merrill’s First Principles facilitated the creation of IL objects for online
instruction.
Critical observations from the collaborative librarians focused primarily on the difficulty
of applying Merrill’s Fourth and Fifth Principles when creating IL objects for online instruction.
The librarians expressed this because of their inability to determine when new knowledge is
applied or integrated by the learner in an asynchronous, online environment. A librarian reflected
in the post-intervention survey: “It’s not realistic to expect to be able to interact on that level with

84

people using the IL object.” It was not necessarily a criticism of Merrill’s First Principles, but an
acknowledgement of some of the constraints of using IL objects for online instruction.
Research Question 2: Does the use of R2D2 facilitate the design of IL objects? If so, how?
Yes, the use of R2D2 facilitated the design of IL objects. Qualitative data analyses of the
data sources which included the pre- and post- intervention IL Object Analyses, the researcher’s
journal and pre- and post-intervention Semi-Structured Interviews revealed that the collaborative
librarians found R2D2 helpful when designing IL objects.
Bonk and Zhang’s R2D2 is not a design model, rather it is a framework intended to guide
educators, in this case the academic librarians, to create learning opportunities using activities
readily available in the Web of Learning (Bonk and Zhang, 2008). The use of R2D2 facilitated the
design of IL objects in a number of ways which are reflective of the variety of experience and
educational backgrounds of the participating librarians. After being introduced to R2D2 in the
Guide, some of the librarians were encouraged to seek out new tools and ways to incorporate those
tools in their Post-Intervention IL objects. Magnuson’s (2013) study examined the potential use of
Web 2.0 technologies for IL instruction. It concluded that choosing proper Web 2.0 tools was
important when creating IL objects but was limited to four tools within a course management
system. R2D2’s potential is profound with respect to creativity and choice when creating IL
objects because of the plethora of tools available on the Web of Learning. The only limitation of
R2D2 was that all of the activities were not necessarily conducive to adoption in IL objects. That
however is not due to a deficiency in R2D2 rather it is due to the nature of IL objects and
technological constraints.
Critical responses to R2D2 expressed the difficulty of addressing some learner phases and
types in an IL Object for online learning: “Some of the aspects of R2D2 I found difficult with these

85

types of literacy objects.” “I get hung up on the reflect part which I think is difficult to build in to
what I’m doing.” This difficulty does not rest entirely in R2D2; instead it rests in part on the
constraints imposed by technology available to the librarians at that specific school and in the
nature of online instruction as a whole.
Research Question 3: Does the consideration of learner preferences facilitate the design of
IL objects? If so, how?
Yes, the consideration of learner preferences facilitates the design of IL objects.
Qualitative data analyses of the data sources which included the pre- and post-intervention IL
Object Analyses, the researcher’s journal and pre- and post-intervention Semi-Structured
Interviews revealed that the collaborative librarians found learner preferences helpful when
creating IL objects.
The consideration of learner preferences facilitated the design of IL objects in many ways.
. The multitude of Web of Learning tools and instructional approaches when creating IL objects
increases the opportunities to reach students with a variety of learning preferences (Nicholson &
Eva, 2011). The collaborating librarians expressed how their greater awareness of learner
preferences, which came from R2D2 and the Guide, led them to seek out different tools and
activities from the Web of Learning. These were tools which they would not have otherwise used
in IL objects. An awareness of learning preferences presents flexibility for librarians when creating
IL objects (Mestre, 2010). R2D2, present in the Guide, helped create a greater awareness of learner
preferences which resulted in broader adoption of Web of Learning tools in the IL objects created
by the collaborating librarians.
The consistent critical response from the librarians concerning learner preferences was the
impediment created by not knowing either the learners using the IL Object or their learner

86

preferences. Many of the collaborating librarians expressed similar observations: “I don’t know
who my students are.” And “I might not know what the learning preferences are of my audience.”
Again, this can be viewed not as a shortcoming of learner preferences or R2D2 but a constraint
resulting from the nature of online education and the intended audience of the IL objects.
Research Question 4: How does the use of the IL Object Design Guide (the Guide), facilitate
the design of IL objects for online instruction?
Qualitative data analyses of the data sources which included the pre- and post-intervention
IL Object Analyses, the researcher’s journal and pre- and post-intervention Semi-Structured
Interviews revealed that the collaborative librarians unanimously found the Guide extremely
helpful and that it facilitated the creation of IL objects in a number of ways.
The Guide was created in response to an acknowledged lack of preparation of academic
librarians for instruction, especially in online learning. This dearth of preparation is supported in
numerous studies. Mestre et al, (2005) reported librarians have minimal formal training in
instruction or for creating IL Objects. In a recent study by the Online Learning Research
Committee of ACRl only 28% of 92 librarians surveyed had previous coursework or a degree
related to teaching (Mestre et al., 2011). None of the participants in this study had any formal
preparation for teaching and only 17% (1 of 6) had any training in instructional design.
Increasingly, academic librarians are being called upon to create IL objects for online
learning. Online teaching and learning is very different from face-to-face instruction; therefore the
preparation of academic for creating IL objects for online instruction needs to take into
consideration those differences. Johnson (2006) suggests the way to best achieve integration of
good IL skills in students is to incorporate sound principles of instruction and educational theory,
design and practice. The Guide introduced the collaborating librarians to instructional design

87

through Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction and to the tools available on the Web of Learning
through Bonk and Zhang’s R2D2 to create IL objects for online learning which incorporate learner
preferences. Davis (2013) also reinforces the importance and usefulness of the Guide because
using instructional design principles ensures IL objects have clear instructional goals and learner
preferences are considered which results in more active engagement by students. Using Davis’
assumptions above, the Guide, through Merrill’s First Principles and R2D2 facilitates the creation
of better IL objects which more actively engage students.
There were only four critical responses offered by the collaborative librarians concerning
the Guide. Two of the responses addressed the presentation which was “too wordy in some of the
text boxes” and two requested examples, especially for the design prompts. These responses were
addressed as part of the iterative improvements to the Guide.
The iterative nature of design-based research was useful in developing the Guide which
increased academic librarians’ awareness of instructional design principles using Merrill’s First
Principles and Bonk and Zhang’s R2D2. Moreover, the use of R2D2 introduced the collaborating
librarians to the plethora of tools available to them in the Web of Learning to create IL objects
with an increased awareness of the importance of learner preferences.
Discussions
The Pre- and Post-Intervention Semi-Structured Interviews with the collaborative
librarians revealed that the iterative process for the development and refinement of the Guide and
its constituent members, R2D2 and Merrill, was extremely helpful. The process aided the academic
librarians in the preparation of IL objects with which they expressed satisfaction. Whether those
IL objects will ultimately be effective and to what extent is unknown at the present time. The data
that supported those results consisted in part of detailed information provided by each of the

88

librarians in the interviews. As is evident from the chart of coded responses, the librarians
consistently expressed the idea that R2D2 and Merrill were largely new concepts to them and that
they would be welcome improvements to the Guide which would steer their preparation of IL
objects. The academic librarians overwhelmingly expressed satisfaction with the Guide and the
usefulness of its contents-Merrill’s First Principles and R2D2. The Guide was helpful because it
introduced them to instructional design principles and a framework which increased their
awareness of learner preferences and the tools available on the Web of Learning. This resulted in
a greater variety of activities being incorporated in IL objects which were innovative and appealed
to students with a variety of learner preferences. Indeed, the principal collaborating librarian
asserted that she wants to use the Guide as a training tool when preparing other librarians at the
university to create IL objects which better incorporate instructional design principles, resources
from the Web of Learning and learner preferences.
This research study was conducted at a large urban university located in the American
Midwest. The participants were librarians from two of the libraries in the university’s library
system- the undergraduate library and the graduate library. The librarians were all certified
librarians with master’s degrees in library and information science. All of the librarians had
different library specialties and levels of experience both as librarians and with instructional design
principles. All had previous experience creating IL objects.
Limitations
The limitations to this research study were attributable to a variety of influences. These
limitations are described below.
Libguides was the only framework in which IL objects were embedded. The academic
librarians at this institution used Libguides as the framework to create research guides for academic

89

support for either individual courses or by subject matter. The IL objects which they created were
limited by the technical requirements of the Libguides and the university’s technological standards.
An example of this was MP4 was the only type of file which could be uploaded to the server.
Only academic librarians from one institution of higher learning were used as collaborators.
The research was conducted at only one university and the collaborative librarians were all
employed by that university. Albeit, they were stationed at two different libraries within that
system, it was still one university library system. Thus, presumably, they had all received similar
training in the use of Libguides and other technology tools and were operating under similar
technological restraints.
Due to time constraints of a dissertation research, the study was limited to six librarians
and was conducted during the Spring/Summer semester when their availability was the greatest.
Fewer students and limited distractions during the summer allowed the librarians more time to
devote to planning and preparation providing them the latitude to devote the necessary time to
participate in the study.
Implications
The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of the Guide—and its components of
R2D2 and Merrill’s First Principles- for use by academic librarians when creating IL objects. There
are many implications for both practice and research that flow from these findings.
There are several implications regarding practice. First, it appears that for the first time a
tool is available for use by librarians when creating IL objects. The Guide incorporates established
instructional design principles with a framework which emphasizes learner preferences and the
sample tools and resources available on the Web of Learning. Secondly, availability of the Guide
to academic librarians will help improve the quality of IL objects as the librarians become more

90

aware of instructional design principles, R2D2 and learner preferences. One can also reasonably
expect that the academic librarians who will be using the Guide going forward to create other IL
objects may also serve as examples to other librarians resulting in potential significant long range
effects on student education. Thirdly, the Guide can be transformed for use in other disciplines.
Although its original audience was academic librarians, the principles advanced by it are not
confined to either librarianship or creating IL objects. Indeed, the Guide may well be applied to
many other instructional subject matters or environments whether blended learning, online or faceto-face.
Finally, on the research front, these findings corroborate prior research about established
deficiencies in instructional design education among librarians and that IL objects created with
pedagogically designed principles and with an eye toward learner preferences afford students a
variety of ways to learn Mestre et al.,( 2011), Johnson (2006) and Luo (2010).
Recommendations for Future Research
This research focused on development of the Guide, enriched by Merrill’s Principles and
R2D2, to be used by academic librarians to create IL objects for online learning. Future research
should include developing an online version of the Guide with links to examples of IL objects
demonstrating successful incorporation of Merrill’s First Principles and R2D2. Indeed, requests
for such examples were made by collaborating librarians when the researcher introduced the
Guide. Links to examples were also suggested improvements to the Guide during post-intervention
interviews. Research should also be pursued into the usefulness of a blog or discussion board as
part of an online version of the Guide. Other future research should study the efficacy of IL objects
which are created using the Guide. In addition to the obvious benefits of such research, it could
also have the effect of encouraging collaboration and discussion amongst librarians. This

91

discussion would ultimately help librarians incorporate instructional design principles and also
improve their awareness of both learner preferences and the tools available on the Web of Learning
when creating IL objects.
Conclusion
This research study was conducted with two overarching goals-to increase the awareness
of academic librarians of instructional design principles and to increase their awareness of the two
primary facets of R2D2, namely phases and types of learners and the plethora of tools available
on the Web of Learning which can help librarians as they create IL Objects. The tool created for
this purpose was called the Guide. The Guide incorporated Merrill’s First Principle’s and Bonk
and Zhang’s R2D2 in a format which was revised through numerous collaborative meetings with
academic librarians. The librarians who participated in the research and collaborated with the
librarian during the creation of the Guide all reported that greater awareness through the Guide of
Merrill’s First Principles, R2D2, and learner’s preferences were all helpful to them when tasked
with creating an IL Object. They also all reported that the Guide was extremely helpful to them
and they would use it again when creating other IL objects in the future. It is hoped that the Guide,
which was the result of this research study, will be helpful to not only these librarians but also to
other librarians and perhaps to other professionals when creating IL objects.

Letter Describing Study and Invitation to Participate
June 10, 2015
Organization X
Address
Dear Academic Librarian,
My name is Kristin Orlich Lavoie. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Wayne State University. I
am conducting a research study to increase our understanding of the formulation of information
literacy (IL) objects used by academic librarians for online instruction at your university. This
study will use design-based research in which the researcher will work collaboratively with you to
examine the processes and activities you use when creating IL objects for online learners. The
study will identify best practices for doing so. It will also focus on integrating various learning
activities with different technologies for effective online learning for a diverse array of learners.
As an academic librarian, you are in an ideal position to give us valuable firsthand information
from your own perspective.
The study will involve the following four stages of activity with you:
1. The researcher will conduct a semi-structured interview with you. At the conclusion of the semistructured interview you and the researcher will collaboratively review an IL object presently in
use.
2. The researcher will then present and discuss a “Guide” which includes information on
instructional design principles and learning preferences for your use to design an improved IL
object based on increased consideration of those elements. Before the next meeting you will be
asked to create a new IL object using the “Guide”. It is expected that this collaborative effort would
occur over the period of one meeting and last approximately one to two hours.
3. The revised IL object will be implemented as you would normally do.
4. Once implemented, another meeting will be scheduled during which you and the researcher will
collaboratively review the new IL object. After an analysis and discussion of the IL object, the
researcher will conduct another semi-structured interview with you. This interview should is very
informal. We are simply trying to capture your thoughts and perspectives on how well the IL object
and the “Guide” performed.
Your collaboration and responses to the interview will be kept confidential.

93

There is no compensation for participating in this study. However, your participation will be a
valuable addition to our research and findings could lead to improvement of IL objects within the
field of academic librarians. The information that you provide will be used to help explain the
results of the study more fully, and to give other practitioners the information to help them improve
their IL objects. It will also ultimately improve information literacy of students. Finally it could
result in greater public understanding of the important responsibilities of academic librarians.
This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through Wayne State University
Institutional Review Board.
If you are willing to participate please suggest a day and time that suits you and I’ll do my best to
be available. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask me.
Here is my contact information:
Thank you for your help. I look forward to hearing from you soon to set a meeting time.
Sincerely,
Kristin Orlich Lavoie

ABSTRACT
USING R2D2 TO CREATE INFORMATION LITERACY OBJECTS IN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES: DESIGN-BASED RESEARCH
by
KRISTIN ORLICH LAVOIE
December 2016
Advisor: Dr. Ke Zhang
Major: Instructional Technology
Degree: Doctor of Philosophy
Academic librarians at the university level are increasingly called upon to create
information literacy objects which are available to students online. These librarians, however,
frequently have little or no training in any type of instruction, either face to face or online. Because
of the unique attributes of online learning, librarians should be aware of instructional design
models and learner preferences in order to maximize online student learning. Academic librarians’
utilization of the activities which promote efficacious online learning can be increased through
awareness of an instructional design model best suited to this purpose. Research was needed to
develop a guide and its components as a vehicle which best delivers that awareness to librarians.
This study examined the process of creating an IL Object Design Guide, using design based
research, in collaboration with academic librarians. Use of the Guide should aid their creation of
information literacy objects for online learners and identify best practices for doing so within the
framework of Bonk and Zhang’s R2D2 (Read, Reflect, Display, Do) Model and utilizing Merrill’s
First Principles of Instruction. A series of four phases of data collection began with consultations

109

with a principal collaborating librarian, continued with meetings with individual academic
librarians and concluded with a final meeting with the principal collaborating librarian. Each phase
of the study included data analysis of information gathered from the IL object analysis, semistructured interviews and progressive iterations of the IL Object Design Guide. Qualitative data
analysis was conducted using the In Vivo coding method. The significance of the study was the
creation of the Guide which can now be used by academic librarians when creating IL Objects.
The Guide is enriched with Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction and Bonk and Zhang’s R2D2.
The inclusion of these elements in the Guide was found to be very helpful by the participants. This
study can serve as a baseline for future development of training methods which prepare academic
librarians to create IL objects that incorporate good instructional design principles and practices
ultimately increasing their efficacy in education.
