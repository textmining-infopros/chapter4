ABSTRACT
HUMAN SELECTION AND DIGITIZED ARCHIVAL COLLECTIONS: AN EXPLORATORY RESEARCH
PROJECT ABOUT CHOICE OF ARCHIVAL MATERIALS DIGITIZED FOR ONLINE PUBLIC AVAILABILITY
by
Randy N. Smith
The University of W isconsin-Milwaukee, 2015
Under the Supervision of Professor Donald Force

Our collective memory, the history that is cultivated through reflection, documentation,
and consensus of historical data, is predicated upon the citizenry having access to the historical
materials that society has created. Digitization has enabled greater public access to those
materials. However, are items being scanned or digitally photographed to create surrogates
that are then not made available to the world? The impetus fo r this study is to delve into
w hether or not intentional or unintentional personal choices play a role in determ ining which
items archivists transform into digital surrogates; both in the decision of w hat to digitize and
w hat to make available to the public on the W orld Wide Web. When one archival collection is
prioritized over another or when it is not possible to digitize an entire collection, w hat rationale
is used to determ ine which items w ill be digitized and published online? Do intentional or
unintentional personal choices come into play in the decision-making? To answer these
questions, four case studies were conducted, involving the random sampling of online
collections and concom itant interviews o f archivists. The purpose of this study is to enhance
archivists' understanding o f the reasons that guide the digitization decision-making process.
Through such understanding, archivists can be more proactive in the decision-making process

to realize the benefit of digitizing and publishing archival materials that ultim ately affect
collective memory. The findings of this research revealed that in the case o f the four
institutions assessed, archivists do use personal choice to determ ine which materials w ithin an
archive are digitized.

Chapter 1: Introduction

Archival materials that have been digitized, also known as digital surrogates,1 provide
greater public access2 to prim ary and secondary source materials and can therefore help any
one of various communities to define its collective memory. Although materials kept w ithin an
archival repository may be open to the public fo r research, that very accessibility might still be
tantalizingly out of reach fo r the average person because of the tim e and money involved in
physically visiting an archives,3 but it is possible to mitigate some of this lack o f accessibility by
way of having digital surrogates available on the W orld Wide Web.4 The impetus fo r this thesis
is to delve into what choices archivists face — both in the decision of w hat to digitize and what
to make available to the public on the W orld Wide Web — that play a role in determ ining which
materials are transform ed into digital surrogates and can thus affect collective memory.

When referring to "choices" or "personal choices" in this thesis, I am defining the phrase
as the choices or values that are not based on professional policies, ethics or best practices. This
definition of personal choice is contrary to my definition of professional choices which I define
as the choices or values are based on professional policies, ethics, or best practices.

The outset of this chapter concerns where the archival field is in regard to mass
digitization, providing insight fo r the reader into w hat practices are currently discussed as being
utilized among archival institutions. This is follow ed by an exploration of w hat defines collective
m emory and some of the influences that affect it. The chapter concludes w ith a discussion
about how digital surrogates could influence a com m unity's collective memory based on the
decisions o f those individuals digitizing archival materials.

1.1

The digitization o f archival materials

Before materials are digitized, archivists must decide w hether or not the digital
surrogate w ill ultim ately be accessible online. This decision is always relevant, but not always
one that is considered by archivists. Digital surrogates may be created upon request and then
stored locally or rem otely on some form o f closed media (i.e., optical discs, hard discs, etc.).
Despite the benefit o f access fo r digitizing archival materials, there are several reasons why an
archives may not digitize archival materials, such as lack o f tim e, donor restrictions, insufficient
general funding, conservation concerns related to the materials, or not having the necessary
technological infrastructure or financial means to utilize an outside digitization provider.5

The decisions about access to archival materials (specifically in the form of digital
surrogates in this paper) have led to archivists being viewed as gatekeepers of the knowledge
held w ith in th e ir repositories. Luke Gilliland-Swetland brings this to light when he discusses the
historical development of the concept and principles of archival repositories, and the 'archivist'
as a profession. Archivists have, by proxy, become the "gatekeepers" o f the collections and
materials under th e ir purview.6 Additionally, Susan Pevar has described her own experience of
becoming a "gatekeeper" to the collections held at the Langston Hughes M emorial Library at
Lincoln University.7

Although archivists can be considered the experts o f the collections under th e ir purview,
can they be considered experts on the historical contexts of which these materials are a part?8
The lack of historical expertise9 may impact the archivist's choice about w hether to digitize an
item . For example, someone wanting to explore the travel habits of people involved in

nineteenth-century westward expansion might want online access to various ticket stubs,
ledger books, receipts, etc. detailing the various costs, schedules, transportation systems, and
obstacles involved. But these materials can be considered less visually appealing or interesting
to a large portion of the population, and thus the impetus to digitize them may languish fo r
decades w ith the items simply remaining untouched in the collection. An archivist may decide
that an e ffo rt to digitize a photograph depicting a fam ily sitting in pose is w hat would be of
greater interest and appeal to the w ider public. This personal assumption may end up being
advantageous fo r the repository's status in that the digitized item might be well received by an
online audience, or the digital surrogate could languish on a website somewhere, waiting to be
accessed by someone browsing the Internet.

Access to digital surrogates also aids research through its broad — one might even say
global — reach.10 The increased use o f digital surrogates fo r public access to original source
materials has been documented in the past,11 dem onstrating the reduction in research travel
cost to access a rem otely located item .12 Such cost reductions can be a boon to research that
utilizes prim ary source materials through remote access via the Internet.13 Because digitization

the impact on research, in a clear quantitative approach.

Research utilizing digital surrogates, w hether done by academics or by the general
public, can be noted in several instances. Jasmine Burns,

have all

observed instances of the general public's aid in working w ith digital surrogates to fu rth e r
scholarship. However, if the archival material is not digitized, then access to it is restricted to
physical visits.

Occasionally an archivist's desire to pursue the digitization of a particular part o f a
collection can result in the absence of items from the collection. For example, the George
Engelmann Papers at the Missouri Botanical Garden17 are im portant to both botanists and
historians of westward expansion during the nineteenth century. Engelmann was part of the
nineteenth-century trium virate of major botanists that included Asa Grey and John Torrey. The
United States governm ent and private botanists exploring the western states often coordinated

w ith Engelmann on specimen-collecting. Engelmann also traded these specimen samples of
western U.S. flora w ith botanical institutions and collectors from around the world. While a
grant was pursued to digitize the correspondence part of the collection due to th e ir historical
significance, it was discovered tow ard the end of the project that Engelmann's scrapbook also
contained letters; these were letters that Engelmann himself deemed im portant enough to set
aside from the other correspondences and place in a scrapbook.18 How these letters w ithin
Engelmann's scrapbooks m ight alter the details of the U. S. westward botanical collection and
exploration in general is unknown. However, the digitization and greater access to Engelmann's
scrapbooks could alter the collective memory of this specific period in history.

Although digitization can aid in making prim ary source materials accessible to greater
numbers of the online public, does this digitization have any effects on the culture of the public
at large? For this part of the assessment we need to define the nature of the 'effect' on culture;
however, to delineate that effect, an evaluation of collective memory must happen first. Once
collective memory has been quantified it needs to be made clear how digitization interacts w ith
collective memory.

1.2

Collective memory

To begin, a definition fo r 'collective m emory' needs to be established, and fo r this, one
can turn to University of Virginia history professor Alon Confino. In the article "Collective
M em ory and Cultural History: Problems of M ethod," he succinctly defines collective memory as

18 This e x a m p le com es fro m firs t-h a n d e x p e rie n c e , as I w as a p a rt o f this p ro je c t fro m its e a rly stages th ro u g h its
conclusion. T h e scra p b o o k w as n e v e r scann ed as p a rt o f th e p ro je c t.

"the ways in which people construct a sense of the past."19 However, Confino does fu rth e r
expand the definition by also stating, "It has been used to explore, first, the memory of people
who actually experienced a given event, such as the memory of Holocaust survivors. In
addition, it has come to denote the representation of the past and the making o f it into a
shared cultural knowledge by successive generations in 'vehicles of memory' such as books,
films, museums, com memorations, and others."20

As Kerwin Klein notes, the connection between the public at large, both lay-people and
professional academics, and the materials held w ithin archival repositories has been a central
issue since the early part o f the tw entie th century, when the interaction between collective
memory and history first became part of scholarly discussions regarding society, repositories of
history, and critical interpretation.21 Primary source materials can help a society retain
collective memory; likewise, they help prevent collective memory from becoming whitewashed
history22 beholden to political or ideological agendas.23

Collective memory has been explored, sometimes as an isolated case, as in the book
History Wars: The Enola Gay and Other Battles fo r the American Past, which chronicles the
backlash and politics involved w ith the Smithsonian's planned 1995 exhibit that presented a
more critical look at the United States' dropping o f atom ic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,24
and sometimes as an over-arching investigation, in many different manners. In dealing w ith the
investigation, Confino analyzed the concept of collective memory and how it relates to cultural
history believing collective memory to be made up of the relationships o f the social, political,
and cultural, and also the relationship between "representational and social experience."25

Collective memory itself has been shown to be faulty26 and sometimes in need of
scholarship to step forw ard to challenge it. Or, as Pierre Nora writes, "m emory, insofar as it is
affective and magical, only accommodates those facts that suit it."27 The them e of memory was
fu rth e r explored by Barbara L. Craig, whereby she advocates the need fo r archival collections to
be accessible to help shape m emory.28 Gerald Sider dem onstrated this in an article that

prom otion of a narrative based more on conjecture than fact led to an inaccurate historical
revelation about a 1912 textile strike.29

Along w ith its potential faults, collective memory also feeds o ff o f itself through
repetition of a narrative when coming from popular cultural sources. In an inform al study,
Michael Frisch notes how collective memory influences pedagogy, which in turn feeds back into
the collective memory.30 Along w ith Frisch's pedagogical influence, Emily Monks-Leeson has
discussed the affects postmodernism is having on collective m emory as the digital surrogates
provide a new, more accessible way to develop contextual narratives.31

Collective memory has also been explored as different mechanisms of societal
traditions. In the introduction to The Invention o f Tradition, Eric Hobsbawm discusses the
meaning of invented trad ition in societies and its role in shaping collective memory. Hobsbawm
notes that the invented traditions of nationalism "all rest on exercises in social engineering
which are often deliberate and always innovative."32

The placing o f digital surrogates on the Internet presents a virtual public exhibit o f the
archival materials held at one or more repositories and has the potential to affect collective
m emory through virtual public exhibition.33 Susan Crane and Ryan Davis have discussed the
importance of this exhibited inform ation (e.g., digital surrogates) impacting collective memory.
Crane notes that antithetical inform ation can have a shock effect on collective m em ory.34 Davis
fu rth e r explored how collective m emory is maintained by the impact of an online e x h ib it.35

That is not to say that all archivists who select materials to be digitized and made public
do so w ith an agenda in mind. Previous research has demonstrated the power of popular ideas
(e.g., collective memory) that are reinforced despite the accuracy of the inform ation.36 Specific
archival materials could possibly be viewed as more significant and in greater need of
digitization based upon contem porary collective m em ory influence upon an archivist. For
example, if a particular archival item or collection demonstrates a counter narrative to the
collective memory, the archivist may choose not to digitize it to avoid any negative reactions.

This decision to avert negative reactions to digital surrogates by not selecting the
original archival material is an example of controversy avoidance. Gary Nash, Charlotte

Crabtree, and Ross Dunn explored this issue by noting an example of textbook publishers.
Textbook publishers have often faced the issue of introducing inform ation that may offend and
thus often had authors rewrite sections of the text, especially in history textbooks, to be
appeasing to as wide an audience as possible.37 Textbooks, as w ith websites, serve to im part
inform ation to a general public, and by extension the same influences upon textbooks also
influence which archival materials are available via the Internet.

Collective memory can benefit from digitization in tw o other ways: "new types of
research" and new users and uses.38 As Peter Hirtle notes, digitization has led to new
techniques, such as utilizing com puter enhancements to reveal artifacts that are beyond w hat is
visible to the human eye, as well as being able to do such things as linking transcriptions and
translations to a digital surrogate.39 W ith the global reach of digital surrogates,40 collective
m emory is also being shaped through new or renewed uses o f the inform ation provided from
digital surrogates 41A prime example of this is the United States Civil W ar website, The Valley of
the Shadow,42 which through m ulti-disciplinary collaboration brought digitized materials

together,43 to create a website to help convey history to shape collective memory 44 In this
case, historians create context from the many digital surrogates45 to shape collective memory.
Another example is one that I have a personal connection w ith. Regarding the George
Engelmann correspondence project mentioned earlier, Dr. Sven Eliasson,46 who is transcribing
and translating the letters, has personally communicated to me that he prefers using the
digitized copies o f Engelmann's letters over the originals as he can alter the digital images to
help make the text in the letters easier to read. The translations and transcriptions that are
completed by Dr. Eliasson are then linked online to the original letters. Regardless of the
anecdotal example this illustrates, this situation demonstrates one user's feedback in utilizing a
digital surrogate of an object rather than the original.

A research participant in a study by Paul Conway spoke about th e ir selection of digitized
photographs to illustrate a context they wished to prom ote. In reference to a photograph
depicting a large outdoor gathering of people and horses near a building, the participant stated,
"I'm selecting images that are conveying culturally particular aspects that the Russians seem to
be honing in on [in assembling the album ]."47 And as Conway states, "fo r all o f the participants,

if the image fit the purpose and the product, all that remained were technical decisions relating
to publishing."48

In his article detailing three experiences he had w ith the com m unity of Berisso,
Argentina, Daniel James demonstrates how his experiences revealed the flu id ity of collective
memory. He describes how several forces, forces we might not necessarily view as very strong
such as children or a news reporter, can begin to shape collective memory.49 His argument
reveals tw o separate facets about memory: firstly, even tin y pieces of inform ation (e.g., digital
surrogates) can exert force over collective memory, and secondly, that the lack o f inform ation
can also exert force upon collective memory. An example o f the second facet goes back to
Conway's study where he notes that research participant four adjusted his own research to
accommodate the lack of a digital surrogate, stating, "I'm happy w ith what's online and if it's
not online, I just try to w ork around it." 50 As Lisa Hooper and Donald Force state, "researchers
should be aware that there are likely many pertinent documents not included in [an] exhibition
that could have some bearing on [a] narrative."51

The public influence on collective memory can also come from the lack of expertise of
the archivist. Such a case can simply be the identification, or re-identification, of data from an
archival item. Conway notes how a research participant noted the m isidentification of a

how another participant "found new connections" between previously separated

placement online means that they are now part of the global network; the connections and
context are created from digital surrogates.

Research questions

This thesis is being pursued to investigate how personal choices affect not only the selection of
materials to be digitized but also decisions related to which digitized materials are made
available online and th e ir possible effect on collective memory. To that end, this research
project is guided by the follow ing questions: When one archival collection is prioritized over
another or when it is not possible to digitize an entire collection, w hat rationale is used to
determ ine which items w ill be digitized? Do intentional or unintentional personal selection
biases come into play in the decision-making? Moreover, w hat are the reasons that archivists
cite when choosing which digitized materials to present online? And do intentional or
unintentional biases drive these choices?

Chapter 2: Literature Review

The topic o f digitization of archival materials has been widely discussed by archivists.
The discussions have ranged from the benefits of metadata fo r location and retrieval of
digitized materials to the anecdotal case studies of digitization projects. Yet none that I have
encountered have systematically and comprehensively studied the elem ent of choices made by
the archivist when deciding w hat should and should not be made publicly available via digital
surrogates.

In a government-commissioned survey of research libraries and archives carried out to
assess the state of digitization efforts in the United Kingdom, Barbara Bultmann, et al.
addressed the selection o f archival materials fo r digitization.54 They found that selection of
archival materials to be digitized fell into nine categories, w ith four of these categories standing
out as the most prevalent: public demand fo r the material, institutional relevance, the
uniqueness of the item(s), and w hether or not a collection was "coherent."55 At the end o f the
article, the researchers draw some conclusions to aid in m ethodology fo r conducting a
digitization project, but include only one instruction to aid in selecting archival materials fo r
digitization: the identification of gaps w ith in digitized collections and reference request.56

Aside from the w ork of Barbara Bultmann et al.,57 and Lisa Hooper and Donald Force (to
be discussed in more detail later),58 most of the literature presents the digitization selection
process by turning it into a methodology. By this I mean that the methodological steps are
linear in fashion so as to remove am biguity from the process. For example, was a grant received
to scan and publish online collection X? If yes, does the repository have all the applicable
permissions in place to scan said collection? If yes, scan and publish online collection X, etc.

The National Archives and Records Adm inistration (NARA) and the Canadian Council of
Archives (CCA) have both published online works to aid in the selection of materials to be
digitized.59 But these resources, and others,60 trea t the selection and im plem entation of
digitizing materials as a very structured process, which w ill be now summarized.

Digitization by request is often used as a prevalent means fo r determ ining w hat to
digitize. Aside from NARA's and CCA's selection im plem entation plans, James Bantin and Leah
Agne go one step fu rth e r in exploring the issue o f selection itself. They mention looking beyond
prescriptive plans tow ard prioritizing reference requests to determ ine digitizing priority.61 It
could be argued that quantifying the reference request to determ ine such priorities is itself an

added layer of structure upon the already existing ones being described here. As long as the
repository has had a method to collect such data, this quantification can lend itself to an
empirical layer of material selection.

If the repository does not have hard data on reference requests, sometimes a need
arises fo r a com m ittee (to enable input from m ultiple participants and thus reduce individual
bias) to select w hat they consider to be most pertinent fo r public interest. Such a situation
occurred at the University o f Alabama when they received funding to digitize a collection, which
led to debates about how to best aid and be "appealing" to school educators, while prom oting
awareness of the collection.62

Akin to the concept of patron-driven choices, is patron-produced choices. Evan Robb's
article on community-based digitization discusses a project whereby the public brought th e ir
personal items deemed to be special in some personal respect to be digitized by Washington
State Library.63 In this manner, the choice of digitization is removed from the institution and
placed com pletely on the public's decision-making processes.

Another criterion present in the prescriptive plans are as follow : assurances have been
obtained that the item is either out-of-copyright or has been given permission to be published.
Melissa Levine64 and Maggie Dickson65 both look into the legal issues, including copyright,

which need to be addressed before tackling a digitization project. This subject is fu rth e r
explored w ith an analysis of the copyright issues surrounding Europeana;66 from the image, to
the metadata, to the laws themselves.67 The issue o f copyright extends backwards from the
digital surrogate to the selection of materials to be digitized.

Another criterion is that the equipm ent to be used is capable o f digitizing the item (i.e.,
it would be difficult to digitize a slide w ith a digital SLR [single-lens reflex] camera). The
personnel must be capable of im plem enting best-practice standards regarding both the
digitizing itself and the metadata to be associated w ith the digital surrogate. And finally, the
original source material needs to be hardy enough to withstand the potentially rigorous
handling during the digitization procedure. These precautions not only apply to text-based
materials, but also include moving images, audio recordings, and artifacts as w ell.68

These are by no means the only suggestions fo r the selection of materials to be
digitized. For example, Paul Conway's focused view o f digitizing fo r preservation presents the
somewhat vague selection criteria fo r digitizing those items that have the potential fo r

"increasing impact and distinctiveness at hom e."69 This idea is similar to that of special
collections librarian Peter Michel, who, fo r a digitization project, suggested that the selection of
materials to digitize was heavily influenced by the desire to simply "prom ote and highlight
collections."70 Also, Ching-chih Chen et al. propose that digitization should focus on rare or
priceless known works so that digital surrogates exist in the event the originals are destroyed.71

Lisa Hooper and Donald Force form four conditional criteria fo r the selection of
materials to digitize: value, condition, access, and legal rights.72 Although th e ir discussion of
"value," "condition," and "legal rights" falls under the methodological categories discussed
earlier, I believe it is the criterion of "access" that stands out as most unique. They specifically
m ention that digitizing "hidden" (quotes are theirs) materials helps illum inate those materials
that otherwise may go unnoticed.73 In an editorial fo r Library Hi Tech, Michael Seadle echoes
Hooper and Force's final idea of digitizing "low-value materials," noting that physical tim e is the
materials' biggest threat from deterioration.74 The deterioration of textual materials from the
nineteenth-century is also the focus of an article by Andrew Stauffer.75 He notes that w ith o u t
digitization to reduce physical use and provide w ider access to the inform ation, research

involving these sources w ill be hampered. A very similar tw o-year project was undertaken by
the Press Institute of Mongolia to prim arily preserve Mongolian newspapers that were in the
process of deteriorating but also allow greater access to underrepresented materials.76 In this
case, although the newspapers were printed between 1990 and 1995, many of the copies were
not collected or well m aintained77; this situation demonstrates that not all archival materials in
need of preservation and/or access are necessarily also antique in nature. The goals of the
W orld Newspaper Archive seem to fall in line w ith the goals o f the Press Institute. James Simon
examines the W orld Newspaper Archive and states that the main goals are access,
preservation, and grow th (acquiring more digital surrogates of newspapers).78 Burns states
that, "institutions give precedent to the conservation of the object over access o f the
scholar,"79 but beyond this, Burns is more interested in the pros and cons of digitization than
the selection. This statem ent would seem to indicate that Burns feels that the preservation of
materials often trum ps the desires of patrons w ith regard to the selection o f materials to be
digitized.

Somewhat contrary to Burns' hypothesis, Emily Monks-Leeson demonstrates how
provenance and context can be maintained or transform ed through a digitization project.80

Although she does discuss this very enlightening issue, she does not discuss how the selection
of materials to create a digital surrogate can also affect context; the creation of a digital
surrogate does not likely affect provenance as that issue is something that influences each
surrogate individually. Similarly, by dem onstrating the transform ative scholarship achieved
through the collaboration of three universities, Lorena Gauthereau-Bryson notes that context is
better understood through a "hemispheric perspective" in which archival materials were
digitized from the respective institutions in tw o countries.81

Bantin and Agne have noted that the am ount of tim e that goes into the planning of
digitization projects can be considerable.82 W ith lim ited financial or personnel resources, some
repositories may find it difficult to be able to follow a methodical digitization plan and may
simply need to resort to an ad hoc approach to digitization. To explore this financial issue in
more detail, Pauline Joseph, Michael Gregg, and Sally May did a case study regarding a project
to digitize materials relating to the anniversary of the Western Museum Welcome Wall in
Australia and raise an excellent point: if this archival material has a pseudo-surrogate, that is a
digital surrogate that is not a digitization of the original item (for example, a PDF document o f a
translation of an archival item), is it w orth the expense to prioritize the digitization of the
original item?83

Other topics surrounding digitization include patron-added metadata to digitized
materials,84 user access and need of digitized m aterials,85 how digitization has altered
research,86 and digitization best practices.87 Articles by Emily Monks-Leeson88 and Lorena
Gauthereau-Bryson89 reveal how the impact from digitization projects can affect scholarship.
Beyond this point, an exploration o f the arbitrary choices made by archivists when deciding
which materials w ill receive a digital surrogate and be made publically available online, as well
as those materials that are initially rejected, remains an untouched research subject that is in
need of fu rth e r investigation.

M ost of the studies previously discussed only viewed this choice of w hat archival
materials to digitize, if it was mentioned at all, as a small byproduct o f a study that was
pursuing different research questions. This study is designed to address one question, which is
the m ethodology or, in essence, the choices that are pursued during the selection process of
which archival materials w ill have a digital surrogate created fo r them . It is hoped that this
research w ill aid in helping those individuals who are setting up digitization programs to be

Chapter 3: Methodology

This exploratory research project, which is the examination o f "a new interest" or "when
the subject o f study itself is relatively new ,"90 involved four different case studies. Each of these
case studies analyzed a repository's digital finding aids and the corresponding digital surrogates
of a collection, as well as any docum entation available; thereafter, an interview w ith the
archivist or o ther person responsible fo r the digitization program was conducted. The research
was conducted to aid the understanding o f the nature and frequency o f personal choice by
archivists in creating digital surrogates.

Because the phenomenon of personal choice is the focus of this research, inductive
m ethodology was determ ined to be the best way to proceed. Inductive m ethodology in this
instance was defined as "reasoning from observations,"91 hence the performance of four case
studies. A case study, as defined by John Creswell, is "a qualitative approach in which the
investigator explores a bounded system (a case) or m ultiple bounded systems (cases) over tim e,
through detailed, in-depth data collection involving m ultiple sources o f inform ation (e.g.,
observations, interviews, audiovisual material, and documents and reports), and reports a case
description and case-bound them es."92 This method was also chosen fo r the lack o f any

experim entation involved; that is, the study w ill be wholly based upon observation of all the
factors already present and included in the study.93

To identify each potential case study candidate, I focused on archival repositories
closest to St. Louis, MO (where I live), or areas where I have personal contacts. This search
involved reviewing repositories in St. Louis, Missouri; Decatur, Illinois; and Virginia Beach,
Virginia. This filtering step was initially thought necessary because an on-site inventory of a
collection might be required to determ ine what, if any, items or collections lack a digital
surrogate. However, this need to evaluate the physical collection was ultim ately deemed
unnecessary, as finding fu rth e r differences between the physical collection and its
corresponding online digital surrogates would not greatly enhance this study's research; all that
was needed was to find an instance o f personal choice influencing digitization selection.

A minimum number o f three case study candidates was arrived at by deciding to
investigate at least one institution from the three repository sizes as described by the Heritage
Preservation institution: smaller institutions (whose total archival collection is less than 1,000
linear feet), medium institutions (whose total archival collection is between 1,000 and 4,999
linear feet), and larger institutions (whose total archival collection is greater than 5,000 linear
feet),94 w ith a goal o f being able to investigate tw o institutions of each size. However, due to
lack o f response from small and medium repositories and tim e constraints, a total o f four case

studies were completed: one small institution, one medium institution, and tw o large
institutions.

Next was a determ ination of w hether or not the institution had digital surrogates
available fo r online public access. This was follow ed by a general comparison of any finding aids
to the total collection of corresponding digital surrogates available online to determ ine if any
discrepancies were present. Such discrepancies m ight include an online digitized collection that
lacks a digital surrogate of an item listed in the finding aid, but that might have differences in
the online finding aid and the online digital surrogates. For reference purposes, I noted the
similarities and differences between the finding aid (representing the physical collection) and
the online collection. This was follow ed by seeking any docum entation of policies posted online
via institutional websites concerning digitization that the repository may have. This would be
helpful in both the analysis o f policies fo r inclusion in the final report and in the instance that
the associated archivist is questioned about the policies if they conflict w ith practice or are
ambiguous and thus need explanation. The best candidates fo r inclusion into this study were
repositories w ith some digital surrogates from a collection that were presented online, but
whose corresponding finding aid indicated an item or items from the collection fo r which no
digital surrogate was found online. A total o f thirteen archival institutions were contacted at
the outset of the study.

The final step in the process was setting up an interview w ith the archivist or other
knowledgeable personnel involved in the decision-making process of which materials are
digitized as well as which digital surrogates are placed on the Web. This was done after a point

26

of contact was first determ ined fo r each potential case study candidate. Once established, each
candidate was contacted initially via email fo r permission to participate in the study (see
Appendix A fo r the contact email). The sent email explained the scope o f the study and asked if
there was someone at the archives who would be w illing to participate in the research. If the
individual accepted the invitation, they were sent a copy o f the questions to be asked during
the interview, and a day and tim e were set up to meet fo r an in-person interview. The interview
covered the questions (see Appendix B) of the selection of archival materials to digitize, and
lasted between 30 and 90 minutes. Each interviewee was the current person overseeing the
digital collections. The case study interview process prim arily involved open-ended questions
concerning w hat ideas w ent into the decision process.

To be able to recall inform ation more accurately, I asked each participant if there would be
any problems w ith having the audio of the interview recorded. All participants verbally agreed
to allow audio recordings. A fter the interviews, all audio was com pletely transcribed to be
analyzed. This content analysis was performed on the transcription o f the interviews to chart
dom inant trends based on statements. The chart contained main headings fo r each category,
and all relevant answers were entered under the appropriate heading fo r each institution.
These headings are listed below.
•

Reasons to digitize.

•

Digitization protocol.

•

Storage of images.

•

•

•

The data from each case study were altered enough to help each institution and
interviewee remain anonymous. The results from the content analysis were then combined to
understand how the personal choice of w hat to digitize was impacted by the interview answers.
The next chapter presents the results of the four case studies from the interviews w ith
personnel currently in charge of digitization. Following that, Chapter 6 w ill present how the
inform ation gleaned from the content analysis reveals the use o f personal choice to determine
which items have derivative digital surrogates created.

28

Chapter 4: Case Studies

The four case studies are presented anonymously and w ill be listed as Institution A,
Institution B, etc. Anonym ity was done to protect the identity of the interviewees as the
purpose o f this study was only to find evidence of personal choice influencing digitization
decisions and was not trying to single out either people or institutions. The presentation w ithin
each case study w ill describe several factors about each institution:

•

The general size of the physical archival collection.

•

The number o f staff w ith in the departm ent.

•

The number o f online digital surrogates created.

•

The source(s) of funding fo r digitization.

•

How decisions are reached regarding w hat to digitize.

•

The types o f materials that get digitized.

•

W hether or not digital surrogates are publically accessible.

Before proceeding to the synopses o f the institutions, a definition should be reiterated
fo r the benefit of the reader. When referring to digitized surrogates, I meanto reference each
individual digital file created and stored on a com puter medium, such as a hard disc, CD-ROM,
flash drive, server, etc.95

4.1

Institution A

95 Please re fe r back to fo o tn o te 1 fo r a fu lle r d e fin itio n o f 'd ig ital s u rro g a te .'

29

Institution A consists of an archive w ith more than 300 collections and surpasses 5,160
linear feet of materials. Three full-tim e staff are employed w ith in the archival departm ent. The
interviewee was unable to determ ine the total number of individual surrogates created from
digitization but did state that more than 16,000 items from the archives have been digitized.
However, the interviewee stated that items may contain m ultiple surrogates, such as a book
w ith 100 pages; in this instance the book is counted as a single digital surrogate rather than 100
digital surrogates.

Funding fo r digitization projects is derived from general departm ental monies, patron
requests, and grant awards. For patron requests, any costs are determined on a case-by-case
basis and w ill be passed along to the patron. For example, if the patron requires that the digital
surrogate be placed on a DVD and shipped to them , the archives would charge the patron fo r
the cost o f the DVD and postage. The interviewee did indicate that a specific policy addressing
such costs does not exist.

The determ ination of which items Institution A digitizes fo r access is m ultifold. Patrons
may visit the archives and request to have a digital surrogate of specific items, or patrons may
contact the archives from remote locations and make a request fo r specific materials. These
requests are granted barring any access restrictions on the materials. Patrons from other
departm ents w ithin Institution A have also requested the creation of digital surrogates. This
included an instance in which a physical exhibit was developed to celebrate a famous
personality who once attended Institute A. The archives, which housed a collection of materials

30

from and about this celebrity, was asked to develop an online exhibit that used only some of
the archival materials w ithin the collection.

The interviewee also cited preservation o f archival materials that receive a high volume
of usage as another factor that may determ ine when an item is digitized. As stated during our
conversation, they decided to digitize some fragile, yet significant, diaries from the 1800s due
to the poor conditions of the materials. This was also the case w ith a different collection of
archival materials. The interviewee stated, "we had . . . maps from the 1800s, also. And those
are getting some use, and they would just crumble. We would have the little shreds of paper on
the floor. And so that got worked into another grant w ith the main library here and the [local
museum]."

Successful grant projects also play a role in determ ining materials to be digitized; fo r
example, Institution A collaborated w ith a state grant-funded initiative to digitize materials
w ith in th e ir archives relating to the Civil War. W ith this specific grant project, the determ ination
of w hat was to be digitized was partly made by another institution that was the project leader
fo r the grant. Although not everything w ithin a whole collection was digitized, all digital
surrogates that have been created are available to the public fo r viewing.

The kinds of materials that are digitized include printed and manuscript items,
photographs, audio, video, and over-sized printed materials. The interviewee noted that the
over-sized items are contracted to a third-party fo r digitization as Institution A lacks the means
to digitize such items.

31

When Institution A decides to digitize non-grant and non-patron-requested items, it is
driven mainly by "patron request," as stated during the interview. The interviewee noted that
they and the staff convene to determ ine w hat is receiving the most patron demand fo r items
not already digitized. Those items are given priority fo r digitization over all other materials
w ith in the archives that have not been digitized already. However, the interviewee stated that
the m ajority of th e ir archives is post-1923 and under copyright restrictions.

Patron access to the digital surrogates from the archives is provided via its website. Lowresolution96 images fo r printed materials are available fo r public viewing via the Archon
software platform ,97 and the original high-resolution images are available upon request.
According to the interviewee and as noted earlier, a "process and handling" fee is charged to
the patron to send them any requested high-resolution versions o f an image.

Institution A lacks a digital assets management platform fo r easy storage and retrieval of
digitized surrogates. All digitized surrogates are currently stored locally on onsite computers.
Some digitized textual surrogates have been uploaded to HathiTrust.com and
GoogleBooks.com, third-party organizations that host print materials that have been digitized.

4.2

Institution B

The archives at Institution B consists of 206 collections, which comprise about 1,987
linear feet. The digitized content consists o f approxim ately 12,315 digital surrogates. At
Institution B, only tw o staff members are involved in the digitization process.

To date, only photographs, textual materials, and audio have been digitized by the
archives at Institution B. They have not digitized any m otion-picture materials. All digitization is
done in-house by either staff or student assistants. The only funding source fo r the archives at
Institution B has been received from the departm ental budget. Institution B has not received
any grants nor does it charge patrons fo r access to high-resolution copies o f digital surrogates.

Institution B does not have a specific w ritte n protocol to determ ine the prioritization of
materials fo r digitization, but does have a digitization policy that addresses inform ation about
the digitization program and patrons, as well as providing guidelines about how to select
materials fo r digitization. Listed below are the criteria outlined in the policy that materials must
meet to be considered fo r digitization:

•

The institution has the right to digitize the material.

•

Does not duplicate existing projects.

•

Increase the inform ational and educational needs of the community.

•

Materials can be accessed w ith o u t a fee.

•

The material can be physically digitized.

•

The materials form a "cohesive whole" (parts of a collection may not be
digitized).
33

•

The materials w ill not be damaged.

•

The technology, funding, and staff knowledge are present to digitize the
materials.

•

The digitized materials w ill have the necessary support to be sustained over
tim e.

•

Significant to the institution, an upcoming exhibit, or is valuable.

•

Adds to the completeness o f already digitized collections.

The interviewee did provide a list o f collections that was created in 2012, in order of
priority, that the archives hopes to digitize. However, according to the interviewee, the
determ ination of w hat to digitize is first and forem ost driven by institutional inter-departm ental
collaboration or student projects. When resources are not being utilized fo r specific student or
inter-departm ental projects, website search statistics were cited as also being used to gain
insight into w hat topics and/or archival items patrons are seeking. These data directly influence
the interviewee's determ ination o f w hat to digitize. The interviewee did not say how the use of
such statistics fits w ith in the digitization policy or the priority list.

At this archives, all items must also be evaluated according to ownership, equipm ent
requirements, and condition before being considered fo r digitization. In addition, any items
deemed to have sensitive, identifiable inform ation are rejected fo r digitization fo r public
viewing. This inform ation was received during the interview and corroborates th e ir digitization
policy. Unlike the situation w ith Institution A, not all digital surrogates are available fo r public
access. An unknown number are kept away from the public, not due to any restrictions but
34

rather the interviewee expressed a desire to make the images part of an online exhibit before
making them available to the public.

Patron access to digital items is via the archives' website running the CONTENTdm
platform .98 From here, patrons are able to view or retrieve full-resolution scans of the digital
surrogates w ith o u t any access restriction. All files fo r digital surrogates are stored locally on
institutional servers.

Not all digital surrogates are available to the public. During the interview a student
digitization project was brought up. The student only desired to create an exhibit that focused
on a specific aspect of the collection; however, most or possibly all the collection was digitized.
When asked about the digital surrogates that had been created but are not available to the
public, it was stated, "w e 'll do something w ith them eventually. They are scanned. They are
digitized, but they are not online . . . [We are] trying to figure out how they could become th e ir
own collection."

4.3

Institution C

The archives at Institution C consists of 8,360 linear feet o f materials w ithin nineteen
collections. The archives has tw o full-tim e staff members. However, they also utilize students to
aid in digitizing materials.

35

The materials that the archives have digitized are textual materials (both manuscripts
and printed), photographs, and audio. All digitization is done at the institution by staff and
student assistants.

The funding to digitize the archives w ith in Institution C has only been through general
departm ent funds. Student and inter-departm ental projects have also occurred, but the
funding is still derived from the archive's parent institution. At the tim e of the interview,
Institution C had not received any funding from grants or from patron requests.

W ith its digitization procedures in place, Institution C's archives has been operating
w ith o u t an approved digitization policy. A w ritte n policy has been created, but it has never
been approved by the institution's adm inistration.

Patron access to digitized surrogates is through a statewide consortium website that
relies on CONTENTdm to allow management and access to each participating institutional
archive. Patrons are able to access image resolution sizes up to 1,000 pixels per side. Larger or
full-resolution images have to be requested from the institution's archives. All digital surrogates
created are stored offsite through an agreement w ith a university w ith in the United States to
host and preserve the original digital surrogates.

The interviewee at Institution C provided several reasons fo r digitizing. Among them
included institutional memory through the digitization of many of its publications. Because the
institution owns the copyright on such items, and barring any other laws that may restrict
public access, it may place such materials online w ith o u t restriction. The interviewee also
m entioned collaboration on projects w ith other departm ents w ithin the institution as a reason
36

to digitize; one such project involved documenting the institution's botanical plants. This was a
collaboration between the archives and tw o other departments.

The interviewee did indicate that, to date, all items that have a digital surrogate are
available online fo r public access. They also noted that although all digital surrogates are
available, that did not mean that all materials w ithin a collection had been digitized.

Exposure o f the collections was another justification fo r digitizing archival materials. The
interviewee stated that they hoped to generate interest about the collections through the
digitization of some of the materials from said collections, as well as through th e ir inclusion to
the online repository fo r public access.

4.4

Institution D

Institution D's archives consists o f a single collection where all materials are not
separated into distinct collections. W ithin the archives are about 2,000 items that comprise
approxim ately 60 linear feet. Their digital content currently stands at about 5,000 digital
surrogates. The interviewee was unable to give precise numbers fo r either the total number of
items w ith in the archives or fo r the tota l am ount of digital items created. Although 2,203 digital
surrogates are listed as being created, this num ber comprises items such as pamphlets, which
are counted as a single file w ith m ultiple images. This made determ ining the exact number of
individual digital surrogates more difficult.

The institution has tw o full-tim e staff members, and does utilize student assistance to
digitize its archival materials. However, volunteers have not participated in digitizing any

37

materials. Funding fo r the digitization of materials is derived from general institutional funds,
patron requests fo r copies of the digital surrogates, and grant awards.

The archives does not have a w ritte n policy to follow regarding digitization, so the
procedure by which to determ ine what to digitize is very broad. To summarize their digitization
philosophy as expressed by the interviewee, they intend to scan everything w ith in the
institution's collections that relate to the institution. A copy of each digital surrogate is kept
locally on a server. The interviewee stated that not all digital surrogates are available online due
to one o f tw o reasons: either the digital surrogate lacked metadata associated w ith it before
being uploaded or the digital surrogate was not related to the history of the institution.

Among the materials scanned by the archives are photographs, manuscript items, and
three-dim ensional objects (such as plates, paintings, etc.). No video or audio materials have
been digitized to date.

Institution D's digital surrogates are hosted through a third-party website PastPerfect." Through this website, patrons are able to access low-resolution, waterm arked
versions of the digital surrogates. High-resolution copies of the digital surrogates are available
fo r a fee from the institution upon request.

Based on these four completed case studies, some observations can be made regarding
the processes used to determ ine which archival materials w ill be digitized fo r public access. The
impact of these procedures upon collective memory and the aforem entioned digitization of
materials w ill be discussed fu rth e r in the next chapter.

Chapter 5: Analysis

Presented here is an analysis of the inform ation acquired from the four case studies.
The analysis w ill look fo r any trends the four institutions share as well as noting any inform ation
that takes a m inority position. These trends are summarized in Table 1 about reasons given fo r
digitization which is follow ed by a deeper look into each o f the reasons listed in the table. After
discussing the reasons fo r digitization, other areas not brought up by the interviewees w ill be
investigated: donations and financial influence. The form er was cited by each interviewee as
not influential in th e ir decision about what to digitize while the latter was not mentioned; that
said, this researcher believes these matters are salient to the discussion of w hat influences
personal choice when digitizing materials. First, a broad overview of the analysis o f the data is
presented.

5.1

Overview

The four institutions analyzed fo r this study present a cross section of archival
repository sizes, both in term s o f collection size and number o f staff. A comparison of the
findings from each o f the institutions reveals some similarities as well as specific differences.
Each of the institutions presents different mixed methods o f approaching the decision process
fo r determ ining which archival materials are to receive digital surrogates. Table 1 indicates the
identified categories, that is, the reasons each interviewee stated fo r determ ining how archival
materials are chosen fo r digitization. A rbitrary colors were used in the table to help highlight
each answer. The colors do not correspond to any other meanings and are only present to aid
the reader.

Color Key: |

Upon analysis of the interview transcriptions, distinct reasons fo r digitization brought up
by the interviewees became more apparent. In some instances, a distinct answer was given by
the interviewee that set itself apart from other answers, such as 'preservation' and 'exposure.'
This led to other institutions' answer(s) being classified as 'N /A ' (Not Applicable).

Overall, collaboration and patron requests were cited as the most popular reasons to
digitize materials. This was followed by student projects that were cited as a reason to digitize
materials at tw o of the institutions. Cited only once were the follow ing reasons given for
digitizing: requests from an institution's adm inistration, preservation, exposure of a collection
and/or the institution. Each reason w ill be addressed in the order listed in the table, from top to
bottom .

5.2

Collaboration
40

Amongst the most popular reason fo r digitization of materials was collaboration w ith
other groups, usually from w ith in the archives' parent institution, but, in one case, w ith an
outside entity (Institution C). Of the four institutions, three interviewees stated this as a reason
fo r digitizing archival materials. This method o f choosing removes the need fo r the person or
persons w ithin the archives to be responsible fo r w hat materials from th e ir collection to
digitize. Instead, collaboration w ith other parties allows the archives to mitigate such
responsibility fo r the decision, and has the added benefit of developing collegial bonds and
defraying some of the costs involved in digitizing, which was something noted by Ken
M iddleton.100

The interviewee at Institution B mentioned that collaboration was part o f the impetus
fo r creating a form al digitization program. A fter working w ith another departm ent to digitize a
specific collection, the archives developed form al procedures fo r digitization. As the
interviewee stated, the benefit o f this first digitization project was that it "fosters collaboration
and enhances the library's role on [locally] or in the com m unity."

As detailed earlier, the interviewee at Institution C mentioned a unique situation
whereby they collaborated w ith an outside institution on a digitization project. Institution C
digitized a Civil War diary that neither belonged to them nor was part of a collaborative exhibit,
nor did Institution C have a collection that pertained to the diary. This discovery was made after
the interview and thus was not addressed by the interviewee. This was the only representation

41

of an institution collaborating w ith a third party to digitize th e ir content and provide internet
access to the third-party's digital surrogates.

Institution D's archives, the smallest o f the four, presented the most unique scenario in
that they were the only archives that did not cooperate w ith other parties. Cooperation w ith
other institutions was not a subject broached by the interviewee. The lack o f volunteering any
inform ation does not autom atically negate the possibility of collaborating w ith other
institutions.

5.3

Patron requests

Patron requests also received three citations as a reason fo r digitization. This method of
deciding w hat to digitize is very similar in principle to collaborating w ith other institutions in
that the decision mechanism of what to digitize is removed from the archival staff and is being
dictated by an outside influence.

Institution A cited patron requests as the prim ary determ iner of digitization. Patron
requests are noted, and if the item had not been digitized, the institution would proceed to do
so when not already working on a specific project.

Institution D acknowledged that they process patron requests fo r digital surrogates of
items not already digitized from th e ir collection. They did not say w hether or not the requests
had to be fo r materials relating to the institution's own history. The interviewee also did not
state how much im portance was given to patron requests.

42

Only the archives at institution C actively turns down patron requests fo r the digitization
of archival materials. The interviewee stated, " . . . I don 't scan anything fo r anybody, because
there's no policy. There's no procedure. I can't even tell them , 'I need to charge you this much
to recover the cost o f the labor.'"

5.4

Student projects

Institutions B and C explicitly cited digitization being driven by student projects. In the
case o f Institution B, one o f the early digitization projects was undertaken by a student who
was perusing the archival materials and found a miscellaneous collection mostly consisting of
correspondences w ith a 19th-century editor. This collection is notable fo r the many
correspondences w ith prom inent figures of the day. However, several of the collection's
contents were not digitized. The reason fo r the omission of some of the collection's content
was described by the interviewee as not pertinent to the student's project. In addition, other
items from the collection were digitized but not placed online and instead reside on local
media. An e ffo rt to remove this gap in access through digitization o f the remaining content
from the collection was not completed by either the student or the institution. A fter reviewing
a description of the non-digitized materials as listed in the finding aid, it seems the items may
not be relevant to the collection they are located w ith, but may be more relevant to other
collections outside of the institution. W ithout a digital surrogate, it is difficult to determine
w hether or not these materials would be beneficial in any context.

Institution C also acknowledged that student projects were a driver of digitization. The
interviewee noted that the student was from a different departm ent but had worked w ith
43

Omeka content management softw are.101 As the interviewee stated, "the student and I have
created, using the content that I am responsible for, as our first project, a tribute to the . . .
anniversary o f the opening of this campus."

5.5

Exposure

The idea of digitizing archival materials fo r exposure is a very broad concept w ith which
all o f the four institutions in this study would likely agree. Although only Institution C was
explicit about exposing collections as a reason fo r digitizing, it can be said that all digital
surrogates that are placed online fo r public access are likely to benefit th e ir institutional
patrons w ith public interest in th e ir collections. Because many institutions are placing th e ir
digital surrogates on the W orld Wide Web fo r patron access, it can be safely assumed that th e ir
collections w ill gain exposure via the harvesting of web content by internet search engines. If an
institution did not w ant exposure of th e ir collections, making the digital surrogates available fo r
mass public access would be the wrong way to proceed.

For this reason, it is not known w hether 'exposure' should be considered a valid
category fo r wanting to digitize archival materials. Nonetheless, because it was specifically
stated by the interviewee, it was decided to include it here.

5.6

Adm inistrative requests

Adm inistrative requests was mentioned by Institution C as a reason fo r digitizing items.
This reason refers to an instance whereby the institution's adm inistration had a hand in the

101 O m e k a is a 3 rd-p a rty o n lin e c o n te n t m a n a g e m e n t s o ftw a re p la tfo rm fo r c u ra tin g d ig ital collections.
h tt p : //o m e k a .o r g /

44

decision to digitize part of a collection. As the interviewee stated, "To be respectful and
responsive to the family, to the donors, our adm inistration decided we would scan that small
portion. So we've created . . . w hat I would think of as a m ini-digital collection." Here, the
involvem ent of third parties is influencing the digitization of materials. In this situation, the
archivist has had the decision of w hat to digitize removed.

5.7

Preservation

One institution, Institution A, also cited preservation as a reason to digitize. As
m entioned during the description of Institution A in Chapter 4, the interviewee explained that
preservation was a consideration fo r reducing wear and tear on heavily used archival materials.
None of the other interviewees in any way mentioned reducing patron access as a reason to
digitize either specific items or an entire collection.

5.8

Donations

One question asked of each of the participants was w hether or not they accepted
donations w ith the main goal o f wanting to digitize the collection. It was thought that this might
have been a way in which archives might use personal judgm ent to decide w hat materials gain
greater public recognition and access. All four institutions said that digitization has not been in
the past or present a factor in accepting donations.

5.9

Financial

One driver of digitization that was not brought up by any of the four interviewees was
money. The impact of money as a driver of digitization is im plicit yet very tangible. Three
45

specific instances were identified where finances im plicitly drove digitization: grants, donations,
and patron requests.

Grants and monetary donations can be lumped into a single group, as the sim ilarity of
the tw o can be seen by looking at how each interacts w ith the recipients. In the case of both
grants and donations, there is an impetus to define digitization projects that w ill be able to
draw interest from a donor (whether in the form of a grant or direct financial assistance coming
from either a single person or a group) and be able to win greater support than other
institutions that may be vying fo r the same funding.102

Conversely, digitization projects that do not provide a tangible return on investment
from grantors and donors may be deemed a failure. These failures could negatively impact
funding fo r digitization projects on the whole. In addition, projects deemed a waste of money
can cause a chilling effect on similar (in this case, of digitization projects) grant-funded
endeavors.103

Patron requests can also im plicitly play a role in determ ining w hat to digitize. As noted
w ith Institutions A and D, patrons are potentially charged fo r access to digital surrogates.
However, it should be noted again that Institution A said they would charge patrons a fee only
if they themselves would incur a direct fee (such as purchasing media to save the digital
surrogate to, paying of postage, etc.). Institution D did not specify the cost involved fo r patrons

to access full-resolution copies of digital surrogates. It could be a simple m atter of control of
the intellectual property rights of the digital surrogates. And no im plication is meant that the
archives are necessarily actively trying to profit from any income received from licensing digital
items fo r third-party use as the funds may simply go back into the operating expenses fo r the
archives.

U nfortunately, inform ation about how money influences digitization, or social research,
appears to be wanting. Perhaps this area of study w ill be picked up by someone else.

W ith a look at the reasons fo r digitization, w hether explicit or im plicit, the discussion
should turn tow ard what was not been digitized. The next chapter w ill look at the subject of
w hat was left out of the digitization process, as well as policies in place guiding digitization and
the involvem ent of personal choice in such selections.

47

Chapter 6: Discussion

W ith a look at the reasons stated by each interviewee regarding the selection process of
digitization, attention can be turned tow ard the impact of those reasons. This w ill mainly focus
on w hat archival materials were implied not to be digitized. But first, a look needs to be done at
the policies guiding digitization at each of the institutions.

6.1

Policies

Of the four archives, only Institution B has a form al w ritte n policy regarding the
digitization of archival materials. The inform al policies that Institutions A, C, and D are utilizing
appear to be based more on habitual practices developed over tim e than policies that have
been researched, w ritten, and approved by any adm inistration. The one exception was
Institution C, which has a w ritte n policy that has never been reviewed and approved by the
institution's adm inistration, although it has been subm itted; thus, it is not being counted as a
form al policy fo r this thesis. The interviewee said they had developed the w ritte n policy fo r
digitization based on inform ation received from the Northeast Document Conservation Center's
guidelines.104 Although Institution C does not have a form al policy, the interviewee stated the
follow ing rationale regarding the criteria fo r selecting materials:

. . . w hat collections do we have? And w hat collections, if I'm the person who is
in position to make the call as to . . .who actually uses it; is likely to use it; how
does this fit the agenda of the institution I serve, the library? For us, it just needs
to be a process that I make a decision. I need this stuff scanned, and the people
who accomplish that carry it out. It's a question o f practicality. At a different

library w ith different resources, human and technological, I think you can afford
to be more idealistic. I still think about the criteria, but the main criteria [we are]
concerned w ith are: do we own it? Do we own both elements? Do we own it
physically and [do] we own the intellectual property rights? Beyond that,
probably how much w ork is this going to be fo r the technician who does the
scanning and the metadata librarian? And in the mix of materials that I hold, and
the agenda o f the library at the moment, how does this fit in?

As can be noted in the quotation, the interviewee at first describes a situation whereby
they simply determ ine the criteria fo r what to digitize. This thought then morphs into more
subjective ideas about intellectual rights, technical capabilities, and the am ount of staff tim e
needed to im plem ent a project.

W ith regard to the approval and im plem entation of the draft policy that was developed,
the interviewee at Institution C stated, "I was very principled and idealistic about this when we
started. And what I have found is that in addition to the criteria, we set up a process of
consideration involving way too many [people]. And my intent as the curator essentially got
lost. We were focusing too much on the conversation. And [when] we met in person . . . it
proved basically impossible to get everybody together; and everybody included administrators.
It proved so clunky and unworkable that I basically subverted it because we w eren't getting
anywhere."

Institution D has a single, inform al policy of digitizing everything pertaining to the
institution. Once completed, all archival material, and many o f the institution's threedimensional items (plates, cups, clothing, etc.) w ill be made available via its website as digital
surrogates.

49

6.2

W hat's not digitized

Another o f the questions that was asked of each interviewee was w hether or not there
had been a situation whereby only part o f a collection has been digitized. Institutions A, B, and
C said that there have been projects whereby only a part of a collection was digitized fo r public
access.

As detailed previously, the archives at Institution A mentioned tw o specific instances
where materials from a collection were not digitized. The interviewee cited an instance of
collaboration w ith another departm ent to create an online exhibit to coincide w ith a physical
exhibit. In this circumstance only specific items were needed to be digitized from the collection
that were relevant to the physical exhibit. Another such instance mentioned earlier was a grantfunded collaboration whereby Institution A digitized some materials from its collection relating
to the Civil War. Both examples illustrate a situation where only select archival materials were
digitized, but the choice of which materials to digitize was partly dictated by a third party. This
does herald a different question about w hether or not a participant should try to advocate fo r
the digitization of an entire collection, regardless of w hether or not all materials w ill be used as
part of a virtual exhibit. As noted by Barbara Craig, Susan Crane, and Ryan Davis earlier, access
to prim ary source materials helps shape collective m em ory.105 The interviewees at Institutions

50

B and C both noted student projects that utilized only specific parts o f an archival collection in
order to develop a specific online exhibit.

Institution D w ithheld digital surrogates, stating that although they have scanned
materials in th e ir archives that do not pertain to the history of the institution, and th e ir account
w ith PastPerfect would accommodate the extra digital surrogates, it was not currently th e ir
intention to pursue uploading those digital surrogates. Their goal is to only make all
institutionally related archival materials available fo r public access. All other materials w ithin
the collection are to remain w ith o u t public access to a digital surrogate. The interviewee stated
that this unw ritten policy o f not providing online all digital surrogates could change one day.
Also, although the digital surrogates that do exist but do not directly relate to the institution are
sitting on a local server, the institution does accept requests to digitize archival materials not
relating to the institution.

This lack of digitization is an example of controlling a specific narrative around a subject.
In the example of Institution A's online exhibit centering on a celebrity that tied in w ith a
physical exhibit, the institution controlled how people generally viewed the exhibition subject.
This hearkens back to the example presented regarding events as told in History Wars
surrounding the Smithsonian's attem pt to present a more nuanced and accurate depiction of
the events occurring at the end of W orld W ar II.106 A major difference between the tw o
situations was that Institution A was a w illing participant in developing a specific narrative
regarding the celebrity whereas the Smithsonian was coerced into altering its exhibit to

106 L in enthal and E n g e lh a rd t, H is to ry W ars.

51

prom ote a specific narrative. W ithout all the inform ation on an event or person readily at the
public's disposal, critical discussions to shape collective memory cannot take place.107

Institution D also presents tw o different means of controlling public access to digital
surrogates. Patrons are required to contact the institution to gain access to a full-resolution
version of the digital item, and this may require a financial transaction (at the institution's
discretion).

When looking into w hether or not any o f the four interviewees noted instances of
w ithholding digital surrogates from the public, the person at Institution A explicitly said, "we
don 't usually w ithhold anything. And we haven't taken anything dow n." Institution C
com plim ented this idea of a desire fo r not w ithholding any digital surrogates or removing them
from public access. When asked this question, the interviewee at Institution C said, "So far, no."
In all three of these cases, there seemed to be a hint of reservation about com m itting to a
definitive 'no' answer. The interviewee at Institution A included the words 'we d o n 't usually
w ith hold' even though, to date, nothing has been removed or w ithheld from public access.
Likewise, the interviewee at Institution C used the qualifying phrase 'so far' before saying 'no'
despite not having removed or w ithheld any digital surrogates.

This left only Institutions B and D, both of which have w ithheld digital surrogates from
the public, but fo r very different reasons. As stated earlier, Institution D withholds digital
surrogates that do not directly relate to the institution's history. On the other hand, Institution
B, which has w ithheld digital surrogates, does hope to provide them to the public once the

107 K erw in , "O n th e E m e rg e n c e o f 'M e m o r y '," 1 2 7 .

52

personnel have decided how to present them online. The interviewee at Institution B did state
that w ith some digital surrogates of oral histories the institution had done, there was a
possibility of having to remove the digital surrogates if a request was made.

6.3

Evidence o f personal choice

This study did reveal that in the case of these fo u r institutions, the personal influence of
those digitizing materials did play a role in determ ining what patrons have access to in an
online environm ent. In the case o f Institutions B and C, this influence can be attributed to the
desire to create virtual exhibits. This does hearken to a question in Chapter 1 about w hether or
not archivists, or th e ir assistants (i.e., student workers, volunteers, etc.), can be considered
experts on the collections w ith which they work. This can be especially pertinent when pieces
of disparate collections are being digitized to create a single, new exhibit, which in turn might
develop into a new narrative.

In the case of Institution A, parts of a collection were digitized fo r an online exhibit to
coincide w ith a physical exhibit about a celebrity associated w ith the institution. It was the
concerted e ffo rt o f those involved w ith the exhibits to pick and choose from the collection to
decide w hat to utilize, including which materials would get a digital surrogate.

Institution D made a specific decision to only digitize and make publically available
digital surrogates o f collection materials that relate to the history of the institution. This
decision leaves all other materials not relating to the institution, yet w ithin the archival
collection, more hidden than they otherwise would be if the institution did digitize and make
available all th e ir materials.
53

It should also be stated that the instances o f personal choice influencing the digitization
of materials appears to be in isolated instances and does not appear to be pervasive among the
participating institutions. All participants stated that they try to adhere to policies, w hether
w ritte n or unw ritten, when making decisions about digitization. In some cases metrics were
utilized to determ ine w hat to digitize, in other cases projects were determ ined by student
projects or collaboration w ith other institutional departments.

6.4

Impact o f the findings

It is hoped that this paper brings attention to the influences that personal choice can
have on the digitization of archival materials. Such choices can impact public access to digital
surrogates of prim ary source items, which in turn can influence collective memory. It is also
hoped that these case studies w ill spur fu rth e r research to determ ine the extent of personal
choice when deciding what primary source materials get digitized. As shown in Chapter 2, much
has been w ritte n about the digitization o f archival materials. But the current research here was
conducted to focus on one facet o f digitization that has received very little attention.

The development of policies is one step to minimizing the effects of personal choice on
the selection o f archival materials to digitize. Policies can help guide the selection process by
becoming a proxy in the decision-making process fo r an individual. Diligence and adherence to
such developed policies may aid in m itigating personal choice as a factor.

Using data analysis, such as done by Institutions B and C, to help determ ine which
collections bring in the most inquiries can help remove personal biases from the selection
process. Data analysis can also be utilized to create a priority list from which to work.
54

Another possible way to minimize the effects o f personal choice is to involve m ultiple
people to aid in the consideration of which materials and collections to digitize. Creating
com m ittees that involve people of different subject specialties and ideological backgrounds is
one solution. Such com mittees can help mitigate any o f the biases that each person carries w ith
them by diffusing the pool o f personal choice among m ultiple influences.

Similar to the development o f com mittees to reduce personal influence when
determ ining which collections to digitize, an area that is also touched upon in the case study
results is creating new exhibits through the partial digitization o f collections and thus could be
beneficial to creating new narratives. But these narratives need to be carefully considered and
should be vetted by m ultiple personnel, again similar to the selection o f what materials to
digitize; these personnel should include subject specialists in the collection being represented
(e.g., a musicologist and trum pet playing professor in the Jazz Music Department fo r a
collection on the iconic 20th-century jazz musician Miles Davis) and individuals w ith varying
points of view. Unlike defining a new narrative to shape collective memory through w riting a
research paper or a journal article, which w ill likely receive less exposure through the
restrictions often accompanying those form s of communication and cannot be as easily
disputed in print, creating a new narrative that is freely and widely accessible should be done
w ith greater caution.

6.5

Study lim itations

This is a project that, in hindsight, may have been conducted in a different manner. One
of the greatest lim itations was the total num ber of case studies completed. The lim ited data set
55

of this research is too small to represent the trends regarding the influences driving today's
digitization of archival materials. However, it is not believed that more case studies would have
been beneficial. This research established that personal choice does play a role in the decision
making, but it has not established the degree to which personal choice occurs nor how often it
occurs. The degree to which personal choice occurs and how often it occurs might be better
addressed w ith larger data sets. For example, a general survey sent to m ultiple institutions that
are digitizing archival materials would likely have provided greater insight into and a much
broader scope of trends when addressing institutions and th e ir decisions about the digitization
of th e ir archival materials. Along this line of reasoning, it is not believed that the size o f the
archival institution, based on the am ount of linear feet o f materials housed by the archives,
would impact the results of this study in any meaningful way. However, a larger data set may
establish possible links between the size of the archives and the influence o f personal choice on
digitization.

In addition, by providing a list of reasons fo r digitizing materials, study participants
would be able to read a list of answers that would aid in memory recall when answering a
question about the reason to digitize. Also, such m emory recall might instigate fu rth e r
expansion of the answers by the study participant when addressing the specific reasons they
digitize.

During this research, additional questions were not asked of any of the participants so
as to create continuity among the answers received by the interviewees. This was a lim itation
as it meant that answers gleaned from interviewee could not be applied to the next

56

interviewee as it would introduce an incomplete data set. As it was, upon analysis o f the data,
there are noted instances whereby a single interviewee brought up an instance of a specific
influence upon the digitization decision process; fo r example, the interviewee at Institution A
mentioning preservation as a reason to digitize.

Perhaps a general survey being sent out to m ultiple archival institutions asking the
reasons why they digitize would have helped establish a greater set of questions w ith specific
reasons mentioned fo r digitization. This would possibly have jogged the recall of the
interviewees as to th e ir own selection process, however, this would not have aided in
establishing that personal choice occurred in deciding w hat materials to digitize.

6.6

Future research

Although these four case studies have dem onstrated that personal choice does play a
role in the selection of materials that are digitized, and thus impacts collective memory, more
research should be done to understand the extent to which such personal choices play a role in
the selection o f archival materials to digitize.

As mentioned in the previous section, tw o questions that need to be addressed are: 1)
How often does personal choice occur in the selection process of digitizing materials? 2) To
w hat degree does personal choice influence the selection process?

Another question that could be addressed by fu rth e r research is the influence of money
on digitization. For example, how much influence do patron requests, possibly involving
financially lucrative access, have on creating digital surrogates? If archives are able to

quantitatively view statistics on patron traffic, how is this inform ation utilized and w hat are the
outcomes from such inform ation? How much digitization is driven by financial boons such as
grants and financial donations? W hat affect could this have on the digitization of archival
collections or parts of collections? Are monies influencing collective memory? If so, w hat is the
impact?

Although this study had lim itations, w ith all four institutions revealing the presence of
personal choices influencing selections there should be a greater light shined on this aspect of
digitization. Beyond investigating how pervasive this influence is, it would additionally be
interesting to reveal w hether or not different institutional types play different roles in the
selection process. Does the influence of personal choice play a part among corporate archives,
governmental archives, volunteer archives, etc. I suspect that it is the case that many, if not
most all archives, can point to instances where personal choice of the archivist(s) has dictated
the digitization of materials.

This discussion o f the evidence fo r personal choice influencing the selection of archival
materials fo r online public access has dem onstrated that such influence occurs. Again, it should
be reiterated that it was not meant to establish the degree or the am ount to which this
personal choice occurs.

Chapter 7: Conclusion

This research aimed to unravel the issue of w hether or not personal choice affects which
archival materials get digitized into digital surrogates and are made available to the public via
the internet, and which materials do not get such treatm ent. This was done through the
examination o f four repositories to develop a case study of each. M ultiple factors were looked
at, including w hether or not w ritte n and approved digitization policies were present at each
institution and by w hat means digital surrogates were chosen to be created from among the
archival materials at each institution. From this exploratory project, it has been determ ined that
personal choice does play a role in the decision-making process o f creating digital collections
and presenting them online. W ith all four institutions, an instance of a person directly
influencing the digitization process could be revealed. Although three of the institutions lack an
im plem ented w ritte n policy regarding the decision process fo r digitization projects (only
Institution B has a w ritten and approved policy), Institutions A and C do follow inform al
procedures to prevent or am eliorate personal choice entering the decision-making process.
Institution D, because of th e ir simple protocol to digitize everything relating to its own history,
has not removed personal choice entirely from playing a role in the decision process. It has
been noted that a choice not to include archival materials that do not pertain to the
institution's history is part of an unw ritten policy and these non-institutionally related materials
w ill not be made available fo r public online access.

Personal choice is not always a negative influence on collective m emory and should not
be curtailed or quashed. As discussed previously, new collective memory narratives can be

59

derived when these choices are thoughtfully, w ith expert participation, used to combine
materials from disparate collections. However, these choices to deliberately leave parts of a
collection w ith o u t a digital surrogate that are not initially deemed pertinent to collective
m emory reduce the public's ability to judge the collective memory narratives that have been
developed. Plus, leaving materials w ith o u t a digital surrogate does not allow the refutation of
collective memory narratives by the public.

How individual societies and groups color and shape th e ir sense of history, th e ir
collective memory, is dependent upon what sources o f inform ation are readily and easily
available to them . Although some factors that are beyond an archivist's control can dictate
w hat original source materials get greater access through digitization and online placement,
there are those times when choices can be individually pursued. It is those moments of
individual decision making that can have an influence on cultural memory. As Janine Solberg
remarked concerning the influence of the choices individuals make w ith regard to digitizing,
"[the y are] actively cultivating an awareness and dialogue around digital tools, and not treating
digital search and discovery activities as transparent, neutral, or inconsequential to the acts of
invention and interpretation that lie at the heart o f rhetorical histories."108

Case Study Inquiry Email

Dear (INSERT CONTACT NAME),

Hello. My name is Randy Smith and I am a graduate student in the School o f Inform ation
Studies at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee and am working on a thesis project to
determ ine w hat personal choices factor into the selection of items a repository decides to
digitize fo r online access. The criteria of this project is to mainly focus on items from a
collection that did not have a digital surrogate (a digital facsimile of a physical item meant to be
accessed via a com puter) created when the rest of a collection was digitized. I am also
interested in gaining a better understanding of w hat choices are made when choosing to
digitize one collection over another.

The impetus fo r this study is to assess w hat decisions are made when determ ining which
items from a collection an archivist transform s into digital surrogates and w hether to make
them available on the W orld Wide Web. The objective o f this study is to understand the
reasons personal, technical, and institutional factors affect the digitization and publication of
archival materials.

According to your archives' website, you have several digital collections available fo r
public access. Are you aware of a situation as described above wherein a personal, technical or
institution factor interfered w ith the creation o f a digital surrogate o f a specific item(s) from a
68

collection that was otherwise digitized? If you are aware of such a situation, would you be
w illing to meet w ith me, either in person, via Skype, or a phone conversation, to discuss the
decisions and processes that were involved in digitizing the materials from the collection(s) and
the placing of the digital surrogates online? If yes, please reply to this email and I w ill arrange a
tim e fo r the meeting. I realize the holidays can be a hectic tim e so if there is a date range or
specific times that are most preferable fo r you to meet w ith me please let me know and I w ill
try to accommodate your request. Once a meeting has been arranged, I w ill send you a copy of
the interview questions I intend to ask.

All inform ation collected during this project w ill remain confidential unless you provide
permission fo r me to do otherwise.

Thank you fo r your tim e and consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you
have any questions about this message or my research project.

Sincerely,

Randy Smith
