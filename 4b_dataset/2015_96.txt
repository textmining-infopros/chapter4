Acknowledgments
This dissertation would not have been possible without the help of so many people in so
many ways. It was also the product of a series of fortunate encounters with people who changed
the course of my career. Had I not had an opportunity to be taken under the wings of Joe Akob
and Jill Harper at East Stroudsburg University, I wouldn’t have pursued a career in higher
education. Joe and Jill’s support was instrumental in my development as a professional, and with
their guidance I learned much more than how to run a recreation center.
It was Flavius Lilly who encouraged me to pursue my doctorate at UB and was with me
the entire journey — from trying to figure out a topic, to patiently sitting through multiple
conversations about my results section. I’m the oldest of four, and have never had the experience
of being a younger sibling. But if I had an older brother, I would want him to be just like Flav. I
want to thank Deb Kohl for her support with statistics and kindly reviewing and advising my
draft when I needed it most. I also appreciate the support of my dissertation committee, Kathryn
Summers, Roger Ward, and Greg Walsh, who made time in their busy schedules to guide me
through the IRB, and evaluate my qualifying exam and dissertation. I am grateful for each of
their unique perspectives.
I want to thank my awesome husband Nick Owens, who is the kindest and most
supportive person I’ve ever known. His gentle personality contrasts my energetic existence and
he is the perfect yin to my yang. Last, I want to thank my Mom, Dad, and Grandma, and siblings
Merr, Christine and Joe. Their warmth, compassion, and energy are guiding forces in my life.

Abstract
Background and Purpose: The concept of a homogenous group of tech savvy digital natives
has recently been refuted empirically and theoretically through comprehensive literature reviews
(Jones & Shao, 2011; Bennett, Maton, & Kervin, 2008). Instead, digital natives have been found
to possess a large variation of technology use and skills (Kennedy et al., 2007). In addition, the
argument for supporting the idea of digital natives is often criticized for neglecting to study race,
socioeconomic factors, and previous experience with technology (Vaidhyanathan, 2008).
Although there is a growing body of literature about the digital literacy of undergraduate
students, there has been little, if any, research completed on the population of graduate and
professional students. There are educational differences between graduate and undergraduate
students (Hussey & Smith, 2010; Artino & Stephens, 2009; Seligman, 2012), and among
academic disciplines there are varying degrees of technology use (Weng & Ling, 2007; Fry,
2004; Fry, 2006; Guidry & BrckaLorenz, 2010). The primary purpose of this study was to
examine whether academic discipline is associated with web-use skills among the graduate and
professional students at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. The secondary purpose of this
study was to examine how age, gender, race, parental education, international status, GPA, and
self-perceived skills affect web-use skills.
Methods: Hargittai and Hsieh’s Web-use Index was adapted as the instrument for this study
(2012). The instrument has been found to be a proxy of participants’ observed web-use skills
(Hargittai, 2005). The Web-use Index was distributed online via a survey to the entire population
of 4,996 potential participants. Six hundred and ninety-nine participants completed and returned
the survey. After reviewing and removing unusable data, five hundred and fifteen eligible
participants remained in the sample. To analyze the data, the Kruskal-Wallis H test was chosen

because of its use for independent samples. The Fisher’s LSD test was used for post hoc analysis
to determine statistical differences between groups.
Results: The results showed that academic discipline affected nine of the twenty-seven web-use
variables. There were statistically significant differences (p < 0.01) for the following variables:
phishing, preference setting, reload, rss, tabbed browsing, tagging, torrent, web feeds, and wiki.
Overall, it appears that the highest scores were from the School of Law and the lowest scores
were from the School of Nursing. Race/ethnicity had an effect on ten of the twenty-seven
variables. There was statistical significance (p < 0.01) for the variables bookmarklet, cache,
frames, phishing, rss, social bookmarking, torrent, web log, widget, and wiki. It appears that
Asian/Pacific Islander participants had the highest scores and Hispanic participants had the
lowest scores. Gender was statistically significant for eighteen of the twenty-seven variables. The
variables significant for gender included cache, firewall, frames, jpg, malware, newsgroup,
phishing, podcasting, preference setting, reload, rss, spyware, tabbed browsing, torrent, web
feeds, web log, widget, and wiki. Male participants outscored female participants on every
variable. Age was statistically significant for three of the twenty-seven variables including
tabbed browsing, tagging, and torrent. GPA was only statistically significant for one of the
twenty-seven variables, which was social bookmarking. The results showed no statistical
significance for International Status or Parental Education.
Conclusion: Gender plays a larger role in the digital literacy of graduate and professional
students than other demographic factors. This may be due to a plethora of factors influenced by
gender including family life, self-efficacy, and access to technology. The high scores of
Asian/Pacific Islander students does not depart from literature within the study of digital literacy
or academic achievement in general, but other findings from this study about the impact of race

were unanticipated. An unexpected finding was that African Americans scored higher than
Caucasian participants on the Web-use Index. In the literature, African American students report
knowing less about the Internet (Hargittai, 2010) and score lower on tests measuring information
and digital literacy (Sexton, Hignite, Margavio, & Margavio, 2009; Jackson et al., 2008;
Ritzhaupt, Feng, Dawson, & Barron, 2013). It can be hypothesized that since participants in the
study are already in graduate or professional school, the effect of the socioeconomic advantage
or disadvantage of their race on web-use skills is offset. While gender and race was associated
with the digital literacy of graduate and professional students, parental education was not. This
finding marks an interesting difference between graduate and undergraduate students and is a
unique contribution to the literature. The conversation surrounding the effect of gender and race
is important in the context of digital inequality. Due to relationship of demographic factors and
digital inequality, faculty, staff, and policy makers should take action by creating initiatives that
address the skill and availability of social support for graduate and professional students.

Key words: Digital natives, digital literacy, information literacy, socioeconomic factors
and digital literacy, graduate and professional students

CHAPTER 1
1.1 Background
In 2001, Marc Prensky and others began the ‘digital native’ debate by claiming the new
generation of students were inherently digitally literate because they have always known a world
with the Internet and computers (Prensky, 2001; Tapscott, 1998; Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005).
Inclusion in their proposed digital native social cohort was based on age and includes those born
after 1980 when the PC became commonplace (Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005). In addition, Prensky
proposed that due to exposure and immersion in technology, students had developed radically
new cognitive capabilities and learning styles (2001). Proponents claim that digital natives
differed from those born before 1980, who Prensky labeled “digital immigrants.” Prensky (2001)
claimed that digital immigrants would always retain their non-native speaking “accent” and
would never fully be able to adapt to their new digital environment.
Digital natives are characterized as having a high level of digital aptitude and literacy,
being constantly connected online, wanting information to be procured quickly and accurately,
their ability to multi-task, their dependence on technology to maintain social contact, their
openness to share content, and their ability to rapidly understand and adopt new technologies
(Dede, 2005; Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005). Since this concept has become popular, an abundance
of other terms have been coined with many subtle variations such as the “Net Generation”
(Tapscott, 1998), “Millennials” (Howe & Stauss, 2000), and “Generation Y” (Jorgensen, 2003).
Each name varies slightly, but the terms are often used interchangeably (Jones & Shao, 2011).
There has been much discussion and debate among academics, practitioners and policy
makers surrounding the characteristics and abilities of digital natives. Advocates of digital
natives claim 1) there is a single new generation of new students who make extensive use of new

10

technology; 2) there is a gap between learners and teachers; and 3) education needs to change to
meet the learning styles of new students. The early research on this topic made bold claims about
digital natives’ characteristics and abilities, but is often criticized for lacking adequate
methodologies (Bennet & Maton, 2010).
An example of an early claim championing generational characteristics is the one made
by Howe & Strauss (2000). In their book Millennials Rising, Howe and Strauss coined the phrase
‘Millennials’ and made sweeping claims about the characteristics of that generation. An
examination of the methodology by Hesel and May (2007) raised questions about the design of
Howe and Strauss’s study. Although they used a wide variety of sources including government
agencies and Internet user groups, many of these sources were anecdotal (Hesel & May, 2007).
In addition to their anecdotal sources, they conducted a survey of 600 students and teachers in a
wealthy suburb in Fairfax, Virginia. In Fairfax, the median household income is over twice the
national average and racial diversity comes mainly from Asian Americans, while African
Americans and Hispanic students were underrepresented compared to the national average
(Hesel & May, 2007). The socioeconomic assets of the participants in the study are not reflective
of the generation as a whole, and it is likely that this sample is very different from the majority of
students in their digital native age cohort.
The concept of a homogenous group of tech savvy digital natives demanding changes to
pedagogy has recently been refuted empirically and theoretically through comprehensive
literature reviews compiled by Jones and Shao (2011), and Bennett, Maton, and Kervin (2008).
In addition, the argument for supporting the idea of digital natives is often criticized for
neglecting to study race, socioeconomic factors, and previous experience with technology
(Vaidhyanathan, 2008). Bennett and Maton (2010) called the concept of digital natives a

11

‘certainty-complacency spiral’ and observed the uncritical reproduction of the term gives digital
natives undeserved credibility and significance.
Overall, evidence shows that today’s students are not a single group or generation with
common characteristics, but who instead have various interests, motives, and behaviors. Jones
and Shao’s recent literature review found that there was “no evidence that there is a single new
generation of young students entering higher education and the terms net generation and digital
native do not capture the processes of change that are taking place” (2011, p. 1). In addition,
Jones and Shao (2011) found that “demographic factors interact with age to pattern students’
responses to new technologies” (2011, p. 1). Kennedy et al. (2007) studied 2,500 first-year
students and found a large variation of technology use among the students, while Kennedy et al.
(2008) found very little difference between how digital native students and their digital
immigrant teachers use technology.
In light of the critical response, these generational arguments are still popularized and
preached as a science throughout educational culture, perpetuating Bennet and Maton’s
‘certainty-complacency spiral’ (2010). One can’t look through their LinkedIn newsfeed without
seeing another article about ‘How to Help Millennials Learn’, or How to Be a Good Employer
for Tech-Savvy Generation Y.’ Marketing this concept to universities is big business; universities
are paying handsomely for advice to help them understand their new students (Hoover, 2009).
So if university students aren’t inherently digitally literate, how digitally literate are they
really? Hargittai (2010) found that considerable variation exists even among college students
with high levels of Internet access when she completed her study in 2008 of 1,060 first-year
students, most of them 18 and 19 years old. She controlled the variables of education and age,
and found that most of them were highly “wired” with multiple points of Internet access. For the

12

study, the students provided a self-assessment of their web experience and web use skills. She
found that those from families with at least one parent holding a graduate degree exhibit
statistically significantly higher levels of know-how about the Internet than others (2010). In
addition, she found that students of lower socioeconomic status, women, students of Hispanic
origin, and African Americans exhibit lower levels of Internet literacy than others and engage in
fewer information seeking activities (2010).
Kennedy, Judd, Dalgarno, & Waycott (2010) conducted a study of 2,096 first-year
students between ages 17 and 26 from three Australian universities to learn more about their
technology skills and preferences. They found that only 15 percent of the students were
advanced users of technology and almost half of the students were basic users, using only
standard web-based applications and mobile phones. It appears that a subset of students in their
study fit the concept of the tech-savvy digital natives, but these students are in the minority. “In a
single class at a university there are major differences in students’ experiences and preferences in
relation to technology” (Kennedy et al., 2010). Kennedy et al. did not collect demographic
information for participants, so although it is apparent there are differences in skill, it is not
possible to see if socioeconomic factors had any influence in their study.
Most of the literature about digital natives has focused on the skills and abilities of
undergraduate students. Many graduate and professional students also fall under the same age
range as digital natives, which at the time of this study is 35 years old and younger. Every ten
years the Department of Education surveys students for basic demographic information, and in
2010 the average age of graduate students in the United States was 32 (U.S. Department of
Education, 2010). This falls within the bounds of the age cohort of digital natives. The lack of
research on graduate and professional students has been attributed to a belief that graduate

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

13

students have adequate skills because they have advanced through an undergraduate experience
(O’Donnell et al., 2009). So not only are graduate students underrepresented in the literature, but
there is an assumption that they have already gained the skills that they need.
Although there is a dearth of literature about differences between the digital literacy of
graduate and undergraduate students, there is some literature about general educational
differences between the two groups. While undergraduates typically learn foundational content
in a broad curriculum, graduate students are often focused on higher-level content in a specific
professional field (Seligman, 2012). The specificity of the education of graduate and professional
students may exclude training or emphasis on digital literary skills, or operate under the premise
that graduate level learners are already digitally literate. There is an assumption in higher
education that graduate students develop skills by virtue of learning through required academic
tasks and having proximity to other students and faculty (Hurst, Cleveland-Innes, Hawranik, &
Gauvreau, 2013).
As undergraduate students transition to become graduate students, they develop to
become more autonomous learners and are encouraged to pursue their studies under their own
direction (Hussey & Smith, 2010). Also, and as to be expected, graduate students are reported to
have engaged in deeper levels of critical thinking than undergraduates (Artino & Stephens,
2009). Since many frameworks and definitions of digital literacy integrate elements of critical
thinking (Calvani, Fini, & Ranieri, 2010; Bawden, 2001; Cornell University, 2013; American
Library Association, 1989), there also may be an assumption that graduate students are operating
on higher cognitive levels than undergraduate students and thus may have more advanced digital
literacy skills.

14

Research indicates that socioeconomic factors such as parental education, gender, and
race affect the digital literacy of undergraduate students (Hargittai, 2010). In light of the
differences in critical thinking, autonomy, and specificity of training, it is plausible that the
socioeconomic factors that affect the digital literacy of undergraduates may affect the digital
literacy of graduate students differently. Graduate students have characteristics that differ from
undergraduate students, and due to these differences the effect of socioeconomic factors should
be explored in more detail.
When discussing digital literacy, it is also important to take into account the role
academic discipline plays in the identity and skills of graduate and professional students.
Graduate and professional disciplinary communities have been described as tribes or territories
because their unique cultures make their academic communities different from each other
(Becher, 1989; Becher & Trowler, 2001). Differences between disciplines include research and
publications, career paths, symbols of identity, and student training (Clark, 1999).
Biglan (1973) classified academic disciplines into three dimensions, pure vs. applied,
hard vs. soft, and life vs. non-life. Pure disciplines are illustrated as being concerned with the
building of theory (e.g. physics), while disciplines located on the applied dimension (e.g.
medicine) are more concerned with applied theory. Hard dimension disciplines (e.g. dentistry)
are characterized as having a single paradigm and are more likely to have consensus about
methodology. This differs from soft dimension disciplines (e.g. marketing), which are
characterized as less likely to have consensus about methodology and also as being nonparadigmatic. Last, life disciplines are concerned with life systems (e.g. social work) where nonlife disciplines, such as law, are not.

15

Differences have been found among academic disciplines. Faculty in hard areas have
been found to be very different from their soft-area colleagues when measuring social
connectedness, commitment to teaching, and scholarly output (Biglan, 1973b). Weng and Ling
(2007) found that some academic disciplines are more likely to use information and
communication technology (ICT) due to the nature of their programs. Research cultures such as
the pure, hard disciplines of science and health science are more likely to strategically
incorporate the use of ICT into their fields (Fry, 2004), while soft disciplines in the social
sciences are more likely to incorporate ICTs in an as needed and localized manner (Fry, 2006).
In addition, further studies have found differences in academic discipline by technology
acceptance (Orji, 2010) risk perception of technologies (Weisenfeld & Ott, 2010), and general
use of technology (Guidry & BrckaLorenz, 2010). Each academic disciplinary community has its
own unique identity, which influences how students are educated, trained, and socialized.
Because of the unique academic disciplinary identity and characteristics of graduate students,
academic discipline should not be ignored when striving to understand the digital literacy of
graduate students.

1.2 Research Question and Specific Aim
There has been a call for research around the subject, emphasizing a need for more
evidence to provide an accurate picture of how students are using and adopting technology
(Bennett et al., 2008). In addition, a recent report from the UK’s National Union of Students
advises pursuing research into the specific ICT needs and characteristics of postgraduates and
students over 30 (NUS, 2010). Although there is a growing body of literature about the digital
literacy of undergraduate students, there has been little if any research completed on the
population of graduate and professional students. To address this gap, this study hopes to

16

investigate how academic and socioeconomic factors affect the digital literacy of graduate and
professional students. The study will be conducted at the University of Maryland, Baltimore
(UMB) due to the availability of graduate and professional students enrolled in differing
academic disciplines.
UMB was founded in 1807 and has had a rich history in Baltimore. Today, this 71-acre
research and technology complex encompasses 65 buildings in West Baltimore near the Inner
Harbor. UMB is Maryland's only public health, law, and human services university. Its seven
professional and graduate schools train the majority of the state's physicians, nurses, dentists,
lawyers, social workers, pharmacists, as well as a substantial number of the state’s biomedical
scientists (University of Maryland, Baltimore, 2015). The student body is comprised of 88
percent graduate and professional students, and in fall of 2014 enrolled 6,276 students.
The primary purpose of this research is to examine whether academic discipline is
associated with web-use skills among the graduate and professional students at the University of
Maryland, Baltimore. To the best of this author’s knowledge, the effect of academic discipline
on digital literacy has not yet been investigated in the literature. When applying Biglan’s (1973)
paradigm of academic disciplines matrix to UMB’s graduate and professional schools, it is
apparent that the schools fall in different dimensions. Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry, and
Nursing are applied, hard, and life disciplines. Social Work is a pure, soft, life discipline, and
Law is an applied, soft, and non-life discipline. Based off of this framework, the different
disciplines at UMB may be associated with different uses of ICT and varying levels of digital
literacy skills.

The secondary purpose is to investigate how age, gender, race, parental education,
international status, GPA, and self-perceived skills are associated with web-use skills. In
literature, these demographics have been shown to be factors that influence digital literacy. The
impact of these factors is addressed in depth during the literature review.
The intent of the study is to obtain data that will be used to improve programs and
services addressing digital literacy and technology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore and
to make recommendations for students, faculty, staff, and policy-makers. This study will
contribute to existing research regarding digital literacy and by investigating a population whose
digital literacy and web-use skills have not been explored.
The literature review that follows in the next chapter examines the current body of
knowledge regarding digital literacy models, factors that affect digital literacy, and assessment of
student learning. This background was necessary to understand what digital literacy is, how to
measure it, and what socioeconomic factors affect it. The methodology in Chapter 3 describes
the research methods, which includes an overview of the statistical analysis and the study
procedures. The results of this study are documented in Chapter 4 and include descriptive
statistics and a nonparametric analysis of the data collected. The discussion in Chapter 5
describes the study’s limitations, examines its contributions to research, and discusses the
implications of the results.

CHAPTER II
LITERATURE REVIEW

The purpose of this study is to determine whether academic discipline is associated with
web-use skills among graduate and professional students at the University of Maryland,
Baltimore. The overall goal is to use the results to be able to discuss the implications of the data
for students, educators, administrators, and policy markers. It is important that students are
capable users of technology because they live in a world where the impact of technology grows
greater by the day. Technology is radically changing entire industries and professions. Where it
once may have been acceptable to have a single skillset for employment, now flexibility is
paramount. Students are being prepared for jobs that have not yet been created, and they need to
be equipped with the cognitive skills and practical wherewithal to be successful in the
intersection of uncertainty and opportunity. The key areas this literature review will be focusing
on are:
•

Digital literacy (Sections 2.1 – 2.6)

•

Technology use and assessment (Sections 2.7 – 2.14)

•

Factors that affect digital literacy (Sections 2.15 – 2.20)

2.1 Defining Digital
Digital literacy has many definitions and derivatives and it is necessary to clarify
definitions and concepts that will be referenced through this study. The concept of “digital” is
characterized by electronic and computerized technology (Merriam-Webster Definition, 2013).

More specifically, it refers to the shift that began when IBM launched the “Personal Computer”
(PC) in 1981 and kick-started a consumer-friendly, home-computing revolution (Elliot, 2011).
In addition, it is also essential to note the pivotal role the development and growth the
Internet plays into the concept of digital. The Internet allows people to connect in new ways and
gives people access to incredible amounts of information. Internet capable mobile devices and
tablets, which have been experiencing incredible growth in popularity, have further connected
people and allow users to access information anywhere with Internet access. As of January 2014,
90 percent of American adults have a cell phone and 58 percent of American adults have
smartphones. Also in 2014, 42 percent of American adults are reported to have a tablet computer
and 32 percent have an e-reader (Mobile Technology Fact Sheet, 2014). Looking at the younger
adult demographic, 97 percent of those between the ages of 18-29 have cell phones and 80
percent of those between 18-29 have smartphones (Brenner, 2013). This definition of digital
concerns the ubiquitous nature of the PC, the Internet, and Internet-capable mobile devices and
their integration into user’s everyday lives, workplaces, and educational settings.
Technology is changing college students’ day-to-day lives. Cultural transformations in
recent years have been strongly linked to the developments of technology and have changed how
students consume information (Buckingham & Willett, 2006). The introduction of technology
“raises discussions about what it means to be able to ‘read’ and ‘write’” in a cultural sense and is
“understood as interpretation of and access to information and how we communicate and express
ourselves” (Erstad, 2008, p. 177-178).

2.2 Digital Literacy Origins
The concept of digital literacy was first introduced by Paul Gilster in 1997. Rather than
list skills, competencies, or attitudes defining digital literacy, he defined it more conceptually as
	  

© Jenny Owens 2015	  

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

20

a way to understand and to use information from a variety of digital sources and regarded it
simply as literacy in the digital age. “Digital literacy is about mastering ideas, not keystrokes”
(Gilster, 1997). Gilster’s definition of digital literacy is not about any particular technology but
instead about “ideas and mindsets, within which particular skills and competencies operate”
(Bawden, 2008, p. 19).
In recent years, there has been an interest in how traditional definitions of literacy has
changed due to newer technologies. Extending the application of the term literacy is a common
practice and the term is morphing into a “vague synonym for competence or even skill”
(Buckingham, 2008, p. 75). Some scholars argue that literacy should only be defined as it relates
to writing (Barton, 1994), while others argue that visual media requires a process of cultural
learning (Messaris, 1994). Visocky O’Grady and Visocky O’Grady found that “in a knowledge
economy, our understanding of the term "literacy" has expanded. It no longer simply refers to
reading and writing skills, but also focuses on the ability to find, process, interpret, and apply
information” (2008, p. 91).
There are many terms and definitions for digital literacy and related concepts. Cornell
University’s Digital Literacy Resource defines digital literacy as the ability to “find, evaluate,
utilize, share, and create content using information technologies and the Internet” (2013). EshetAlkalai (2004) calls digital literacy “survival skills in the digital era” comprised of five literacies
including photo-visual literacy, reproduction literacy, information literacy, branching literacy,
and social-emotional literacy. Another variation of digital literacy is Hargittai’s (2005) weboriented digital literacy, or the measure of users’ actual knowledge of computer and Internet
related terms and functions.

2.3 Information Literacy
Information literacy may be the most well known new literacy and is the base of many
other definitions. Paul Zurkowski coined the term information literacy in 1974, but his definition
was quite different then than how the term is used today. Zurkowski associated information
literacy with the effective use of information, specifically with problem solving in a commercial
environment (Bawden, 2001). Burchinal (1976) gave a similar use of the term that also
emphasized problem solving. There was criticism that this view didn’t address any aspects of
citizenship and could be broader than just having a work related focus (Bawden, 2001). More
recently, information literacy has been defined as to “be able to recognize when information is
needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information”
(American Library Association, 1989). The term “information literacy” is now used largely, but
not exclusively, by the library community.

2.4 Other Related Literacies
In addition to the many definitions of digital literacy, there are also other related terms
that address similar topics, although many definitions possess nuances to distinguish themselves.
Some of the more common terms include information literacy, information communication and
technology (ICT) literacy, media literacy, communication literacy, visual literacy, network
literacy, e-literacy, web literacy, and Internet literacy. A few of authors have tried to organize the
concepts including Bawden (2001), and more recently Kope (2006). Table 2.4.1 lists and defines
related literacies.
Due to the sheer number of definitions and somewhat confusing terminology, the
development and use of the concept of digital literacy is often difficult to employ. Eshet-Alkalai
(2004) suggests that the unclear use of the terms causes ambiguity and that leads to poor

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

22

communication and misunderstanding. Different naming conventions create different
assumptions about what the terms means. Also, Eshet-Alkalai finds that there is a particular
inconsistency between those who see digital literacy as operational, concerned with technical
skills, and those who see it conceptually, or focused on cognitive and socio-emotional aspects of
working in a digital environment (Eshet-Alkalai, 2004).

Table 2.4.1 Related Literacies
Terminology

Definition

Communication
Literacy

Learners must be able to communicate effectively as individuals and work
collaboratively in groups, using publishing technologies, the Internet, as well as
other electronic and telecommunication tools (Martin, 2008).

Computer literacy

In vogue in the 1980s, computer literacy is being able to use software packages
effectively (Martin, 2008).

Computer literacy

Computer literacy is to use technology as a tool for organization,
communication, research, and problem solving (Eisenberg & Johnson, 2002).

Digital Competence

Digital Competence is to be able to explore and face new technological
situations in a flexible way, to analyze, select and critically evaluate data and
information, to exploit technological potentials in order to represent and solve
problems and build shared and collaborative knowledge, while fostering
awareness of one’s own personal responsibilities and the respect of reciprocal
rights/obligations. (Calvani, Fini & Ranieri, 2009).

Digital literacy

Digital literacy is a way to understand and to use information from a variety of
digital sources and is regarded simply as literacy in the digital age (Gilster,
1997).

Digital literacy (2)

Digital literacy is a survival skill in the digital era comprised of five other
literacies including photo-visual literacy, reproduction literacy, information
literacy, branching literacy, and social-emotional literacy (Eshet-Alkalai, 2004).

Digital literacy (3)

Digital literacy is comprised of the following tenants:
• “Knowledge assembly,” building a “reliable information hoard” from
diverse sources

Retrieval skills, plus “critical thinking” for making informed judgments
about retrieved information, with wariness about the validity and
completeness of internet sources
Reading and understand non-sequential and dynamic material
Awareness of the value of traditional tools in conjunction with
networked media
Awareness of “people networks” as sources of advice and help
Using filters and agents to manage incoming information
Being comfortable with publishing and communicating information, as
well as accessing it (Bawden, 2001).

Digital literacy (4)

Digital literacy is the ability to successfully navigate encounters with the
electronic infrastructures and tools that make possible the world of the twentyfirst century (Martin, 2005).

E-literacy (short for
electronic literacy)

E-literacy combines traditional skills of computer literacy, aspects of
information literacy, the ability to find, organize, and make use of digital
information, and knowledge construction and expression (Martin, 2003, 2005)
E-literacy is a much debated topic that may have been more widely adopted if
not for the confusion with similar sounding illiteracy.

Information literacy

Used largely by the library community, information literacy is the basis for
many other definitions of new literacy. To be information literate is to be able
to:
• Recognize a need for information
• Identify what information is needed
• Find the information
• Evaluate the information
• Organize the information
• Use the information (American Library Association, 1989).

Information
literacy (2)

Someone who is information literate is able to:
• Engage in independent self-directed learning
• Use information processes
• Use a variety of information technologies and systems
• Internalize values that promote information use
• Have sound knowledge of the world of information
• Approach information critically
• Determine their own personal information style
Information literacy less as a series of competencies to be mastered and more as
a set of general knowledge and attitudes to be possessed by an information
literate person (Bruce, 1997).

Literacy

To be literate means the individual has the following seven components:
• Tool literacy – competence in using hardware and software tools
• Resource literacy – understanding forms of, and access to, information
resources
• Social-structural literacy – understanding the production and social
significance of information
• Research literacy – using IT tools for research and scholarship
• Publishing literacy – ability to communicate and publish information
• Emerging technologies literacy – understanding of new developments in
IT
• Critical literacy – ability to evaluate the benefits of new technologies
(Shapiro & Hughes, 1996).

Network literacy

Network literacy focuses on digital information in networked form (McClure,
1994).

Informancy

Informancy implies traditional literacy, plus information literacy (Neelameghan,
1995).

Information
Communication
Technology (ICT)
literacy

ICT literacy is using digital technology, communication tools, and/or networks
to access, manage, integrate, evaluate, and create information in order to
function in a knowledge society. The definition reflects the concept of ICT
literacy as a continuum, which allows the measurement of various aspects of
literacy, from daily life skills to the transformative benefits of ICT proficiency
(International ICT Literacy Panel, 2002).

Internet literacy

Internet literacy is the capability to access and evaluate online information
(Eisenberg & Johnson, 2002).

Internet literacy (2)

Internet literacy is online search competence (Harkham Semas, 2002).

Internet literacy (3)

Internet literacy is having skills with connectivity, security, communication,
multimedia, and web page development (Hofstetter, 2003).

Multimedia literacy

Since a digital source could generate many forms of information (text, images,
sounds, etc) a new definition of literacy was necessary to make sense of these
new forms of presentation. Lanham coined the term multimedia literacy to
address this new literacy (Lanham, 1995).

Media Literacy

Media literacy is represented by four broad concepts, 1) representation, 2)
language, 3) production, and 4) audience (Buckingham, 2003).

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

25

Media Literacy

Media literacy attempts to consolidate strands from the communication multiliteracies that correspond with the convergence of text, sound and image. It has
been associated with the ability to make sense of all media and genre, from the
more classic education fare to popular culture (Tyner, 1998).

Mediacy

Mediacy is the ability to deal with digital information in a variety of media
(Inoue, Naito & Koshizuka, 1997).

Technology literacy

Technology literacy is an individual’s abilities to adopt, adapt, invent, and
evaluate technology to positively affect his or her life, community, and
environment (Hansen, 2005).

Visual literacy

Visual literacy refers to a group of vision-competences a human being can
develop by seeing and at the same time having and integrating other sensory
experiences. The development of these competencies is fundamental to normal
human learning. When developed, they enable a visually literate person to
discriminate and interpret the visible actions, objects, symbols, natural or manmade, that he encounters in his environment (Debes, 1969).

Web-oriented digital
literacy

Web-oriented digital literacy is the measure of users actual knowledge of
computer and Internet-related terms and functions (Hargiatti & Hsieh, 2012).

Lankshear and Knobel distinguished between conceptual definitions of digital literacy
from standardized operational definitions (2006). Conceptual definitions view digital literacy as
a general idea or an ideal. In contrast, standardized operational definitions “operationalize”
digital literacy in terms of certain tasks, performances, demonstrations of skills, etc. and advance
these as a standard for general adoption (Lankshear & Knobel, 2008).
Some of the terms, such as computer literacy, e-literacy, network literacy, and
informancy have been outgrown. The terms used most frequently in the literature about new
literacies are digital literacy and information literacy. A main differentiator for those terms still
in use is the difference between whether the term has an operational or conceptual definition.
Purely operational definitions are quickly dated, because as technology changes the definition

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

26

becomes irrelevant. For example, computer literacy is being able to use software packages
effectively. Given the variety of software that now exists—from Microsoft Excel to the Adobe
Creative Suite—it is unrealistic to expect someone to be able to use them all. It is not as
important to be able to use all software packages, but instead it is more important for students to
be able select and use the ones that are applicable to their lives.
The terms and definitions that will live on will are likely to be conceptual terms that
employ a cognitive dimension. The hardware and interfaces of technology will change over time.
The most important ability to have will not be learning a specific set skill, but instead to be able
to conceptually navigate those changes over time. Digital is not an end, but instead a means to an
end. It transforms the way people gather information and interact with the world. Successfully
literate people will be equipped to evolve with the technology around them.

2.5 Conceptual Frameworks for Digital Literacy
Due to the constant nature of changes in technology, the trend of the definition of digital
literacy has evolved to a more conceptual definition, rather than focusing on technical
operational requirements. There are only a few frameworks for digital and related literacies, and
most of them have elements of higher levels of cognition. Calvani et al. (2010) created a widely
used framework that embraces the concept that digital competence is “not the results of simple
elements of ability or instrumental knowledge, but rather a complex integration between
cognitive processes and dimensions as well as methodological and ethical awareness.”
Calvani et al. (2010) define digital competence as “being able to explore and face new
technology situations in a flexible way, to analyze select, and critically evaluate data and
information, to exploit technological potentials in order to represent and solve problems and

build shared and collaborative knowledge, while fostering awareness of one’s own personal
responsibilities and the respect of reciprocal rights/obligations” (See Chart 2.5.1).

The framework is comprised of three coexisting and integrated dimensions;
technological, cognitive, and ethical.
•

technological dimension: being able to explore and face problems and new
technological contexts in a flexible way;

•

cognitive dimension: being able to read, select, interpret and evaluate data and
information taking into account their pertinence and reliability;

•

ethical dimension: being able to interact with other individuals constructively and
with sense of responsibility using available technologies;

•

Integration between the three dimensions: understanding the potential offered by
technologies which enable individuals to share information and collaboratively
build new knowledge (Calvani et al., 2010).

One of the premises of this model is that individuals are constantly facing new tools and
applications as a requirement of contemporary society. This framework emphasizes that
individuals need to be flexible and able to adapt to new technologies and use their pre-existing
knowledge to face and master the unknown (Calvani et al., 2010). What this model has that
many others do not is the element of the ethical dimension of technology use. This is particularly
important due to the rise of ethical issues such as plagiarism or cyberbullying in higher
education. Cyberbullying, for example, can be worse than traditional bullying as there is an
increased potential for a larger audience and anonymity, and lower levels of direct feedback and
supervision (Sticca & Perren, 2012). It is important that individuals are made aware and educated
on the impact of their technology use and this is why the ethical component is an important
dimension.

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

29

Another model is Levels of Digital Literacy developed by Mayes and Fowler (2006).
This framework approaches digital literacy on three levels. First is digital competence, which
consists of learning basic skills and techniques. The second level is digital usage, or using and
applying the concepts. Last is digital transformation, which is when the individual has mastered
the usage and is able to use the tools for innovation.

Chart 2.5.2 Levels of Digital Literacy (Mayes & Fowler, 2006)
Level III: Digital Transformation (innovation/creativity)

Level II: Digital Usage (professional/discipline application)
Level I: Digital Competence (skills, concepts, approaches, attitudes)

It is interesting to look at this framework in the lens of how information is consumed on
electronic devices. Many of the popular devices today are designed to consume information
rather than create information (personal communication, S. Carton, Feb. 2014). For example, an
iPad is great for reading, or to use apps to navigate tasks such as online banking, but it lacks
some of the more powerful capabilities of creation. An iPad can be difficult to write at length on,
at least without a keyboard. It doesn’t have the memory for powerful statistical software or
design applications. The iPad is better suited for transactions and the consumption of information
than the creation of new things.
If you applied this line of thought to Mayes and Fowler’s (2006) model of Levels of
Digital Literacy, the user would hover at levels 1 and 2, but wouldn’t necessarily progress to

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

30

level 3. When a user is using a tool to consume information rather than create, they are not
challenged to master the tools or use them for innovation and creativity.

2.6 Collaboration and Culture
Digital tools create new platforms for creativity. New literacies are seen as “more
collaborative,” “participatory”, “more distributed”, and “less individuated” by Lankshear and
Knobel (2006). Collaborative authorship relies on the input of multiple people and can be
organized or organic. Lorenzo, Dziuban, and Oblinger observed that students are not just
consuming information, but instead are taking existing material, adding or removing elements,
and then republishing. These derivative works bypass traditional methods of production and
publication (2007). Individuals are able to use online tools to “remix” information in ways that
have never been done before. The term “digital remixing” has been coined to describe how
individuals are using digital tools to create new possibilities for getting access to information,
producing, sharing, and reusing (See Chart 2.6.1).

Chart 2.6.1 Graphical Representation of Different Modes of Remix (Diakpolous, 2005)

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

31

Depending on what is being remixed, there are often fewer financial barriers to entry and
information can be shared widely and quickly through self-authorship platforms such as
YouTube or WordPress. What’s unique about digital remixing is that a diverse group of the
population can take part in digital remixing, not just the elite or specific technical groups.
Although many people are online creating and remixing content, it should be noted that in the
United States those that create content make up only 23 percent of the online adult population (Li
& Bernoff, 2008). This again goes back to the idea of creation vs. consumption – more people
are consuming than creating information online.
Others view literacy through the lens of culture. Lankshear and Knobel (2008) see
literacy as “socially recognized ways of generating, communicating, and negotiating meaningful
content as members of discourses through the medium of encoded text” (p. 249). Scribner and
Cole (1981) call literacy a social practice used for developing social and patterned ways of using
technology to accomplish goals. Literacy is similar to a family of socially evolved and patterned
activities such as letter writing, keeping records and inventories, keeping a diary, posting
announcements, etc. (Knobel & Lankshear, 2008).
Many contemporary popular cultural pursuits involve highly technical and specialist
styles of language (Shaffer & Gee, 2005). People of all ages are engaging with “digital artifacts.”
Surrounding these artifacts are complex vocabularies in order to understand the rules of video
games or to master concepts for operating specific software or technologies (Lankshear &
Knobel, 2008). Twitter is a good example of this because users have their own vocabulary
(tweet, hashtag) and ways of interacting when using their platform (mentions).
Scribner and Cole (1981) found that literacies change over time due to social-cultural
processes and McGarry (1993) observed that literacy is a relative concept. “To be literate in

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

32

Honduras is not the same as to be literate in Hampstead, London” (Bawden, 2001). The
continuum ranges from being able to read and write to logical thinking, higher order cognitive
skills, and reasoning. “For most of the last centuries that the term has been in use, it has meant
being well educated, well-read, versed in literature and letters” (Bawden, 2001). Barton and
Hamilton define literacy as “something people do; it is an activity located in the space between
thought and text” (1998, p. 3). Being literate therefore involves an understanding not just of how
to read and write, but also involves awareness of ‘social stuff’ that surrounds text (Davies, 2008).
If digital literacy is viewed through the lens of culture and ‘social stuff’ it can be
compared to a type social capital. Social capital has the potential to increase one’s sense of
community, grant access to information and knowledge, and provide status and recognition
(Bohn, Buchta, Hornik, & Mair, 2014). Not having the skillset to or the cognitive mental model
to use technology could potentially impair an individuals’ ability to connect with others in
addition to impeding their access to information.

2.7 Student Use of Technology
Internet capable mobile devices are growing in popularity with 89 percent of students
owning smartphones in 2014 (Pearson Student Mobile Device Survey, 2014), up from 66 percent
in 2010 (Smith, Salaway, & Caruso, 2010). Ownership of computers by students has remained
steady at 98 percent between 2006 and 2009 (Smith et al., 2010) although there was a drop in the
number of desktop users and a rapid rise in laptop ownership. Seven out of ten students own a
computer newer than two years old and laptops are still the most commonly used mobile device
for academic use (Smith et al., 2010). Nearly 45 percent of college students report that they
regularly use a tablet in 2014, up from 40 percent in 2013. Although tablet use is lower than

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

33

smartphone and laptop use, 81 percent of students think that tablets will transform the way
college students learn in the future (Pearson Student Mobile Device Survey, 2014).
In addition to what technologies students are using, it is important to understand how
students use technology. In 2002, the Pew Internet and American Life Project (PEW) began
collecting data about college students’ use of Internet and computer technologies, specifically
how they accessed information and communicated with friends and fellow students (Jones,
Ramanau, Cross, & Healing, 2010). Data was collected using large surveys from two and fouryear institutions at 27 U.S. colleges and universities, ethnographic observations of life in
Chicago area institutions, and PEW survey findings of American’s use of the Internet in 2001
and 2002. They found college students were engaged in more online activities than the average
adult, such as music downloading, file sharing, instant messaging, and online chatting (Jones et
al., 2010).
Since 2004, the ECAR Study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology has
sought to discover how university students use technology for both academic and non-academic
use (Smith et al., 2010). The 2010 report suggest that undergraduates may become leaders
among the early users of cloud computing as almost three-quarters of the 36,950 students
reported using at least one web-based tool for a course in the spring 2010. In addition, Kennedy
et al. (2007) surveyed 2,588 first-year students at several Australian universities. They
investigated how students used 41 different applications of new technologies in their academic
and personal lives. Searching for information on the web, email, use of a mobile device, and text
messaging were used very frequently by a large majority of students (Kennedy et al., 2007).
Students are using technology in different ways in academic and non-academic contexts.
Outside of school, students are using email, social media, texting and talking on cell phones, and

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

34

instant messaging (Corrin et al. 2010). Communication technologies dominate students’ use of
technological tools with 95 percent of students using text messaging in 2010, remaining
consistent over the past four years (Smith et al., 2010). When using technology for academic
study, regular use of social networking and IMing for communication was much lower than
mobile phone and email communication (Corrin, et al., 2010). In addition, writing a blog,
building websites and using RSS feeds are not frequently used, and a majority of students
reported having never completed these activities (Corrin, et al., 2010).
In addition, Corrin et al. found that the frequency of use of technology for academic
activities is lower than everyday life for the students in the study (2010). “It is unclear if this is
caused by a lack of integration of technology into teaching or if students are not motivated to use
technology to support their learning” (Corrin et al. 2010, p. 649). Selwyn also noted that
although there has been considerable growth in access to technological tools, students’ use of
technology is often used for “social and entertainment purposes, but not for learning” (2009).
So how are students using technology for in their educational experience? More than 94
percent of students reported using their universities’ website for school, work, and recreation,
and 90 percent of students were using the course or learning management systems (Smith et al.,
2010). In school, students are accessing information on the Internet, using email, word
processing, math and science based programs, texting on cell phones, and accessing electronic
databases. In addition, students are using technology to collect, select and work with information
(Corrin et al. 2010).
Technology use by students in an academic context changes the roles of participants,
time, content and social organizations. Students are becoming active rather than passive learners,
and faculty are serving more as a “guide on the side” rather than a “sage on the stage” (Gumport

& Chun, 1999). Technology also changes the dimension of time as students can use software and
applications at their own pace and at convenient times of their choice (Gumport & Chun, 1999).
In addition, technology affects the social organization of teaching and learning by expanding the
delivery of higher education. No longer do students have to be physically present in a classroom
to be part of the educational experience.
Some students feel there is a place for all technologies in an educational form, while
others want to maintain a separate digital footprint for inside the classroom (Clark et al., 2009).
The term digital dissonance has been introduced to describe “the tension with respect to learners’
appropriation of Web 2.0 technologies in formal contexts” (Clark et al., 2009, p. 57). “This
element of dissonance is framed by a situation where young people’s ‘everyday’ use of digital
technologies is encountering a process of delegitimization as evidenced by the banning of mobile
phone use in schools, for example” (Clark et al., 2009, p. 57).

2.8 Technology and Educational Reform
With the widespread use of technology both in and out of the classroom, there has been a
spirited discussion on how use of technology impacts students’ ability to learn and professors’
ability to teach. Policy makers and educational change advocates claim that the current system of
education is not equipped to accommodate the changing needs of the student population and call
for “wide-spread discussion” about the trends (Dede, 2005, p. 15). Universities and higher
education as a whole have been urged by some to make “strategic investments in physical plant,
technical infrastructure, and professional development” to gain an advantage in both recruiting
and teaching students (Dede, 2005, p. 15). Students are said to be a force for change, demanding
new kinds teaching and learning and systems of delivery that are not currently being offered by
universities (Jones, et al., 2011). In addition, Prensky (2001) claimed most teachers lack the

36

technological fluency of the digital natives. The disparity between the technological skills and
interests of new students and the limited and unsophisticated technology use by educators is
claimed to be creating alienation and disaffection among students (Levin & Arafeh, 2002).
Kennedy, Judd, Churchward, Gray, and Krause (2008) found that “the widespread
revision of curricula to accommodate the so-called digital natives does not seem warranted,” (p.
10) and “we cannot assume that being a member of the Net Generation is synonymous with
knowing how to employ technology strategically to optimize learning experiences in university
settings” (p. 10). Jones and Cross, (2009) found that “it does not seem that [students] are marked
by their exposure to digital technologies from an early age in ways that make them a single and
coherent group.” In addition, they warn administrators and policy makers “against adopting
technological determinist arguments that suggest that universities simply have to adapt to a
changing student population who are described as a single group with definite and known
characteristics” (Jones & Cross, 2009, p. 19).
Margaryan, Littlejohn, and Vojt (2011) completed a mixed method study in which they
gave 160 students a questionnaire and conducted in-depth interviews with eight students and
eight faculty and staff. The researchers asked the participants questions regarding their
background, demographic information, use of technology in the course, technology used for
learning, and technology use for socializing and recreation. Their findings show that regardless
of age, students’ attitudes towards learning appear to be influenced by how the teachers lead the
class (2011, p. 438). In addition, their study found no evidence that the “current generation of
students adopt radically new learning styles, exhibit new forms of literacies, use digital
technologies in sophisticated ways or have novel expectations from higher education” (2011, p.

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

37

438). The results of this study found that instead of having radically different expectations,
students expected traditional ways of learning and teaching (Margaryan et al., 2011).
In 2011 Jones and Shao completed a comprehensive literature review, studying the
relationship between digital natives and higher education. After reviewing the literature they
found:
There is no obvious or consistent demand from students for changes to pedagogy at
university…There may be good reasons why teachers and universities wish to revise their
approaches to teaching and learning, or may wish to introduce new ways of working.
Students will respond positively to changes in teaching and learning strategies that are well
conceived, well explained, and properly embedded in courses and degree programmes
(sic). However there is no evidence of a pent-up demand amongst students for changes in
pedagogy or of a demand for greater collaboration (Jones & Shao, 2011, p. 2).

In addition, they reported this regarding the technology skill gap between students and their
professors:
The gap between students and their teachers is not fixed, nor is the gulf so large that it
cannot be bridged. In many ways the relationship is determined by the requirements
teachers place upon their students to make use of new technologies and the way teachers
integrate new technologies in their courses. There is little evidence that students enter
university with demands for new technologies that teachers and universities cannot meet
(Jones & Shao 2011, p. 1).
The evidence for the generational educational reform argument parallels the lack of
empirical evidence regarding digital native claims referenced in the introduction. Some

proponents of the digital natives debate have begun to move away from age as the main criteria
for membership and now are advocating usage levels and experience with technology as
measures of whether a person can be considered a digital native, rather than their age alone
(Dede, 2005; Bullen, Morgan, Belfer, & Qayyum, 2009). Although this proposition appears to
make more sense because it acknowledges that people of any age can develop technological
expertise, it still assumes a simple homogeneous notion of technological expertise.
This is also an interesting argument in the context of pedagogy and technology.
Technology does not negate the importance of good teaching and instruction, and merely having
more technology does not enhance a students’ ability to learn. Technology supports the goals of
teaching, but is not a substitute for it. In light of the discussion on education reform, this is not an
argument that educators cannot learn from students or education should not change to meet
changing demands. Instead, change should spring from systematic evaluation and assessment of
the education process.

2.9 How Digital Literacy is Measured and Assessed
In light of the claims of digital natives being inherently digitally literate, there is evidence
suggesting students are struggling with current technology used by universities. “Despite coming
of age with the Internet and other technology, many college students lack the information and
communication technology (ICT) literacy skills necessary to navigate, evaluate, and use the
overabundance of information available today” (Katz, 2007). There is increasing evidence that
students do not use technology effectively when they conduct research or communicate
(Rockman, 2002). Universities are banding together to study and promote digital literacy. The
National Higher Education ICT Literacy Initiative, a consortium of universities, was founded in
2003 (Katz, 2007). The consortium created a nationally available assessment of ICT literacy for

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

39

students and tested over 10,000 students in 2005 and 2006. The consortium found evidence of
students’ difficulty with ICT literacy and found that students scored poorly – achieving only
about half the possible points on the assessment (Katz, 2007). As more universities develop
information literacy instruction, more effective assessment tools will need to be developed to
measure students’ digital, information, and communication technology skills (Katz, 2007).
When assessing digital literacy, most of the existing research is found by participants
self-reporting their skill levels (van Dijk, 2006), often referred to as self-efficacy (Bandura,
1977). This is an indirect measure as opposed to a direct measure that assesses users’ actual
knowledge of digital literacy. There are a few existing instruments that measure digital literacy
including Educational Testing Service’s (ETS) iSkills, Hargittai’s Web-Use Skills Index (2005),
and the Digital Competency Assessment (DCA) although none are recognized as a standard of
measurement.
ETS was founded in 1947 and is the world’s largest private nonprofit educational testing
and assessment organization. The iSkills assessment from ETS is an outcomes-based assessment
that measures students’ ability to think critically in a digital environment. iSkills is a one-hour
exam that features scenario-based tasks that measure students’ ability to:
•

Evaluate the usefulness and sufficiency of information for a specific purpose

•

Create, generate or adapt information to express and support a point

•

Communicate information to a particular audience or in a different medium

•

Define an information problem or formulate a research statement

•

Access, summarize and integrate information from a variety of digital sources
(Educational Testing Service, 2014).

ETS is most often used to satisfy regional accreditation requirements and to measure
student performance. The starting cost to administer the test is $20 per student and the test can be

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

40

proctored on or off-campus. The results can be delivered in an individual or group format
designed to demonstrate program effectiveness, enhance and develop curriculum, and evaluate
students to make placement decisions (Educational Testing Service, 2014). The iSkills
assessment has been used on undergraduate students and adult learners, but has never been used
on graduate students (I. Katz, personal communication, April 30, 2014).
The web-use skills index is a survey developed by Ezter Hargittai in 2005 to serve as a
proxy for observed skill measures, which are often expensive and difficult to collect for larger
samples of participants. The survey was based on a study that examined users’ digital literacy
through both observations and survey. The analysis of the study yielded recommendations for
what measures can be used as a survey proxy of participants’ observed web-use skills (Hargittai,
2005). The observations that Hargittai (2005) conducted measured the effectiveness and
efficiency of eight tasks. Participants looked for information on 1) job and career opportunities;
2) a site that compares different presidential candidates’ views on abortion; 3) a used car for
purchasing; 4) tax forms; 5) information about local cultural events (movie time listings, theatre
shows); 6) music to listen to online; 7) children’s art; and 8) museum’s or gallery’s website.
In addition to the direct observations of the searching for content online, participants
were also presented with survey questions to measure aspects of their Internet-related
knowledge. Hargittai (2005) collected four different types of measures a) four yes or no selfreport questions about digital literacy b) 38 five-point (self-reported) ratings of degree of
understanding of digital literacy-related items c) 37 multiple choice tests of digital literacy, and
d) an overall (self-report) rating of Internet skill. Hargittai then completed descriptive statistics
and an OLS regression and found that the relationship between outcome and skill measures was
statistically significant. Due to organizing her instrument into four constructs, her findings

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

41

suggest that the self-reported ratings on the survey may be used as a proxy for actual skill. She
has replicated use of the survey several times since then with different populations (Hargittai &
Hsieh, 2012; Hargittai, 2009).
The Instant Digital Competency Assessment (DCA) was developed by Calvani, Cartelli,
& Fini (2009) and is a wide-ranging instrument that covers linguistic and conceptual skills. The
assessment contains 85 questions that include multiple choice, matching, and short answers. This
assessment is based off of Calvani’s digital competency framework covered earlier in Section
2.5. The three dimensions; technological, cognitive, and ethical, are broken down into further
classifications in Chart 2.9.1. The instrument has been primarily used for 15 and 16 year-olds in
Italian and English speaking schools, and there have been no studies that delve into their
statistical reliability of the instrument (Calvani et al., 2009). The instrument is no longer
available for public use.

2.10 Assessment and Learning Styles
To have a deeper understanding of how students’ develop digital literacy, it is important
to review learning styles and how they influence the learning process. Learning style advocates
Vincent and Ross (2001) conclude that most educators “agree that learning styles exist and
acknowledge the significant effect that learning styles have on the learning process” and there
are many validating studies. Swanson’s (1995) review of literature found numerous studies
identifying cultural differences in learning styles. Learning styles are defined in many ways but
one of the most referenced definitions is how “cognitive, affective, and physiological factors
affect how learners perceive, interact with and respond to the learning environments” (Keefe,
1997). Recent literature details the varieties of learning styles that students can exhibit and much
of the work has its foundations in one of six models. See Table 2.10.1 to view an overview of
learning style models.
Table 2.10.1 Learning Style Models Overview
Models of Learning Styles
Field dependence/field independence
Field dependence/independence measures the degree to which an individual uses “an analytical as
opposed to a global way of experiencing the environment” (Keefe, 1997, p.9). Field
dependence/independence is the study of the differences in how people perceive discrete items within a
surrounding field (Witkin et al., 1977).
Jungian models (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Gregorc Style Delineator, Keirsey Temperament)
The Myers Briggs Type Indicator MBTI is a questionnaire measuring how people perceive the world and
make decisions. This is based off of Jung’s proposed existence of four dichotomies cognitive functions –
rational functions of thinking and feeling, and irrational functions of sensation and intuition. The test
places individuals into one of sixteen types (Myers, 1962).
Gregorc breaks learners into four style types: concrete sequential (CS), abstract sequential (AS), abstract
random (AR) and concrete random (CR). The four styles describe the characteristics of each type of
learner based on how they like to process information and their learning preferences (Gregorc, 1982).
The Keirsey Temperament Sorter II is a 70-question personality instrument that rates people in four
groups based off their MBTI category – Artisan, Guardian, Rational, and Idealist (Keirsey.com, 2014).

Sensory models (visual-auditory-read/write-kinesthetic - VARK)
The VARK learning style has four main ways of learning – visual, auditory, read/write, and kinesthetic
(movement). Learners can use all four modalities to learn, however, according to the VARK theory, one
or two of the styles is typically dominant. The dominant style is the best way for a person to learn
(Flemming, 2009).
Social interaction models (Grasha-Riechman Student Learning Style Scales)
The Grasha-Reichman Learning Style Scale was developed in 1974 to determine college students’ style of
classroom participation. The scale focuses on students’ attitudes towards learning, classroom activities,
teachers, and peers. There are six styles in this model – avoidant, participative, competitive, collaborative,
dependent, and independent (Grasha & Reichman, 1974).
Multiple intelligences model
Gardner identified seven distinct intelligences – visual-spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal,
intrapersonal, linguistic, and logical mathematical (Gardner, 1983).
John Biggs’ approaches to learning model (Study Process Questionnaire)
Biggs’ theory is that a student’s approach to learning has two components: 1) how the student approaches
the task (strategy), and 2) why the student wants to approach it (motive) (Biggs, 1987).

The domains of learning styles each inhabit different aspects of an individual’s learning
preferences or orientations. As an overview, field dependence/independence indicates whether an
individual prefers more concrete vs. abstract learning experiences (Keefe, 1979), while Jungian
models are indicators of personality or temperament and categorize people how people perceive
the world and make decisions (Myers, 1995). Sensory models are different modalities of how
individuals physically interact with learning via their senses (Flemming, 2009), which differ
from the social interaction model that highlights the differences in students’ attitudes towards
learning (Grasha-Riechman, 1974). Last, the multiple intelligences model identifies seven
distinct intelligences that are innate to the learner (Gardner, 1983), and the approach to learning
model identifies the learner’s strategy and motive (Biggs, 1987).
When analyzing these learning styles, the ones that appear the most similar are the
Jungian model, sensory model, and multiple intelligences model. These three speak to an innate

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

44

disposition that categorizes the learners into groups with different orientations towards learning.
The approaches to learning and the social interaction models both deal with the learners’
cognitive disposition towards learning as they study attitudes, motivation, and strategy. The
model that is least similar to the others is the field dependence/independence model, which is an
orientation towards wanting concrete or abstract learning experiences. Field dependent learners
are more oriented to social learning in groups and applying learning to their own experience.
This differs from field independent that is more likely to create their own structure and pursues
ideas for their own sake.
The learning style models do not compete with one another, but instead identify multiple
orientations that learners can have towards learning. Critics of learning style theory point out that
for the theory to be valid and useful “it must be shown that students learn more effectively when
their learning styles are accommodated, and only a limited number of studies have shown this”
(MSCHE, 2007, p. 93). These tools may help “students gain self-awareness, provided that
students have the opportunity to complete several instruments, so they do not take the results of
any one instrument too seriously” (MSCHE, 2007, p. 94). Another concern is that most learning
style theories lump and label students into categories rather than recognize that they exhibit a
variety of styles and run the risk of stereotyping cultural groups (Stellwagen, 2001).
If using Calvani’s framework of Digital Competence, the most useful learning styles
would likely be Biggs’ Approaches to Learning Model (1987). There are many different ways to
learn and different orientations, but an interesting aspect of Biggs’ approach is that it reviews
how the student approaches the task, and why the student wants to approach it. Being digitally
literate is not just about technical skills, but also how students conceptually view technological
tools. Technology will change, and to be successful students need to be cognizant of how they

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

45

are approaching the task, and why they are approaching the task. Being able to strategically
evaluate the problem and select the right technology for their situation is crucial for success in a
changing world.

2.11 Assessment in Higher Education
Assessment is a hot topic at higher education institutions. Depending on your stake in the
university, assessment means different things. It is discussed as a measure of student learning,
cost-effectiveness, administrative efficiency, and also measuring educational value (Spurlin,
2006). We also cannot forget assessment is used to help meet the demands of accreditation, for
administrative needs, or to determine how well students learn in brick-in-mortar as compared to
online courses (Spurlin, 2006). Some reasons for assessment are to “improve the quality of
education; to aid in decision making, or to meet external agencies’ criteria (accountability)”
(Spurlin, 2006).
Palomba and Banta define assessment as “the systematic collection, review, and use of
information about educational programs undertaken for the purpose of improving student
learning and development” (1999). “The aims of assessment are typically broader than simply
gathering direct evidence of student learning outcomes… assessment also embraces the
processes used by institutions and programs to apply what they learn to make improvements in
teaching and learning” (CHEA, 2003). Accountability is often linked with assessment, especially
when the audience includes the public, state legislatures or accrediting agencies (Spurlin, 2006).
Assessment is a cyclical process that involves developing the question or outcome,
defining methods, implementing assessment methods, analyzing data, interpreting the results,
and making decisions based on the results and interpretations (Spurlin, 2006). It is also
recommended that before the cycle is started it is important for those conducting the assessment

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

46

to determine their purpose by defining their organizational mission and goals (Campus Labs,
2014).

There are many different methods to use to approach assessment including direct vs.
indirect, formative vs. summative, quantitative vs. qualitative, and population vs. sample. Direct
methods are any process employed to gather data that requires subjects to display their
knowledge, behavior, or thought processes. Indirect methods ask subjects to reflect upon their
knowledge behaviors, or thought processes (Campus Labs, 2014). Direct methods assess student
work, projects, or portfolios developed from the learning experiences, while indirect methods use
the opinions of students or others to indicate student ability (Spurlin, 2006). Some examples of
direct assessment methods are tests, essays, homework, presentations, projects, thesis or
dissertation work, and qualifying exams. Some indirect methods include surveys and inventories

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

47

related to behavior or attitude changes, focus groups meetings, student development transcripts,
and student reflection on work, portfolios, and other activities (Spurlin, 2006).
Direct methods “provide evidence of whether or not a student has command of a specific
subject or content area, can perform a certain task, exhibits a particular skill, demonstrates a
certain quality in his or her work… or holds a particular value” (MSCHE, 2007, p. 30). Indirect
methods are “related to the act of learning, such as factors that predict or mediate learning or
perceptions about learning but not reflect learning itself” and are “often acquired through the use
of self-reported format surveys, questionnaires, and interviews” (MSCHE, 2007, p. 32). Rubrics
or rating scales, checklists, self-reflection, ratings from supervisors, tests, surveys, focus groups,
portfolios, and retention/graduation rates are all tools for assessment (MSCHE, 2007).
Formative assessment is an “ongoing assessment,” or assessment conducted during the
program. It is intended to “improve an individual student’s performance, student learning
outcomes at the course or program level, or overall institutional effectiveness” (MSCHE, 2007,
p. 27). Ideally, formative assessment allows the one conducting the assessment to “act quickly to
adjust the contents or approach of a course or program” (MSCHE, 2007, p. 27). This differs from
summative assessment which occurs at the end of a unit, course, or program. The purpose of
summative assessment is to “determine whether or not overall goals have been achieved and to
provide information on performance for an individual student or statistics about a course or
program for internal or external accountability purposes” (MSCHE, 2007, p. 27). Grades are a
common form of summative assessment. Both formative and summative assessment are needed
to work together to improve learning.
Quantitative evidence consists of data that is represented numerically (MSCHE, 2007).
“For instance, performance on a test or responses to a questionnaire may be scored so that a

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

48

number represents the degree to which an individual performed or agreed/disagreed with a
certain concept” (MSCHE, 2007, p. 33). Quantitative data can be compared directly or subjected
to statistical analysis (MSCHE, 2007) and may be generalized to greater populations with larger
samples (Campus Labs, 2014). In addition, quantitative methods are often easy to replicate.
Qualitative evidence focuses on text or narrative from respondents and seeks to explain and
understand (Campus Labs, 2014). Qualitative data can be ‘richer’ than quantitative data because
it can provide a larger variety of information (MSCHE, 2007) and can capture “elusive”
evidence of student development and learning (Campus Labs, 2014). A misconception is that
quantitative assessment is more reliable, valid, and objective than qualitative assessment
although this is not necessarily the case. “There are well-designed and statistically reliable means
of interpreting and analyzing qualitative data and numerous resources for learning to use
qualitative methods (Silverman, 2001; Maxwell, 1996).
An assessment that goes to the whole group is said to be a population assessment, while
an assessment that only goes to a subsection of the group is said to be a sample (Campus Labs,
2014). When sending many surveys to the same group, it is beneficial to use population surveys
sparingly so the respondents do not suffer from survey fatigue. Sample size calculators are very
useful because they will tell you how many members of the population you need to have
completed the assessment in order for the data to be statistically valid.

2.12 Student Learning and Accreditation
The Middles States Commission in Higher Education (MSCHE) is one of seven regional
accrediting bodies recognized by the Council of Higher Education Accreditation and the U.S.
Department of Education. Regional accreditors accredit entire institutions, not individual
programs, units, or locations. The University of Maryland, Baltimore is accredited by MSCHE.
	  

© Jenny Owens 2015	  

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

49

The Middle States Commission in Higher Education has two standards organized into
two subsections that deal with assessment – institutional context and educational effectiveness
(MSCHE, 2007, p. 2). The definitions are below:
Standard 7: The institution has developed and implemented an assessment plan and
process that evaluates its overall effectiveness in achieving its mission and goals, its
efficiency in the use of its resources, and its effectiveness in assuring that its students and
graduates achieve the appropriate learning and other outcomes (MSCHE, 2007).
Standard 14: Assessment of student learning demonstrates that the institution’s students
have knowledge, skills, and competencies consistent with institutional goals and that
students at graduation have achieved appropriate higher education goals. (MSCHE,
2007).
The exact verbiage is different depending on the accrediting body, but assessing student
learning is an element in every regional accreditor’s standards. Defining and assessing student
learning assists faculty in their teaching, students as they select their institutions and in managing
their own learning, and administrators as they plan and support students (MSCHE, 2007).
Accreditation helps assure the public, legislature, and stake holders that the goals of higher
education have been met by “evaluating each institution within the context of its mission”
(MSCHE, 2007, p. 1).

2.13 Research & Evaluation
Assessment is different than research. Assessment is conducted by practitioners in the
field and results in improving and changing practice. Assessment is involved in day-to-day, here
and now, and grounded in sense-making. It can help shape formal research, but is context driven
and not generalizable. In addition, an in-depth knowledge of methodology and experimental

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

50

design not needed. (Campus Labs, 2014). Formal research is conducted by researchers and
practitioners and results in adding to a body of knowledge. Research is involved in long-range
and is less action oriented, but instead grounded in exploring new research or expanding or
confirming past research. It is generalizable and an in-depth knowledge of methodology and
experimental design is needed. Also research is conducted in formal settings or controlled
environments and is narrowly focused, driven by past research (Campus Labs, 2014).
Evaluation and assessment are easily confused because instead of being distinct
categories they lie along a continuum. Evaluation is the systematic investigation or the merit,
worth, or significance of an object, a program, or a process (Shadish, Cook, & Leviton, 1991).
Rather than focus on a narrow program or service, evaluation is a broad concept that addresses
all aspects of a program. This includes resources, staffing, organization, operations and
efficiency (Scriven, 1998). Types of evaluation include, but are not limited to; program
evaluation, needs assessment, process evaluation, and cost benefit analysis (Spurlin, 2006).
It is important to distinguish the differences between assessment and evaluation when
discussing technology issues (Spurlin, 2006). Questions about technology often revolve around
cost-benefit analyses, staffing, support and infrastructure, what students want, what faculty feel
they need, and satisfaction with technology support (Spurlin, 2006). These questions are
concerned with evaluation. “Assessment focuses on the effect of technology on student learning”
(Spurlin, 2006, p. 4). Assessment deals with environment, technology, curriculum, co-curricular
activities, instruction, and student variables.

2.14 Variety of Skill Levels among College Students
When researchers have assessed the digital literacy of college students they did not find a
homogenous group of digital natives, but instead a group that exhibits a variety of skill levels.

Kennedy, Judd, Dalgarno, & Waycott (2010) conducted a study of 2,096 undergraduate students
between ages 17 and 26 from three Australian universities and identified four differentiated
groups of technology users: Power users (14 percent), ordinary users (27 percent), irregular users
(14 percent), and basic users (45 percent).

Table 2.14.1 Breakdown of Skills Levels (Kennedy et al., 2010)
Skill Level

Description

Power Users
(14%)

Power Users use a wide range of technologies and used them significantly more
frequently than all other users.

Ordinary
Users
(27%)

Ordinary Users are regular users of standard web and mobile technologies. While not
averse to using emerging technologies and games, they do so no more than monthly and
tend not to engage in web publishing and sharing.

Irregular
Users
(14%)

Irregular Users are similar to ordinary users, but engage in most of the technology-based
activities less frequently.

Basic Users
(45%)

Basic Users are characterized by extremely infrequent use of new and emerging
technologies and less than weekly or monthly use of standard web technologies. They are
regular users of standard mobile features.

(p. 337)
The advanced technology power users are in the minority, making up less than 15
percent, while the largest group is basic users, who used only standard web-based applications
and mobile phones. It appears that a subset will fit the concept of the tech-savvy digital natives,
but these students are in the minority. “In a single class at a university there are major differences
in students’ experiences and preferences in relation to technology” (Kennedy et al., 2010).
Jones et al. (2010), in the Net Generation Encountering eLearning at University Project,
investigated how much time younger students (25 and below) spent using information
communication technology (ICT) for leisure as compared to study in comparison to older
students. The study found that older students used ICT more frequently for study, and younger

students used technology more for leisure. In addition, the research showed that even with the
spheres of leisure and academic use, students used the technology in a variety of ways (Jones et
al., 2010).
Jones and Healing (2010) conducted a series of interviews with student volunteers to
learn about how student were engaging with technology and learning. They found that students
choose technology based on class format and requirements. A study by Ferri et al., (2008, cited
in Jones & Shao, 2011) found that there were at least three different student profiles derived
from the intensity of Internet use and the production of content, see Table 2.14.2. Only 30
percent of the students fell into the category closed to the conception of digital natives, a far cry
from the blanket statements made about students’ web skills.

The digital mass

The digital mass accounts for almost half of the
students. The digital mass are heavy Internet users
but rarely produce digital content.

The neo-analogical

The neo-analogical account for approximately 20
percent of the students. They produce some content
but connect to the Internet less than the average

The inter-activated account for approximately 30
percent of the students. This group is close to the
prevalent image of new millennium learners, which
is heavy Internet users and quite frequent content
producers.

Hargittai (2010) also found that considerable variation exists even among college
students with high levels of Internet access. In 2008, she completed her study of 1,060 first-year
students, most of them 18 and 19 years old. Hargittai controlled the variables of education and

age, and most of them were highly “wired” with multiple points of Internet access. The students
provided self-assessment of their web experience and web use skills. She found that those from
families with at least one parent holding a graduate degree exhibit statistically significantly
higher levels of know-how about the web than others (2010). In addition, she found that students
of lower socioeconomic status, women, students of Hispanic origin, and African Americans
exhibit lower levels of Internet literacy than others and engage in fewer information seeking
activities (2010).
After reviewing the findings in the literature, it is clear that access and use of computers,
the Internet, and technology is present in most of these students’ lives. The mere presence of
these tools does not guarantee high competency levels nor explain the vastly different
characteristics and skills. Students have a variety of skill levels, but only a small percentage of
them operate at the highest level of technology use and digital literacy. College students do not
have a universal experience with technology, and many factors affect digital literacy and web use
skills.

2.15 Factors that Affect Digital Literacy
After reviewing the literature, it was discovered that generational labels and arguments
fail to provide a clear picture of the range of digital literacies of college students. It is trendy to
talk about millennials and digital natives and it is easy to assign them characteristics and skills
because that helps faculty and staff understand and comprehend them. Generational arguments
feel tidy and packaged, but they neglect many other complex factors that play into a student’s
digital literacy. Factors such as type of use, parental educational background, availability of the
Internet and personal computers (PCs) at home, gender, and race all weave into a complex
relationship that can better predict a student’s digital literacy than their age.

In our discussion about socioeconomics of students in higher education, it is important to
note that the population of college students is different from that of the general population.
Bradley et al. found that college are not representative of the broader population and are skewed
toward higher socioeconomic status (2008). Brown & Czerniewicz (2010) suggest that digital
natives’ attributes are not about a generation but instead characteristics of a “digital elite.”
Investigating digital literacy uncovers who in the population may be positioned best to benefit
from the medium. As more and more information and services become accessible only on the
web, then those with lower digital literacy skills will become increasingly disadvantaged
(Hargittai, 2005).
In 1995, the ‘digital divide’ was studied almost exclusively in terms of Internet access.
Digital divide refers to “the gap between those who can benefit from digital technology and
those who cannot” (Smith, 2013). According to Pew Internet and the American Life Project, in
1995, only 10 percent of Americans were online. In January of 2014, this number has risen to 87
percent of U.S. adults and 97 percent of those between the ages 18 and 29 (Mobile Technology
Fact Sheet, 2014).
As that gap between those with Internet access and those without began to close, an
assumption remained that when someone was online, inequality was no longer a concern
(Hargittai, 2010). Now that more are online, there are still many differences when it comes to
how people incorporate the Internet into their lives (Barzilai-Nahon, 2006; DiMaggio, Hargittai,
Celeste, & Shafer, 2004). Smith (2013) claims that access is not the real issue anymore but
instead it is about the benefits derived from access. Jackson (2007) found that even when more
people are online, differences in use “may have the unintended consequence of deepening other
divides” (p. 154). DiMaggio and Hargittai (2001) found that secondary digital divides could exist

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

55

due to an individuals’ differing technical means, autonomy of use, use patterns, social support
networks, and skill.

2.16 Recreational Browsing vs. Capital Enhancing
A person’s use of the Internet, particularly the differences between recreation-oriented
and education-oriented activities, strongly depends on a number of variables such as their
parents’ educational level, experience with the Internet, and frequency of Internet use, all of
which are strongly connected to their socioeconomic status (Mominó, Sigalés, & Meneses,
2008).
Hargittai and Hinnant classify two types of Internet browsing, 1) capital enhancing and 2)
recreational browsing (2008). Those that use the Internet for capital enhancing activities are
typically more educated, (Howard, Rainie, & Jones, 2001) have privileged backgrounds,
(Harigiatti & Hinnant, 2008) and have higher socioeconomic status and Internet usage
(Livingstone & Helsper, 2007). Those with a college degree or more are more likely to seek
health information, engage in financial transactions, find job information and get news, than
those with lower levels of education (Howard et al., 2001). Also, those with lower levels of
education are more likely to use the Internet for browsing for fun, online games, and online
gambling (Hargittai, 2010).
As discussed above, a second digital divide occurs when you factor in the differences of
digital use. An accumulated advantage can increase existing socioeconomic divides and have the
potential to contribute to social inequality (Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008; DiMaggio et al., 2004).

2.17 Gender, Web-Use, and Self-efficacy
Gender has been found by some to be a significant predictor of types of Internet use for
college students. Jackson et al. (2001) found that male and female students used the Internet
equally, but differently. This finding was validated by other researchers (Fortson et al.,
2007; Odell et al., 2000), but differs from research by Bressers & Bergen (2002) who found that
male college students spend significantly more time on the Internet than female college students.
A trend identified by Fortson et al. (2007) finds male college students are more likely to
use the Internet as a source of entertainment and leisure, while female students are more likely to
use the Internet for communication and educational experiences. Based on a sample of 843
students from eight American universities, Odell et al. (2000) found male students are more
likely to use the Internet to research purchases, look for news, play games, listen/copy music,
and look at sex websites. Female college students are less likely to play games online and spend
more time using email, bulletin boards and to conduct research for school, but other variables
such as school, major, and study habits had a significant effect on those results (Odell et al.
2000). This is in contrast with other research that reported that females spend significantly more
time using email than male students (Sherman, 2000). Also it was found that male and female
students spend around the same amounts of time using email and there is no statistically
significant difference related to academic research, general information searching, job searching,
or shopping (Fortson et al., 2007; Bressers & Bergen, 2002).
After reviewing the literature it appears that there is no conclusive difference between
male and female students and their web use habits. Trends emerge when you start to consider
how gender affects attitudes towards technology and self-efficacy.

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

57

Sherman et al. found (2000) that men had more positives attitudes towards Internet use
than women. Slate, Manuel, and Brinson Jr., (2002) surveyed Hispanic freshman at a
Southwestern U.S. university and also found that men had more positive attitudes about the
Internet than women and felt “more comfort and less confusion” when using the medium. Zhang
found that males have less “Internet anxiety” than females (2002, p. 147).
He and Freeman (2010) completed a study on web use and gender and their results
suggest female students were found to have less computer knowledge and fewer computing
experiences than their male counterparts. In addition, they were more likely to be anxious and
have lower levels of computer self-efficacy. Several other studies report findings that males felt
more comfortable with the Internet and had more positive attitudes than females (Sherman et al.,
2000; Zhang, 2002; Slate et al., 2002). Hargittai & Shafer (2006) found that men have higher
levels of self-perceived web-use skills despite similarities in actual skill. In another study,
Hargittai (2010) found that women claim lower levels of know-how regarding Internet-related
terms and report visiting fewer types of sites than men.
Research by McMillan & Morrison (2006) suggests that the family environment can
reinforce gender stereotypes related to Internet use and perception. McMillian & Morrison
(2006) conducted a qualitative analysis of 72 autobiographical essays from young adult college
students and found that generally, mothers were “reticent in their use of communication
technology” (p. 80) while fathers displayed more Internet use and savvy. Another explanation for
higher self-efficacy or higher skills are that men have been found to be more likely than women
to have had more technology classes in school, more computers in the home in which they grew
up, and a personal computer in their own room (Correa, 2010). Others have suggested that

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

58

gender is a factor in Internet use because the content on the Internet is biased toward men
(Bimber, 2000).
After reviewing this literature, it appears that across the board female students
consistently have lower self-efficacy regarding their Internet and web-use skills, and higher
Internet anxiety. Some studies show male students having higher scores (Hargittai, 2010), while
other studies found that men have higher levels of self-perceived web-use skills despite
similarities in actual skill (Hargittai & Shafer, 2006; Madigan, Goodfellow, & Stone, 2007).
Livingstone and Helsper (2007) found that a person’s Internet skill level has a great impact on
the number of activities they complete and perform online. In addition, self-efficacy with
technology has been shown to be a significant predictor of a student’s future academic and career
path (Vekiri & Chronaki, 2008). When students feel more competent they become more
motivated to create content (Correa, 2010). Cooper (2006) suggests that if negative stereotypes
of female’s use of technology continue to be socially reinforced, they may continue to contribute
to secondary digital divides between male and female students.

2.18 Race, Web-Use, and Self-efficacy
Generally, studies about race and Internet use find continued evidence of different use
and attitudes towards the Internet and technology. Some studies suggest that digital divides based
on race are becoming less persistent (Cotton & Jelenewicz, 2006; Jackson et al., 2001b), while
others suggest digital divides persist (Cooper, 2006; Slate et al., 2002).
Hargittai and Hinnant found that Asian American students used the web more than other
groups regardless of resources or experience (2008). Asian Americans visit more types of
websites while students of Hispanic origin visit fewer types of sites than white students
(Hargittai, 2010). In the literature, African Americans and Hispanic students report knowing less

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

59

about the Internet (Hargittai, 2010), and African Americans score lower on tests measuring
information and digital literacy (Sexton, Hignite, Margavio, & Margavio, 2009; Jackson et al.,
2008; Ritzhaupt, Feng, Dawson, & Barron, 2013). Regarding diverse types of Internet uses,
Hargittai’s study suggests “those from a lower socioeconomic background, women, and students
of Hispanic origin tend to engage in fewer information-seeking activities online on a regular
basis than others” (2010).
Jackson et al. (2008) reported that although more African Americans are online, the
intensity and nature of use differs from other racial groups even when controlling for education
and income. Black adults are more likely to use the Internet to access religious and spiritual
information and less likely to use the Internet for communication (Jackson et al., 2008).

2.19 Education, Income & Disability
Those with lower levels of education are less likely to use the Internet – only 43 percent
of adults who did not complete high school use the Internet, as opposed to 71 percent of high
school graduates and 94 percent of college graduates (Zickuhr & Smith, 2012). Education is also
found to be a strong predictor of what types of online activities a person will pursue (Hargittai,
2010). Respondents with high school education or less are significantly less knowledgeable
about the Internet than those with a college degree or higher (Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008).
Education is a strong predictor of the type of activities an individual will participate
online. Howard et al. (2001) found that individuals with higher levels of education are more
likely to send emails, search for financial, political, or government information, and bank online.
In addition, Madden (2003) found that those with higher education and household income are
more likely to find news and product information and use the Internet for work. Also, Spooner
and Rainie (2000) found that those who have a lower income level are much more likely to use

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

60

the Internet to gamble. Hargittai found that undergraduate students with at least one parent with a
graduate degree exhibit a much higher knowledge about the Internet even when controlling for
other demographics (Hargittai, 2010).
A demographic not often studied are those living with disabilities and their digital
literacy or Internet connectivity. The Pew Research Center’s Internet and American Life Project
found that only 54 percent of adults living with a disability use the Internet, which is much lower
than the general population (Zickuhr & Smith, 2012). There is currently a call for more research
on how disabilities affect Internet usage and access.

2.20 Access
Access has been an enduring focus of research on digital literacy because it is an obvious
precursor of students’ use of technology. Access deals with how long students have had access,
how many places students have had access, and where they have access. Access has also been
studied in terms of access to technology, or to the Internet, sometimes those terms have been
used synonymously. Facer and Furlong (2001) observed that access is a much more complex
issue than “the mere provision of facilities” because access to a computer does not automatically
mean genuine access.
Peter & Valkenburg (2006) found that the longer someone has been using the Internet in
years is a predictor of greater and more complex usage in the future. Echoing this, in 2010,
Eshet-Alkalai and Chajut (2010) discovered that “experience with technology, and not agedependent cognitive developments, accounts for the observed life-long changes in digital literacy
skills” (p. 173). It appears that rather than age, Internet use in years affects digital literacy skills.
In addition to experience, the number of places that people have access has been shown
to affect digital literacy and web-use skills. Hassani (2006) found that people who have more

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

61

locations in which they have access tend to benefit more than those with fewer points of access.
Hargiatti and Hinnant (2008) found that the more places that people have access to the Internet
the greater their Internet mastery and usage. Livingstone and Helsper (2007) found that children
who have access to the Internet at home have been users for more years and spend more time
online than those who do not have home access. In addition, access on a home computer has
been found to have a large impact on digital literacy because it offers autonomy and experiential
learning opportunities (Hargiatti & Hinnant, 2008). Users who have more ways to access the
Internet are also more likely to use the Internet for beneficial purposes including seeking health
information, researching products, purchasing products, and banking online (Hassani, 2006).
Trends in socioeconomic factors have begun to emerge to showcase a growing body of literature
that reveals the way the Internet is used is a strong indicator of past and future socioeconomic
status.

2.21 Conclusion
In conclusion, there are many different definitions and derivatives of digital literacy, and
several conceptual frameworks. Some definitions are operational, concerned with technical
skills, and others are conceptual, or focused on cognitive and socio-emotional aspects of working
in a digital environment (Eshet-Alkalai, 2004). When assessing digital literacy, most of the
existing research is found by participants self-reporting their skill levels (van Dijk, 2006), often
referred to as self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977). This is an indirect measure as opposed to a direct
measure that assesses users’ actual knowledge of digital literacy. There are a few existing
instruments that measure digital literacy including Educational Testing Service’s (ETS) iSkills,
Hargittai’s web-use skills index (2005), and the Digital Competency Assessment (DCA).
Assessment of digital literacy skills can be difficult and expensive on a large scale.

62

The technological skills and habits of digital natives have been studied, and the concept
of a homogenous group of tech savvy digital natives has recently been refuted empirically and
theoretically through comprehensive literature reviews (Jones & Shao, 2011; Bennett, Maton, &
Kervin, 2008). Instead, digital natives have been found to possess a large variation of technology
use and skills (Kennedy et al., 2007). Although there is a growing body of literature about the
digital literacy of undergraduate students, there has been little, if any, research completed on the
population of graduate and professional students. There are educational differences between
graduate and undergraduate students (Hussey & Smith, 2010; Artino & Stephens, 2009;
Seligman, 2012), and even among academic disciplines there are varying degrees of technology
use (Weng & Ling, 2007; Fry, 2004; Fry, 2006; Guidry & BrckaLorenz, 2010). It is plausible
that graduate students differ from undergraduate students and that there are differences in the
digital literacy skills of students enrolled in different academic disciplines.
The argument for supporting the idea of digital natives is often criticized for neglecting to
study race, socioeconomic factors, and previous experience with technology (Vaidhyanathan,
2008). Factors such as type of use, parent’s educational background, availability of the Internet
and PCs at home, gender, and race all weave into a complex relationship that can better predict a
student’s digital literacy than age.

CHAPTER III
METHODOLOGY

3.1 Participants
The study population consisted of 4,996 graduate and professional students at the
University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB). Data were collected during the 2014-2015 academic
year. This population included students in the Schools of Nursing (n=1,119), Social Work
(n=957), Law (n=914), Medicine (n=843), Pharmacy (n=646), and Dentistry (n=517). Students
from the Graduate School were excluded.
The Web-use Index was distributed to the entire population of 4,996 potential
participants. Six hundred and ninety-nine participants completed and returned the survey for a
total response rate of 14 percent. Responses from undergraduate participants were excluded from
the results (n=99) as the study was designed to investigate web-use skills of graduate and
professional students. In addition, participants from the Graduate School were removed (n=50),
as the variety of degree programs offered by this school prevents specific determination of
whether the academic discipline had an effect on participants’ web-use skills.
Six participants indicated on the survey that they were Physical Therapy students. Their
classification was changed to School of Medicine, as that program is a part of the School of
Medicine. Eleven participants marked Question #11 incorrectly and they were removed from the
sample, due to lack of attentiveness. Question #11 asked “The purpose of this question is to
assess your attentiveness to question wording. For this question please mark the Very Often
response,” and presented answer choices of “Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, and Very Often.”

The seven participants who did not answer all of the self-reported rated terms were
removed from the study sample, as this survey was modeled after Hargittai and Hsieh’s (2012)
Web-use Index, and their methodology specified that missing values be excluded. The
participant who identified as transgender was excluded due to the small sample size (n=1).
Five hundred and fifteen eligible participants remained in the sample, which now
included students from the School of Dentistry (n=50), School of Law (n=78), School of
Medicine (n=117), School of Nursing (n=72), School of Pharmacy (n=67), and School of Social
Work (n=131) (See Table 3.1.1).

3.2 Instrument and Variables
Hargittai & Hsieh’s Web-use Index was modeled as the instrument for this study (2012).
The survey was adapted slightly to study the effects of academic discipline, gender, age,
race/ethnicity, parental education, international status, self-perceived Internet skills, and GPA.
The web-use skills index is a survey originally developed by Ezter Hargittai in 2005 as a proxy
for observed skill measures, which are often expensive and difficult to collect for large samples
of people. The survey was based on a study that examined users’ digital literacy through both
observations and survey. The survey has changed over the year to ensure the variables reflect

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

65

current web terminology and trends. The analysis of the study yielded recommendations for what
measures work well as survey proxies of people’s observed web-use skills (Hargittai, 2005;
Hargittai, 2009; Hargittai & Hsieh, 2012). I corresponded with Dr. Hargittai via email (April 7,
2014) and to best of Hargittai’s knowledge this will be the first time the survey has been used to
assess the web-use skills of graduate and professional students. She has used it with both
undergraduate students (2009), and the general population (2005).
The adapted Web-use Index included eight independent variables, and 30 dependent
variables. The independent variables included academic discipline, race/ethnicity, gender,
parental education, age, international status, GPA, and self-perceived Internet skills. Academic
discipline indicated which school at UMB the participant was enrolled in. Options for academic
discipline were Dental, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Social Work. In the case of this
study, race refers to physical characteristics such as skin pigment, while ethnicity refers to
cultural factors such as nationality and ancestry. The two definitions were combined to create the
variable Race/Ethnicity. Options for Race/Ethnicity included Asian/Pacific Islander,
Black/African American, Hispanic, White/Caucasian, and Other. Gender is the state of being
male, female, transgender or other, and participants identified which category they associated
with. Parental Education is defined as the highest level of education attained by either parent. If
the parent is currently enrolled, then the highest degree received was the one to be recorded.
Options for Parental Education were Some high school, no diploma; High school graduate,
diploma or the equivalent; Some college credit, no degree; College degree; and Graduate or
professional degree.
Age was captured as age in years, and was a write in variable. The average age of
participants taking the survey was 27.6 years old. GPA was grade point average and was a write-

66

in variable. The average GPA of participants was 3.48. Each school’s catalog was reviewed and
it was confirmed that all graduate and professional schools at UMB measure grades through
GPAs, although there are differences in the ranges collected. The schools of Medicine, Law, and
Social Work have GPAs that range from 0.00 – 4.30, while the schools Nursing, Dental and
Pharmacy have GPAs that range from 0.00 – 4.00. In addition, this was verified with the
registrar at UMB. Also, it was confirmed that pass/fail courses do not factor into a participant’s
GPA. First semester students do not yet have GPAs, so that was addressed by inquiring if
participants were first semester students. If they selected yes, skip logic was used to have
participants skip the question asking about GPA.
International status indicates whether the participant was an international student or not.
Self-perceived Internet skills asked participants to rate their own Internet skills. Options for selfperceived Internet skills included Not at All Skilled, Not Very Skilled, Fairly Skilled, Very
Skilled, and Expert.

podcasting, preference setting, proxypod, reload, RSS, social bookmarking, spyware, tabbed
browsing, tagging, torrent, web feeds, weblog, widget, and wiki. Each participant was asked to
evaluate their familiarity with Internet-related terms on a scale between 1 and 5 where 1
represents having “no understanding” and 5 represents having “a full understanding” of the
variable. Participants were instructed not to Google the variable to discover meaning.
Three of the variables were not real terms to test if individuals were randomly selecting
terms. These three terms include Fitibly, JFW, and Proxypod. While there are no corresponding
measures of actual skill except that which is self-reported, non-existing terms yielded the lowest
means (See Table 3.2.2). The full instrument can be seen in Appendix A.

Web page so that you can easily re-visit the page at a
later time.

4.61

Bookmarklet

A direct link to a specific function or feature within a
Web page. While a browser bookmark takes you to a

Podcasting

Podcasting is similar in nature to RSS, which allows
subscribers to subscribe to a set of feeds to view
syndicated website content. With podcasting however,
you have a set of subscriptions that are checked
regularly for updates and instead of reading the feeds
on your computer screen, you listen to the new content
on your iPod (or like device).

RSS

RSS is the acronym used to describe the de facto
standard for the syndication of Web content. RSS is an
XML-based format and while it can be used in
different ways for content distribution, its most
widespread usage is in distributing news headlines on
the Web. A Website that wants to allow other sites to
publish some of its content creates an RSS document
and registers the document with an RSS publisher. A
user that can read RSS-distributed content can use the
content on a different site.

4.22

Social
Bookmarking

Commonly used in blogs, site authors attach keyword
descriptions (called tags) to identify images or text
within their site as a categories or topic. Web pages
and blogs with identical tags can then be linked
together allowing users to search for similar or related
content. If the tags are made public, online pages that
act as a Web-based bookmark service are able to index
them. tags can be created using words, acronyms or
numbers. Tags are also called tagging, blog tagging, or
folksonomies (short for folks and taxonomy).

2.06

Spyware

Software that covertly gathers user information
through the user's Internet connection without his or
her knowledge, usually for advertising purposes.

3.51

Tabbed Browsing

Tabbed browsing is a function of some Web browsers
that allow uses to surf and view multiple pages by
loading the Web sites into "tabbed" sections of one
page, rather than multiple pages.

Tagging

Commonly used in blogs, site authors attach keyword
descriptions (called tags) to identify images or text
within their site as a categories or topic. Web pages
and blogs with identical tags can then be linked

content. If the tags are made public, online pages that
act as a Web-based bookmark service are able to index
them.

4.08

Torrent

BitTorrent is a file distribution system used for
transferring files across a network of people. As you
download a file, BitTorrent places what you download
on upload for other users; when multiple people are
downloading the same file at the same time they
upload pieces of the file to each other. BitTorrent
pieces together the file you are downloading, to where
the first part of a file you get may be the last part
someone else gets. As you continue to retrieve the file,
BitTorrent also uploads data to other users. For
example, a person with 98 percent of the file done is

71

directed to the people with the 2 percent of the file
they still need. The files downloaded via BitTorrent
are called torrents.
Web feeds

A Web document that is a shortened version of a Web
page that has been created for syndication. Feeds
usually end in .xml or .rss.

3.03

Weblog

A weblog is a Web page that serves as a publicly
accessible personal journal for an individual. Typically
updated daily, webblogs often reflect the personality
of the author. Weblogs are also called blogs.

2.99

Widget

Widget is a generic term for the part of a user interface
that allows the user to interface with the application
and operating system. Widgets display information
and invite the user to act in a number of ways. Typical
widgets include buttons, dialog boxes, pop-up
windows, pull-down menus, icons, scroll bars,
resizable window edges, progress indicators, selection
boxes, windows, tear-off menus, menu bars, toggle
switches and forms.

3.08

Wiki

A collaborative Web site comprises the perpetual
collective work of many authors. Similar to a blog in
structure and logic, a wiki allows anyone to edit, delete
or modify content that has been placed on the Web site
using a browser interface, including the work of
previous authors.

3.3 Procedure
IRB approval was sought from both UMB and the University of Baltimore in the summer
of 2014. The study was exempt at both institutions. See Appendix B for documentation.
Participant information was de-identified to ensure confidentiality of participants participating in
the research study.
Graduate and professional students were identified in the directory at UMB and emailed
an electronic survey measuring web-use skills in September of 2014. Students had two weeks to
take the assessment, from Wednesday, September 17, 2014 through Wednesday, October 1,

72

2014. The electronic survey was accessible at all times during the two-week period and could be
taken anywhere the participant had Internet access.
The survey was introduced via email with an informed consent (See Appendix C). Two
reminders were sent to non-respondents only over the two-week period. After the study was
over, one email address was chosen using an online number randomizer and that student was
given an iPad mini. Only one student was eligible to win a prize and that was distributed the day
after the survey.

3.4 Hypothesis
The primary purpose of this study was to examine whether academic discipline was
associated with web-use skills among the graduate and professional students at the University of
Maryland, Baltimore. To the best of this author’s knowledge, the effect of academic discipline
on digital literacy has not yet been investigated in the literature. When applying Biglan’s (1973)
paradigm of academic disciplines matrix to UMB’s graduate and professional schools, it is
apparent that the schools fall in different dimensions. Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry, and
Nursing are applied, hard, and life disciplines. Social Work is a pure, soft, life discipline, and
Law is an applied, soft, and non-life discipline. Research has shown that differing academic
disciplines have varying levels of ICT use (Weng & Ling, 2007; Fry, 2004; Fry, 2006). Based off
of Biglan’s framework and consequent research, the different disciplines at UMB may be
associated with different uses of ICT and varying levels of digital literacy skills.
The secondary purpose of the study was to investigate how age, gender, race, parental
education, international status, GPA, and self-perceived skills affect web-use skills. In current

73

literature, these variables have been shown to be associated with digital literacy. These factors
are addressed in depth in Sections 2.15 through 2.20.

Primary hypothesis
H1: Academic discipline is not associated with web-use skills among graduate and professional
students.
HA: Academic discipline is associated with web-use skills among graduate and professional
students.

Secondary hypotheses
H2: Asian/Pacific Islander and White/Caucasian participants will score higher than Black/African
American, Hispanic, and Other participants.
H3: Male participants will perceive themselves to be more competent users of technology and
have higher web-use skills than female participants.
H4: Higher Parental education will be positively related to web-use skills.
H5: Students with higher web-use skills will also have higher GPAs.
H6: Age is not associated with web-use skills among graduate and professional students.
H7: International status is not associated with web-use skills among graduate and professional
students.

3.5 Power Analysis and Sample Size
A power analysis was completed in the statistical software SAS version 9.1.3 “proc
power” to determine an adequate sample size for the survey. An R2 value of 0.21 was used from
previous research completed by Hargittai measuring variation in web use skills among
undergraduate college students (2010). Hargittai determined the R2 when she was exploring the
effect that age, gender, parental education, and race/ethnicity have on individuals’ Internet skills.
A sample size between 445 and 719 participants was needed to achieve a power range
between 0.90 and 0.99 (See Table 3.5.1). If by the end of the two-week period less than 445
students had taken the survey, a third and fourth reminder would have been send out to nonrespondents timed one week apart. If the desired number of participants had still not been
reached, another survey or assessment method would have been considered. Fortunately, a third
and fourth reminder was unnecessary, as the number of desired participants was reached before
the two week period was over.

3.6 Statistical Methods
Nonparametric procedures do not require assumptions about the parameters of the
populations represented by the samples. In particular, nonparametric data does not assume that
the populations form a normal distribution or any particularly shaped distribution. Nonparametric
statistics are used when the scores are from very skewed or otherwise non-normal distributions,
when the samples have significantly heterogeneous variances, or when the scores are from an
ordinal (ranked) or nominal data (categorical) (Heinman, 1992).
The Kruskal-Wallis H test was chosen because of its use for independent samples and is
the nonparametric equivalent to the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Kruskal-Wallis
H test differs from the ANOVA because it does not depend on the assumption that the sample is
normally distributed. It can be performed on ranked data, which means you convert the smallest
measurement to a rank or 1, the next smallest to a rank of 2, and so on. It assumes that the study
involves one independent variable and that there are three or more independent variables.
To use the Kruskal-Wallis H Test, four assumptions must be met. Assumption 1 states
that the dependent variable should be measured at the ordinal or continuous level (i.e., interval or
ratio). The dependent variables in the study are ranked on a scale of 1 to 5, so the ordinal ranked
data so assumption 1 is met. Assumption 2 states that independent variables should consist of
two or more categorical, independent groups. Two examples of independent variables that meet
this criterion include race/ethnicity (e.g., five groups: Asian/Pacific Islander, Black/African
American, Hispanic, White/Caucasian, and Other), and academic discipline (e.g. seven groups:
Dental, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Social Work, and Other). Assumption 3 states that
there should be independence of observations, which means that there is no relationship between
the observations in each group or between the groups themselves. This assumption is met

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

76

because each independent variable has different participants and no participant is in more than
one group. Last, Assumption 4 states that in order to know how to interpret the results from a
Kruskal-Wallis H test, you have to determine whether the distributions in each independent
variable have the same shape. For this study, that assumption was not met as independent
variables had different distribution shapes. Since the fourth assumption was not met, instead of
being able to compare the medians of the dependent variables we will need to compare mean
ranks. Although the last assumption was not met, with this modification a Kruskal-Wallis H test
can still be used with the data (Laerd Statistics, 2015).
The Kruskal-Wallis H test is an omnibus statistic and cannot tell you which specific
groups of independent variables are statistically significantly different from each other. Instead,
the Kruskal-Wallis H test tells you that at least two groups are different. Since this study is
examining students from six academic disciplines, there are more than two groups in the study
design. To determine which variables differed from each other, a Fishers Least Significant
Difference (LSD) test was used as a post hoc test to determine differences. If one of the expected
values for a group is less than five, which is true for some instances of this study, Fisher’s LSD
can be applied. Fisher’s LSD has one assumption, which is that there should be independence of
observations, or no relationship between the observations in each group or between the groups
themselves. Like with the Kruskal-Wallis H, this assumption is met because each independent
variable has different participants and no participant is in more than one group.
The Kruskal-Wallis H Test has been used in other similar studies with ordinal ranked
data. The Kruskal-Wallis H has been used to analyze adult learners access and attitudes towards
digital technology (Jeffs & Richardson, 2013), self-perceived information literacy (Bronstein &

CHAPTER IV
RESULTS
The results of this study examine whether academic discipline was associated with web-use
skills among the graduate and professional students at the University of Maryland,
Baltimore. The secondary purpose of the study was to investigate how age, gender, race,
parental education, international status, GPA, and self-perceived skills are related to webuse skills. The results chapter examines the statistical significance of each variable.

4.1 Study Sample Description and Demographics
A comparison of the demographics of this sample to the population of the University
community shows that the sample is representative. Overall, the total graduate and professional
population at UMB is 29 percent male and 71 percent female. Twenty three percent of the
sample is male, and 77 percent of the sample is female (See Table 4.1.1).
Post hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test revealed that there were statistically
significant differences between academic disciplines by gender. The schools of Nursing and
Social Work are not statistically different from each other, and also the schools of Dental, Law,
Medicine, and Pharmacy are not statistically different from each other. However, the schools of
Nursing and Social Work are statistically different from the schools of Dental, Law, Medicine,
and Pharmacy due to their much higher percentage of female participants.

The racial composition of the sample also reflects the composition of the population.
Sixty-one percent of the university population is Caucasian, and 39 percent are minorities. Sixtythree percent of the sample is Caucasian. The academic discipline with the highest nonCaucasian population is the School of Pharmacy (56.7%) followed closely by the School of
Dentistry (48.0%). The least racially diverse academic discipline is the School of Social Work
with 72.5 percent Caucasian, followed by the School of Medicine with 70.1 percent Caucasian
participants (See Table 4.1.2).
Post hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test revealed that there were statistically
significant differences between academic disciplines by race. The racial composition of the
School of Pharmacy is statistically significant different than all schools except for the School of
Dentistry. Both Pharmacy and Dental have a similar percentage of Asian/Pacific Islander
participants. The schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Social Work are not significantly different
from each other and are primarily Caucasian. The schools of Nursing and Social Work are
statistically significant different than the Schools of Law, Dentistry, and Pharmacy. The School
of Medicine is statistically different than the schools of Dentistry and Pharmacy, and the School
of Dentistry is different than the schools of Social Work, Nursing, and Medicine.

A total of 3 percent of participants are international students, which is comparable to the
to 4 percent of international students at UMB. Of all academic disciplines, the School of
Pharmacy has the highest percentage of international participant respondents at 11.9 percent,
followed by the School of Dentistry, which hosts an international population of 6 percent. The
academic discipline with the lowest international participant population is the School of Social
Work (0.8 % International students), followed closely by the School of Medicine (0.9%
International students) (See Table 4.1.3).
Post hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test revealed that there were statistically
significant differences between academic disciplines by international population. The Schools of
Nursing, Social Work, Law, and Medicine are not statistically different from each other. The
Schools of Nursing and Social Work are statistically different from the Schools of Dental and
Pharmacy. The School of Pharmacy is statistically different from all other schools.

The majority of participants (71.5%) were between 22 and 28 years old and only 7.2
percent of participants were older than 40 years of age. The School of Nursing had the highest
percentage of older participants with 27.8 percent of its participants older than 40 years of age.
The School of Pharmacy had the highest percentage of participants under 22 of age (13.4%) (See
Table 4.1.4).
Post hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test revealed that there were statistically
significant differences between academic disciplines by age. The schools of Dentistry, Law,
Medicine, and Pharmacy were not statistically different from each other based on age. The
School of Nursing was statistically different than every other school, and the School of Social
Work was different than all schools except for the School of Dentistry.

Participants rated themselves on self-perceived Internet skill so that the effect of selfperceived skill on the Web-use Index could be investigated. No participant rated himself or
herself as “not at all skilled” and only 2.1 percent of participants rated themselves as not very
skilled. Almost forty two percent of participants rated themselves as fairly skilled, 48.9 percent
as very skilled, and 6.4 percent as expert. Eleven and a half percent of law participants and 9.0
percent of pharmacy participants rated themselves as experts. Overall, only 2.7 percent of
participants rated themselves as not very skilled, or not at all skilled, so most participants rated
themselves as fairly skilled or above. Participants from the School of Law rated themselves the
highest, with 65.4 percent of participants rating themselves very skilled or expert. Participants
from the School of Dentistry rated their skills the lowest, as 56 percent of participants rated
themselves as fairly skilled or below (See Table 4.1.5).
Post hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test revealed that there was no statistically
significant difference between academic disciplines by self-perceived Internet skill.

Parental education was assessed because it has been found to be related to academic
achievement (Klebanov, Brooks-Gunn, & Duncan, 1994) and an indicator of higher digital

literacy skills (Hargittai, 2010). The average amount of parental education varied by the
academic discipline of the participant. The academic discipline with the highest number of
graduate or professional degrees for parental education was the School of Medicine at 60.7
percent. The lowest was the School of Pharmacy at 32.8 percent. Overall, almost 50 percent of
the participants had parents with degrees from graduate and professional schools. Thirty four
percent of all participants reported that their parents had college degrees. Only 16.4 percent of
participants had parents who did not have college degrees (See Table 4.1.6).
Post hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test revealed that there were statistically
significant differences between academic disciplines by parental education. The Schools of Law,
Nursing, Pharmacy, and Social Work were not statistically different from each other based on
parental education. There were also no statistically significant differences between the schools of
Dentistry and Medicine. The Schools of Dentistry and Medicine were significantly different than
the Schools of Nursing, Pharmacy, and Social Work.

GPA was assessed as a proxy for academic achievement, although it is noted that there is
variation in GPA by academic discipline. Participants from the School of Social Work reported
having the highest GPAs with 72.9 percent of students reporting GPAs greater than 3.7. The
School of Nursing had the second highest percentage of GPAs (39.6%). The School of Law had
the lowest GPAs with 43.5 percent of participants less than 3.3, followed closely by the School
of Medicine with 43.3 percent under 3.3 (See Table 4.1.7).
Post hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test revealed that there were statistically
significant differences between academic disciplines by GPA. The Schools of Dentistry,
Medicine, and Pharmacy were not statistically different from each other based on GPA, although
the School of Dentistry was significantly different than the School of Law. The schools of Law,
Medicine, and Pharmacy were not statistically different from one another. The School of Social
Work was statistically different than all other schools by GPA. In addition, the School of
Nursing was statistically different than all schools except for the School of Dentistry.

Previous research has found that race and gender affect web-use skills (Hargittai, 2010;
Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008). Because of this, an analysis of the demographics of race and gender
was performed. Black/African American participants have the highest percentage of female

participants (93.3%), followed by Other (90.0%), Hispanic (79.2%), White/Caucasian (75.0%),
and Asian/Pacific Islander (73.1%) (See Table 4.1.8).
Post hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test revealed that there were statistically
significant differences between race/ethnicities by gender. There were no statistically significant
differences between the gender make-up between Asian/Pacific Islanders, Hispanics,
White/Caucasians, or participants that identified as Other race/ethnicities. There was a
statistically higher percentage of females when comparing Black/African Americans with
White/Caucasian and Asian/Pacific Islander participants.

In addition, it is also important to consider gender and academic discipline when
controlling for race. For Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and White/Caucasian participants the
percentage of female participants make up about three fourths of the population. This contrasts
from the population of Black/African American and Other participants, where females make up
93.3% and 90.0% of the population respectively (See Table 4.1.9).

Hargittai and her colleagues (2008; 2010) found that race interacts with self-efficacy
regarding web-use skills. Because of this, an analysis the demographics of race and selfperceived Internet skills was performed. Hispanic participants ranked themselves as having the
lowest self-perceived Internet skills with 50.0 percent of participants selecting fairly skilled or
below, followed by white/Caucasian at 46.0 percent, Black/African American at 41.7 percent,

Asian/Pacific Islander at 40.9 percent, and last was Other at 40.0 percent. Of the participants
who ranked themselves as experts, the participants that were most likely to rank themselves as
experts were Other (10.0%), Black African American (8.3%), Hispanic (8.3%), Asian/Pacific
Islander (7.5%), and last was Caucasian (5.5%) (See Table 4.1.10).
Post hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test revealed that there was no statistically
significant difference between race/ethnicities by self-perceived Internet skills.

Men are more likely than women to perceive themselves to be competent users of
technology (Madigan, Goodfellow & Stone, 2007; He & Freeman, 2010; Hargiatti & Shafer,
2006). Analysis of the demographics of gender and self-perceived Internet skills indicated that
male participants were more likely than female participants to rate themselves as Expert (12.8%
of male students vs. 4.5% of female students). The gap widens further when the Very Skilled and
Expert ratings are combined; 67.5 percent of male participants and 51.7 percent of female
participants rating themselves as Very Skilled or Expert (See Table 4.1.11).

Post hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test revealed that there were statistically
significant differences between self-perceived Internet skills by gender. Male participants were
statistically more likely to select expert or very skilled than female participants

To investigate whether there was an effect of gender on self-perceived Internet skills, a
Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed. Results showed statistical significance of gender on selfperceived Internet skills (X2 = 12.72, df = 1, p < 0.01). It appears that male participants rated
their self-perceived Internet skills higher than female participants.

4.2 Effect of Academic Discipline on Participants’ Web-Use Skills
The primary hypothesis of this study examines the association between academic
discipline and web-use skills among graduate and professional students at the University of
Maryland, Baltimore. To investigate whether there was an effect of academic discipline on the
web-use skills, a Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed. The results showed an effect of academic
discipline on nine of the twenty-seven variables. There was statistical significance (p < 0.01) for
the following variables: phishing, preference setting, reload, rss, tabbed browsing, tagging,

torrent, web feeds, and wiki (See Table 4.2.1). A full explanation of all dependent variables can
be found in Table 3.2.2 in Chapter 3. A statistical significance of p < 0.01 rather than the
conventional p < 0.05 was chosen to determine statistical significance. This was done to ensure
that there were no false positives at p < 0.05.

The statistically significant difference for the variable Phishing appears to be due to the
very high score of participants in the School of Pharmacy compared to the other academic
disciplines. The academic discipline that appears to have the lowest score for the variable
Phishing is the School of Nursing. Post hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test revealed that
there were statistical significant differences between the School of Pharmacy and all other
schools. In addition, there were statistically significant differences between the schools of
Dentistry and the School of Nursing. There was no statistically significant difference between the
schools of Law, Medicine, and Social Work.
For the variable Preference Setting, the statistically significant difference appears to be
due to the difference between the School of Law and the School of Nursing. The School of Law
appears to have the highest score, followed respectively by the School of Pharmacy, School of

Social Work, and School of Medicine. The academic disciplines that appear to have the lowest
scores are the School of Dentistry, and the School of Nursing. Post hoc comparisons revealed
that there were statistically significant differences between the School of Law and the schools of
Dental and Nursing. In addition, the School of Nursing was statistically different from all other
schools except for the School of Dentistry. There was no statistically significant difference
between the schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Pharmacy, and Social Work.
The statistically significant difference for the variable Reload appears to be due the
difference between the schools of Law, Pharmacy, Medicine, and Social Work with the schools
of Dentistry and Nursing. Although it appears that the School of Law had the highest score, there
is a large gap between the two groups mentioned above. Post hoc comparisons revealed that
there were statistically significant differences between the School of Law and the School of
Social Work, and also the School of Dentistry and the schools of Law and Medicine. In addition,
the School of Nursing was statistically different than all other schools. There was no statistically
significant difference between the schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, Social Work, and Law.
For the variable RSS, the statistically significant difference appears to be between the
School of Law and the School of Nursing. The School of Law appears to have the highest score
followed by the School of Medicine, and the School of Pharmacy. The academic discipline with
the lowest score appears to be the School of Nursing. Post hoc comparisons revealed that the
schools of Nursing and Social Work were statistically different than the schools of Law,
Medicine, and Pharmacy. In addition, the School of Dentistry was statistically different than the
School of Law. There was no statistically significant difference between the schools of Law,
Medicine, and Pharmacy.

The statistically significant difference for the variable Tabbed Browsing appears to be
due to the difference between three groupings of academic disciplines. The School of Law
appears to have the highest score, followed by the School of Medicine. The second grouping that
appears to be made of the middle scorers are the schools of Pharmacy, Dentistry, and Social
Work. The School of Nursing appears to be much lower than the other two groups and also
appears to be the lowest score. Post hoc comparisons revealed that the School of Nursing was
different than all other academic disciplines. In addition, it was found that the School of Social
Work was statistically different than the schools of Law and Medicine, and also that the School
of Dentistry was different than the School of Law. There was no statistically significant
difference between the schools of Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Social Work.
For the variable Tagging, the statistically significant difference appears to be between the
schools of Law, Pharmacy, Social Work, and Medicine and the schools of Pharmacy and
Nursing. The first group of academic disciplines appears to have higher scores than the second
group of academic disciplines. Post hoc comparisons revealed that the School of Nursing was
different than all other schools except for the School of Dentistry. In addition, it was found that
the School of Dentistry was different than the School of Law. There was no statistically
significant difference between the schools of Law, Medicine, Pharmacy, and Social Work.
The statistically significant difference for the variable Torrent appears to be due to the
difference between four groupings of schools. The schools of Pharmacy and Law appear to have
the highest scores. The next highest groupings of schools are the schools of Dentistry, and
Medicine. The School of Social Work appears to have the next highest score, and the school that
appears to be significantly lower than the rest is the School of Nursing. Post hoc comparisons
revealed that the academic disciplines of Nursing and Social Work are statistically different than

92

all other academic disciplines. In addition, it was found that the School of Medicine was
different than the School of Pharmacy. There was no statistically significant differences between
the schools of Dentistry, Law, and Pharmacy.
The statistically significant difference for the variable Web feeds appears to be due to the
difference between three groups of schools. The schools of Pharmacy and Law appear to have
scored the highest. They are followed by the schools of Medicine, Social Work, and Dentistry
with middle scores. The academic discipline that appears to have the lowest scores is the School
of Nursing. Post hoc comparisons revealed that the School of Nursing was statistically different
than the schools of Pharmacy, Law, and Medicine. In addition, it was found that the schools of
Social Work and Dentistry were statistically different than the School of Pharmacy. There were
no statistically significant differences between the schools of Law, Medicine, and Social Work.
The statistically significant difference for the variable Wiki appears to be due to the
difference between three tiers of scores. The schools of Pharmacy, Law, and Dentistry appear to
have had the highest scores. They are followed by the schools of Medicine and Social Work with
the middle scores. The academic discipline that appears to have the lowest scores is the School
of Nursing. Post hoc comparisons revealed that the School of Nursing was statistically different
than all other academic disciplines. In addition, it was found that the School of Social Work was
statistically different than all other academic disciplines except for the School of Medicine.
There was no statistically significant difference between the schools of Dentistry, Law,
Medicine, and Pharmacy.
Looking at the data as a whole and examining the average rank sum for the six academic
disciplines, it appears that participants in the School of Law have the highest score, followed
closely by the schools of Pharmacy and Medicine. The next group of middle scorers appears to

be from the School of Social Work and the School of Dentistry. The lowest scores appear to be
from the School of Nursing (See Graph 4.2.1).

the graduate and professional participants in this study, a Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed.
The results showed an effect of academic discipline on eighteen of the twenty-seven variables.
There was statistical significance (p < 0.01) for the following variables: cache, firewall, frames,
jpg, malware, newsgroup, phishing, podcasting, preference setting, reload, rss, spyware, tabbed

4.4 Effect of Race/Ethnicity on Participants’ Web-use Skills
Previous research (Hargittai, 2010; Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008) has found that race affects
web-use skills. To investigate whether there was an effect of race/ethnicity on web-use skills, a
Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed. The results showed an effect of race/ethnicity on ten of the
twenty-seven variables. There was statistical significance (p < 0.01) for the following variables:
bookmarklet, cache, frames, phishing, rss, social bookmarking, torrent, web log, widget, and
wiki (See Table 4.4.1).

The statistically significant difference for the variable Bookmarklet appears to be due to
the differences between Asian/Pacific Islanders and African American participants compared to
Hispanic, Caucasian, and Other participants. The first group mentioned appears to have much

were statistically different than both Asian/Pacific Islander and African American participants.

Asian/Pacific Islander participants were statistically different than all other groups. There was no
statistically significant difference between African Americans, Hispanic, Caucasian, and Other
participants.

Looking at the data as a whole and examining the average rank sum for the five
race/ethnicities, it appears Asian/Pacific Islander participants have a highest average rank sum
followed by Other, African American, and Caucasian. The lowest scores appear to be from
Hispanic participants (See Graph 4.4.1).

4.5 Effect of International Status on Participants’ Web-use Skills
UMB’s international population makes up 4 percent of the total population and was
included to explore whether international status had an effect on web-use skills. The results
showed no significance for international status. Examination of the average rank sum for
international and non-international participants indicates that international participants have
higher scores. However the discrepancy in sample sizes (international students n=14, and noninternational students n=501) prevents any meaningful analysis.

4.6 Effect of Parental Education on Participants’ Web-use Skills
Parental education was included as a variable because it has been found to be related to
academic achievement (Klebanov, Brooks-Gunn, & Duncan, 1994). To investigate whether there
was an effect of parental education on web-use skills, a Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed on
the data. The results showed no statistical significance for parental education for any of the
twenty-seven variables (p < 0.01).

4.7 Effect of Self-Perceived Internet Skills on Participants’ Web-use Skills
Since self-efficacy in general is related to actual behavior (Bandura, 2012), participants
rated themselves on self-perceived Internet skills so effect of self-perceived skills on the Webuse Index could be investigated. In addition, self-efficacy with technology has been shown to be
a significant predictor of a student’s future academic and career path (Vekiri & Chronaki, 2008).
The results showed significant differences on web-use skills by self-perceived Internet skills. All
twenty-seven variables showed differences between levels of self-perceived Internet skills (p <
0.01) (See Table 4.7.1).

4.8 Effect of Age on Participants’ Web-use skills
There is a perception that younger students born after 1982 are more digitally literate than
older students (Prenski, 2001, Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005), although it has been refuted by recent
literature reviews (Jones & Shao 2011; Bennett, Maton & Kervin, 2008). To investigate whether
there was an effect of age on web-use skills, a Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed. The results
showed significant differences between age groups for three of the twenty-seven variables (p <
0.01). These variables were tabbed browsing, tagging, and torrent (See Table 4.8.1).

The statistically significant differences for all three variables (Tabbed Browsing,

those over 40 years of age. The lowest scores for those three variables appear to come from the
participants that are greater than 40 years of age (See Graph 4.8.1). Post hoc comparisons using
the Fisher LSD test revealed that for all variables, the statistically significant difference was
between those 39 and younger, and those over 40 years old.

4.9 Effect of GPA on Participants’ GPA
GPA was assessed as a proxy for academic achievement, although it is noted that there is
variation in GPA by academic discipline. The results showed statistically significant differences
for GPA. Only one of the twenty-seven terms variables showed differences between GPA (p <
0.01): social bookmarking (X2 = 13.65, df = 2, p < 0.001).
Post hoc comparisons using the Fisher LSD test revealed that there were statistically
significant differences for the variable social bookmarking between GPAs over 3.7 and GPAs
under 3.3. The statistically significant differences for the variable Social Bookmarking appear to
be due to the differences between all three groups. The lowest scores for Social Bookmarking
appear to be from participants with GPAs greater than 3.7, the middle scores are from those with
GPAs between 3.3 – 3.7, and the highest scores are from those with GPAs lower than 3.3 (See
Graph 4.9.1).

CHAPTER V
DISCUSSION

5.1 Summary of Results
The primary purpose of the study was to examine whether academic discipline was
associated with web-use skills among the graduate and professional students at the University of
Maryland, Baltimore. Although there is a growing body of literature about the digital literacy of
undergraduate students, there has been little, if any, research completed on the population of
graduate and professional students. Graduate and professional disciplinary communities have
been described as tribes or territories because their unique cultures make their academic
communities different from each other (Becher, 1989; Becher & Trowler, 2001). Each academic
disciplinary community has its own unique identity, which influences how students are educated,
trained, and socialized. Because of the unique academic disciplinary identity and characteristics
of graduate students, academic discipline should be examined when striving to understand the
digital literacy of graduate students.
When comparing web-use skills across the different disciplines, significant statistical
difference was found for nine of the twenty-seven web-use variables. There were statistically
significant differences (p < 0.01) for the following variables: phishing, preference setting, reload,
rss, tabbed browsing, tagging, torrent, web feeds, and wiki. It appears that the School of Law had
the highest web-use scores, followed closely by the School of Pharmacy and the School of
Medicine. Mid-range scores appeared to be from the School of Social Work and the School of
Dentistry respectively. The lowest scores appeared to be from the School of Nursing.

107

The secondary purpose of the study was to investigate how age, gender, race, parental
education, international status, GPA, and self-perceived skills are related to web-use skills.
Based on trends in the literature, it was hypothesized that Asian/Pacific Islander and
White/Caucasian participants would score higher than Black/African American, Hispanic, and
Other race/ethnicities. Race/ethnicity had an effect on web-use skills on ten of the twenty-seven
variables. There was statistical significance (p < 0.01) for the variables bookmarklet, cache,
frames, phishing, rss, social bookmarking, torrent, web log, widget, and wiki. For the sample
investigated in this study, Asian/Pacific Islander students have the highest scores followed by
Other, African American, and Caucasian students. Hispanic students had the lowest scores.
The effect of age on web-use skills was minimal, with only three of the twenty-seven
variables showing statistically significant differences between age groups. Age was statistically
significant for the variables tabbed browsing, tagging, and torrent. The statistically significant
differences for all three of these variables appear to be due to the difference between those under
40 years of age and those over 40 years of age. The lowest scores for those three variables appear
to come from the participants that are greater than 40 years old.
Another purpose of the study was to investigate whether male participants would
perceive themselves to be more competent users of technology and have higher web-use skills
than female participants. Gender was statistically significant for eighteen of the twenty-seven
variables. The statistically significant variables included cache, firewall, frames, jpg, malware,
newsgroup, phishing, podcasting, preference setting, reload, rss, spyware, tabbed browsing,
torrent, web feeds, web log, widget, and wiki. The findings suggest that women indeed have
lower web-use skills than men and, in addition, rate themselves as less competent Internet users

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

108

then men. It appears that male participants outscored female participants on every variable, even
for those that did not show statistically significant differences.
Next, it was found that parental education did not have a statistically significant effect on
the Web-use Index scores for graduate and professional students. This finding differs from prior
research results regarding undergraduates, which found that undergraduate students with at least
one parent with a graduate degree exhibit a much higher knowledge about the Internet (Hargittai,
2010). Although the effect of parental education on web-use skills has been studied with
undergraduates, the last two independent variables, international status and GPA, have not. For
GPA there was a statistically significant difference for only one of the twenty-seven variables;
social bookmarking. The statistically significant differences for the variable Social Bookmarking
appears to be due to the differences between all three age categories. The lowest scores for
Social Bookmarking appear to be from participants with GPAs greater than 3.7, the middle
scores are from those with GPAs between 3.3 – 3.7, and the highest scores are from those with
GPAs lower than 3.3. The significant variable appears to show an inverse relationship of GPA to
web-use skills. Finally, in this study the results showed the effect of international status on webuse skills had no statistically significant differences for any of the variables.

5.2 Limitations
There are some notable limitations of the study that may have implications for the
interpretation and generalizability of results. First, caution should be used when generalizing the
results beyond graduate and professional students. The population at large of graduate and
professional students is already a relatively privileged group since all have completed
undergraduate degrees and are in the process of completing advanced degrees. These findings

	  

© Jenny Owens 2015	  

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

109

may be applicable to graduate students but not to the population at large or undergraduate
students.
Also, the findings of the study were based on an indirect assessment of skill that is a
proxy for actual skill. Although the scores on the Web-use Index correlate with actual skill
(Hargittai, 2005; Hargittai & Hsieh, 2012), it would be ideal if the assessment were a direct
assessment instead of relying on a proxy to demonstrate a relationship. Direct measures are
tangible and self-explanatory evidence of what students know. Conversely, indirect measures
reveal characteristics associated with learning, but at best they imply that knowledge is attained
and is less clear and less convincing than direct evidence (Suskie, 2009).

5.3 Discussion and Implications
If you use Biglan’s model (1973) to group the academic disciplines, they fall into three
categories. The Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry, and Nursing are applied, hard, and
life disciplines. Social Work is a pure, soft, life discipline, and Law is an applied, soft, and nonlife discipline. Based off of this framework, it was hypothesized that these different disciplines at
UMB may be associated with varying levels of digital literacy skills. Similarities and
dissimilarities between academic disciplines were observed, but did not appear to fall along the
lines of Biglan’s model. For example, even though they were in the same Biglan classification,
participants at the schools of Nursing and Dentistry appeared to have the lowest scores while
participants from the schools of Pharmacy and Medicine had some of the highest.
After reviewing the effects of other independent variables on web-use skills, specifically
gender and race, it could be argued that those variables may have stronger associations with
varying levels of web-use skills than academic discipline. That said, the effect of gender and race

	  

© Jenny Owens 2015	  

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

110

does not explain all variations of web-use skills among the different academic disciplines. If
gender and race were the only influential variables, then the schools of Nursing and Social Work
would have the lowest scores due to both having the highest percentage of female participants,
and the lowest percentage of Asian/Pacific Islander participants. Although they were both in the
bottom three, the School of Dentistry also joined them even though it had the lowest percentage
of female participants and the second highest percentage of Asian/Pacific Islander participants.
Solely in the lens of gender and race, one could hypothesize that Dental participants would have
some of the highest scores. Instead, the School of Dentistry had the second lowest web-use
scores. This anomaly cannot be explained by gender and race alone, and it appears that the
academic discipline the participant is enrolled in is associated with varying levels of web-use
scores.
Why would students in different academic disciplines have varying levels of web-use
skills? Graduate and professional disciplinary communities have been described as tribes or
territories because their unique cultures make their academic communities different from each
other (Becher, 1989; Becher & Trowler, 2001). Differences between disciplines include research
and publications, career paths, symbols of identity, and student training (Clark, 1999). Students
may self-select to go to different academic disciplines based on innate abilities, strengths, or
cultural preferences. These differences may contribute to varying levels of web-use skills.
In addition, some academic disciplines are more likely to use information and
communication technology (ICT) in the academic curriculum (Weng & Ling, 2007). Research
cultures such as the pure, hard disciplines of science and health science are more likely to
strategically incorporate the use of ICT into their fields (Fry, 2004), while soft disciplines in the
social sciences are more likely to incorporate ICTs in an as needed and localized manner (Fry,

	  

© Jenny Owens 2015	  

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

111

2006). In addition, further studies have found differences in academic discipline by technology
acceptance (Orji, 2010) risk perception of technologies (Weisenfeld & Ott, 2010), and general
use of technology (Guidry & BrckaLorenz, 2010). Perhaps the differences in web-use skills can
be attributed to the type or execution of ICT in the classroom, or students’ academic experience
or comfort with technology. Future research should investigate how differing cultures and ICT
use affects digital literacy among academic disciplines.
Most of the literature about digital literacy has focused on the skills and abilities of
undergraduate students. The lack of research on graduate and professional students has been
attributed to a belief that graduate students have adequate skills because they have advanced
through an undergraduate experience (O’Donnell et al., 2009). Graduate students are not only
underrepresented in the literature, but there is an assumption that they have already gained the
skills that they need to successfully navigate technology. In addition, the specificity of the
education of graduate and professional students may exclude training or emphasis on digital
literary skills, or operate under the assumption that graduate level learners are already digitally
literate. When you combine this knowledge with the un-evidenced claim that digital natives have
inherent technological ability, you can see how the assumption that graduate students are tech
savvy becomes even more pronounced.
Results from this study find that like undergraduate students, graduate students have a
variety of digital skill levels and that these skill levels are more influenced by other demographic
factors other than age. Age did have a small relationship with digital literacy, but only with
variables that represent newer technology advances catering towards younger adults. An example
of this is sharing files through torrents, used more frequently by undergraduate students than
older adults (Jones et al., 2009). Findings from this study support other research (Jones & Shao,

	  

© Jenny Owens 2015	  

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

112

2011; Kennedy et al., 2007; 2008; Bennet & Maton, 2010) that today’s students are not a single
group or generation with common characteristics, but instead have varying skill levels.
It was hypothesized that GPA would be positively related with digital literacy skills. In
this study, this was not found to be the case. The one statistically significantly different variable,
social bookmarking, actually showed an inverse relationship between skill and GPA. This may
be due to the variety of grading scales and curriculums used by the different academic
disciplines. The outcome may have been different if the GPAs of participants were compared
within a particular academic discipline or school, instead of comparing academic disciplines
against each other.
Prior research indicates that the socioeconomic factors of parental education, gender, and
race affect the digital literacy of undergraduate students (Hargittai, 2010). Results from this
study found that while gender and race affected the digital literacy of graduate and professional
students, parental education did not. This finding marks an interesting difference between
graduate and undergraduate students and is a unique contribution to the literature. The
socioeconomic advantage of parental education does not seem to affect graduate or professional
students in the same way it affects undergraduate students. The findings suggest that at some
point, students outgrown the impact of their parents’ education. The students who do not
outgrow their parents’ impact may be less likely to end up in graduate school. Goldin and Katz
(2008) found that the highly educated are able to keep up with advancements in technology and
increase their lead over people in lower socioeconomic classes. Also, more education is
characterized by higher levels of computer ownership, spending more time online, and more
availability of Internet access (DiMaggio et al., 2004) all of which are associated with higher
web-use skills. It can be hypothesized that since participants of the study are already in graduate

or professional school, the effect of the socioeconomic advantage of their parents’ education on
web-use skills has been offset.
Although the level of students’ education appears to negate the effect of parental
education, it does not negate the effect gender has on web-use skills. Examining the results in
closer detail, gender plays a larger role in the digital literacy of graduate and professional
students than other demographic factors. The results of this study found that men scored higher
on the Web-use Index and perceived themselves to be more competent users of technology than
women. This may be due to a plethora of factors influenced by gender including family life, selfefficacy, and access and use of technology (McMillian & Morrison, 2006; Correa, 2010;
Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008; Hassani, 2006; Livingstone & Helsper, 2007).
Beginning with family life, research by McMillan & Morrison (2006) suggests that the
family environment can reinforce gender stereotypes related to Internet use. McMillian &
Morrison (2006) found that generally, mothers were less likely to use communication technology
while fathers displayed more Internet use and proficiency. Daughters mirror the gender roles
displayed by their mothers, and this has the ability to contribute to stereotypes surrounding
women and their Internet use. In addition, men have been found to have more positive attitudes
towards the Internet than women (Sherman et al., 2000; Slate et al., 2002; Zhang, 2002).
In this study, higher self-perceived Internet skills were positively related with higher
web-use skills. This variable is important because participants’ self-perceived skills are not
always positively related with actual skill. Some studies have found that male students rate their
self-perceived skills higher and actually score higher (Hargittai, 2010), but other studies found
that men have higher levels of self-perceived web-use skills than women despite similarities in

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

114

actual skill (Hargittai & Shafer, 2006; Madigan, Goodfellow, & Stone, 2007). In this study, men
both rated their self-perceived Internet scores higher, and scored higher on the Web-use Index.
He and Freeman (2010) completed a study on web use and gender and their results
suggest female students were found to have less computer knowledge and fewer computing
experiences than their male counterparts. Men are also more likely to have more technology
classes in school, more computers in the home in which they grew up, and a personal computer
in their own room (Correa, 2010). These factors may contribute to male participants’ higher
scores in this study. Future research should examine attitudes and perceptions as they relate to
technology use and gender of graduate and professional students.
Second to gender, race had the second highest effect on web-use skills. The findings that
Asian/Pacific Islander students had the highest web-use skills and Hispanic students had the
lowest support those of Hargittai and Hinnant (2008), who found that Asian American students
used the web more than other groups regardless of resources or experience, and that students of
Hispanic origin report knowing less about the Internet. Asian/Pacific Islanders experience similar
prejudice and discrimination encountered by other minority groups (Sue, 1981), but yet in this
study had the highest scores on the Web-use Index. Why could that be? Many studies have
investigated the high achievement of Asian/Pacific Islander students. While some studies
emphasize selective immigration (Hirschman and Wong, 1986), the most widely accepted
explanation involves the integration of cultural values that promote academic excellence (Sue &
Obazaki, 1990). Some examples of cultural values embodied in Asian American culture that
have been identified as promoting educational success are the importance of hard work, respect
for education, and high expectations for achievement (Kitano, 1984; Sue & Okazaki, 1990). In
addition, family socialization has been proposed as a major factor for transmitting cultural

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

115

values, and contributing to Asian American students’ academic success (Mordkowitz &
Ginsburg, 1987).
In addition, research has found that students, who hold beliefs that their skills are less,
tend to believe that success and intelligence is innate and unable to be changed (Komarraju &
Nadler, 2013). On the other hand, those students who have a higher self-image outperform others
because they are able self-regulate their impulses and persist when faced with a difficult situation
(Komarraju & Nadler, 2013). Those who possess higher self-efficacy and expectations for
achievement are more likely to outperform others with lower self-efficacy (Beas & Salanova,
2006).
The high scores of Asian/Pacific Islander students does not depart from literature within
the study of digital literacy or academic achievement in general, but other findings from this
study about the impact of race were unanticipated. Perhaps the most surprising was the finding
that African Americans scored higher than Caucasian students on the Web-use Index. The gap in
academic achievement between African Americans and white Americans has been studied
extensively (Rothstein & Wozny, 2011). The literature surrounding this topic could easily create
the basis for another thesis (or three or four). To summarize, there is a gap in the academic
achievement of black and white students. This is impacted by many factors including but not
limited to income, schooling, wealth (Jencks & Phillips, 1998; Hill 2001), household
composition (Astone & McLanahan, 1991), perceived teacher support (Hayes, 2011), parental
involvement (Rosenblatt & Peled, 2002), school environment (Webster, 2004), and parental
educational aspirations (Overstreet et al., 2005).
Moving from the gap in academic achievement and specifically delving into digital
literacy, the finding from this study is contrary to other findings regarding African American and

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

116

Caucasian students. In the literature, African American students report knowing less about the
Internet (Hargittai, 2010) and have scored lower on tests measuring information and digital
literacy (Sexton, Hignite, Margavio, & Margavio, 2009; Jackson et al., 2008; Ritzhaupt, Feng,
Dawson, & Barron, 2013). What’s also noteworthy is that in this study 93.3 percent of
Black/African American participants were female. So although they scored higher than
White/Caucasians overall, in this instance race may have had a larger impact than gender on
web-use skills. Similar to the discussion surrounding parental education, it can be hypothesized
that since participants of the study are already in graduate or professional school, the effect of the
socioeconomic advantage or disadvantage of their race on web-use skills is offset.
Possible reasons for this finding could be that African American students in graduate
school may have a higher socioeconomic status, higher quality of schooling, more parental
support, or a better school environment. Future research should investigate the digital literacy of
African American graduate and professional students to uncover why it deviates from the
traditional academic achievement gap. Further studies of graduate and professional students may
not confirm the results found in this study. Learning more about this subject has the potential to
affect how this gap is addressed throughout the course of an individual’s educational path, and
not just as graduate and professional students.
The conversation surrounding the effect of gender and race is important in the context of
digital inequality. DiMaggio et al. (2004) created a theoretical framework that highlights five
aspects of inequality related to information and communication technologies: 1) the quality of
hardware, software, and network connection, 2) autonomy of use, 3) skill, 4) availability of
social support, 5) extent and quality of use. DiMaggio et al. (2004) proposed that demographic
and socioeconomic factors influence the level and quality of the first four factors. This goes on to

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

117

influence the types of use, which then creates differentiated benefits and opportunities of use.
Ultimately, this can contribute to differing life outcomes. Those who are more privileged are
positioned to benefit more from the medium than those who are less privileged. Neglecting to
address this gap in digital literacy between different genders and races may deepen secondary
digital divides and disadvantage certain groups of people. Furthermore, it has been found that
online abilities are related to a person’s future socioeconomic status (Hargittai, 2002; Hargittai &
Hinnant, 2008; Hargittai & Walejko, 2008). Not addressing these concerns has the potential to
contribute to inequality. Future research should investigate how types of Internet use affect
potential gains in human, financial, and social capital.

5.5 Conclusion
In light of the concern of demographic factors and their relationship with digital
inequality, faculty, staff, and policy makers should take action by creating initiatives that address
the digital literacy of graduate and professional students. This can be done by creating programs
and initiatives that include aspects of DiMaggio et al. (2004)’s framework of digital inequality,
particularly skill, availability of social support, and extent and quality of use. Skill addresses
actual skill with technology. Extent and quality of use addresses the cognitive aspects of
navigating technology and the ethical impacts of technology use. Social support addresses
changing what is modeled in society and mentoring others. In the case of this study digital
literacy was measured by evaluating web-use skills with Hargittai and Hsieh’s Web Use Index
(2010). This assessment falls under DiMaggio et al. (2004)’s domain of skill, but is narrow from
a holistic standpoint of impacting digital inequality. Taking a wider lens and addressing more
domains would require an integrated approach regarding education around digital competence.

To start with initiatives that address skill, it would be a useful practice to evaluate
students’ digital literacy skills upon or before entering graduate school. If students do not meet a
designated skill threshold they should be required or encouraged to take a class or workshop
addressing the skills needed to enhance their competency with technology. To do this at such a
large scale, more affordable and accessible assessment tools should be developed with an
emphasis on skills that are needed to be successful as a graduate or professional student.
Likewise, it would be useful to also evaluate the digital literacy of faculty and staff upon joining
the university and provide them with on-going support and training as needed. Also, faculty and
staff that are engaged with technology should actively mentor students and/or their peers. This
can be done informally through impromptu trainings or formally through an organized series of
professional development opportunities.
Universities could offer a curriculum or co-curriculum of workshops or trainings to
graduate and professional students that address general technological competence. Examples of
workshops could include “Getting started with Zotero,” “How to build a website when you don’t
know how to code” or “Cyberbullying and higher education” When designing these programs, it
is important to emphasize actual technical skill with certain programs, but also address the
cognitive and ethical aspects of digital literacy. As the volume of information available online
expands, students will be challenged to search critically and evaluate information. A student’s
conceptual ability to adapt to new technology and navigate these changes will be paramount.
Also, future research should investigate bias in instruction. Educational materials to help
educators to overcome bias exist, but often educators do not engage with these materials because
they think themselves incapable of bias. Instead, activities should be facilitated with educators
that help them uncover their own biases and how to be cognizant of those biases when teaching

EXAMINING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT AFFECT THE WEB-USE SKILLS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

119

and leading programs. Recognizing bias is essential to closing the skill gap for women and
minorities.
From a societal and policy perspective, those that have the responsibility of
communicating should start portraying those who work in technology driven fields differently,
so that diverse and underrepresented groups can see themselves working and engaging with
technology. Currently, the overwhelming image of technology is white, geeky men and this can
discourage participation from diverse groups. Individuals form models of what is possible and
acceptable when they see people like themselves inhabiting those roles. The achievements of
women and diverse groups should be highlighted to encourage engagement with technology.
Moving from societal to social support, just as the popular Girls on the Run encourages
girls to exercise and be active, programs that support young women’s engagement and
competency with technology should be advocated for. Girls tend to fall off the STEM
bandwagon in sixth or seventh grade, so ideally this group would engage students before they
reach that age. To address this, graduate and professional students in STEM fields could partner
with local middle or elementary schools to encourage and empower young girls’ participation in
science and technology fields. In addition to technological competence, it is also important to
address training or instruction regarding self-efficacy and technology. Self-efficacy with
technology has been shown to be a significant predictor of a student’s future academic and career
path (Vekiri & Chronaki, 2008), and women have been shown to have higher levels of Internet
anxiety and lower levels of technology self-efficacy than men (Sherman et al., 2000; Zhang,
2002; Slate et al., 2002; Hargittai & Shafer, 2006). Addressing Internet anxiety through role
modeling or education has the potential to create a more comfortable environment where women
will feel empowered to use technological tools.

In conclusion, the conversation surrounding the effect of gender and race is important in
the context of digital inequality. Due to relationship of demographic factors and digital
inequality, faculty, staff, and policy makers should take action by creating initiatives that address
the skill and availability of social support for graduate and professional students. Not addressing
these concerns has the potential to contribute to inequality.
