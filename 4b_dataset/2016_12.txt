I dedicate this dissertation to my family. My father, Pedro Julian Ruiz Rodriguez, taught me to
be honorable and always said to me “plan your work, and work your plan.” He passed on while I
was still working on this dissertation and he was as proud of me as I was of him. My mother,
Carmen Maria Gonzalez de Ruiz, taught me how to be caring and astute. My parents not only
built a home filled with love, respect, and happiness, but they also told my brothers, Dr. Pedro
Javier Ruiz and Architect Isaac Alberto Ruiz, that we could be whomever we wanted to be and
achieve whatever we wanted to achieve.
But most of all, I dedicate this dissertation to my children, Jonathan Freeman, Michelle Nicole,
and James Patrick. My kids taught me humility, patience, compassion, and all about the
fragileness the human heart. I learned what true love was when my children came into my life.
Everything that I am, I owe to my family and especially to my three children. I love them all
more than life itself, and I always carry them in my heart.

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study was to identify and explain the factors that contribute to the
implementation of succession planning and management programs (SP&MPs) in academic
libraries as a means of addressing the lack of planning for and development of current academic
librarians to fill future leadership roles at their libraries through the provision of these programs.
Kurt Lewin’s (1947) planned change theory framed the research. The theory guided the
understanding of the change process and assisted in identifying the driving forces for and
restraining forces against a planned change. Understanding and recognizing the forces that can
support or impede a planned change may help leaders foresee challenges and opportunities
before following through with the change process that includes unfreezing the current status,
moving the group towards the desired change, and then refreezing the change at the preferred
level. The study found that the deans’ leadership styles affected their decisions to implement
SP&MPs as a planned change at their academic libraries and identified driving forces for and
restraining forces against program implementation.
The study employed a mixed-method sequential explanatory research design that
consisted of online questionnaires using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire self-rater form
(MLQ 5x) followed by structured in-depth interviews. The findings from the analyses of the
MLQ 5x standardized scale demonstrate that the leadership styles of the academic library deans
made a difference in their decisions to implement SP&MPs as a planned change at their libraries.
The findings from the analyses of the in-depth interviews demonstrate that many driving forces
for and restraining forces against SP&MP implementation affected the deans’ decisions now and
may affect their decisions in the future. The driving forces were divided into main categories and
included; constant change, library staff training, deans’ perceptions towards the future and the
x

profession, and the budget. The restraining forces were also divided into main categories and
included; not enough budget, staff, time, and interest; and too many changes, institutional
politics and policies, and organizational cultures. The findings also suggest that additional
familiarization with formal SP&MP structure and components could benefit program
implementation. The literature review and the findings from this study led the researcher to
create a list of practical tips for SP&MP implementation specifically for academic libraries.
Limitations of this study are attributable to the sample size and the institutions from
which the population derived. The study participants were ten academic library deans from the
same public university and college system in a southeastern state in the United States. The focus
of this study was limited to academic libraries; it did not include public, school, or special
libraries.
Future research is suggested to supplement the limitations of this study and to build upon
the interpretations of the findings. The study should be replicated using a broader sample of
leaders in key positions at various levels of the organization; then a comparison the findings
from both studies could be conducted to gain a wider perspective on the issues. Future research
could expand the knowledge of library practitioners about the purpose and benefits of SP&MPs
to the profession. Current library leadership institutes should consider the inclusion of SP&MP
training for higher-level library administrators to encourage program implementation.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

Observations of academic libraries woefully ill prepared to fill dean of library vacancies
at those libraries served as motivation for research on leadership and the implementation of
succession planning and management programs (SP&MPs) at academic libraries. A
comprehensive literature review on succession planning at academic libraries led to questions
about deans’ leadership styles and other factors that may contribute to library deans’ or directors’
decisions to implement SP&MPs at their libraries as a strategy for preparing future leaders.
Further observations and reflections gave way to additional questions about the status of the
future of leadership in academic libraries and the preparedness of academic librarians to assume
key leadership roles.
Imagine coming back to work after an extended vacation to find that the Dean of
University Libraries has taken another job and is gone. Meanwhile, it is widely known that the
Associate Dean of University Libraries is retiring in three months! How will the organization
react to this news? Who in the library has the necessary qualifications to step-up and successfully
lead the team during a top leadership transition period with short notice? What programs are in
place to prepare the staff to lead the library?
The Library and Information Science literature confirmed concerns about the
preparedness of current academic librarians to assume key leadership roles at academic libraries
(Bridgland, 1999; Chute, 2007; Cromer, 2009; Hall-Ellis & Grealy, 2013; Pennell, 2010; Singer,
2010; Webster & Young, 2009). “Given the importance of high performance expected in the
academic library environment, administrators need to identify and use strategies that enable them
to identify, develop, and retain talented individuals” (Hall-Ellis & Grealy, 2013, p. 587). Chute
1

(2007) stated “recruiting future library leaders and preparing them for leadership positions in the
field of librarianship by providing them with the proper education and training has become a
critical issue for the profession” (p. 97).
None of the three academic libraries where the researcher worked had smooth transitions
of leadership. The failed dean searches at those academic libraries led to the naming of interim
deans or directors, chaos and mistrust among staff, suspension of organizational planning, and
disruption of user services. If staff from within those academic libraries had been better prepared
to assume responsibilities vacated by their leaders, these problems might have been prevented.
The National Center for Education Statistics defines academic libraries as the library associated
with a degree-granting institution of higher education (NCES, 2016, ‘library statistics program’).
Library deans or directors are the chief administrators for the university libraries. The term
‘library deans’ is used in this study to refer to either library deans or library directors who are the
chief administrators of the academic libraries they lead.
This study introduces SP&MPs as a solution to addressing the lack of planning for and
development of current academic librarians to fill key leadership positions from within all levels
of leadership at their academic libraries, not just the top leadership positions, as is often
misconceived. According to Hall-Ellis and Grealy (2013), “effective succession planning and
management provides a workplace environment ready to respond to sudden changes, critical
backups, and individual development” (p. 587). This study employs Rothwell’s (2010) definition
of succession planning and management: “a deliberate and systematic effort by an organization
to ensure that the leadership continuity in key positions retain and develop intellectual and
knowledge capital for the future; and encourage individual advancement” (p. 6).

Who will be in charge of academic libraries in the future? Will it be business
professionals, information technologists, university professors, information scientists, or
academic librarians? The gap among currently credited librarians (librarians with a Masters of
Library Science degree from an American Library Association (ALA) accredited program) to
assume key leadership positions is exacerbated by constant changes in higher education that have
an impact on academic libraries and require library leaders to continuously rethink the status
quo. Qualified academic library leaders are needed to successfully traverse challenges and take
advantage of opportunities that may result from changes that impact libraries, their staff, and
their missions.

Statement of the Problem
The problem that this research addressed is the gap in the planning for and development
of current academic librarians at their institutions to fill future leadership roles within their
libraries. There is an expressed need in the Library and Information Science literature for
planned programs, such as SP&MPs, to identify and prepare potential leaders to assume key
leadership roles. According to Kaufman (2002), “in addition to the challenges of recruiting
people to fill jobs in our libraries, how will we meet the challenges of recruiting new people to
our profession, developing and retaining them in our institutions, and making management
positions attractive alternatives to their current jobs?” (p. 5). The problem is so persistent in
academic libraries that the Association of Research Libraries created the Research Library
Leadership Fellows (ARL RLLF) Program to develop leaders who can support, enable, and
enrich the transformations affecting research and research-intensive education (German, Owen,

3

Parchuck, & Sandore, 2009). The results of a survey conducted by German et al. (2009) to study
the effects of the program found the following:
The ARL RLLF succeeded in three distinct areas: succession planning through leadership
development for large research institutions is under way, a talented pool of leaders’ is
being cultivated, and these emergent leaders understand the nature of the library
director’s role and are eager to step up into leadership positions. (p. 806)
There are many leadership programs at the national level such at the Emergent Leaders
Program, offered by ALA for newer library workers and the Harvard Leadership Institute for
Academic Librarians, taught at Harvard for librarians with significant leadership and
administrative responsibilities. Some states also offer leadership training opportunities, such as
Florida’s Sunshine State Library Leadership Institute for new to mid-level managers.
Nonetheless, these programs are not always accessible to the majority of academic librarians. A
study conducted by Arabella Advisors (2015) found:
Leadership training opportunities exist around the world for librarians at all stages of
their careers who have the time, resources, and employer support to travel and invest in
intensive training. However, the need for leadership training globally is vastly outpacing
its provision. The small number of training slots, compared with the number of librarians
globally, indicates a gap in the training field, and this gap is compounded by the fact that
many of the training programs that are available require long-distance travel and
significant time commitment away from work and family. (p. 11)
A distinction between leadership and management is critical to this research because the
study addresses issues with the lack of planning for and development of academic library
leaders, not managers. The study of library managers was not within the scope of this study. This

4

study focused on academic library leadership, not management. Rost (1995) defined leadership
as “an influence relationship among leaders and collaborators who intend real changes that
reflect the purposes mutually held by both leaders and collaborators” (p. 133). Whereas, Rost
(1995) defined management as an authoritarian relationship “management involves coordinating
people and resources to produce and sell goods and/or services in an organization, and
management requires coordinated activities to produce and sell the goods and/or services that
reflect the organization's purpose” (p. 134). The next chapter details the distinctions between
leadership and management.
The question of who will lead academic libraries is relevant in light of the present and
projected workforce demographics. Virtually thirty percent of librarians were over 60 years old
in 2015, and this demographic fact led to the conclusion that changes in the profession will
persist because the majority of those librarians will be eligible to retire between 2015 and 2025
(Tordella & Godfrey, 2009). This demographic phenomenon is known as the graying of the
profession. It is accepted that the slowing down of the U.S. economy since 2008 influenced the
workforce to remain at their jobs for more years., so the graying of the profession was not quite
the problem that was once anticipated. The eventual exodus of librarians due to retirements will
result in numerous job vacancies within a relatively short timeframe. Effective SP&MPs help to
identify replacements needs as a means for targeting necessary training, education, and
development (Rothwell, 2010).
“The most current statistics for Library and Information Science graduates indicate that
approximately 6,700 are graduating per year… and if graduation rates do not change in the next
decade and if librarians retire when they are eligible to do so, age-based attrition will most likely
outpace the supply of new librarians” (Snyder, Dillow, & Hoffman as cited in Manjarrez, Ray, &

5

Bisher, 2010, p. 12). Over the past decade, enrollment has grown by 1,823 students, from 14,683
to 16,506, a rate of just over one percent per year (Mulvaney & O’Connor, 2014). The slow
growth in enrollments compounds the multigenerational characteristic of the librarian workforce.
Another change for library deans is leading and managing a multigenerational workforce that has
different work expectations, needs, and demands. Effective SP&MPs encourage the
advancement of diverse groups (Rothwell, 2010).
Librarian retention rates impact the academic library workforce. Nixon (2008) expressed
concern that many librarians were leaving the profession permanently because of their perceived
lack of career advancement opportunities. Burd’s study on work values of academic librarians
suggested librarians were less likely to abandon their jobs and more committed and satisfied in
the workplace if libraries supported participatory management, open communication,
opportunities for achievement, and relationships built on honesty and trust (2003, last para.). The
Library Science and Information field has been significantly impacted by national trends in
higher education such as tight budgets, emerging and disruptive technologies, and increased
accountability; these trends have mandated a change in academic libraries. “Our jobs are shifting
from doing what we have always done very well to always being on the outlook for new
opportunities to serve an unmet need that will advance teaching, learning, service, and research
approaches” (Mathews, 2012, p. 2). According to Chute (2007), controversial topics such as
electronic access, intellectual property, preservation, and censorship created demand for
“knowledgeable and experienced Library and Information Science leaders in many specialty
areas” (p. 86).
Rothwell (2010) stated that establishing new SP&MPs in organizations that do not
currently have one requires a major change effort and may require a quantum leap from the

6

current status; organizations tend to recognize that today’s workplace must be adaptable because
of constant changes. Organizations will have to provide on the job training experiences, job
rotations, stretch assignments, opportunities for participation in professional organizations,
formalized feedback mentoring, and coaching as possible solutions to creating more
opportunities for individual growth if vacancies are filled from within the organization (Pennell,
2010).
During the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) conference in 2006,
the Roundtable on Technology and Change in Academic Libraries wrote an essay identifying
changing roles of academic libraries for the future. One of those roles dealt with how
professionals must prepare and position themselves to handle change. Twenty-nine academicians
and practitioners in the Library and Information Science field wrote the essay, they stated that
library staff needed to have technical skills to manage emerging technologies, they needed to
strengthen their ties with teaching and research faculty, and they needed to help faculty to
understand how research inquiry has changed over the years (Association of College and
Research Libraries [ACRL], 2006). The group identified several roles for ACRL that may be
useful such as “providing national leadership in communicating the potential and performance of
libraries in adopting new paradigms and meeting changing demands of institutions, faculty, and
students” (ACRL, 2006, “roles for ACRL’). “By exerting visionary leadership and making the
right choices within and beyond their institutions, academic libraries can continue to exert a
positive force that allows them to remain integral to the transformational process” (ACRL, 2006,
last para.). Ten years later, we are still grappling with these roles and still talking about planning
for change.

7

Simply stated, attention should be given to questioning where future academic library
leaders will come from and whether talented librarians are being developed with the
qualifications needed to seamlessly transition into challenging leadership roles in academic
libraries fraught with change. There appears to be a pressing need for qualified librarians to lead
a diverse, multigenerational workforce, to increase retention rates, to recruit qualified staff, to
increase job satisfaction, and to train and develop workers at all levels. Simultaneously, there is a
need to manage change and complete multitudinous tasks and challenges associated with tight
budgets, disruptive technologies, and increased accountability based on library workforce
projections. As indicated earlier, succession planning is a management strategy that can be of
great benefit to workers at all levels within the academic library. Lack of SP&MPs may result in
additional turbulence, chaos, and uncertainty in organizations when leadership changes and
increased employee turnover occurs.

Research Purpose and Questions
This study sought to address four questions; the first was to earn if certain leadership
styles of academic library deans affect their decisions to implement SP&MPs at their academic
libraries. Second, to identify the driving forces that might influence a library deans’ decision to
implement SP&MPs as a planned change at their academic library. The third was to identify the
restraining forces that might impede a library dean’s decision to implement SP&MPs as a
planned change. And fourth, to determine the usefulness of Lewin’s planned change theory in
this study. Explanatory research is about identifying causes and effects of social phenomena and
how one phenomenon will vary as a result of a change in another phenomenon (Schutt, 2009). A

8

mixed-method sequential explanatory design consisting of online surveys followed by in-depth
semi-structured interviews were employed to answer the questions under study.
The four questions that guided the research process to address the lack of planning for
and development of current academic librarians to fill future leadership roles at their academic
libraries by implementing SP&MPS were:
RQ 1. How do the leadership styles of academic library deans affect their decisions to
implement SP&MPs as a planned change?
RQ 2. What are the driving forces that affect library deans’ decisions to implement
SP&MPs at academic libraries?
RQ 3. What are the restraining forces that affect library deans’ decisions to implement
SP&MPs at academic libraries?
RQ 4. How useful was Lewin’s change theory in predicting the need to identify driving
and restraining forces as necessary for better understanding a planned change?
This research was limited to studying three factors that might affect the deans’ decisions
to implement SP&MPs at their academic libraries although there may be many other factors that
influence the implementation of SP&MPs in academic libraries. These factors were the deans’
leadership styles, driving forces for the implementation of SP&MPs, and restraining forces
against the implementation of SP&MPs. While there are numerous different leadership styles,
this study focused on the three leadership styles identified by Bass (1990) as the full range of
leadership. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5x) is the leadership self-rating
standardized scale developed by Bass and Avolio used in this study. The three leadership styles
quantified in this study were transformational leadership, transactional leadership, and
passive/avoidant behavior. Driving forces are factors that the library deans think support or

9

“drive” the implementation of SP&MPs at their libraries. Restraining forces are factors that the
library deans think “restrain” the implementation of SP&MPs are their academic libraries. The
driving and restraining forces can be either internal or external to the academic libraries. The
implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries represents a planned change.

Leadership Styles
Transactional leadership is when one person contacts another to exchange something of
value, i.e., jobs for votes or subsidies for campaign contributions (Burns, 1978). The components
of transactional leadership are contingent reward and management-by-exception. According to
Burns (1978), transforming [transformational] leadership “shapes and alters and elevates the
motives and values and goals of followers through the vital teaching role of leadership” (p. 425).
The four components of transformational leaders according to Bass and Riggio (2006) are
idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized
consideration. Bass and Riggio (2006), defined passive/avoidant behavior as “the avoidance or
absence of leadership (p. 8). Laissez-faire and management by exception are two distinctions of
this ineffective leadership style, and they are non-transactional (Bass & Riggio, 2006).

Driving and Restraining Forces
Implementing SP&MPs requires the commitment from the library dean because these
programs oblige financial, personnel, and time resources. Therefore, program implementation
must be part of a planned process. Since SP&MPs affect all of the librarians in an organization,
program implementation takes effect at the group level. Kurt Lewin believed in involving
members of the organization in the change process. “Attending to creating the motivation to

10

change by helping people see the need for change and taking ownership of it is as important as
the changing process itself and the efforts to reinforce change and ensure that it survives”
(Cartwright, 1978, as cited by Coghlan & Brannick, 2003, p. 34).
The driving and restraining forces that affect deans’ decision to implement SP&MPs as a
planned change helped the researcher to understand why deans do or do not engage their
academic libraries in SP&MPs and what were the enablers and barriers. “Lewin’s theory can
provide the guidance needed to analyze the process of change and assist in identifying forces that
either propel the change or create barriers that stagnate the change” (Bozak, 2003, p. 80).
Lewin’s (1947) concept of a social field described a social group in its natural setting,
and his concept of phase space described certain aspects or conditions of social problems. Lewin
argued that certain social forces increase or drive change (ambition, goals, needs, and fears) and
these driving forces can act either both towards or away from something; while restraining
forces oppose driving forces. Lewin called these forcefields. Librarians working at academic
libraries represent the social field concept that is the group in its natural setting, and the
implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries represents the phase space concept that is the
social problem or intended change. Driving forces could include the dean’s ambition for
increasing the pool of promotable employees, or the dean’s goal to encourage the advancement
of diverse librarian groups. Restraining forces could include the dean’s opposition to the
program’s potential due to too much time and staff commitment that may divert staff attention
from other library initiatives or work. The driving forces and restraining forces could also
include external forces to the library; for example, perspectives about leadership development
from within the organization to fill vacancy positions may or may not align with the preferred
practices or the culture of the university, its provost or its president. Lewin’s (1947) planned

11

change theory argued that the status quo of groups was in a quasi-stationary equilibrium and that
forces in any direction could shift that balance. Lewin stated “to understand how to implement
change one needs first to ask: (1) why does the process under the current circumstances proceed
on this particular level? And (2), what are the conditions for changing the present
circumstances?” (1947, p. 15). Academic libraries that have not yet implemented a SP&MP
exists in a quasi-stationary equilibrium. Implementing a SP&MP at an academic library
represents a force that will disrupt the current quasi-stationary equilibrium and before
committing their libraries to a change library deans need to ask themselves: (a) why does the
planning for and development of current librarians to fill future leadership function on this
current level? And (b), what are the conditions (driving and restraining forces) for changing the
present circumstances? This study intends to help library deans identify and understand the
answers to those questions.

Significance of the Research
Contributes to the Understanding of Academic Library Deans’ Leadership Styles and
Their Decisions Towards Implementing SP&MPS
Leadership support is the first step in the process of implementing SP&MPs in academic
libraries. Other considerations, such as the organization’s culture, must also be taken into
account when implementing new programs. According to Valentine (2011), succession planning
may be a key element in dealing with the cultural problems associated with leadership succession
and organizational culture has a better chance of surviving when an organization plans carefully
for leadership succession. When employing a behaviorist perspective, culture is evident in the
way people in the organization behave as they go about their work (Lineberry & Carleton, 1999).

12

When cultural continuity is desired, respecting the past is important because it provides the
ideological and emotional grounding for the current culture (Trice & Beyer, 1993). So,
establishing a supportive organizational culture through management is a specific practice that
must be executed to build the leadership pipeline effectively (Groves, 2007). According to Gallo
(2011), the past CEO of Apple, Steve Jobs “built a culture within the company that puts the user
first” (p. 4). Fancher (2007) suggested that researchers should review the organization’s culture,
its members, and stakeholders to understand better the decision-making processes surrounding
succession planning and the impact of succession planning programs.
The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the organizational culture and
provide alternatives for what can be done today to increasingly prepare information professionals
for key leadership roles in the future. This research gives some insight into how leaders may
approach change and how they may prepare their libraries for that change while articulating how
they view the forces that drive and restrain change in their organizations.

Contributes to the Body of Knowledge of SP&MPs
In addition to contributing to the Library and Information Science literature on various
topics of interest such as leadership, this study has practical applications for professors of
Library and Information Studies and information professionals. Professors could use the study
results to inform their teaching of courses on management and leadership in information
organizations. Librarians could use the study results to inform their practice when implementing
SP&MPs. The study results could be used to help create awareness among academic librarians
globally about the benefits of SP&MPs and to engage library leaders in the development and
implementation of these and staff development training programs at their libraries.

13

Perhaps another contribution is that this study introduces Rothwell’s Seven-Pointed Star
Model for Systematic Succession Planning and Management (2011) to researchers and librarians
alike, the model details how to implement a program from start to finish and can be easily
applied to academic libraries (see Figure 1, page 23).

May Help to Make Academic Libraries More Effective and Productive
Little has been written about SP&MPs from an information science perspective and even
less about the impact that SP&MPs may have on academic libraries While much has been
written about SP&MPS from a business perspective. This study may contribute to making
academic libraries and other organizations more effective and productive in preparing their staff
to assume key leadership roles in the future.
SP&MPs may make academic libraries more effective and productive by preparing their
staff to assume leadership roles when vacancies become available. Some ways that SP&MPs
may make libraries more efficient include: (a) providing stability by ensuring the continuation of
organizational culture by promoting librarians from within the organization; (b) reducing costs
and saving time by mitigating the impact of decreased budgets in higher education by promoting
librarians from within the organization and therefore reducing the time and money spent
conducting searches outside the organization; (c) increasing minorities in top leadership roles by
advancing high-potential staff who come from diverse backgrounds; and by (d), decreasing staff
turnover by providing opportunities for advancement within the organization to help retain
academic librarians at their current jobs (adapted from Rothwell, 2010, p. 41). According to
Rothwell (2010), when experienced staff leaves organizations they not only take with them the
experiences and wisdom they developed, they also take with them the institutional memory.

14

May Help to Explain How Staff Reacts to Planned Change
The theoretical discussion about the implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries is
guided by Lewin's’ planned change theory and applied here to the practice of librarianship.
Lewin’s work in field theory, group dynamics, and action research influenced his thinking about
the development of the planned change theory. “Lewin saw them as a unified whole with each
element supporting and reinforcing the others and all of them necessary to understand and bring
about planned change, whether it be at the level of the individual, group, organization, or even
society” (Burnes, 2004, p. 981).
This study may help academic library leaders understand how their staff will react to a
planned change as a group. The implementation of SP&PMs is the planned change in this study.
Additionally, this study may help leaders recognize that there are forces within their
organizations that are driven by the staff as a group for and against the planned change. Leaders
must be cognizant of what these forces are and what motivates those forces so that they can
successfully lead their organizations through a planned change process.

Assumptions
This research assumed that the deans of academic libraries are somewhat familiar with
the concept of succession planning. The deans were given a definition of SP&MPs during the indepth interviews as part of this research. There was also an assumption that the decisions to
implement SP&MPs at academic libraries were influenced by forces outside the library, such as
the politics and procedures employed by presidents, provosts, and others to whom the deans of
the academic libraries report. Furthermore, this research assumed that the deans of academic
libraries are interested in learning about and exploring options to help develop their high

15

potential employees to assume key leadership roles within their organizations in a timely and
efficient manner. According to Rea and Parker (2005), “…survey research involves soliciting
self-reported information that is not available elsewhere” (p. 4), so this original research also
assumes that the participants answered the questions in the online survey forms and during the
in-depth interview truthfully.

Overview of the Theoretical Framework
Information professionals have accepted change as part of their natural discourse. “In
fact, this theme of change has become a part of our landscape. Change is the new normal.
Change is the only constant” (Mathews, 2012, p. 2). There is increasing pressure from academic
library parent institutions for demonstrations of increased accountability and contribution to
student success. In Florida for example, the State University System Board of Governors,
financially rewards universities that do well in ten metrics; and one of those is student success.
Student success is a metric with which most academic librarians are familiar. Academic libraries
need to create awareness about their contributions to the higher education community by
demonstrating their value. Library deans need to start training leaders today to better serve their
libraries and their constituents. “In discussing the means of bringing about a desired state of
affairs one should not think in terms of the goal to be reached, but rather in terms of a change
from the present level to the desired one” (Lewin, 1947, p. 32). According to Burnes (2004),
Lewin was a humanitarian who believed that only by resolving social conflict, whether it
be religious, racial, marital or industrial, could the human condition be improved. Lewin
believed that the key to resolving social conflict was to facilitate learning and so enable
individuals to understand and restructure their perceptions of the world… (p. 981)

16

The concepts in Kurt Lewin’s planned change theory can help academic library deans,
librarians, researchers, and others to understand group reactions towards change during SP&MP
implementation and it can also contribute to explicate and predict the behaviors of groups
towards planned change. “Lewin’s theory can provide the guidance needed to analyze the
process of change and assist in identifying forces that either propel the change or create barriers
that stagnate the change” (Bozak, 2003, p. 80). Armstrong (2006) stated,
Lewin also suggested a methodology for analyzing change which he called ‘field force
analysis.' This involves analyzing the restraining or driving forces that will affect the
transition to the future state; these restraining forces will include the reactions of those
who see change as unnecessary or as constituting a threat; assessing which of the driving
or restraining forces are critical; and taking steps both to increase the critical driving
forces and to decrease the critical restraining forces. (p. 347).

Overview of the Conceptual Framework
Academic library leaders and staff familiar with SP&MPs may recognize the importance
of these programs as an option to address the lack of planning for and development of future
library leaders to fill key leadership roles. Rothwell (2010) stated that a SP&MP is “a deliberate
and systematic effort by an organization to ensure leadership continuity in key positions, retain
and develop intellectual and knowledge capital for the future, and encourage individual
advancement” (p. 6).
Library leadership styles vary from leader to leader. This study included a questionnaire
to identify the leadership styles of a select group of academic library deans and focused on three
different leadership styles: transformational, transactional and passive/avoidant behavior. This
17

study sought to explain how the leadership styles of the library deans affect their decisions to
implement SP&MPs at their libraries. The research is relevant to academic libraries and its
leaders because the results can help deans better understand the forces within their organizations
that either support or oppose the implementation of a planned change. Understanding those
forces will assist the dean in making the right decision, taking into account the correct measures,
and working with the right people to successfully implement SP&MPs as a planned change.
The population selected for this research is composed of chief administrators of academic
libraries because they are responsible for the implementation of SP&MPs as a planned change in
their libraries. The driving forces for and the restraining forces against a planned change need to
be understood by those implementing a change to increase its successful application (Lewin,
1947). This study also sought to understand and explain what the academic library deans viewed
as the driving forces for and the restraining forces against the implementing of SM&MPs are at
their libraries.
Lewin’s planned change theory provides the theoretical framework for the study. The
concepts in the planned change theory are applied to the implementation of SP&MPs at
academic libraries as a planned change (see figure 3). Trice and Beyer (1993) stated that to
maintain the organizational culture when implementing SP&MPs certain behaviors should be
present and that these behaviors should be measurable. Driving and restraining forces can change
the current status quo or “quasi-stationary equilibrium” as Lewin (1947) referred to the current
culture of the organization. Library deans can better implement a planned change if they can
identify and understand the internal and external forces that impact that change. Ritchie (2004)
calls the motivation needed to make a change “a controlled crisis” (p. 245).

18

Overview of the Method
A mixed-method sequential explanatory design consisting of online surveys followed by
in-depth interviews was employed to answer the research questions. The study consisted of
quantitative analyses using data resulting from the online standardized scale and qualitative
analyses using the data from the in-depth interviews. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire
(MLQ 5x self-rating form) developed by Bass (1990) was administered online to the deans of the
academic libraries in a state in the southeastern portion of the United States. The MLQ 5x selfrating form measures how leaders think about or perceive their leadership behavior.
Additionally, semi-structured in-depth interviews with the same deans of those universities and
colleges were conducted. The interviews were intended for the researcher to compile a more
comprehensive understanding of the deans’ attitudes towards SP&MPs and how their individual
leadership styles affected their decisions to implement a SP&MP at their libraries. The study also
sought to understand the factors that affect library deans’ implementation of SP&MPs at
academic libraries; these include both driving and restraining forces.

Summary
The chapter began by stating observations about changes in academic libraries that affect
the lack of planning for and development of academic librarians to fill key leadership roles in
their organizations in the future. These observations served as a motivation to study the
implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries. More specifically, this research sought to find
if the leadership styles of the deans of academic libraries affected their decisions to implement
the program at the academic libraries they lead. The study also sought to identify and explain the
internal and external driving and restraining forces that may also influence deans’ decisions to

19

implement SP&MPs. The key concepts in the study, such as leadership styles, driving forces,
and restraining forces were introduced and defined.
The reasons for conducting this study were explained in detail along with the
implications that this research may have on library educators and practitioners alike. Since the
implementation of a SP&MP represents a planned change for an organization, Kurt Lewin’s
planned change theory was discussed as it frames the theoretical discourse. The planned change
theory may help to explicate how staff may react to a planned change and the driving and
restraining forces that may impact a planned change in an academic library setting. The four
research questions that frame this study were introduced. Moreover, this chapter also provided a
brief overview of the research design that consisted of mixed-method sequential explanatory
design that included an online standardized scale to gather quantitative data and in-depth
interviews to gather qualitative data. The data were collected and analyzed to answer the four
research questions. The participants in this study were the deans of academic libraries in a
southeastern state of the United States. The data resulting from the questionnaires and the indepth interviews were analyzed, and the results were included in the results and conclusions
chapters of this study.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW

Succession Planning and Management Programs
Henry Fayol (1841-1925) was among the first to write about succession planning and
management. Scholars and business people alike still commonly refer to Fayol’s classic
fourteen-points of management. According to Rothwell (2005), Fayol indicated that management
has the responsibility for “ensuring the stability of tenure of personnel” (p. 10) and that if
managers did not take this responsibility seriously, the result could be bad leaders.
Succession planning is a strategy that can be used by academic libraries to mitigate the
impact that leadership vacancies create and to ensure the tenure of librarians in key positions.
Succession planning is “a deliberate and systematic effort by an organization to ensure that the
leadership continuity in key positions retain and develop intellectual and knowledge capital for
the future; and encourage individual advancement” (Rothwell, 2010, p. 6). Many researchers
refer to Rothwell’s definition verbatim (Bridgland, 1999; Krauss, 2007; Nixon, 2008; Richards,
2009; Singer, 2010). Deegan (1986) defined succession planning as “taking the steps necessary
to be able to have an orderly and suitable succession of persons in key positions (p. 5). The
American Society for Training and Development (2010) defined succession planning as “the
process organizations use to identify the key positions, candidates, and employees needed to
meet both the short- and long-term challenges inherent in conducting operations” (p. 4).
SP&MPs are not the same as replacement planning, talent management, workforce
planning, or human capital management. While SP&MPs incorporate some of the same goals
and activities of each of these programs, there are distinct differences worth highlighting to
ensure clarity in the definition of SP&MPs used in this study. Replacement planning may be
21

limited to filling positions that are vacated or that will be vacated in the future at any level of the
organization. SP&PMs proactively attempt to cultivate the talent from within the organization,
with planned developmental activities to fill key leadership vacancies (Rothwell, 2010). The
purpose of talent management is to address competency gaps by attracting, developing, retaining,
and using employees’ skills to meet organizations’ needs (Office of Personnel Management
[OPM], 2014). SP&MPs also strive to develop and retain employees, but the emphasis is on key
leadership positions. Workforce management identifies and addresses workforce gaps between
current and future needs (OPM, 2014); SP&MPs also identify workforce gaps, but they focus
more on the main leadership positions. Human capital management deals with the strategic
alignment, leadership, and knowledge management, results-oriented performance, and
accountability (OPM, 2014), whereas SP&MPs are more concerned with the values of
institutional memory, creativity, and social relationships (Rothwell, 2010, p. 14).
Succession planning versus succession management. Hawthorne (2011) described
succession management as “managing the implementation of the [succession] plan and the
[succession planning] internal processes” (p. 8). While succession planning and succession
management are two separate entities, Rothwell (2010) recommended that they not stand-alone;
pairing succession planning with succession management allows for a more dynamic, real-time,
talent building setting (p. 8). Succession planning, as previously defined is a process for
identifying and developing internal employees with the potential to fill key leadership positions.
Program management is the process of applying knowledge, skills and techniques to several
related activities to accomplish a specific goal. Consequently, the researcher combined both
concepts, succession planning (SP) and management programs (MPs) to create SP&MPs.

22

Rothwell’s Seven-Pointed Star Model for Systematic Succession Planning and Management
The Seven-Pointed Star Model for Systematic Succession Planning and Management
developed by Rothwell (2010) can serve as a model for implementing a SP&MP as a planned
change in an academic library (see Figure 1). Rothwell’s model lists the key steps necessary for
program implementation (p. 83).

23

The Seven-Pointed Star Model is relevant to this research because it operationalizes the
concepts used in the implementation of SP&MPs. The model provides the theoretical constructs
of SP&MP implementation utilized in the research questions and the theoretical constructs found
in the literature about succession planning. The steps listed below explain the Seven-Pointed Star
model, yet the descriptions were modified from Rothwell’s (2010) descriptions to demonstrate
better how each step may be applied in an academic library setting:
1. Making the commitment. The library dean commits the organization to a continuous
and systematic program by listing program requirements. The library dean or representative links
the program to strategic plans and mission statements, benchmarks practices at other libraries,
identifies target groups, establishes priorities, creates action plans, conducts meetings, and trains
those involved. Each action is documented as it occurs and is then shared within the library. The
most important step in the process for library deans is to commit to the program personally and
to support it.
2. Assessing present work and people requirements. The library dean or representative
works with supervisors or human resources staff to identify and document key leadership
positions at the library and to determine and document work or competency requirements for
those positions. Competencies for librarian positions are available on professional association
websites.
3. Appraising individual performance. The library dean or representative meets with
supervisors or human resources staff to determine how employees perform their jobs (can be
completed using annual evaluations). A talent inventory is documented to determine which
talents are already available and which talents need to be further developed.

24

4. Assessing future work/people requirements. The library dean or representative assesses
and documents future work requirements and competencies to be prepared to cope with
organizational strategic objectives and planned change.
5. Assessing future individual potential. The library dean or representative assess and
documents future individual potential to determine how well they are prepared for
advancement.
6. Closing the developmental gap. The library dean or representative establishes
continuing leadership development opportunities to cultivate future leaders internally. These
programs can include in-house and on-the-job training. They can also include webinars,
conferences, lectures, and other developmental activities.
7. Evaluating the SP&MP. The program must be assessed at least once a year by the
deans or representative to determine if the results of the programs met the written expectations or
what program adjustments are required.
Rothwell’s Seven-Pointed Star Model for Systematic Succession Planning and
Management was chosen as an example for this study because it is comprehensive and is often
cited in the Library and Information Science literature (Bridgland, 1999; Nixon, 2008; Pennell,
2010; Richards, 2009; & Singer & Griffith, 2010). SP&MPs are not one-size-fits-all programs;
organizations that want to implement these programs need to find the model that is right for their
organizational needs. Systematic programs can also be customized to meet the needs of
individual libraries. The programs are ongoing because staff change due to retirement, moves,
and deaths. These programs should be common knowledge to library staff, and staff should have
the option to participate. It is up to the library dean to decide to ‘tell or not to tell’ individual
members if they are targeted for professional advancement.

25

Academic Library Deans’ Responsibilities Towards Stakeholders
Academic library deans must be responsive to numerous stakeholders at once. The
stakeholders can include but are not be limited to boards, provosts, councils, faculty, staff,
students, and community members. Each one of those groups has their agenda and interests in
academic library operations, services, resources, facilities, and programming. Library leaders
need to be responsive to the demands and desires of the persons who compose those groups, and
they need to be flexible and savvy to deal with conflicting interests from different groups while
attempting to provide individualized attention to all stakeholders.
Steven Bell (2015) put together a list of the top ten issues that academic librarians may
want to focus on in 2015. The decisions about the importance that academic libraries place on
any of these ten issues rests with the deans of those libraries. Academic library deans will have to
take into account the political climates at their institutions, legislative mandates, budgets,
university strategic directions, staffing levels and skills, and ongoing projects, among other
possible considerations before deciding what issues to address and in what priority. Deans must
have the leadership skills necessary to successfully deal with a multitude of internal (library)
forces and external (university and community) forces that drive change and restraining forces
against change. The ten issues that Bell (2015) listed are: alternate higher education models,
shifting staff – particularly the pending retirement of deans and directors, the application of the
ACRL Information Literacy Framework, transition to open educational resources, digital (online)
education, accessibility (from websites to e-resources for disabled library users), library space as
a place for intentional learning and community engagement, more e-books than print books,
student data to monitor academic performance, and leadership. The last issue on Bell’s list,

26

which was not in any particular order, was leadership. This is what Bell (2015) wrote about
leadership:
With more intense pressure on academic librarians to demonstrate their value on and
beyond the campus, we will need those who lead at every level in their library to bring
the focus and energy required to build the library’s secure future as an essential
contributor to the success of our students and faculty and the institution itself. (next to
the last para.)
The four questions guiding the research process to address the lack of planning for and
development of current academic librarians to fill future leadership roles at their academic
libraries through the provision of SP&MPS are:
RQ 1. How do the leadership styles of academic library deans affect their decisions to
implement

SP&MPs as a planned change?

RQ 2. What are the driving forces that affect library deans’ decisions to implement
SP&MPs at academic libraries?
RQ 3. What are the restraining forces that affect library deans’ decisions to implement
SP&MPs at academic libraries?
RQ 4. How useful was Lewin’s change theory in predicting the need to identify driving
and restraining forces as necessary for better understanding a planned change?

Trends That Drive SP&MPs
Many trends drive the future of the workforce in the U.S. such as globalization, which
allows for seamless professional relationships without boundaries; and emerging technologies,
which allow for the instantaneous sharing of data, information, and knowledge. These trends

27

have an impact on the workforce and by extension on programs that deal with workforce
management issues like succession planning. Rothwell (2010) identified ten trends that influence
SP&MPs:
●

The need to quickly identify and develop high-potential talent.

●

It is a buyer’s market for skills – top talent can be acquired at bargain-basement
prices.

●

Reduced loyalty among employees and workers – employers are not making longterm commitment to their employees as a result of downsizing.

●

The importance of intellectual management and capital – the collective economic
value of the workforce is knowledge management.

●

The importance of values, ethics, and competencies – people want leaders who
can get results while modeling appropriate ethics.

●

More sophisticated software to support succession planning is available.

●

The growing activism of the board of directors requires board accountability in
business operations. i.e., Sarbanes Oxley Act 2002.

●

Growing awareness of similarities and differences in succession issues globally.

●

Growing awareness of similarities and differences of succession programs in
different venues: government, nonprofit, education, small businesses, and family
businesses.

●

Managing CEO succession – corporate boards are increasingly more demanding
and less forgiving of CEOs.

The ACRL Research and Planning and Review Committee compiled a list of the 2012 top
trends in academic libraries. Staffing was one of the trends identified, “academic libraries must

28

develop the staff needed to meet new challenges through creative approaches to hiring new
personnel and deploying/retaining existing staff” (ACRL, 2012).

Factors Contributing to Limited Use of SP&MPS
In 2009, Rothwell and his colleagues surveyed the members of the Human Resources
Planning Society to learn why organizations would or would not support systematic SP&MPs.
The survey results suggested the following seven factors that contribute to the limited use of
SP&MPs in organizations (Rothwell, 2010, p. 18).
●

Lack of support from top leaders in the organization.

●

Organizational politics – managers promote friends or allies over employees
with the best track records or the most potential.

●

Quick fix attitudes - effectiveness can be sacrificed to efficiency if
managers are promoted to key leadership positions without proper cultivation.

●

Low visibility – organizational leaders do not see the benefits of the program
because it occurs at lower levels and it is not brought to the attention of
higher level administrators.

●

The rapid pace of organizational change - SP&MPs are not effective just to
fill vacancies, detailed approaches to work requirements, competencies, job
rotations, action learning, and team-based management are needed.

●

Too much paperwork - documentation is required at each step of the process.

●

Too many meetings - SP&MP coordinators need to meet regularly for program
kick-off, organizational or functional area discussions, work requirements,
appraisal meetings, career path and planning, training and education meetings.

29

The most cited factor contributing to the limited use of SP&MPs was a lack of support
from top leaders. SP&MPs must have leadership support to be successfully implemented.

Implementation of SP&MPs
Viable succession plans contribute to positive work environments; serve as alternative
options for professional enrichment and career progression programs, and promote employee
development (Rothwell, 2010). The objective of SP&MPs is to develop strong leadership teams
so that there are layers of leaders from whom to select if and when the need arises (Bridgland,
1999). Notwithstanding the contributions of SP&MPs to positive work environments,
professional enrichment and career progression, individual development and the cultivation of
strong leadership teams; SP&MPs require a strong commitment from the academic library to be
effective and successful. The identification and preparation of key leadership positions at
academic libraries could include staff at all levels, not just the top leadership positions. Along
with making the commitment to implement a SP&MP, library deans should integrate SP&MPs in
their academic library’s planning processes and strategic plans to further state the value of the
program.
The succession planning process begins when the library dean makes the commitment to
conduct the program. The starting point can vary based on where the program is most needed.
For example, in one library that may be in a department that is experiencing high turnovers, in
another library it may be in a department with many new hires. Rothwell (2010) suggested the
library dean or a representative complete the following series of planning activities before
embarking on program implementation (p. 82): begin by crafting a procedure statement to
govern the SP&PM that includes a statement of values. Create job competency models for the

30

targeted librarian positions, and assess librarians’ potential for leadership. Then generate
development plans for those librarians. Moreover, create a list of skills inventories for the talent
pools targeted. Library deans may choose to name a representative from their libraries to manage
the SP&MPs on their behalf. SP&MPs require continual management to be successful, and it is
best to have a designated representative completing the day-to-day planning, conducting
activities, and writing reports. Much attention should be paid to who will lead academic librarian
in the future since the library deans’ decisions to implement these programs at their libraries are
critical to the program’s success.

Potential Benefits of SP&MPs
There are numerous benefits to establishing SP&MPs at academic libraries to help staff
prepare to fill future key leadership roles. Bridgland (1999) lists the benefits of succession
planning as:
Assured continuity of prepared leaders for key positions, a disciplined process for
reviewing leadership talent, increased opportunities for high-potential workers, increased
talent pool of promotable employees, assisting employees to realize their career
plans within the organization, and developing strong leadership teams for strategic tasks.
(p. 23)
Likewise, Rothwell (2010) lists the biggest benefits to SP&MPs as:
Less time and expense to source talent to fill vacancies because the talent has already
been identified and prepared; people development efforts have been aligned with the
organization’s strategic objectives… and the organization is prepared to deal with
sudden catastrophic losses of key people. (p. 375)

Participation of Academic Libraries in SP&MPs
Rothwell’s (2016) book is written from a business management perspective, and the
primary audiences are corporations and businesses. Therefore, it does not directly address
institutions of higher learning whose mission and stakeholders are very different from for-profit
corporations. The characteristics of effective SP&MPs, the foundations for formulating the
program, and the actions plans covered by Rothwell are transferable to academic libraries.
Academic libraries are integral to the success of students and faculty by supporting
student and faculty studies, teaching and research needs. The Colorado Academic Library Impact
Study, How Academic Libraries Help Faculty Teach and Students Learn, found that two-thirds
(67%) of those surveyed indicated that the library staff had helped them to find books, journal
articles, and internet resources (Dickenson, 2006, p. 72). According to Dickenson (2006), 87%
of faculty surveyed used electronic databases, article indexes, and print materials from their
college libraries and this was indicative that libraries were integral to faculty scholarly pursuits.
This study showed the impact that academic libraries can have on both faculty teaching and
student learning. The building, technologies, collections, and staff that support the research,
teaching, and learning activities of students and faculty are under the direction of library deans.
Consequently, academic libraries to need leaders who understand the complex environments,
issues, and trends surrounding them and the academic libraries they lead.
Predicted shortages of librarians, as previously described, were so perilous in the mid –
2000s that the Association of Research Libraries (Webster & Young, 2009) reached out to their
library leaders in search of solutions for preparing the next generation of leaders. Webster and
Young (2009) referred to the preparation of senior leadership as random, episodic,
circumstantial, and incomplete. Similarly, the Special Library Association (SLA) placed

32

emphasis on leadership skills development and practices and offered to train its members in this
area. The SLA considered it necessary both for its advancement and that of the library profession
(Cromer, 2009).
A study funded in 2005 under the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian program called the
Workforce Issues in Library and Information Science (WILIS) consisted of a retrospective
1964 and 2005 from one of the six Library and Information Science programs in North Carolina
(Marshall et al., as cited by Moran, Marshall, & Rathbun-Grubb, 2010, p. 215). The survey listed
reasons why librarians left the field, some of those reasons included downsizing, layoffs, seeking
further education, or family reasons. By far the most common reason given was to seek better
opportunities for career development is for more challenging work (Moran et al., 2010, p. 217).

Value of SP&MPs at Academic Libraries
Schachter (2008) alluded to the connection between the problem of demographic changes
and leadership development in librarianship when discussing the practice of succession planning
and management strategies in libraries. Schachter stated that managers should find the best new
employees and give them opportunities to grow and reasons to stay with the organizations (2008,
p. 40). Schachter further stated that employees should want to work for organizations that
recognize their abilities and that invests in them as much as the employee invests time and
energy in the company (2008, p. 41). Organizations, including libraries, which establish policies
for quality hiring and retention, create the basis for effective succession planning.
Conditions for encouraging SP&MPs in academic libraries. Rothwell (2010)
conducted a survey asking participants to list their reasons for encouraging the implementation
SP&MP (p. 18). The top ten reasons the participants gave were:

33



Contribute to the implementation of the organization’s strategic plan,
SP&MPs should be linked to, and supportive of the organizational planning
processes.

●

Identify staffing needs as a way of targeting required training, employee
education, and professional development.

●

Increase the talent pool of promotable employees - not just one employee, but
groups of employees across functional areas.

●

Provide increased opportunities for high-potential employees.

●

Tap into the potential intellectual capital in the organization.

●

Help individuals realize their career plans within the profession, may contribute to
increased retention.

●

Encourage the advancement of diverse groups, i.e., minorities.

●

Improve employee morale.

●

Improve leaders’ abilities to respond to changing environment demands.

●

Cope with the effects of downsizing.

Different organizations may face different issues at different times. Therefore, some of
these conditions may take precedence over others based on needs at a given time.
Conditions for discouraging SP&MPs in academic libraries. There are conditions
under which these programs should not be implemented at academic libraries or other
organizations. According to Rothwell (2010), leaders need to ask themselves a series of
questions before committing the organization, employees, and financial resources to SP&MP
implementation. The primary questions leaders should ask themselves include: (a)what is the
organization's readiness to run a program systemically? (b) How much time are they and their

34

staff willing to devote to establishing the program? (c) What is the stability of the current
organizational structure? (d) How many resources can be dedicated to developing staff? And (5),
what are their preferences for filling vacancies from the inside rather than from the outside the
organization? Although these individual issues may be surmountable, library leaders should
consider all of them simultaneously in their decision-making process. If libraries are unable to
participate in all of the implementation planning activities or steps, they may still benefit from
the program by completing selective steps that address specific problems that they are facing,
even though this may not be the ideal approach to SP&MP.

Leadership Versus Management
As stated earlier, this study makes a distinction between leadership and management.
Rost’s definition of leadership “an influence relationship among leaders and collaborators who
intend real changes that reflect the purposes mutually held by both leaders and collaborators”
(1995, p. 133), is used in this research to distinguish leadership from management. Rost’s
(1995) definition of leadership included four essential elements. The first was the relationship
between leaders and collaborators is based on influence. Rost (1995) stated that the relationship
is multidirectional, not just from the top down; and that it is not coercive or dictatorial. The
leader and collaborator use persuasion to impact each other. The second element was that leaders
and collaborators are the actors in this relationship. Rost (1995) explained that both cannot be
leaders and that each person has a role to play for the relationship to work; while that
relationship may take many forms, followers are active participants in the relationship. The third
essential element in Rost’s (1995) definition of leadership was that collaborators intend real
changes. Rost (1995) specified that intention does not necessarily have to lead to change, it is

35

sufficient that there is a purposeful intention to desire certain change. Rost (1995) defined real
changes as substantive and transforming. The fourth and final essential element in Rost’s (1995)
definition of leadership was that the changes that the leaders and collaborators intend reflect their
mutual purposes. The changes should reflect only what the leader and collaborator want. Rost
(1995) stated that the common enterprise between leaders and collaborators is the development
of mutual purpose. Rost (1995) further clarified his definition of leadership by declaring:
The intended changes reflect the purpose or vision that leaders and collaborators have for
an organization. That purpose is usually not static but is constantly changing as leaders
and collaborators come and go, as the influence process works its effects on both leaders
and collaborators, and as circumstances, environment, and wants and needs impact on the
relationship and the organization. (p. 134)
Rost listed the following four differences between leadership and management (1995, p.
134):
1. Leadership is an influence relationship; management is an authority relationship,
2. Leadership is done by leaders and collaborators; management is done by managers and
subordinates.
3. Leadership involves leaders and collaborators intending real changes in an
organization; management involves coordinating people and resources to produce and sell goods
and services in an organization.
4. Leadership requires that the intended changes reflect the mutual purposes of the
leaders and collaborators. Management requires coordinated activities to produce and sell the
goods and services that reflect the organization's purpose.

36

Rost stated that his “intention was not to denigrate management but distinguish it from
leadership” and that “people need both management and leadership in organizations and societies
to survive and prosper” (1995, p. 134). In 1977, Zalenik was the first to write about the
differences between managers and leaders. According to Zalenik (1977), “a managerial culture
emphasizes rationality and control…a manager is a problem solver” and “it takes persistence,
tough-mindedness, hard work, intelligence, analytical ability, tolerance, and goodwill to be a
manager” (p. 75). Zalenik (1977) stated “leaders are active instead of reactive, shaping ideas
instead of responding to them… the net result of this influence changes the way people think
about what is desirable, possible, and necessary” (p. 76).

Transformational Leadership
Transformational leadership was first mentioned as a concept by Downton (1973), in his
seminal book Rebel Leadership; the book dealt with the differences between revolutionary,
rebellious, reform, and ordinary leadership. Five years later, James MacGregor Burns more fully
described transformational leadership in his classic book, Leadership, and distinguished it from
transactional leadership. Burns (1978) described transforming leadership as
Whatever the separate interests’ persons might hold, they are presently or potentially
united in the pursuit of ‘higher’ goals, the realization of which is tested by the
achievement of significant change that represents the collective or pooled interests of
leaders and followers. (p. 425)
Burns (1978) claimed that “leaders act as agents of their followers” (p. 3). This statement
was revolutionary because for the first-time leaders were portrayed as having influence over their
followers. Bass (2008) defined this leadership style as “elevating the follower’s level of maturity,

37

ideals, and concerns for the well-being of others, the organization, and society” (p. 619).
According to Bass and Riggio (2006), transformational leadership goes beyond the personal
goals of the leader to the common purposes of the followers, making this a popular leadership
style with the potential to transcend circumstances and cultures.
Burns defined leadership as a “reciprocal process of mobilizing, by persons with certain
motives and values, various economic, political, and other resources, in a context of competition
and conflict, in order to realize goals independently or mutually held by both leaders and
followers” (1978, p. 425). Burns stated (1978) transforming leadership goes beyond that
reciprocal process to “shape and alter and elevate the motives and values and goals of followers
through the vital teaching role of leadership” (p. 425). According to Burns (1978), the concept of
transformational leadership emerged when the interests of leaders and followers were united to
achieve mutual goals.

Transformational Leadership and Academic Libraries
The theoretical constructs in the definitions of transformational leadership, such as
leaders and followers united, leaders helping followers to grow and develop, leaders responding
to followers’ needs, empowering followers, and aligning individual and groups goals with
organizational goals are all present in the discourse of transformational leadership in the Library
and Information Science literature (Castiglione, 2006; Germano, 2011; Mavrinac, 2005; Riggs,
2001; Sutton, 2005; Townley, 2009).
Riggs (1997) stated, “as academic libraries are becoming more complex and confusing,
reshaping and renewing themselves, and undergoing unparalleled changes, transformational
leadership is in demand” (p. 8). According to Albritton (1998), “… transformational leaders are

38

needed in academic libraries to help encourage librarians and other staff to move toward
individual renewal and organizational revitalization” (p. 66). Germano (2011), stated libraries
can “benefit from transformational leadership since it represents self-sustaining change along
with the propensity to encourage the creativity that improves library experiences for patrons” (p.
10). Mavrinac (2005) specified that libraries play a critical role in the education of its citizens, of
lifelong learning, and in the provision of free and equitable access to information; and that the
professional values of librarianship are very similar to the public values of transformational
leadership. Transformational leadership is commonly viewed as occurring at the shared team
level. Hicks and Givens (2013) indicated that change discourse was among the most dominant
discourses in librarianship during the past two decades and that change had transforming effects
of libraries. Hicks and Givens (2013) also stated that transformational leaders are needed to
guide the profession into its unknown future. Smith (2011) revealed that transformational
leadership had been studied in pre-service school librarians enrolled in the Project LEAD
(Leaders Educated to Make a Difference) programs.
According to Gilstrap (2009), very few studies on transformational leadership exists in
the Library and Information Science literature. Albritton (1998) conducted a study of
transformational leadership in 104 medium-sized academic libraries and found that
transformational versus transactional leadership models are found in libraries at the same rate
that they are found in other formal organizations. Gilstrap (2009) lists transformational
leadership as one of the major leadership theories in academic libraries in a historiographical
analysis of major leadership and organizational development theories that have influenced how
we think about and lead academic libraries.

39

Alire (2007) stated transformational leadership is “the most effective leadership style for
anyone working in the library profession” (p. 171). Additionally, Alire (2007) stated that a
library leader with transformational leadership characteristics can lead libraries through changes
as a result of the technological transformations taking place in society and higher education, and
demands new service delivery models. Transformational leaders are ideally poised to implement
succession planning and management programs in academic libraries because these leaders
inspire followers to commit to the vision of the organization. According to Bass and Riggio
(2006), transformational leaders challenge followers to be innovative problem solvers and
develop followers’ leadership capacity via coaching and mentoring.
Sutton (2005) wrote about her application of transformational leadership in her role as a
library director; she developed and built an undergraduate academic library and talked about the
importance of being passionate and having a deep commitment to a shared vision. Hicks and
Givens (2013) conducted a study that explored, among other questions, why the ALA Council
selected principled transformational leadership style as a core competency for librarians during
the Task Force on Core Competencies meeting in 2009. Castiglione (2006) noted that library
leaders should adapt their leadership styles to fit the situation, in some instances, transactional
leadership is a more appropriate approach to a situation, and in other cases, transformational
leadership is more appropriate. Castiglione (2006) also stated that “differences in education,
managerial expertise, the year entered the profession, values, and other factors may have a
significant impact on the ability or willingness of senior library administrators to migrate from a
transactional to a transformation management style” (p. 293).
Bass and Riggio (2006) stated that transformational leaders stimulate and inspire
followers to attain amazing accomplishments and in doing so they cultivate leadership abilities.

40

One way that leaders do this is by “looking at the big picture, questioning the status-quo,
reviewing the organization's vision statement, and seeking out ways to make significant
improvements in services” (Riggs, 2001, p. 14). Germano (2011) contended that
transformational leaders manage talent and ensure that people's actions, interest, and expertise
are used to solve problems, improve processes, and meet patron demands.
Bass and Avolio (1990) developed, and later refined, the Multifactor Leadership
Questionnaire (MLQ 5x), a standardized scale consisting of two separate forms; a self-rating
form used by supervisors to rate themselves, and a rater form used by supervisees or colleagues
to rate a supervisor. An alternative form, the MLQ 5x ranking form, is intended for research
purposes only. According to Bass and Avolio (1990), the MLQ 5x was developed to build upon
previous leadership measurements and to provide “a concise computerized feedback form that
could be used for individual, team, and organizational development” (p. 1). The MLQ 5x can be
used to assess leadership effectiveness at all levels of the organization and its scores can also be
utilized for the identification of candidates to leadership training and promotion.
Transformational, transactional, and passive/avoidant behavior are constructs that define the
MLQ 5x.
The Transformational Leadership Development Program, consisting of the MLQ 5x, the
MLQ 5x instruction manual, and the MLQ 5x profile (a form that provides feedback to the
leader), developed by Bass and Avolio (1990) systematically demonstrates, measures, and
explains exceptional leadership behavior. The MLQ 5x was originally drawn up to provide
practitioners and researchers a reliable method for measuring transformational leadership,
transactional leadership, and passive/avoidant behavior. The Full Range Leadership
Development Program assesses four factors of transformational leadership, two factors of

41

transactional leadership, two factors of non-leadership, and three outcome factors. The
transformational leadership factors Bass and Riggio (2006) developed are: idealized influence
(originally charisma), inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized
consideration (see Table 1).

Idealized influence. Leaders serve as role models and are admired, respected, and trusted
by their followers. Followers endow leaders with having extraordinary capabilities, persistence,
and determination. Leaders with idealized influence are willing to take risks and are consistent.
They can be counted on to do the right thing and demonstrate high standards of ethical and moral

42

conduct. A sample item from the MLQ 5x is: “The leader emphasizes the importance of having a
collective sense of the mission.”
Inspirational motivation. Leaders motivate and inspire by providing meaning to
followers’ work. Team spirit, enthusiasm, and optimism are present. Leaders communicate
expectations that followers want to meet; they demonstrate a commitment to goals and a shared
vision. A sample item from the MLQ 5x is: “The leader articulates a compelling vision for the
future.”
Intellectual stimulation. Leaders stimulate followers’ innovative and creative efforts by
questioning assumptions, reframing problems, and looking at new ways to deal with old issues.
Ideas and solutions are solicited from followers included in the process of addressing problems
and finding solutions. A sample item from the MLQ 5x is: “The leader gets others to look at
problems from many different angles.”
Individualized consideration. Leaders serve as coaches or mentors and pay attention to
the followers’ achievement and growth needs. New learning opportunities allow for
individualized consideration practices in a supportive environment. The leaders accept the
individual differences of the followers. Interactions with followers are encouraged, and the
leader listens effectively. Leaders delegate tasks to followers with the purpose of developing
their skills. A sample item from the MLQ 5x is: “The leader spends time teaching and coaching.”
Mossop (2013) modified the definition developed by Bass and Avolio by adding trust as
an additional component. Pielstick’s (1998) conceptual framework of transformational leadership
derived from his meta-ethnographic analysis of the literature includes six major themes: shared
vision, communication, relationships, culture, implementation, and character (p. 5).

43

The Difference Between Transformational Leadership and Other Types of Leadership
Since Bass’ definition of transformational leadership has been selected to address this
major topic, outlined below are the distinctions between transformational leadership,
transactional leadership, and passive/avoidant behavior.
Transactional leadership. According to Burns (1978) transactional leadership occurs
when one person contacts another to exchange something of value, i.e., jobs for votes or
subsidies for campaign contributions. The components of transactional leadership are contingent
reward and management-by-exception. In contingent reward leadership, the leader states what
needs to be done by the followers in exchange for the completion of assigned tasks, leaders
arrange for material or psychological rewards for their followers. Bass and Riggio (2006)
stated that material rewards could include an increase in salary or the receipt of an award and
psychological rewards can include positive feedback or leader approval. A sample item from the
MLQ 5x is: “The leader makes clear what one can expect to receive when performance goals are
achieved.” Bass and Riggio (2006) also stated management-by-exception can be active and
occurs when the leaders monitor followers to catch them making a mistake and then take
corrective measures; passive management-by-exception happens when leaders wait for followers
to make mistakes and then take remedial action. A sample item from the MLQ 5x for passive
management-by-exception is: “The leader takes no action until complaints are received.”
Bass (2008) stated transactional leadership “emphasizes the exchange that occurs
between a leader and followers in exchange for achieving specific work objectives” (p. 618);
individual followers or groups are compensated or rewarded for the completion of their tasks. In
contrast, Burns (1978), stated that transforming leadership occurs when followers and leaders
engage with each other to raise one another to higher levels of motivation and morality. The

44

keywords are exchange and engage; transactional leaders make exchanges with their followers,
whereas transformational leaders engage with their followers.
“The chief monitors of transactional leadership are modal values - values of means:
honesty, responsibility, fairness, the honoring of commitments - without which transactional
leadership could not work” (Burns, 1978, p. 426). As the word implies, transactional leadership
is about transactions between leaders and followers in exchange for personal or organizational
gains. According to Burns (1978), “transformational leadership is more concerned with end
values, such as liberty, justice, equality... transforming leaders ‘lead’ their followers through
levels of morality” (p. 426).
Passive/Avoidant Behavior. According to Bass and Riggio (2006), this style of
leadership is recognized for “the avoidance or absence of leadership” (p. 8): and it is an
ineffective leadership style and contrary to transactional leadership it is non-transactional.
Furthermore, decisions are not made, actions do not take place, and responsibilities are not
addressed. The passive/avoidant behavior can be either management by exception or laissezfaire. A sample item from the MLQ 5x for passive management-by-exception is: “The leader
avoids getting involved when important issues arise.” One might conclude that laissez-faire
leadership is almost the opposite of transformational leadership, where the leader and follower
work together. According to Burns (1978), when transformational leadership takes place “leaders
and followers are engaged in a common enterprise, they are dependent upon each other, their
fortunes rise and fall together; they share the results of planned change together” (p. 426).
Transformational leaders can influence, motivate, stimulate, and consider employees in different
ways than transactional leaders or laissez-faire leaders (Bass, 2008; Bass & Avolio, 1990; Bass
& Riggio, 2006; Burns, 1978).

45

In a continuum of leadership activities and effectiveness measurements, by definition,
transformational leadership is more active and effective than transactional leadership which is
more active and effective than passive/avoidant behavior (Bass, 2008). The three styles together
formed what Bass termed the Model of Full Range Leadership (Bass, 2008).

Potential Benefits of Transformational Leadership
According to Germano (2011), “libraries, like all organizations, stand to benefit from
transformational leadership since it represents self-sustaining change along with the propensity
to encourage the creative thinking that improves library experiences for patrons” (p. 10).
Germano (2011) listed five specific benefits that transformational leadership offers libraries:
evaluates innovation efforts, identifies creatives, develops an innovative climate, assesses
tolerance for change, and understands patron wants and needs.
Evaluates innovation efforts. Germano (2011) argued that leadership that drives
innovation and creativity and that can serve to alleviate staff’s fears and frustrations “caused by
the traditional library goal of ensuring ordered and reliable access to a body of knowledge
despite an increasingly disordered and technologically unpredictable information universe” (p. 2)
is greatly needed.
Identifies creatives. Germano (2011) described creatives as “employees who question
established practices to come up with new ideas and develop exciting new programs that benefit
patrons” (p. 11).
Develops an innovative climate. According to Germano (2011) in the library
environment, “transformational leadership can be challenging and labor intensive due to the need

46

to “connect the dots” between the individual and group strengths and the organizational need and
challenges” (p. 8).
Assesses tolerance for change. According to Duren (2013), transformational leadership
is well suited to managing major changes in libraries and when introducing large-scale,
deliberate change in libraries leaders need to be proactive and attentive to future trends. Duren
(2013) describes transformational leaders in libraries during times of change as leaders who
“identify and articulate a clear vision, serve as a role model, foster the acceptance of group goals,
set high-performance expectations, and provide individual support and intellectual stimulation”
(p. 137).
Understands patron wants and needs. According to Germano (2011), transformational
leaders make changes that are meaningful and valuable to library users by understanding and
making distinctions between patrons’ wants and their needs.

Potential Drawbacks of Transformational Leadership
The major drawbacks of transformational leadership in practice as identified in the
literature are leaders’ misuse of influence and followers’ dependency on transformational
leaders. According to Bass and Steidlmeier (1999), “critics say that transformational
leadership is unethical… it lacks the checks and balances of democratic discourse and
power distribution… and that it manipulates followers into ignoring the followers own
best interests” (p. 211).
Follower’s dependency. Eisenbeiß and Boerner (1999) conducted a study focusing on
followers’ dependency on transformational leaders. Using the MLQ 5x and other measures, 416
R&D employees based in Germany were surveyed. According to Eisenbeiß & Boerner (1999),

47

the results showed a positive relationship between transformational leadership and followers’
creativity.
Time-consuming. Some other drawbacks of this leadership style that may be
experienced during practice; it is time-consuming to give individualized attention to many
followers. Additionally, transformational leadership may be out of reach for people who lack
inspirational communication skills. The theory explains the what it is, but not how it is done;
that makes it difficult to implement in practice.

Implementation of Transformational Leadership at Academic Libraries
As previously stated, transformational leadership characteristics encompass a wide array
of attitudes, beliefs, and actions. According to Bass and Avolio (1990), transformational
leadership occurs at all levels of leadership; therefore, one could surmise that components of
transformational leadership may be observable at any hierarchical level of an academic library,
from deans to paraprofessional staff.
According to Gilstrap (2009), there are few studies on transformational leadership in the
Library and Information Science literature. Albritton (1998) conducted a study to test the
efficacy of the MLQ 5x, and the other study conducted by Mavrinac (2005) focused on
mentoring as a critical component of transformational leadership.
Transformational leadership can be implemented at academic libraries through the
application and modeling of idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual
stimulation, and individualized consideration; the four components that distinguish this style of
leadership from other styles. Academic library leaders can teach and mentor librarians or make
available training opportunities to inform staff about transformational leadership.

48

Lead by example. Library leaders can influence their followers by leading-by-example.
For instance, leaders can engage followers in meaningful discussions - grounded on ethics and
values - about the library’s future. These value and ethically laden discussions may influence
followers to transcend their self-interests for the sake of that of the organization. According to
Riggs (2001), “values are the principles or standards that help libraries determine what is
worthwhile or desirable … library leaders should understand how they conform with those of the
library” (p. 13).
Inspire followers to be motivated. Library leaders can inspire their followers’
motivation by presenting assigned tasks or assignments as part of something larger, especially
during change. For example, leaders can confidently and passionately share with followers how
the academic libraries’ vision and mission help students succeed, as opposed to simply having a
written vision or mission statement that resides somewhere on the library’s homepage. Alire
(2007) stated that effective transformational leaders embrace change to move library
organizations forward by motivating and mentoring their followers and implementing a shared
vision.
Intellectually stimulate followers. Library leaders can intellectually stimulate
followers by encouraging them to participate in decision-making and problem-solving. In
particular, library leaders can foster an environment conducive towards open and frank
conversations by soliciting opinions that are heard and respected. The Association of Research
Libraries created the Research Library Leadership Fellows Program to develop leaders who can
support, enable, and enrich the transformations affecting research and research-intensive
education (German et al., 2009).

49

Give individualized consideration. Library leaders can provide individualized
consideration to their followers by treating them (followers) as they want to be treated. For
instance, leaders can help followers grow and develop professionally by building trust-based
working relationships in their day-to-day transactions with them. According to Bass and Riggio
(2006), transformational leaders challenge followers to be innovative problem solvers and
develop their followers’ leadership capacity via coaching and mentoring.
Albritton (1998) conducted one of the few studies on transformational leadership in the
library profession exploring transformational versus transactional leadership models to find
perceptions of transformational leadership in medium-sized academic libraries, and how those
perceptions related to leadership outcomes. Albritton’s (1998) study results suggested that
“…transformational leadership was perceived as augmenting or having more effect on leadership
dimensions and outcomes of organizational effectiveness than did transactional leadership” (p.
78).

Evaluating Leadership Styles Using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire
An evaluation of transformational leadership in academic libraries can best be
accomplished using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5x). The MLQ 5x was
created by Bass in 1985 and revised in 1988. The definition, purpose, and constructs of the MLQ
5x have been previously described, so they will not be repeated here. In 1999, Avolio, Bass, and
Jung re-examined the components of transformational and transactional leadership using the
MLQ 5x. The purpose of the study was to examine the factor structure of the MLQ 5x to find the
best leadership descriptive model; 3,786 national and international respondents participated in
the study. Avolio, Bass, and Jung (1999) found “a high degree of consistency in estimates of

50

reliability, correlations, and factor loading when comparing the initial with the replicating sample
results” (p. 458).
There are other instruments available to evaluate transformational leadership, such as the
Transformational Leadership Questionnaire and the Global Transformational Leadership scale.
The MLQ 5x was selected to assess the leadership styles of academic library deans because it
focuses on the three leadership styles presented in this study. Bass developed the
transformational leadership theory and designed the MLQ 5x specifically with the purpose of
testing that theory. It has been widely used and undergone modifications and refinements.

Planned Change Theory by Kurt Lewin
Kurt Lewin was a Jewish, German psychologist who immigrated to the United States
during the Nazi reign before WWII. Lewin’s ideas on organizational change developed during
the 1940s have had a lasting impact on current thinking about planned changed in organizations.
Lewin (1947) stated that group life within any organization is never without change and what
differs is the amount and type of change; “change and consistency are relative concepts” (p. 13).
Kurt Lewin’s (1947) planned change theory is an analysis that represents social forces in
a group setting to gather insight into the desire for and resistance to a specific change. Lewin
(1947) used the concept social field to describe a social group in its natural setting; and phase
space as a concept to describe certain aspects or conditions of social problems. According to
Kippenberger (1998), social field is expansive and includes sub-groups within the group, group
membership, and channels of communication. Lewin (1947) argued that certain social driving
forces increase or drive change (ambition, goals, needs, and fears) and these driving forces can
act either both towards or away from something; while restraining forces oppose driving forces,

51

he called these forces forcefields. “Taken together, the overall structure and the actual setting of
the groups will determine the range of changes that are possible; this is because any changes will
depend on the distribution of and interplay of forces across the entire field” (Kippenberger, 1998,
p. 10). Lewin (1947) stated that “the status quo of groups is a quasi-stationary process; to
understand how to implement change one needs to first ask: (1) why does the process under the
current circumstances proceed on this particular level? And, (2) what are the conditions for
changing the present circumstances?” (p. 15). The concept of the quasi-stationary equilibrium is
not constant; according to Lewin (1947), they ‘’show fluctuations at an average level” (p. 16).
“Central to Lewin’s case is his argument that a forcefield operates in such a way that the
opposing forces balance out at a point where the driving and restraining forces are equal
(Kippenberger, 1998, p. 10). Furthermore, Kippenberger (1998) describe this phenomenon as
“the point at which the level of equilibrium for human activity becomes established” (p. 10).
So, Lewin defined planned change as transplanting the force field of a quasi-state of
equilibrium from one level at the beginning of the change to the force field of another quasi-state
of equilibrium level at the end. However, for Lewin, the change did not occur in a vacuum; all of
the circumstances need to be considered first. Burns (2004) stated that Lewin posed two
questions concerning groups: “(a) what is it about the nature and characteristics of a particular
group that causes it to respond (behave) as it does to the forces that impinge on it? And, (b) how
can these forces be changed in order to elicit a more desirable form of behavior?” (p. 982).
Lewin (1947) stated, “a change toward a higher level of group performance is frequently
short-lived; after a ‘shot in the arm,’ group life returns to the previous level” (p. 35). Lewin
(1947) described the three aspects necessary for change as “unfreezing (if necessary) the present
level, moving to the new level, and freezing group life at the new level” (p. 35).

52

Lewin (1947) illustrated the principles of quasi-stationary equilibria in group dynamics
before and after planned change using worker levels of production in factories (see Figure 2).
Lewin (1947) explained that the output of a team in a plant over a period could be viewed as the
quasi-stationary equilibrium of that group. He further stated that to make changes to the level of
production of the factory workers, managers or leaders need first to analyze the forces in play
within the individual and the group that maintains that equilibrium. An example of a force that
may keep production down is workers’ strain avoidance; and an example of a force that may
increase production is the employees’ desires to earn more money if the production is tied to
financial incentives (Lewin, 1947).

group dynamics: Concept, method, and reality in social sciences; social equilibrium and
social change. Human Relations, 1(5), 5-40. Copyright 1947 by Sage Publications.

Managers or leaders must understand the forces that motivate workers to either increase
or decrease their individual and group levels of productivity before the planning change is
initiated. Lewin (1947) used the example of women working at a factory in the South who had
53

more earning capacity working at a plant than at any other jobs available to them in their
neighborhoods. Money did not incentivize these women. However, understanding what other
factors may have served as incentives for those women to increase their levels of production was
crucial for a successful change implementation. Lewin (1947) identified ability, difficulty, and
change of difficulty as factors that may restrain many social events, including productivity
levels. Lewin (1947) stated, “restraining forces are not equivalent to a tendency to change, they
merely oppose driving forces” (p. 28). Lewin (1947) also identified ambition, goals, needs, or
fears as driving forces for changes. The fear of job loss may serve as a driving force for workers
to increase production levels at a factory.

Planned Change Theory and the Need for SP&MPs at Academic Libraries
During the unfreezing step of planned change, Lewin (1947) stated that “to break open
the shell of complacency and self-righteousness it is sometimes necessary to bring about
deliberately an emotional stir-up” (p. 35). When a dean of library leaves unexpectedly, and there
is no one in the library prepared to step-up and lead the library during a transition period,
employees may be in a state of turmoil about the library’s future as well as their futures and
chaos may ensue. An unexpected vacancy at the top level may serve as the juggernaut behind the
establishment of SP&MPs in the future and as a catharsis to remove preconceived ideas and
prejudices towards the program. The researcher of this study created a figure to exemplify the
relationship between Lewin’s planned change theory and the implementation of SP&MPs at an
academic library (see Figure 3).
SP&MPs offer an option to academic libraries for ensuring leadership continuity from
within the organization. According to Rothwell (2010), SP&MPs can be of importance to

54

organizations because: (a) the continued survival of the organization depends on having the right
people in the right places at the right times; (b) as a result of decreased budgets there are fewer
available to advance to the top; (c) the program can increase diversity and multiculturalism at the
organization, and (d) the program helps to guide organizations with establishing developmental
and training programs and career paths (p. 41).

55

Lewin’s planned change theory is a system of analysis that represent social forces in a
group setting to gather insight into the desire for and resistance to a specific change. Shoemaker,
Tankard, and Lasorsa (2004) defined a theory as “... a set of systematically related
generalizations suggesting new observation from empirical testing. As such, the purpose of a
theory is to explain or predict” (p. 112).
Librarians working at academic libraries represent the social field concept that is the
group in its natural setting, and the implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries represents
the phase space concept that is the social problem or intended change. The implementation of a
program represents a process that is continuously evolving. Lewin (1947) compared it to a river,
“continuously changing its elements even if its velocity and direction remain the same” (p. 15).
The state of flux that libraries operate in on a day-to-day basis is represented by the quasistationary social equilibrium concept. When implementing a SP&MP at a library to address
staffing and training issues, certain forces will drive that change and others will oppose it, these
forces in either direction represent the force field concept. Driving forces could include the
deans’ and the groups’ acceptance of the program's potential for increasing the pool of
promotable employees, or encouraging the advancement of diverse librarian groups. Restraining
forces could include the deans’ and the groups’ opposition to the program’s potential for too
much time commitment due to planning meetings or completing paperwork. It is important to
highlight that adding forces in the desired direction or diminishing opposing forces can change
the quasi-stationary social equilibrium.
According to Lewin (1947), “influencing a population to make a change…means trying
to break a well-established custom or social habit” (p. 32). To overcome resistance to change due
to customs or social habits, a library dean needs an additional force sufficient enough to break or

56

unfreeze that custom or habit. Therein lies a major challenge for the dean, identifying what the
group will consider is a sufficient enough reason for moving towards the change. Lewin (1947)
found that changing group standards (force field) tend to facilitate changing the individual and
stabilizing the individual conduct at the new group level (p. 36). Moving a group to change can
be influenced by tapping into a groups’ eagerness and motivation. If the group feels motivated,
that may lead the group to act and to freeze the individual’s tendency to commit to the group.
A. Lewin’s (1947) theory enabled prediction and explanation of group behavior and
individuals. Using Lewin’s planned change theory as a guide, the library dean’s first
consideration should be to ask what forces affect the implementation of SP&MPs at the
library, rather than how the implementation can be achieved. Regarding group behavior,
the theory predicts that social habits will be regarded as obstacles to the change.
Librarians may find it difficult to accept that some positions will be classified as key
positions and object to such classification because that represents a break from the
custom. Planned change theory argues that an additional force is required to overcome
obstacles to change. Going back to the implementation of a SP&MP, if a pay raise is
associated with advancement due to advanced training or a promotion, it may represent a
sufficient force to overcome a specific obstacle.
B. The theory gives practitioner explanations in specific situations. Going back to the
example above about social habits being obstacles to change; a library dean may realize
that librarians will object to having some positions classified as key positions. In
anticipation of that objection, the dean may elect to provide opportunities where program
benefits can be discussed in detail to help mitigate those obstacles. Recognition that an
additional force may remove an obstacle may result in the dean balancing what may be

57

perceived as bad news with good news. Understanding the perceived social value that
individuals put on group standards, helps the dean to recognize the level of resistance that
may be encountered. Seeking other means of social value may help minimize the
resistance.
C. The theory provides perspective on behaviors towards change. According to the theory,
the group sets the standards of conduct. An individual may differ in their personal level
of conduct from the group level, and if the individual is too divergent from the group’s
level of accepted behavior, that individual may be ousted from the group. Most
individuals chose to stay within acceptable group conduct to prevent being ousted. The
dean may use this information to give the group an opportunity to deal with different
behavior on their own. According to Lewin’s (1947) theory, the higher the social value
the individual places on the group, the higher the resistance of the person to move away
from that level. Lewin (1947) stated “that it is usually easier to change individuals
formed into a group than to change any one of them separately (p. 32). With this
knowledge, the academic library dean can try to effect change at the group level rather
than at the individual level.

Planned Change and the Unfreezing Step
During the unfreezing step of planned change, academic libraries lay the foundation for
the SP&MP. The prerequisite for Lewin’s concept of changing group performance to a higher
level of performance requires the acknowledgment of a need for change. Academic libraries will
need to take action if they want to make a case for needed change. According to Lewin (1947),
“the unfreezing of the present level may involve quite different problems in different cases” (p.

58

35). Rothwell (2010) lists six activities that organizations can engage in to make a case for
change, and that require a quantum leap from the status quo (p. 105). The activities from the
unfreezing step of the change process described by Lewin can help to describe how a systematic
SP&MP can be established at an academic library. Other practical steps recommended for using
the theoretical framework during the unfreezing step include determining the need for change,
ensuring there is strong support from upper management, creating the need for change, and
managing and understanding the doubts and concerns of employees (Mind Tools, n.d.). These
actions reference the identification of the driving and restraining forces.
Assessing current problems and practices. The organization should be surveyed to
understand better its current state and why change needs to take place. As earlier indicated,
Lewin (1947) stated “sometimes it is necessary to bring about deliberately an emotional stir-up”
for a change to occur (p. 35). Similarly, Rothwell (2010), indicated that “crisis in a common
impetus for a change” (p. 106). An indication of a problem in an academic library could be
difficulties in filling vacancies due to unqualified candidates or that the librarians in the library
lack or show no interest in advancing.
Demonstrating the need for a program. Rothwell (2010) suggested that organizations
tie SP&PM issues directly to their pressing problems and mission. A need for a SP&MP as a
planned change could be demonstrated, for example, by hitchhiking on a staffing crisis.
Determining organizational requirements. Requirements for SP&MPs vary because
academic libraries vary due to size, staffing numbers, maturity states, leadership values, and so
forth. During the unfreezing stage, library leaders should establish the goals for the SP&MP at
their libraries with the understanding that these may differ from goals set by colleagues
at other academic libraries.

59

Linking the program with the libraries’ strategic and human resources plans. “Use
your vision and strategy as supporting evidence for changing and communicating the vision in
terms of the change required” (Mind Tools, n.d.). Rothwell (2010) defines organizational
strategy as “the way in which business choose to compete” (p. 119). Examples of these activities
include when library leaders address questions about the time and attention they are willing to
dedicate to the program, how stable the current organizational structure is, how many resources
leaders are willing to devote to the program, and whether leaders prefer to fill positions from
within or without the library.
Benchmarking program processes at other academic libraries. Academic libraries
can gather fresh perspectives and points of comparisons that may be applicable helpful in making
a case for and developing the program at their libraries by identifying benchmarks at other
libraries that have already established SP&MPs,
Obtaining and building library deans’ commitments to systematic programs.
Rothwell (2010) recommends that before committing to a program, leaders ask themselves: (a)
who is affected by the change? (b) What is the change process? (c) Who is making the change?
And, (d) in what domain is the change taking place? There should be strong support from upper
management, and SP&MPs should be framed as issues important to the whole organization.

Planned Change and the Moving Step
During this step in a planned change, “people begin to resolve their uncertainty and look
for new ways to do things and believe and act in ways that support the new direction” (Mind
Tools, n.d.). Some activities during this step include often communicating about the benefits of
the change, how these will affect everyone, and how employees can prepare themselves for the

60

coming change. Leaders need to be vigilant and to dispel rumors by answering questions
honestly and dealing with problems immediately. Leaders also need to empower employees to
take action and participate in the day-to-day activities. Finally, leaders need to involve
stakeholders in the process and generate short-term wins.
Preparing and communicating the program action plan. The purpose is to set clear
expectations about the program and to conceptualize the strategy for implementing the program.
Conducting meetings. Rothwell (2010) recommends that during this step a series of
meetings be held to verify the need for the program, seek input from employees, hammer out the
proposal, and to conduct periodic reviews. The librarian or human resources staff responsible for
the SP&MP will call the meetings, set the agenda, and ensure that the right employees are
present.
Conducting training. A systematic approach to SP&MPs requires that employees have
new skills and knowledge, and training can be completed in-house. Training can include topics
such as introduction to SP&MPs, conducting effective performance appraisals, carrying out
assessments of future work requirements and individual assessments.

Planned Change and the Refreezing Step
The final step of Lewin’s (1947) planned change theory is refreezing. Refreezing is when
changes occur, and librarians embrace the new program and all it entails. According to Mind
Tools (n.d.), practical steps that can be taken include: “anchoring the changes in the culture,
developing ways to sustain the change, providing support and training, and celebrating success”
Rothwell (2010) stated that organizations “need to determine the organization's collective
succession needs, using promotion from within to meet those needs, clarifying individual

61

developments, and closing those gaps systematically through planned training and education” (p.
241). Rothwell’s (2010) description of making the program permanent resonated with Lewin’s
refreezing step and included the following:
Testing the organization’s bench strength, establishing an unequivocal internal promotion
policy to ensure internal promotion when appropriate, preparing individual development
plans to close the gap between what individuals presently do and what they must do to
qualify for promotion, and use internal development when appropriate to realize the
learning objectives of individual development plans. (p. 271)
In developing ways to sustain the change further during the refreezing step, Rothwell
(2010) recommended evaluating SP&MPs for “customer satisfaction, program progress,
effective placements, and organizational results” (p. 347). The evaluations can be conducted
anecdotally, periodically, or programmatically.

Summary
This chapter discussed the definition of SP&MPs as found in the literature. Rothwell's
definition of SP&MPs was selected by the researcher for this study because it best describes
these programs, it is comprehensive, and has been previously used in the Library and
Information Science literature. The Seven-Pointed Star Model by Rothwell (2010) serves as one
example of how to develop the program at academic libraries. The model also serves to
operationalize the researchers’ use of the term “implementation of a SP&MP” when interviewing
the deans and this, in turn, increases the reliability of the study. The implementation of SP&MPS
in academic libraries was explicated along with trends that drive program implementation.
Considerations for when to implement or not the program were also discussed.

62

There is a paucity of literature on transformational leadership studies conducted in
academic libraries, during the literature review three studies only were identified; Albritton
(1998), Mason (2015), and Mavrinac (2005). That is surprising because much has been and is
routinely articulated about change due to demographics and trends in higher education. Changes
are expected to highly impact academic libraries and justify the need for transformational leaders
who are qualified to lead academic libraries (Alire, 2007; Castiglione, 2006; Düren, 2013;
Germano, 2011; Mossop, 2013; Riggs, 1997; Sutton, 2005; Townley, 2009). The evaluation of
transformational and transactional leadership and passive/avoidant behavior presents ample
opportunities to conduct future research that can contribute to the knowledge of the field.
The literature review revealed that there were no examples of the application of formal
SP&MPs at academic libraries. The lack of implementation of these programs led the researcher
to question why SP&MPs are not integrated into the culture of academic libraries and what
factors may contribute to deans’ decisions to implement or not implement a program. The
researcher developed questions to seek explanations as a result of this line of questioning.
Lewin’s (1947) planned change theory guided the theoretical discussion for this study.
Lewin (1947) stated that before a planned change occurs in an organization, the managers or
persons responsible for implementing the planned change should be aware of the forces that may
drive the change or restrain it. The understanding of those forces will help the organization’s
leaders as they unfreeze the current status quo by correctly diagnosing the problem, move
towards the needed or desired change, and refreeze the change at the new, preferred level. The
theory was explained in detail and examples of its application in academic libraries were
provided. Lewin is famously known for stating, “there is nothing so practical as a good theory.”

CHAPTER 3
METHODS

Research Design and Questions
As stated in chapter one, the problem addressed by this research is the gap in the planning
for and development of current academic librarians at their institutions to fill future leadership
roles within their libraries through the provision of succession planning and management
programs (SP&MPs). There is an expressed need in the Library and Information Science
literature for establishing planned programs within academic libraries to identify and prepare
potential leaders to assume key leadership roles. This study presented SP&MPs as a solution to
the problem stated and answered four research questions:
RQ 1. How do the leadership styles of academic library deans affect their decisions to
implement SP&MPs as a planned change?
RQ 2. What are the driving forces that affect library deans’ decisions to implement
SP&MPs at academic libraries?
RQ 3. What are the restraining forces that affect library deans’ decisions to implement
SP&MPs at academic libraries?
RQ 4. How useful was Lewin’s change theory in predicting the need to identify driving
and restraining forces as necessary for better understanding a planned change?
The study employed a mixed-method sequential explanatory design that consisted of
online surveys to collect quantitative data followed by in-depth interviews to collect qualitative
data. The qualitative data helped to explain the results of the quantitative data. The first question
in the study asks if deans’ leadership styles make a difference in the implementation of SP&MPs.

64

It was necessary for the researcher to measure the leadership styles of the library deans who
participated in the study to answer that question. The results of the instrument used to measure
leadership tendencies were analyzed and quantified. Additional research questions were posed to
understand other factors may affect the implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries.
Follow up in-depth interviews were designed to gather more information from the deans that
would provide further explanations about the results of the quantitative data. According to
Ivankova, Creswell, and Stick (2006), “the rationale for mixing both kinds of data within one
study is grounded in the fact that neither quantitative nor qualitative methods are sufficient, by
themselves, to capture the trends and details of the situation” (p. 3).
Library deans were selected as the population under study because the body of SP&MP
literature suggests that for these programs to be effective they require the support of the
organization’s chief administrators. Library deans and directors fill those roles at academic
libraries.
The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) 5x self-rating form developed by Bass
and Avolio (1990) was administered online to the deans of the academic libraries in a state in the
southeastern portion of the United States. The data from the MLQ 5x self-rating form was used
to answer RQ 1: How do the leadership styles of academic library deans affect their decisions to
implement SP&MPs as a planned change? The MLQ 5x self-rating form measures how leaders
think about or perceive their leadership behavior (see Appendix A for sample questions). The
MLQ 5x standardized scale is designed to measure transformational, transactional, and
passive/avoidant behavior leadership styles.
After the deans completed the questionnaires, the results were tabulated and compared to
the perceptions that the deans had about their leadership styles. The deans were simultaneously

65

invited to participate in both a survey and a follow-up in-depth interview (see Appendices B and
C). The first in-depth interview question (see Appendix D) was: Prior to today, you participated
in a survey instrument, the MLQ 5x self-rating form, it was designed to identify your leadership
analysis provide a general understanding of three different leadership styles. The styles of
leadership measured were transformational, transactional, or passive/avoidant behavior. In a few
minutes, I will tell you how you rated according to the way in which you answered the questions
on the MLQ 5x, but first please tell me:


What do you think your leadership style is: transformation, transactional,
passive/avoidant behavior or something else?



Do you think that your leadership style as identified by the MLQ 5x survey
in any way influences your decision to implement a SP&MP at your library?

The data collected from the in-depth interviews were used to answer RQs 2 and 3: What
are the driving forces that affect library deans’ decisions to implement SP&MPs at academic
libraries? And, what are the restraining forces that affect library deans’ decisions to implement
SP&MPs at academic libraries? The additional interview questions were intended to help the
researcher compile a more comprehensive understanding of the deans’ attitudes towards
SP&MPs. The researcher was interested in learning whether the deans had such a program at
their libraries, any situational factors at their campuses that may have influenced their decisions
to implement the programs, and other general impressions they had on succession planning.
Impending and constant changes in the library workplace, budget constraints in higher
education, perceptions of lack of interest in leadership roles by current librarians, the possibility
of many dean retirements within the next five to ten years, and an increasingly multigenerational
workforce necessitate qualified library administrators. The impact of these workforce issues in

66

academic libraries can be negated by effective succession planning and management
implementation. Effective SP&MPs include strategies for identifying staff within the
organization to fill key leadership positions and for establishing staff development training
programs that can prepare librarians to assume key leadership roles in the future (Rothwell,
2010).

Research Instrument Selection
The online standardized scale was selected because it is the most appropriate, timely, and
cost-effective way for the researcher to gather data about the leadership styles of academic
library deans using an existing instrument. The online mode of delivery was chosen because it
was convenient for respondents to access and because it allowed respondents to complete the
survey in private and at their convenience. The online standardized scale also contributed to
saving the researcher’s limited time and resources. The questionnaire was the data collection
instrument used in the first phase of this study. The in-depth interviews were conducted after the
online questionnaire data were collected and analyzed. The second phase of the study clarified
findings on the deans’ leadership styles, their effects on succession planning, and the driving
forces for and restraining forces against the implementation of SP&MPs.
The aim of the qualitative component of the study was to gain further understanding of a
solution to the problem under consideration. The in-depth interviews were intended to elicit
information about the factors that academic library deans consider when making decisions to
implement or not implement SP&MPs at their libraries. The interviews also sought to identify if
some of the leadership styles were more likely than others to lean towards the implementation of
SP&MPs. In-depth interviews were appropriate for use as a research method during this study

67

because the researcher was interested in seeking explanations about why, what, and how people
think and behave. The face-to-face or phone encounters that included a series of open-ended
questions may have uncovered more details about the way the deans think and feel about the
research under study than other research methodologies.

Mixed-method Research
The study employed a mixed-method sequential explanatory design that consisted of two
distinct phases. According to Ivanka, Creswell, and Stick (2006), the advantages of this research
method include “straightforwardness and opportunities for the exploration of the quantitative
results in more detail” and the limitations are “lengthy time and feasibility of resources to collect
and analyze all types of data” (p. 5). The first phase of the study was the quantitative data
collection and analysis that used the MLQ 5x self -rating form as the data collection instrument.
The MLQ 5x data collection and analysis served to identify the leadership styles of the library
deans, helped to broaden the researcher’s general understanding of leadership styles, and
contributed to the knowledge of leadership in the Information Studies field (see Appendix A).
This study gave priority to the qualitative data collection and analysis phase even though that
phase of the study occurred after the quantitative data collection and analysis phase because the
researcher sought explanations for and a better understanding of the factors that deans considered
when implementing a SP&MP at their libraries. The intent of the qualitative data collection and
analysis was to explain and better interpret the results of the quantitative phase.
The in-depth interviews were conducted during the second phase of the study. The indepth interviews were designed to assist the researcher in seeking a better understanding of the
leadership styles of the deans and if these influenced their decisions when planning change in the

68

form of SP&MPs at their academic libraries. The interviews also sought to gather explanations
about the driving forces for and the restraining forces against the implementation of SP&MPs at
libraries. The figure below depicts a sequential data analysis (see Figure 4).

Data to Explain Quantitative Data Results. Adapted from Designing and conducting
mixed method studies by J. W. Creswell and V. L. Plano, 2007. Copyright 2007 by Sage
Publications.

The data from the in-depth interviews were collected and analyzed after the online
standardized scale and were used to help explain the quantitative results. The study emphasizes
the qualitative data analysis and results. The second phase builds upon the first and intersects at
the intermediate stage of the research as shown in Figure 4 (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007).
During the first phase of the study, the questions focused on the leadership styles; characteristics
of transformational leadership, transactional leadership, and passive/avoidant behavior of each
participant as identified in the MLQ x. The participant’s responses were compared to the results
of the MLQ 5x self-rater standardized scale because the researcher was interested in learning if

69

specific leadership styles affect deans’ decisions to implement SP&MPs; for example, did the
data show that transformational leaders were more or less likely than transactional leaders to
implement SP&MPs? This line of questioning addressed the first research question. During the
second phase of the study, in-depth follow-up interviews addressed other factors that contributed
or may contribute to the implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries. The data integration
occurred at two points during the study; first, during the interpretative stage and later when
developing the questions for the in-depth interviews. The questions seek answers from the deans
about their perceptions of their leadership styles and their responses were compared to the styles
identified by the MLQ 5x. It was necessary to collect data about the deans’ leadership styles first,
using the same measurement instrument, to determine if deans with a specific leadership style
were more likely than deans with another leadership style to implement a SP&MP at an
academic library. The results of the survey and the in-depth interview datasets provided the
researcher explanations about the factors that affect deans’ decisions to implement SP&MPs at
their libraries.

Online Surveys
Definition. Schutt (2009) defined survey research as “involving the collection of
information from a sample of individuals through their responses to questions” (p. 256). Reinard
(2001) defined surveys as “an empirical study that uses questionnaires or interviews to discover
descriptive characteristics of phenomena” (p. 256). Lastly, Creswell (2005) defined surveys as
“procedures in quantitative research in which investigators administer a survey to a sample or to
the entire population of people in order to describe the attitudes, opinions, behaviors, or
characteristics of the population” (p. 354).

70

Researchers have used the MLQ 5x extensively. Therefore, the instrument was not
pretested as part of this study. The researcher retrieved the names and email addresses of the
academic library deans from the libraries’ websites to gain access. Potential respondents were
sent a cover letter (see Appendix B) via email explaining: (a) the study, (b) their participation,
and (c) a link to the online survey. Respondents were required to sign the behavioral consent
form and mail it to the researcher before completing the survey (see Appendix E).
Advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages of online surveys include
convenience, rapid data collection, cost effectiveness, ample time to respond, ease of follow-up,
and confidentiality (Rea & Parker, 2005). Technology has made it possible for respondents to
complete online surveys at their home, office, or almost any location and the data can be
collected and analyzed within relatively short timeframes. Cost related to mailing paper surveys
such as postage and paper are eliminated, as are out of town travel costs. Respondents can take
their time responding to an online survey; they can start, stop, and resume the survey at their
convenience and they have time to review notes and think about their responses. The researcher
can remind the potential respondents to fill out and submit the survey. In addition, using a secure
server ensures the data are protected. Some disadvantages of using online surveys include limited
respondent bases, self-selection, and lack of interviewer involvement (Rea & Parker, 2005). The
respondent base is limited to those with computer and internet access. The deans of the academic
libraries in this study had ample access to computers and to the internet at their libraries, and this
was not a limiting factor in this research. Persons who do not use email or who may have limited
reading abilities may choose not to participate in online surveys. However, the deans of the
academic libraries in this study have a minimum of a Master's degree in Library and Information
Science, so the lack of information literacy skills are not applicable to this population.

71

Nevertheless, the researcher’s contact information was available to all of the respondents should
they have needed additional information or required clarification on any of the procedures for
completing the questionnaire, participating in the in-depth interviews, or had questions about
what they are being asked to do as part of this study.

In-depth Interviews
Definition. Boyce and Neale (2006) defined in-depth interviews as “a qualitative
research technique that involves conducting intensive individual interviews with a small number
of respondents to explore their perspectives on a particular idea, program, or situation” (p.3).
Conducting in-depth interviews can lead to researchers to gaining detailed information that
allows them to achieve a better understanding of the participant’s beliefs, behaviors, and
reasoning. Schutt (2009) defined in-person interviews as “a survey in which an interviewer
questions respondents face-to-face and records their answers” (p. 296). The Encyclopedia of
Survey Research Methods (2008) defined interviewing as “typically a formal standardized
conversation between a person asking the questions [the interviewer] and a person giving
answers to those questions [the respondent]” (p. 385).
Advantages and disadvantages. According to Boyce and Neale (2006) and Schutt
(2009), there are numerous benefits and disadvantages to conducting in-depth interviews. The
benefits to conducting in-depth interviews include achieving higher response rates because there
is a commitment between the interviewer and interviewees to meet. The in-depth interview can
include more and complex questions that can be expanded upon or clarified by the interviewer.
The questions can be either open-ended or closed-ended. The interviewer controls the order of
the questions, and the respondents’ answers can be further clarified and explored. Furthermore,

72

the interviewer and interviewee can meet in a physical space that appeals and is convenient to
both of them.
Conversely, there are disadvantages to conducting in-depth interviews. In-depth
interviews can be prone to bias, consume much time, require training in interviewing techniques,
and the results are not generalizable to the population (Boyce & Neale, 2006). The interviewer
should be consistent when conducting the in-depth interviews: each respondent should “be asked
the same questions, in the same way, by the same kind of person who reacts similarly to the
answers” (Schutt, 2009, p. 296). During this study, potential respondents were sent a cover letter
(see Appendix C) via email explaining: (a) the study, (b) their participation, and (c) a meeting
invite. Respondents were required to sign the behavioral consent form before participating in the
interview (see Appendix E).

Sampling
As expressed in chapter one, the problem addressed by this research is the gap in the
planning for and development of current academic librarians at their institutions to fill future
leadership roles within their libraries through the provision of SP&MPs. Since the purpose of
this research is to determine if leadership styles are among the factors that affect academic
library deans’ decisions to implement SP&MPs at their institutions, the deans of the academic
libraries are the population selected for this study. Library deans/directors are the leaders of the
academic libraries in each of the state universities or colleges. The Occupational Outlook
Handbook (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016-17) stated administrative librarians “hire and
supervise staff, prepare budgets, and negotiate contracts for library materials and equipment.
Some conduct public relations or raise funds for the library.” The term “deans” is used in the

73

study to refer to both deans and directors of academic libraries. Some of the academic libraries at
the universities and colleges with larger student bodies or professional schools may have more
than one library, yet they tend to have only one library dean. The deans of these academic
libraries were selected as the sample for this study because they are representative of similar
populations at other state university and college systems. Therefore, the deans and directors of
the academic libraries in universities and colleges in a southeastern state of the United States
form the sample for this study. The total population consists of 40 academic library deans of
public state colleges and universities.

Units of Analysis
The four units of analysis in the study are the leadership styles of academic library deans,
the driving forces for the implementation of SP&MPs in academic libraries, the restraining
forces against the implementation of SP&MPs, and the usefulness of Lewin’s planned change
theory for SP&MP implementation. According to Foss and Waters (2007), “a unit of analysis
will help you know which aspect of your research of the data to focus on in your coding” (p.
186).

Data Collection and Analyses Procedures
The researcher collected and analyzed primary data generated by the participant’s
responses to the online standardized scale and in-depth follow-up interviews. The deans of the
academic libraries in a state in the southeastern portion of United States were invited via email to
participate in the study. The researcher compiled a list of all the universities and colleges in the
state system and then identified the deans of each of the libraries at those institutions by
accessing the library websites. The university deans were invited first to participate in the study.
74

Only six university deans volunteered to participate in the study. As planned, the researcher also
extended invitations to the college deans to take part in the study. Only four college deans
volunteered to participate in the study. All the deans at the universities and colleges were invited
to participate in the study with the intent of achieving the highest possible number of
participants. In all, sixty percent of the respondents were from universities and forty percent were
from colleges.
An informed consent form approved the Florida State University Institutional Review
Board was included in the invitations. Respondents emailed back their signed consent forms to
the researcher before completing the questionnaire. The same population participated in both the
surveys and in-depth interviews.
The MLQ 5x self-rating leadership standardized scale was used to answer the first
research question during the first phase of the study on leadership styles. The quantitative data
resulting from the MLQ 5x standardized scale were analyzed before the second phase of the
study was conducted. The MLQ 5x instrument was ordered online via Mind Garden, at
http://mindgarden.com; the company sells access to validated research instruments to interested
persons. The researcher purchased a license to use the standardized scale with up to 50 leaders
within a year’s timeframe. The researcher provided the respondents a link to access the
questionnaire and login instructions in the invitations sent to the participants in the study. The
respondents completed and submitted their responses online to Mind Garden where participants’
responses to the 45 questions were accessible only to the researcher. The results of the scale were
printed and shared with each dean individually during or after the follow-up interviews.
The same deans were invited via email to participate in the in-depth interviews. The indepth interviews provided the qualitative data the researcher sought to answer the second and

75

third research questions regarding driving and restraining forces for and against the
implementation of SP&MPs. According to Singleton and Straits (2010), the data collected from
the in-depth interviews is descriptive in that it seeks to “describe the distribution within a
population of certain characteristics, attitudes, or experiences and make use of a simpler form of
analysis” (p. 267).
As participants responded they were assigned a letter from A to J to identify them, the
MLQ 5x standardized scale they completed, and the transcriptions of their in-depth interviews.
The identification system allowed the researcher to collate the dean with corresponding scales
and transcripts while protecting the respondents’ confidentiality. The researcher only has the key
that identifies a dean to his or her corresponding scale and transcript.
The researcher scored the data from the MLQ 5x self-rating form to share with the deans
individually. “The MLQ 5x scale scores are average scores for the items on the scale” (Bass &
Avolio, 1995, p. 118). The scores were calculated by summing the items and dividing them by
the number of items that made up that particular scale (see Table 2). Each of the leadership style
scales had four items. The MLQ 5x self-rating form also tested for three different outcomes of
leadership: extra effort (three items), effectiveness (four items), and satisfaction (two items)
(Bass & Avolio, 1995).
According to Bass and Avolio (1995), the MLQ 5x “is not designed to encourage the
labeling of a leader as transformational or transactional…it is more appropriate to identify a
leader or a group of leaders as (for example) ‘more transformational than the norm’ or ‘less
transactional than the norm” (p. 120). After the data had been analyzed, the researcher scheduled
in-depth interviews with those same deans. The individual results of the MLQ 5x standardized
scale was shared with that respondent only. An academic library director who did not take part in

76

the study pretested the in-depth interview questions. The director stated the questions flowed in a
logical manner and addressed the research questions; and that the deans would expect this line of
questioning if they were considering the implementation of a program.

The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed by a professional transcription
service. The researcher compared the audio recordings to the transcriptions to ensure accuracy.
The in-depth interviews were conducted face-to-face or via telephone. Meeting face-to-face was
not always possible due to conflicting schedules and expenses related to long-distance travel to
77

colleges and universities across the state. Telephone interviews were an alternative to the face-toface interviews. A total of five interviews were conducted face-to-face, and five were conducted
via the phone. The transcripts of the in-depth interviews were coded A through J to correspond
with the letters assigned to each dean and the researcher only had the key that identified the dean
with his/her in-depth interviews to ensure the confidentiality of the participants.
Steps were taken to ensure that rapport was built between the researcher and the
interviewees and to help the interviewees understand that there were no right or wrong answers,
and that it was perfectly acceptable if they did not have a SP&MP at their libraries. The steps
followed the suggestions of Ryan and Dundon (2008) about building rapport with interviewees
when conducting qualitative research. In stage one, opening the interview, Ryan and Dundon
(2008) suggests clarifying and selling the research project, explaining to the interviewees why
their tacit knowledge is important to the research, and suggesting ways the research outcomes
may be of use or interest them and their organization (p. 446). During stage two, establishing
empathy, Ryan and Dundon (2008) suggests searching for common ground between the
interviewees and the researcher. “The endeavor at this stage is to provide further rationale for the
research topic and ensure the researchers’ agenda is appreciated and understanding of the
researchers’ needs is improved” (Ryan & Dundon, 1997, p. 447). Throughout stage three,
embedding rapport, Ryan and Dundon (2008) suggests that the researcher build on any
developing bonds with the interviewee to “to get both parties to reconcile themselves to the
research agenda” (p.447). During the next to the final stage, stage four – embedding rapport,
Ryan and Dundon (2008) suggests “the quality of the data was now evidently a primary concern
to the interviewees, signaling the strengthening of researcher-respondent relationship” and they
cautioned against over familiarization (p.447). In the final stage, closing the interview, Ryan and

78

Dundon (2008) stated “researcher-respondent discourse continued to furnish additional fruitful
information and helped gain access to other potential informants for follow-up interviewing” (p.
448).
Data collected from the ten in-depth interview questions were analyzed and sorted into
two major categories to present findings for the research questions about (a) the driving forces
for and (b), the restraining forces against the implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries.
The categories in the codebook emerged from the words, themes, and ideas expressed by the
deans during the in-depth interviews. The codebooks contain categories, additional words or
phrases, and frequencies (see Table 3). This data collection method was chosen to code the data
from the transcribed in-depth interviews because it allows for data to be organized and presented
in a logical manner from which the researcher can present findings and draw conclusions.

Once the data were collected and analyzed, the next steps included stating how the
research questions were answered using the research design. According to White and Marsh
(2006) stating how research questions were addressed by the study include: (a) summarizing and
restating findings in context with the research questions, (b) identifying and articulating patterns
among findings; and (c), relating more involved findings to further research (p. 33).

Reliability and Validity
The results of this study are true and they are likely to apply to other academic library
settings in other state colleges and universities. The researcher cautions that the results should
not be generalized to the population as a whole because the sample size is limited and represents
only twenty-five percent of the population of academic library deans in state universities and
colleges in one of fifty states in the United States. Readers are invited to consider the
transferability of the results of this study to their experiences on SP&MP implementation at their
academic libraries. According to Schofield (2002),
The goal [of qualitative research] is not to produce a standardized set of results that any
other careful researcher in the same situation or studying the same issue would have
produced. Rather it is to produce a coherent and illuminating description of and
perspective of a situation that is based on and consistent with the detailed study of that
situation. (p. 174)
The findings from this study can be suggestive of the types of factors that academic
library deans at other institutions may encounter as they set out to try to implement SP&MPs.
There are many, useful lesson to be learned from the results of this study. A section on practical

80

tips for succession planning implementation at academic libraries is included in the summary and
conclusions chapter of this study.
Slavin (1992) stated the concepts of reliability and validity were “of critical importance
in understanding issues of measurement in social science research” (p. 75). Reliability is the
degree to which the same results are obtained using the same measures. The researcher used the
MLQ 5x self-rating form in this study. Any researcher using that same instrument should also be
able to describe the leadership styles of survey respondents (as more transformational,
transactional, or passive/avoidant behavior than…) because that is what the instrument is
designed to measure. The researcher asked each of the deans the same set of questions in the
same manner. The internal consistency and reliability of the instrument were estimated by how
well the same constructs provided the same or similar results. For example, were time and
money often listed as restraining forces against the implementation of SP&MPs across responses
by the different deans?
Slavin (1992) also stated, “a measure's validity refers to the degree to which it actually
measures the concept it is supposed to measure” (p. 78). The research questions in this study
asked what driving forces and restraining forces affect library deans’ decisions to implement
SP&MPs at their academic libraries. During the in-depth interviews, the researcher questioned
the deans of academic libraries on what they perceived to be the driving and restraining forces
for the implementation of a SP&MP at their academic library, without this line of questioning
there is no face validity because obviously, the in-depth interviews would not address the
research questions under study.
The operationalization of the constructs used in the study were validated against the
content as described in the field. The literature review chapter listed and provided definitions of

81

the constructs under study including, leadership, implementation of SP&MPs, driving forces for
change and restraining forces against change; and planned change theory as found in the Library
and Information Science and other fields. “Construct validity can be viewed as an overarching
term to assess the validity of the measurement procedure that is used to measure a
given construct” (Lund Research Ltd., first para).
It is important to reduce or eliminate researcher bias to increase validity and reliability in
social research. “Researcher bias tends to result from selective observation and selective
recording of information, and also from allowing one’s personal views and perspectives to affect
how the data are interpreted and how the research is conducted” (Johnson, 1997, p. 284).
Johnson suggested that researchers reflect on their potential biases.
The researcher took a series of steps, as recommended by Johnson (1997), to eliminate
and reduce bias in this study. The researcher sought participant feedback during the survey and
interview process, and the results of the MLQ 5x were discussed in detail with each dean during
the interviews and sent via email to the deans who were interviewed via phone. The transcripts
of the in-depth interviews were shared with the deans to review and correct as needed. This
critical step by the researcher served to increase the interpretive validity of the study.

Limitations of Research
There may have been a myriad of situational factors that affected the results of this study.
Some of these factors may include the environment in which the in-depth interviews were held
or even the time of day when the respondents completed the questionnaire. Factors such as these
more readily identifiable and could have affected the results of the study. Other situational
factors, such as the depth of knowledge of the participants on the subject matter, or the way in

82

which the participants chose to respond to the researcher, are harder to pinpoint and address.
Therefore, it is necessary to acknowledge at the onset of this study that there may have been
some situational factors that the researcher was not privy to, could not identify, and possibly
could not control that may have affected the results of this study.
According to Schutt (2009), “research always has some limitations and some flaws and our
findings are always subject to different interpretations” (p. 20). There are some limitations in this
study. The study design was constrained by the sample population that is limited to a group of
academic library deans in one state, so the researcher cannot generalize findings to the
population. Since the deans in this study all come from the same state, it is possible that there
may be some systematic bias regarding outside forces such as library operating budgets and
internal forces such as organizational culture that may introduce bias into the results.
Additionally, this study focused on the implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries;
it did not include public, school, or special libraries. So, it is possible that the perceptions of
leaders of other types of libraries may differ from these findings.

Ethical Considerations
Schutt (2009) identified six ethical issues that should be given particular attention to
when conducting research: voluntary participation, subject well-being, identity disclosure,
confidentiality, appropriate boundaries, and researcher safety. The researcher invited the
respondents to take part in the study and did not disclose their identity at any time before, during,
or after the study. Safeguarding the confidentiality of the respondents was of utmost importance.
“The obligation to protect the anonymity of research participants and to keep research data
confidential is all-inclusive” (Frankfort-Nachmias & Nachmias, 1992, p. 85).

83

The expectation was that the respondents would spend approximately 30 minutes filling
out the online surveys and approximately one and a half hours answering the interview
questions. Particular attention was paid to ensuring that unintended disclosure of identities did
not damage the reputations and feelings of the participants. The researcher listened to and was
sensitive to the remarks made by the respondents.
Research standards require that all potential respondents give their informed consent
before participating and that the purpose of research is fully disclosed. The researcher made
every effort to expunge any identifying material from all published information. Five of the indepth interviews were held in the offices of the deans at the academic libraries where they work
during regular work hours. Five telephone interviews were conducted during regular work hours.
The offices of the deans and researcher provided a safe environment for the interviewee and the
researcher.

Summary
If the goal of research is to produce knowledge, then researchers should be asking
themselves: How will the knowledge resulting from this study be used? As described in this
chapter, the goal of this research is to understand the factors that affect the implementation of
SP&MPs in academic libraries as a means to address the lack of planning for and development of
current academic librarians to fill future leadership roles at their academic libraries through the
implementation of SP&MPs.
This chapter outlined and justified the mixed-method sequential explanatory research
method used in this study. The first phase of the study employed online surveys using the MLQ
5x self-rating standardized scale and the data collected were analyzed in a quantitative manner.

84

The MLQ 5x data collection and analysis served to identify the leadership styles of the library
deans. The analysis intended to find if any leadership style was more likely than another to
contribute to the implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries. The second phase consisted
of in-depth interviews designed to understand and seek explanations about the driving forces for
planned change and restraining forces against planned change in the form of a SP&MP at an
academic library. The data collected were analyzed in a qualitative manner. Both data gathering
instruments were explicated in this chapter.
The MLQ 5x self-rating standardized scale was administered the deans of academic
libraries in a state in the southeastern portion of the United States to determine if their leadership
styles are transformational, transactional, or passive/avoidant behavior. The quantitative data
collected from the survey was used to answer the first research question on how the leadership
styles of academic library deans affect their decisions to implement SP&MPs as a planned
change. In-depth interviews with the same library deans were conducted after the survey to gain
a better understanding and explanation of the deans’ perceptions towards the driving forces for
and the restraining forces against the implementation of SP&MPs. The qualitative data collected
from the in-depth interviews was used to answer the second and third research questions.
The data collection and analyses processes were detailed in the chapter. The data from
the online surveys were coded, analyzed, and the deans’ leadership styles were determined based
on their responses to the survey. The data from the in-depth interviews were transcribed, coded,
and analyzed. The standards of ethical research were discussed in the chapter as were the
limitations inherent in this research study.

CHAPTER 4
RESEARCH FINDINGS

The purpose of this chapter is to present findings from the analyses of the data collection.
The problem this research addressed is presenting succession planning and management
programs (SP&MPs) as a solution to address the gap in the planning for and development of
current academic librarians to fill future leadership roles within their libraries. This study
introduced SP&MPs as a solution to addressing that problem at all levels of the organization, not
just in the top leadership positions as is often misconceived. The study sought to provide
explanations about the factors the affect academic library deans’ decisions to implement these
programs at their libraries. These include: (a) to learn if certain leadership styles of academic
library deans affected their decisions to implement SP&MPs at their academic libraries; (b) to
identify the driving forces that influenced or might influence a library deans’ decision to
implement SP&MPs as a planned change at their academic library; (c) to identify the restraining
forces that impeded or might hinder a library dean’s decision to implement SP&MPs as a
planned change at their library; and (d) to explain the usefulness of Lewin’s change theory in
predicting the need to identify driving and restraining forces as necessary for better
understanding a planned change. This chapter presents the results of the data analyses of the
questionnaires and in-depth interviews designed to provide answers to these research questions.
The first section of the chapter presents the quantitative results of the research. The
Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) 5x standardized scale was taken by each dean to
self-identify their leadership style. Follow-up questions were then developed to explain the
results of the MLQ further 5x regarding how the deans’ leadership styles affected their decisions
to implement SP&MPs as a planned change at their libraries. The second and third sections of
86

the chapter present the qualitative results of the research. The in-depth interviews were used to
seek explanations about the forces that drove deans’ decisions to implement SP&MPs and forces
that restrained the implementation. The fourth section explains how Lewin’s planned change
theory provided a better understanding of the information needed before implementing a planned
program. The chapter ends with a summary of the research findings.

Research Question One
The first research question in the study was how do the leadership styles of academic
library deans affect their decisions to implement SP&MPs as a planned change? To answer this
question, the researcher invited the 40 deans and directors of academic libraries in a state’s
university and college system to participate in the study. The researcher provided the respondents
a link to access the MLQ 5x standardized scale along with login instructions in the email
invitations. The respondents received an initial invitation and follow-up invitations (reminders)
approximately two weeks after the initial invitations were sent to increase participation in the
survey. Of the 40 possible respondents, two dean/director positions were vacant; one interim
dean replied that due to changes in reporting structure at that institution’s library: “I do not think
I am suitable for participating in your survey.” From a population of 40 deans, two positions
were vacant, leaving 38 possible respondents. Of those 38 deans, ten participated in the study,
resulting in a 26.3% response rate.
The respondents completed the questionnaire online at the Mind Garden website where
their responses to the 45 questions in the survey were compiled. The raw data were accessible to
the researcher through the Mind Garden portal. The researcher reviewed and transferred the data
resulting from the 45 questions into individual spreadsheets, by respondents, so that they could

87

later be shared with the deans individually. The results of the individual questionnaires were
shared with the individual deans during the follow-up interviews.

Respondents’ Characteristics
The respondents represented a broad range of academic libraries in universities and
colleges. The student populations (head counts) served by the academic libraries range anywhere
from approximately 14,000 to over 60,000 students. The library employees range in number
from approximately 14 to 180 (includes part-time and full-time faculty, Academic &
Professional, and others). Some deans are responsible only for one library, while other deans are
responsible for up to 10 libraries. Some respondents work in rural communities with 50,000
people, and others work in urban settings with 850,000 people. Some respondents have been in
dean positions for over 20 years, while others have been deans for less than five years. The
respondents’ educational levels range from a minimum of a Master’s Degree in Library and
Information Science to doctoral degrees. Two respondents are males, and eight are females.
The respondents were assigned a letter from A to J (in alphabetical order) as they replied to
the survey; from that point forward, that assigned letter represented the dean, the survey results,
and the interview transcripts for that specific dean. Ten deans completed the questionnaire and
participated in the follow-up interview thus representing 26.3% of the population under study.

MLQ 5x Data Analyses
The 45 questions in the MLQ 5x are divided into the three leadership styles and three
outcomes of leadership. The transformational leadership characteristics fall into the “Five Is” or
characteristics of transformational leadership to calculate the results. Items (or questions) 10, 18,
21, and 25 were computed into idealized attributes; items 6, 14, 23, and 34 were computed into
88

idealized behavior; items 9, 13, 26, and 36 were computed to inspirational motivation; items 2,
8, 30, and 32 were computed into intellectual stimulation; and items 15, 19, 29, and 31 were
computed into individualized consideration. Transactional leadership characteristics were
divided into two items (or questions). Items 1, 11, 16, and 35 were computed into contingent
reward; and items 4, 22, 24, and 27 were computed into management by exception (active). The
results of passive/avoidant behavior characteristics were also divided into two: items 3, 12, 17,
and 20 were computed into management by exception (passive); and items 5, 7, 28, and 33 were
computed into laissez-faire. Finally, to calculate the results of the outcomes of leadership
characteristics, these were divided into three areas. The first was extra effort and items (or
questions) 39, 42, and 44 were computed into that outcome. The second was effectiveness and
was computed by items 37, 40, 43, and 45. The last outcome of leadership was generates
satisfaction, and it was computed by items 38 and 41.
The researcher shared the results of the MLQ 5x with the deans during the follow-up
interview. Before sharing the results, the deans were asked what they thought their leadership
styles were: transformational, transactional, passive/avoidant behavior or something else. Two
deans replied they were transformational; seven deans replied they were somewhere in the
middle and had characteristics of both transformational and transactional leadership, and one
dean replied she was transactional. One of the deans who identified as being both
transformational and transactional also stated that there were also some passive/avoidant
behaviors present. The two transformational deans’ emphatically stated they were not
passive/avoidant. Dean B stated, “…it kind of varied throughout my career…it depends a lot on
the organization, how it affects you.” Along that same thought process, Dean D said, “…in the
current setting there’s been a lot of challenges and a lot of dysfunction that I’ve had to deal with,

89

so I’m not sure if I’ve moved my decision-making style. I have adapted since I have been here.”
Moreover, Dean G stated, “I suspect that I may land somewhere on the border of transactional
and transformational. And which way I lean at any given moment is very circumstance
dependent.” Additionally, Dean H stated, “my leadership activity is transactional, but my intent
is transformational.”
Figure 5 presents the aggregate scores of the deans’ transformational leadership styles as
identified by the MLQ 5x self-rater form. The deans’ scores averaged 3.5; the lowest score was
3.3 in acts with integrity, and the highest was 3.6 in encourages others. Seven deans said they
were both transformational and transactional leaders. Two other deans said they were
transformational leaders and one dean self-identified as a transactional leader. The results of the
MLQ 5x show that nine of the ten deans have more of a transformational than a transactional
leadership style and that one dean was more transactional than transformational.

Figure 5. Summary of Deans’ Aggregate Scores for Transformational Leadership Styles.
*According to the research validated benchmark, the ideal frequency of all of the five
transformational behaviors should be a “fairly often” rating of 3 or greater (Mind Garden
Inc, 2016).

The deans’ aggregate scores for transformational leadership compared to the self-norm
are summarized below (see Figure 6). The normative data is composed of data from 3,375
leaders who had taken the MLQ 5x self-rater form nationally.

Figure 6. Dean’s Transformational Leadership Styles Compared with the Self-Norms.
The self-norms represent data from 3.375 self-ratings of leaders who previously completed
the MLQ 5x. The results of the respondents in this study are identified with one *, and the
results of the self-norm with **. (Mind Garden Inc, 2016).
During the in-depth interviews with the ten deans, the researcher shared the deans’ scores
from the MLQ 5x standardized scale and shared the data from the normative data. The researcher
showed each dean how they compared to the norm in each of the characteristics of the
transformational, transactions, and passive /avoidant sections of the MLQ 5x. Each dean was
provided with their written scores and their percents in comparison to the norm. The aggregate
scores of the deans’ transactional leadership styles are listed in Figure 7.

91

Figure 7. Summary of Deans’ Aggregate Scores for Transactional Leadership Styles.
*According to the research validated benchmark, the ideal frequency of CR should be
between “sometimes” and “fairly often” (2.0 – 3.0). **The ideal frequency MBEA should
be between “once in a while” and “sometimes” (1.0 – 2.0). (Mind Garden Inc, 2016).
The deans’ aggregate scores of their transactional leadership in comparison with the norm
are summarized in Figure 8. The self-norms represent data from 3,375 leaders who previously
completed the MLQ 5x self-rater form. The group as a whole was above the benchmark in
rewards achievement, and below the benchmark in monitors behaviors and mistakes. A dean
stated:
I've always been that person in the middle that holds onto the person whose vision is way
out there and drags the person whose very conservative through the process of change.
Not entirely transactional—you can't quite get to this transformational, but certainly
elements of both of those two. (Dean I)
Dean D stated: “I provide others with assistance in exchange for their efforts. I provide
people with assistance, but it's not an exchange. It's not so much if you do this, I'll do that.” The
ambivalence about using certain leadership styles under different circumstances, with

92

different people, may be reflected in the different results of the data compiled on
transformational leadership and transactional leadership style (see Figures 7 and 8).

Figure 8. Deans’ Transactional Leadership Styles Compared with the Self-Norms.
The respondents in this study are identified by an *, and the self-norms are represented
by two**. (Mind Garden Inc, 2016).

None of the deans selected passive/avoidant behavior as their primary leadership style,
although Dean I said she exercised some passive/avoidant behaviors but just to bring about
compromise:
I don’t really know much about those three particular descriptions. I mean, I’m sort of
guessing to come up with that. But I’ll tell you what for years I have described my
leadership style. I see little pieces of all of those. (Dean I)
The groups’ aggregate scores for fights fire were 0.9, and the aggregate scores for avoids
involvement were 0.4, they all scored within the self-norms (see Figures 9 and 10). When asked
to describe their leadership style, Dean B began by stating: “Well, it certainly wouldn’t be
passive/avoidant…” This style of leadership was dismissed immediately by that dean. Dean F
stated: “…that style is, whatever happens, happens.” Moreover, Dean D said: “I'm very sure that
I'm not passive/avoidant. I'm positive of that because I tend to be very direct.”

The data show that the library deans varied in their leadership outcomes (see Figures 11
and 12). The three areas measured were generates extra effort, is productive, and generates
satisfaction. The lowest score for generates extra effort was 2.0 and the highest score was 4.0.
The total scores of the deans for extra effort were 3.2 when compared to the self-norm at 2.8.
The data also show that their effectiveness (productivity) scores were the highest of all three
outcomes of leadership. The lowest score for effectiveness was 2.5, and the highest scores were
4.0. The total scores for deans’ productivity were 3.6 when compared to the self-norm at 3.1. The
final leadership outcome measured was generates satisfaction. The deans scored high as a group
in this category as well. The lowest scores for satisfaction were 3.0, and the highest scores were
4.0. The group’s score for generating satisfaction was 3.5 compared to the self-norm at 3.1.
Overall, the deans’ outcomes of leadership were higher than the norm. The mean for outcomes of
leadership is 3.0, and the deans scored a mean of 3.43. According to Bass and Avolio (1995), the
MLQ 5x “is not designed to encourage the labeling of a leader as transformational or
transactional…it is more appropriate to identify a leader or a group of leaders as (for example)
‘more transformational than the norm’ or ‘less transactional than the norm” (p. 120).

Findings on Deans’ Leadership Styles
The first question that guided the research process to address the lack of planning for and
development of current academic librarians to fill future leadership roles at their academic
libraries by implementing SP&MPS was how do the leadership styles of academic library deans
affect their decisions to implement SP&MPs as a planned change? The MLQ 5x was used as a
standardized instrument by the deans to measure their leadership styles. The data show the deans
were more transformational than transactional than the norm in their leadership styles by nine to
96

one. The ideal frequency of the five transformational behaviors or “Five Is” should be a rating of
3.0 to 4.0. according to the benchmark. The deans in the study scored between 2.6 and 4. The
ideal frequency for monitors deviations, a characteristic of transactional leadership, should be a
rating of 1.0 to 2.0 according to the benchmark. The deans in the study scored between 0.5 and
3.3. Under rewards achievement, another characteristic of transactional leadership, the deans
scored between 2.3 and 3.8, and the ideal frequency should be a rating between 2.0 and 3.0
according to the benchmark. The results of the MLQ 5x also show that the deans have very low
passive/avoidant behaviors. According to the benchmark, the ideal frequency of both
passive/avoidant behaviors should be between 0 and 1.0. The deans’ scores are between 0 and
1.7 for fights fires, and 0 and 4 for avoids involvement.
The answer to RQ1 is that based on the findings of this study, the leadership styles of the
academic library deans affect their decisions to implement SP&MPs as a planned change at their
libraries. According to the MLQ 5x results, nine of 10 deans are more transformational than the
norm. Of those nine deans, five said they have informal succession planning programs. So, the
majority of the deans in this study who have a more transformational leaderships style said they
have succession planning programs. The dean who was more transactional according to the
MLQ 5x results said she does not have a program. However, because the sample size was small
and the difference between those who stated that they have a program and those who stated that
they do not is only one dean, further studies are needed to conclude for certain that the leadership
styles of academic library deans make a difference in their decisions to implement SP&MPs. The
two deans who self-identified as transformational leaders said they had a SP&MP at their
libraries, yet neither programs were in writing as part of their library’s strategic plan, nor any
other planning document. The dean who self-identified as a transactional leader said she had not

97

implemented a program. Of the remaining deans who self-identified as in-between
transformational and transactional, four deans stated that they do not have a program, and three
deans stated that they do.
Deans’ responses varied when asked how their leadership style - as identified by the
MLQ 5x standardized scale - affected their decision to implement a SP&MP at their libraries.
Dean B responded “Now whether or how my style would influence that [succession planning
implementation], that’s an interesting question. I’ll have to think about that.” Other deans closer
to the end of their careers expressed concerns about their legacy, for example, Dean C stated:
I’ve evolved…you begin to realize the kinds of things that really do need your time and
attention as opposed to the things that you can delegate to someone else, as opposed to
the things that don’t really need much attention at all and maybe are better ignored. And,
the further along I get in my career, the more I realize that delegation, giving other people
opportunities to step up when it comes to decision-making, when it comes to representing
our libraries in important meetings, when it comes to being out there on campus and
interacting with campus administration and faculty, and all those kinds of things that
deans tend to do, that giving other people the opportunities to do that is an important
aspect of letting them start to develop their own leadership potential, give them a
perspective on what it means to be a leader.
Other deans gave more concrete examples of actions they have taken at their libraries as
proof of their transformational leadership style. Dean D gave a specific example:
Part of our succession planning here was to create opportunities for our faculty to get
experience supervising other faculty, …which was part of reorganizing the departments. I
will say that was not a popular change… for some people that was hard, but ... that part of

98

my transformational leadership. I just want to help people grow and develop, but it's also a
part of thinking about how the organization can become better, can perhaps achieve more
by having people who have grown and developed.
As a group, all the deans expressed a commitment to help their faculty and librarians
develop and prepare for leadership roles. Dean H summarized this sentiment by stating:
In working with staff and faculty, I look for many ways to interact with them on projects,
as well as in meetings and training situations, to see if I can identify the strengths and
characteristics of individuals and try to build those through special assignments as a team
leader, or project leader.
The deans were asked if they had a SP&MP, as defined during the interview process, at
their libraries Deans A, B, E, G, and J stated they did not have a succession plan; The other five
deans stated they did, Deans C, D, F, H and I further stated their plan was not a “formal
program.” Dean F stated the program was not written in a policy book. Dean C stated, “It has not
been high on my priority list …my succession plan has evolved over time, and it’s been a fairly
organic thing.”

Research Question Two
The second research question in the study was: What are the driving forces that affect
library deans’ decisions to implement SP&MPs at academic libraries? To answer this question,
the researcher asked the deans the following questions (a) What do you (in your role as the dean
of the library) perceive to be the driving forces for the implementation of a SP&MP as a planned
change at this library? (b) Which of these are most important and why? (c) What others do you
see as critical and why? The researcher defined the term “driving forces” as defined by Lewin

99

(1947) to clarify the intent of the question and to provide all of the interviewees with the same
definition. The audio-recorded interviews were transcribed to make it easier for the researcher to
code the data. The deans were provided copies of their transcribed interviews to review and
comment on; five deans only replied and of those five, three identified minor changes. The codes
are data-driven as they were created after a thorough review of the deans’ answers. According to
Decuir-Gunby, Marshall, and McCulloch (2011), “a codebook is a set of codes, definitions, and
examples used as a guide to help analyze interview data (p. 138).

Data Analyses and Codebook of Driving Forces
The categories in the codebook emerged from the words, themes, and ideas expressed by
the deans during the in-depth interviews. The codebook contains categories, additional
words/phrases, and frequencies (by deans) on the driving for the implementation of SP&MPs
(see Table 5). The codebook below shows the data in an organized and concise manner.

Findings from the In-depth Interviews
The respondents expressed a broad range of driving forces for the implementation of
SP&MPs at academic libraries. The ten deans articulated what they considered to be driving
forces for their current informal programs or future programs (if these were to be implemented)
at their libraries. The researcher engaged in the process of coding data to make sense of the
interviews. “A codebook is a set of codes, definitions, and examples used as a guide to help
analyze interview data. Codebooks are essential to analyzing qualitative research because they
provide a formalized operationalization of the codes” (Decuir-Gunby, Marshall, & McCulloch,
101

2011, p. 138). The driving forces identified by the respondents were grouped into major themes.
The first major theme that emerged from the interviews was constant change which was further
coded into two subthemes: (a) planned and unplanned change, and (b) internal (academic library)
and external change (institution and national). The second major theme was library staff in key
positions and includes both professional librarians as well as library assistants (without the
Masters in Library and Information Science). Library staff was coded into three subthemes: (a)
training to provide opportunities for advancement, (b) retaining qualified staff, and (c), dealing
with pending retirements. The third major theme that emerged was the deans’ perceptions and
beliefs, (a) their perceptions about the future of their libraries, and (b), their beliefs about the
purpose of the profession. And the fourth theme that emerged was the budget. The themes are
further explained in the following paragraphs and examples of the deans’ comments extracted
from the interviews are included to serve as examples and better explicate the emergent themes.
Planned and unplanned change. Deans H and I discussed performance funding as a
combination of both planned and unplanned change during the interviews. The Board of
Governors funds colleges and universities in the state system in a manner that has forced
academic libraries to be more accountable to their parent institutions in terms of how they
support student retention and success. Performance metrics determine funds allocated to
institutions from year to year, so uncertainty about next year’s budget makes planning more
challenging for the library deans, particularly in planning for filling vacant positions and allotting
monies for professional development. Dean H noted,
I think the driving forces are all the changes that are happening in higher education in
terms of the way we are funded, the way we are evaluated by the Board using

102

performance metrics, and that’s a national trend…it’s not just here in our state, there are a
lot of changes happening at the institution. (Dean H)
Dean A reflected on change since his tenure at the college and said that a lot of historical things
were going on there and that the changes that were going on were pretty much reactionary. “So,
the change will happen, it was not planned; we were just trying to keep the doors open and not
really planning” (Dean A).
Internal and external change. Five deans identified changes that were internal to their
libraries, such as organizational structure changes; and changes that were external to their
libraries, at their institutions or at the national level, that were driving forces for the
implementation of SP&MPs. An internal change that drives succession planning is new
leadership. Dean D mentioned that after completing an environmental scan within a few months
of her arrival at the library, she realized that something needed to be done about staffing for the
future. Dean D stated, “I became the new driving force.”
Dean A emphatically stated, “…number one, identify that change is going to happen
whether you like it or not. So, you might as well plan for it and get your ducks in a row so that
when that does come it is going to be as smooth as it can be.” Dean G reflected upon a campuswide policy that may affect how they promote and select new hires at the library.
We are potentially looking at the state campus-wide policy. And a component of that is
not just that the policy would strongly lean towards internal candidates for management
or leadership positions. But it also would presume that department head employment
would be term limited. So, to me that would be a huge driver for any succession planning
if you are working in an environment where you would be looking for new leadership
candidates every three to five years. I think if this moves forward on the campus, I think

103

it is going to hopefully cause us to look at our internal departmental activities and
structures in a somewhat different way. (Dean G)
Dean J mentioned how national technological advances force changes in the work
patterns and in the skills of library staff whose job it is to support and help students using the
libraries. This externally driven change has made on impact on the types of people hired to work
at that library:
The use of technology by our patrons. The new ways that our patrons are using the
technology. I see it as a way that's driving a change that we're making in how we decide
who to hire. …I think that's one of our major driving forces… I'm forced to change into
more and more electronic resources and less physical resources. And that's not just a we
need a new kind of thinking about the way we're doing it. It changes more than that. It
changes the way we teach our students. It changes the way our students interact with us,
and that sort of thing. And so, that to me is one of the major forces driving how we're
deciding who succeeds who. (Dean J)
Training to provide opportunities for advancement. Six deans talked about the
importance of training staff and providing staff the opportunities to expand their skill sets. Five
deans specifically mentioned sending key library leaders to national and state training such as the
Harvard Leadership Institute for Academic Librarians or the State Library Leadership Institute,
to encourage them to remain at their current libraries.
I must also say, though, that we do think about the future somewhat and that we do want
people to give people opportunities to learn if they’re interested. So, while there’s not a
program, I think it’s important to look at the people that you think are going to be the
movers and shakers in the future and where you can, provide opportunities for them. I

104

think it’s very important to encourage people if they want to stay in their field, to do what
they can do. (Dean B)
Retaining qualified library staff. Four deans mentioned they want to retain their skilled
staff in key positions and that SP&MPs can help drive that retention. Dean F, for example, noted,
“the longer we keep a good member who has the same goal as the college/library, the better it is
for both sides and that can be translated into driving force [for succession planning].”
Dealing with pending retirements. Five deans expressed concern about the effects of
retirements on current library staff and library operations. A dean also mentioned that changes in
job responsibilities in terms of how libraries operate today compared to 20 years ago has affected
how they fill key roles. The following dean’s comments demonstrate how they are dealing with
pending retirements at their libraries and why retirements serve as a driving force for SP&MPs.
As a recent example, we have known of a couple of upcoming retirements, and so we
have tried to begin thinking well in advance of those retirements with what we want to
happen with that position… [we have] a very long-time staff member who has worked in
our materials unit. And as the number of materials has dwindled and dwindled, he has
taken on some additional new areas of responsibility in working with our digital
collection center in capturing more digital publications, things that we subscribe to in a
formal way. But there are publications at the university that we used to receive in print
form regularly, and now they are just online. He has taken on some responsibilities in
that area. But even though his retirement month is a little off, we are already talking
about what we will be looking for in that replacement position. (Dean G)
Dean E reflected on the impact of pending retirements and not having an adequate
organizational structure to identify key positions for replacement.

105

I have three key full-time people who will be leaving. I cross my fingers and say in three
years. Again, that could change on a whim… If I had other librarians, I would definitely
be grooming them for taking over. In fact, I only have one of the new librarians who will
be groomed to take over one of the campus libraries. (Dean E)
Dean J does not have a SP&MP. Therefore, the driving force for implementing a program
at that library is need.
I would say that the strongest factor for us is probably just need. The fact that at some
point some of the people that have been here for a very long time are planning to retire.
Some of them have already announced some timeframes. That includes one to two people
that are part of the leadership team. At those points, we will be forced to deal with some
type of succession plan. (Dean J)
Deans’ values and concerns towards the future of their libraries. Six deans expressed
concerns about how their decisions related to succession planning now will impact their libraries
in the future. Dean A said, “I think another element of this is, and we kind of go back to the
transformational leadership style, …it is just a morally right thing to do, to be prepared, to have
people - so that if I kick the bucket tomorrow - things will go on.” The deans also talked about
the impact their decisions had made on their libraries and how they hoped that incoming leaders
would continue their legacy. A driving force for implementing SP&MPs is grooming or
preparing key people to carry on with the values of the institution.
I can safely say that the library has become much more service-oriented, it’s become
much more innovative, it’s become much more efficient and effective, and a much better
place to work. For me, personally, continuing that legacy is important. If I were to leave,
I would certainly want the leadership, be it top or senior leadership level, to be in the

106

hands of people who believed in those values and would continue it forward. That’s
partly a self-serving, …an emotional need for me to see my legacy continued. But also,
because the library is now recognized as a vital part of what’s going on academically at
this university, where before it was an afterthought at best. (Dean C)
Dean I expressed concerns about having to make difficult decisions about what work to
do and what work to let go, in order to do the most important thing in her mind - lay the
groundwork for the future.
But it is the interaction with our students and faculty that is our prime mission. …just
because a person was doing a very important job and we relied on them heavily didn't
mean that when we replaced them, we were going to replace them with the same kind of
person doing exactly the same thing. This was an opportunity to make some changes in
the way we operate, and we were going to do it even if that meant there would be things
that would not work for a while. So basically, we said, we're going to have to let some
things suffer, some things that might be considered standard library operating procedures.
But we were going to make sure that we were laying the right groundwork for transition,
and for our future. (Dean I)
Deans’ beliefs towards the purpose of the profession. All the deans spoke at length
about their commitment to the profession and wanting to do more and be better. Deans’ belief in
what they do serve as a driving force for them to want to implement SP&MPs.
Library work is ever evolving and complex and so for the success of the university and
for the success of the library going forward, it needs to build in some capacity for growth,
and change; and envisioning new kinds of services, processes, expertise, and new ways
that we in the library can support the academic enterprise. All of those are good reasons

107

for building in that capacity of individuals because I think it is individuals who bring that
quality to bear in the library and in the university community more broadly. (Dean H)
Budget. Four deans identified budget as a driving force for the implementation of
SP&MPs at their libraries. Dean I stated that the succession planning program was tied to a
budgetary plan rather than a strategic plan because the president of the institution directed that
the library staff be decreased without firing people. Many staff were eligible to retire, so the dean
began cross-training people to ensure that work knowledge was spread out before people retired.
Dean I further explained how the budget of the institution served as a driving force for the
implementation of a succession plan at the library by stating:
When someone left, if we replaced them, we were replacing them at a cheaper cost. And
not just because they didn't have enough experience, not just that kind of a cost. And
where two people were leaving close together, where could we combine their jobs and
hire maybe even at a higher level, but only one person—not two. So, that's the kind of
thing that I was facing looking forward. And so as far as the college is concerned, it
became a budget-based operation. I was finding ways to take positions that were leaving
and costing the college less long-term. And then, internally we were trying to figure out
how to shift responsibilities and how to combine the jobs. And since then, every year in
our budget process we have been implementing changes in how we rehire for anyone that
leaves. (Dean I)

Research Question Three
The third research question in the study was: What are the restraining forces that affect
library deans’ decisions to implement SP&MPs at academic libraries? To answer this question,

108

the researcher conducted in-depth interviews with the ten deans and asked them the following
questions specifically about restraining forces: (a) What do you (in your role as the dean of
library) perceive to be the restraining forces against the implementation of a SP&MP as a
planned change at this library? (b) Which of these are most important and why? And (c) What
others do you see as critical and why? The researcher provided the interviewees the description
of “restraining forces” as defined by Lewin (1947) to clarify the intent of the question and to
provide all of the interviewees with the same definition.

Data Analyses and Codebook of Restraining Forces
The categories in this codebook also emerged from the words, themes, and ideas
expressed by the deans as restraining forces during the in-depth interviews (see Table 6). The
codebook was chosen to code the data from the transcribed in-depth interviews because the data
can be organized and presented in a clearer and more concise manner from which the researcher
can draw conclusions.

Findings from the In-depth Interviews
The respondents expressed a broad range of diverse perspectives on restraining forces
against the implementation of SP&MPs in their informal programs or when considering the
implementation of such programs at their academic libraries. The restraining forces identified by
the respondents can be grouped into two major themes; too little and too much. The deans listed
not enough budgets, insufficient staffing, lack of time, and not enough interest in the programs as
restraining forces. Equally, the deans listed too much time, too much change, too many
institutional politics, and too embedded an organizational culture as additional restraining forces.
Not enough budget. Dean A succinctly described that the result of insufficient
budget/funds influenced his decision not to implement a program at that library. “If you do not
have the money, you do not have necessarily the staff, you do not have the travel time, you do
not have the budget for training, all of those things take resources to be able to do.” Dean A’s
point was that to send staff to conferences and training costs money, and there has to be
110

sufficient staff left behind at the library so that work can be completed while others are being
trained. Even when additional training opportunities are offered at the home institutions, these
may be in the form of stretch assignments that require that staff take on additional duties. When
asked about restraining forces at her library, Dean G answered:
It is kind of the quick cop-out answer, but money. As we have seen the activities and
requirements of librarian positions generally undergo such continuous change, continuous
new knowledge and skill development, we often do not have the financial resources to I
think adequately compensate people for the additional responsibilities they are assuming.
(Dean G)
Insufficient staffing. Dean A concisely describes the problem of insufficient staffing. “If
we do not have a sufficient staffing, then all your time is just spent just keeping the doors open,
and you do not really have the ability to send somebody to a program or training” (Dean A).
Lack of time to implement a program and too much time to get buy-in. When asked
about restraining forces against the implementation of SP&MPs, Dean J stated, “I think there are
a lot of factors. I think one of those factors is, of course, time and energy being directed at other
projects that are perceived to be of higher priority projects.” Dean D explained that it could take
time to bring higher-level administrators to understand and agree with what the dean is trying to
accomplish in terms of staff changes. While the dean is ready to move ahead, the higher-level
administrator needs more time to make a decision.
I was not able to sufficiently help my boss understand the importance of certain changes
that he didn't think we should undertake or that he wanted to take slower. I think it was
the difference between the person who wants to rip the Band-Aid off, and the person who
wants to slowly peel it off. My boss wanted to slowly peel it off, and I wanted to rip the

111

Band-Aid off and then help everybody heal. It's a difference of approach. I'm not saying
one's right or wrong. So, the restraining force was perhaps in many ways, how fast we
could accomplish something. (Dean D)
No interest implementing the program. Dean J explained she had not implemented a
program because: “Well, I would say that it has probably been a case of sort of benign neglect
with respect to the fact that before I came, …the director of the library at the time stayed here for
a total of 20 years.” Another dean commented:
I think in general the theory of a program is excellent. A formal program though, while it
might sound good in theory, I think in practice it is probably at least at this institution, not
really realistic. I have worked at the colleges and university level (public and private),
and I am going to say from all my experience at least at the college level I would not
recommend it. Maybe at the university level because there is generally a broader range of
staff, a little bit more continuity in general, and a little bit more political stability. But at
the college level and probably even at smaller universities I just do not see that is really a
realistic option. I still think that having your staff prepared for whatever, just in case the
contract does not get renewed or whatever - have your resume up and going, have all
your papers written, and just be prepared for the profession and not for the institution.
(Dean A)
Too much change. Dean I referred to the rapid rate of retirements and losing those
vacated positions due to budget cuts and politics at the institutional level. The rapid rate of
organizational change forced her to focus on work requirements, increase job rotations, and use
action learning to cope with change.

112

You know that change is going to happen, and in a normal organization change does
happen, but it can happen so long and so consistent that you break a lot of the social and
structural elements up to such a fine [point]; they are just literally so broken apart that
you have a really hard time coming back together so that you can get organized and get
things going. If you have so much change over a period of time people just lose sight of
the connections, of the impacts from one area to another, and that is critical. (Dean A)
Organizational culture and unrealistic expectations. One dean only mentioned the
impact of the organizational culture as a restraining force. Yet three deans mentioned that they
did not want to create unrealistic expectations with staff about the possibility of being promoted
as a result of a SP&MPs and then something happens to prevent the promotion.
Certainly, the fact that the current structure has been in place for so long is sort of
perceived as very rigid and very difficult to change. All of those factors sort of work
together to help us maintain the status quo. It makes it easier to postpone dealing with
this issue of succession planning as opposed to something that we are able to really work
on in a structured way. (Dean J)
Institutional politics and policies. Dean I stated lack of funding, and then further
clarified:
Actually, not really so much money as convincing administrators, who have never
considered the kinds of issues that are involved in library operations, that [succession
planning] really will in the end save them money. So, one of the restraining forces is that
I have to not only figure out the efficiency of this, but then I also have to package it in a
‘Look, you save this much money this year, and this money next year, and this much
money the next year.’ To me that's very restraining, because I should just be able to

113

explain why moving along in this way is the right way to make this transition. But I also
have to do this bookkeeping sort of piece. (Dean I)
The researcher was interested in exploring other factors that may affect the
implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries. Since academic libraries are associated with
and operate within the oversight of their parent institutions, the deans were asked the following
questions: Are there any situational factors at this university that may affect the implementation
of SP&MPs at this library? By situational factors, I am referring to university politics, realities,
contexts, and other issues that may affect your decision. Four deans said they did not think there
were any situational factors. Listed below are major theme that emerged from the combined
replies from the six deans who responded affirmatively to this question.
Budget cuts have resulted in lost positions. Dean I stated that when staff retire, those
positions are eliminated instead of becoming opportunities to promote, increase salaries, and
develop people in new positions.
The Office of the President of the institution. Dean I said that it takes the dean time to
develop a relationship with the president and to educate the president about how the library
operates and its needs in terms of budget and staffing. Dean C said that the president highly
values the importance of staffing and does not lay off people during budget cuts. Dean B stated
that one of the president’s goals is to create a diverse workforce, “we would have to look and see
how that would work out because obviously, we’re training somebody who may or may not be in
one of the chosen areas that they’re looking at trying to have more people….”
We’ve had the same president for years… It’s been very stable; I enjoy a positive
working relationship with him and with the provost…They’ve been a very good team for
the university in my opinion and they certainly have been supporters of the development

114

of library services and library collections. The big change that’s coming for us is that our
president has announced his retirement… Will this person be an accomplished researcher
who has grown up in higher education the way our president did …or will it be an out of
work legislator who thinks everything you need to know can be found with a Google
search? That can be a real difference in the way that the library is perceived and
supported by university administration and so whoever succeeds me will have to continue
that process of being present at the table when decisions are being made and open others
to understand what the library does in terms that make sense to them, whether them is an
administrator, politician, board member. (Dean H)
Variance in compensation for staff taking on additional responsibilities. Different
units on campus compensate faculty, who assume additional assignments, at a higher rate than
the library. The example given was how the College of Business offers courses at the market rate
that then generates a significant part of its expenditure through those student credit hours. Since
the library does not teach courses, it does not generate those student credit hours and cannot
afford to pay its faculty the same rate as other units on campus.

Research Question Four
The final research question was how useful was Lewin’s planned change theory in
predicting the need to identify driving and restraining forces as necessary for better
understanding a planned change? The literature review chapter explains Lewin’s theory in detail.
A brief description of Kurt Lewin’s (1947) planned change theory as it relates only to driving
and restraining forces, is included here. Lewin’s theory represents social forces in group settings
to help understand the desire for and resistance to a specific change. Lewin (1947) argued that
certain social driving forces increase or drive change and these driving forces can act either both
115

towards or away from something; while restraining forces oppose driving forces. Lewin (1947)
said we should ask the following questions to understand change: “(1) why does the process
under the current circumstances proceed on this particular level? And, (2) what are the
conditions for changing the present circumstances?” (p. 15). Lewin defined planned change as
transplanting the quasi-state of equilibrium from one level at the beginning of the change to
another level at the end of the change. Burns (2004) stated that Lewin posed two questions
concerning group change: “(a) what is it about the nature and characteristics of a particular group
that causes it to respond (behave) as it does to the forces that impinge on it? And, (b) how can
these forces be changed in order to elicit a more desirable form of behavior?” (p. 982). In order
to bring about a planned change, such as the implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries,
library deans should first understand the driving forces or current circumstances that have
permitted these programs to proceed as they have, and also the restraining forces or conditions
that have impeded the programs. Deans can implement programs to elicit desirable change once
they have a better understanding of the driving and restraining forces for and against the planned
change. Lewin’s planned change theory was useful in predicting the need to identify driving and
restraining forces to understand planned change better because it created awareness among deans
that these forces exist, it clearly identified the forces, and it gives deans a better understanding of
what they may encounter when they proceed with the change.
Researchers and academic library deans can use the data compiled from this unique study
to make a convincing case for and to explain to university administrators and library staff why
the change is needed. The study of driving forces also helps to explicate the benefits of the
program, for example, the implementation of SP&MPs as a planned change helps to ensure the
continuity of qualified people in key leadership roles; it encourages professional development

116

and advancement, and it guarantees the stability of the organization over time. The driving forces
for the implementation of SP&MPs can be linked to the organizational goals and provide
strategies for mitigating the impact of personnel changes on the organizations; these can include
training, retaining qualified staff, and managing vacancies.
Deans D and I stated that we should be having conversations about succession planning
at the state level. Dean E mentioned that this issue should be brought to other deans and a strong
institution driving the program could serve as a model for other libraries in the state to emulate.
As stated in the literature review chapter, according to Lewin’s (1947) theory, the higher
the social value the individual places on the group, the higher the resistance of the individual to
move away from that level. Lewin (1947) stated, “that it is usually easier to change individuals
formed into a group than to change any one of them separately (p. 32). Lewin (1947) stated that
before a planned change occurs in an organization, the managers or persons responsible for
implementing the planned change should be aware of the forces that may drive the change or
restrain it. The understanding of those forces will help the organization’s leaders as they unfreeze
the current status quo by correctly diagnosing the problem, moving towards the needed or
desired change, and refreezing the change at the new, preferred level.
Researchers and academic library deans can use the restraining forces identified by this
study to solve problematic issues and practices at the library and the institutional level, rather
than the individual level. The study of restraining forces against the implementation of SP&MPs
at academic libraries presents data that can be used by researchers and academic library leaders
to identify barriers and to think in advance of possible solutions to the problems. The restraining
forces identified include securing funds, staffing, and time to implement a program. While these
restraints are challenging to respond to, they are all surmountable. Other restraining forces

117

identified by the academic library deans include difficulties in managing too much organizational
change, institutional politics and policies about hiring and filling vacancies; and too much time
for top institution administrators to make decisions that affect libraries. The other restraining
force was managing the current organizational culture. Lewin’s planned change theory includes
three steps for implementing planned change that could be useful to academic library deans as
they try to influence the culture; first by unfreezing beliefs, moving towards new behaviors, and
refreezing the new culture - that includes SP&MPs - at the desired level. As Dean I concluded:
In the library world, we talk a lot about the people who are retiring and changes. But I
haven't heard much discussion about a good succession plan, and so I was happy to read
what you were working on. And I'm afraid that we've already missed some of the
opportunities… (Dean I)

Summary
The chapter began by listing the purpose of the research which includes four specific
areas: (a) to learn if certain leadership styles of academic library deans affected their decisions to
implement SP&MPs at their academic libraries; (b) to identify the driving forces that influenced
or might influence a library deans’ decision to implement SP&MPs as a planned change at their
academic library; (c) to identify the restraining forces that impeded or might impede a library
dean’s decision to implement SP&MPs as a planned change at their library; and (d) to explain
the usefulness of Lewin’s change theory in predicting the need to identify driving and restraining
forces. The profiles of the study participants were provided in detail.
The findings from the analysis of the MLQ 5x self-rater form demonstrate that the
leadership styles of the academic library deans affect their decisions to implement SP&MPs as a

118

planned change at their libraries. According to the results of the MLQ 5x, nine of the ten
respondents were more transformational than transactional. According to the deans; two said
they were transformational leaders; seven said they were somewhere in the middle of
transformational and transactional leaders, and one was a transactional leader. The two deans
who self-identified as transformational leaders stated that they had a SP&MP at their libraries,
yet neither of the programs were in writing nor any library’s planning documents. The dean who
self-identified as a transactional leader, does not have program. Of the remaining seven deans,
four said they do not have a program, and three stated that they have informal programs.
However, because the sample size was small and the difference between those who stated that
they have a program and those who said they do not is only one, further studies are needed to
conclude for certain that the leadership styles of academic library deans make a difference in
their decisions to implement SP&MPs.
The findings from the analysis of the in-depth interviews about driving forces for the
implementation of the informal SP&MPs at academic libraries demonstrate a wide array of
forces in the informal programs implemented or in consideration of the expansion of such
programs at their academic libraries. The driving forces were grouped into major themes. The
first theme that emerged from the interviews was constant change and included planned and
unplanned change; and internal (academic library) and external change (institution and national).
The second theme was library staff in key positions and includes both professional librarians as
well as library assistants. Driving forces for library staff include training to provide opportunities
for advancement, retaining qualified staff, and dealing with pending retirements. Another theme
that emerged was the deans’ perceptions about the future of their libraries and their beliefs about
the purpose of the profession. The final theme was the budget.

119

The findings from the analysis of the in-depth interviews about restraining forces against
the implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries demonstrate a broad range of diverse
perspectives in the informal programs implemented or in consideration of the expansion of such
programs at their academic libraries. The restraining forces identified by the respondents were
grouped into two major themes. The deans listed not enough budgets, insufficient staffing, lack
of time, and not enough interest in the programs as restraining forces. Similarly, the deans listed
too much time, too much change, institutional politics, and organizational culture as additional
restraining forces.
Lewin’s planned change theory was useful in predicting the need to identify driving and
restraining forces to understand planned change better because it allows academic library deans
to recognize those forces and be prepared. Researchers and academic library deans can use the
data compiled from this unique study to make a convincing case for and explain to university
administrators and library staff why the change is needed. The study of driving forces also helps
to explicate the benefits of the program. The identification of restraining forces can be used to
solve problematic issues and practices at the library and the institutional level. As Lewin
predicted, some forces such as change, budget, time and the deans, served simultaneously as a
driving force for the planned change and as a restraining force against the planned change.
This chapter presented the results of the data analyses of the questionnaires and in-depth
interviews designed to provide answers to these research questions. The following chapter
includes an interpretation of these findings.

CHAPTER 5
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The final chapter of this dissertation presents the interpretations and implications of the
findings from the analyses of the transcripts of the in-depth interviews and the Multifactor
Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) 5x standardized scale. This chapter begins with a summary of
the problem addressed by the study, restates the four research questions, reintroduces the
theoretical framework, and summarizes findings. This chapter also includes the researcher’s
interpretations of the findings that focus on a comparison of the findings with data in the
literature and the implications of the study from empirical and theoretical perspectives. The
limitations that affect the study are also included in this chapter. The chapter concludes with
recommendations for future research about succession planning and management program
(SP&MP) implementation at academic libraries and with recommendations for how the theory
can be further applied in additional studies.

Summary of Study and Findings
The motivation to conduct this study originated from observations of woefully illprepared library staff to fill key leadership positions at their institutions and concerns about the
future direction of the profession. The lack of implementation of SP&MPs led the researcher to
question why these programs were not widely implemented at academic libraries and what
factors may be contributing to or discouraging deans’ decisions to apply these programs. A study
of 34 Association of Research Libraries found that there are few instances of application of
formal SP&MPs at academic libraries. Yet when asked, 88 percent of the respondents said their

121

program was either somewhat established or not very well established (Galbraith, Smith, &
Walker, 2011, p. 226). This study’s findings support the trend discussed in the literature.
The purpose of this study is to identify and explain the factors that affect the
implementation of SP&MPs in academic libraries as a means to address the lack of planning for
and development of current academic librarians to fill future leadership roles at their academic
libraries through the provision of these programs. Succession planning is “a deliberate and
systematic effort by an organization to ensure that the leadership continuity in key positions
retain and develop intellectual and knowledge capital for the future; and encourage individual
advancement” (Rothwell, 2010, p. 6).
Kurt Lewin’s (1947) planned change theory frames this study. Since the implementation
of a SP&MP represents a planned change for an organization, Lewin’s planned change theory
“provides the guidance needed to analyze the process of change and assist in identifying forces
that either propels the change or create barriers that stagnate the change” (Bozak, 2003, p. 80).
Lewin’s (1947) theory states that leaders or managers responsible for implementing planned
change should be aware of the forces that may drive the planned change and forces that may
restrain the planned change in organizations. Understanding those forces before making changes
helps the organization’s leaders as they unfreeze the current status quo by correctly diagnosing
problems, moving towards the needed or desired change, and then refreezing the change at the
new, preferred level.
The Library and Information Science literature support transformational leadership as the
preferred style of leadership to help libraries and their staff cope with and manage change (Alire,
2007; Castiglione, 2006; Düren, 2013; Germano, 2011; Mossop, 2013; Riggs, 1997; Sutton,
2005; Townley, 2009). Specifically, this study seeks to find if the leadership styles of the deans

122

of academic libraries affected their decisions to implement the program at the academic libraries
they lead. The study also seeks to identify and explain the internal and external driving force for
and restraining forces against a planned change that affect deans’ decisions to implement
SP&MPs at their libraries.
The mixed-method sequential explanatory research design consists of two phases, an
online standardized scale that was employed during phase one and in-depth interviews that were
conducted during phase two. Ten deans of academic libraries in a southeastern state of the
United States participated in this study. The first phase of the study employed online surveys
using the MLQ 5x self-rating standardized scale to identify the leadership styles of the academic
library deans. The leadership styles measured are transformational, transactional, or
passive/avoidant behavior. The data from the standardized scale were analyzed using quantitative
methods. The second phase of the study consisted of in-depth interviews designed to provide a
better understanding of and explanations about the deans’ perspectives towards the driving forces
for planned change and the restraining forces against planned change in the form of a SP&MP at
academic libraries. The data from the in-depth interviews were analyzed using qualitative
methods.
The findings from the analysis of the MLQ 5x self-rater form demonstrate that the
leadership styles of the academic library deans affect their decisions to implement SP&MPs as a
planned change at their libraries. According to the MLQ 5x results, nine of the ten respondents
were more transformational than transactional. According to the deans; two said they were
transformational leaders; seven said they were somewhere in the middle of transformational and
transactional leaders, and one said she was a transactional leader. However, because the sample
size was small and the difference between those who said they have a program and those who

123

said they do not is only one, further studies are needed to conclude for certain that the leadership
styles of academic library deans make a difference in their decisions to implement SP&MPs.
The findings from the analyses of the in-depth interviews about driving forces for the
implementation of the informal SP&MPs at academic libraries demonstrate a wide array of
forces in the informal programs implemented at those libraries or in consideration of the
implementation of such programs at those academic libraries. The first category that emerged
from the interviews was constant change and included planned and unplanned change. The
second emergent category was library employees, and it included training to provide
opportunities for advancement, retaining qualified staff, and dealing with pending retirements.
The third category that emerged was the deans’ perceptions about the future of their libraries and
their beliefs about the purpose of the profession. The final category was the budget.
The findings from the analyses of the in-depth interviews about restraining forces against
the implementation of SP&MPs also demonstrate a broad range of diverse perspectives. The
restraining forces identified by the respondents were grouped into two major categories. The
deans listed not enough budgets, insufficient staffing, lack of time, and not enough interest in the
programs as restraining forces. Conversely, the deans also listed too much time, too much
change, too many institutional politics and policies, and organizational culture as additional
restraining forces.
Lewin’s planned change theory was useful because it creates awareness among the deans
that these forces exist, provides a better understanding of what deans may encounter, offers a
justification for convincing others to implement planned change, identifies both driving and
restraining forces, and the results can be linked to the organizational goals to provide strategies
for mitigating the impact of staff changes.

124

Interpretations and Implications of Findings
The interpretations of the findings and implications of the study are listed separately
under the four sections in this heading. Each section corresponds to a research question posed at
the onset of this study. The researcher relates the interpretations of the findings back to the
literature and to the contributions that the study may make to the literature henceforth. The
implications of the findings are listed as they relate to their theoretical and practical application
by scholars and librarians.

Leadership Styles of Academic Library Deans in the Study
This study is the first to seek a link between the leadership styles of academic library
deans and the implementation SP&MP at their libraries; as such, it sets the benchmark for future
studies. The results of this suggest that the leadership styles of the academic library deans affect
their decisions to implement SP&MPs as a planned change at their libraries. According to the
MLQ 5x results, nine of 10 deans are more transformational than the norm. Of those nine deans,
five said they have informal succession planning programs. So, the majority of the deans in this
study who have a more transformational leaderships style than the norm said they have
succession planning programs. The dean who was more transactional than transformational
according to the MLQ 5x results, said she does not have a program. However, because the
sample size was small and the difference between those who said they have a program and those
who said they do not is only one dean, further studies are needed to conclude for certain that the
leadership styles of academic library deans make a difference in their decisions to implement
SP&MPs.

125

The implication of this finding is that transformational leaders are more likely to
implement SP&MPs at their libraries. A limitation of this study is that the sample is too small to
draw any concrete conclusions that one leadership style is more likely than another to implement
a program and therefore future research with a larger sample is recommended. Other factors such
as driving and restraining forces may have more or less of an effect on deans’ decisions than
their leadership styles; for example, institutional politics, budgets, and changes in higher
education may weigh more or less heavily in deans ‘considerations. Further research is needed to
determine the factors that rate the highest in decisions to implement SP&MPs.
The deans’ responses about their leadership styles were unanticipated; seven of ten said
they were somewhere in-between transformational and transactional leaders. Dean J said:
I think my leadership style is probably a combination of the transactional dominating and
maybe slightly transformative… not a lot of change occurs when you have been with one
leader for a very long time [referring to her successor], so anything that I do now is
perceived as transformational; whereas, I perceive it as routine transactions. (Dean J)
Transformational leadership is touted as the best and most appropriate leadership style for
library leaders according to the Library and Information Science literature (Albritton, 1998;
Alire, 2007; & Germano, 2011). “In short, the responses to the rapid changing and repurposing
of the profession call for the work of transformational leaders. Transformational leaders create a
shared vision, use values to build trust and personal relationships and create long-lasting
substantive change” (Martin, 2015, p.347). The most probable reason that the majority of the
deans self-identified as in-between transformation and transactional is because they do in fact
have a strong combination of both leadership styles. This research found that nine of ten deans
were more transformational than transactional, although seven of the deans said their leadership

126

styles were in-between those two styles. The difference in the summary of deans’ aggregate
scores between transformational leadership (3.5) and transactional leadership (3.3) was .2. The
difference is so insignificant that it may explain why the deans described themselves as inbetween both leadership styles.
Another interpretation of this finding is that library leaders are aware of the leadership
characteristics needed, even desired, by followers to lead libraries during constant change. In
fact, two deans stated that they try to be more transformational. That implies that
transformational leadership is viewed as the desired leadership style among the deans in this
study. This line of thinking led the researcher to question how academic librarians view their
bosses’ leadership styles. A survey of 465 academic librarians (not library directors, deans, or
university librarians) indicated “the academic librarians who participated in the study perceived
their leaders to be more transformational than transactional, but their overall perceptions indicate
their library leaders need to improve their use of the transformational components to make their
libraries open to change” (Martin, 2016, p. 274).
The validity of the MLQ 5x was reinforced as a result of this study. A meta-analysis of
the full range of leadership developed by Bass and Avolio (1990) found that the results [of the
analysis] provide important support for the validity of transformational as well as contingent
reward and, to some extent, laissez-faire leadership. “The validity of transformational leadership,
in particular, seems to generalize across many situations, including when it is studied in rigorous
settings” (Judge & Piccolo, 2004, p. 765). This study confirmed findings from other studies
about academic library dean’s leadership styles as discussed in the literature review of this
dissertation (Castiglione, 2006; Germano, 2011; Mavrinac, 2005; Riggs, 2001; Sutton, 2005; &
Townley, 2009). The study further validates the MLQ 5x standardized scale and suggests that

127

this is a valid instrument to use in measuring the leadership styles of academic library leaders in
future studies.
This study revealed that even the deans who support SP&MPs at their libraries participate
only in limited aspects of the program, such as providing professional training and identifying
high potential employees. Rothwell’s (2010) Seven Pointed Star Model for Systematic
Succession Planning and Management, covered in the literature review of this dissertation,
presents a comprehensive model that libraries could use and explains complete program
implementation and management. This study also revealed that while the deans understood the
definition of succession planning as provided to them during the interviews and they have a
broad understanding of how a program could be applied at their libraries, they are not fully
familiar with all of the elements of or understood all of the benefits of a full program. Dean C
stated, “Well, if I am to be completely honest, I don’t have a really good sense of what a formal
program would look like.” According to McLean, Scale, and Rouse-Jones (2014), “the research
shows that in the absence of formal succession planning, leadership training takes place in
tandem with the staff appraisal and career development process” (p. 201). Some deans included
all their professional development activities under the succession planning umbrella, regardless if
it was leadership training or not. The implication of this finding is that the deans in this study are
not familiar with all of the elements of a formal systematic SP&MP.
A common reason given for not implementing the program was organizational culture.
Some institutions require that vacant key leadership positions be advertised at the national level,
regardless if there are qualified persons to fill those positions from within the organization.
These types of hiring policies exemplify the narrow view that some institutions have about the
opportunities that SP&MPs can provide, not just in the library, but at the institutional level. The

128

deans who were not proponents of SP&MPs failed to realize that in not preparing and training
their staff, they were impeding those staff from advancing at their libraries and thus possibly
affecting staff retention. Therefore, it is recommended that deans expand their perspectives and
those of their supervisors to include training staff for key leadership roles at their institutions so
that staff are prepared to compete and to have an opportunity for advancement within the
organization, even when policies require national searches.
The study provides two examples of when it is not applicable to implement a SP&MP;
when staff are not interested in career advancement and when the dean has been recently hired. It
generally takes deans time to learn the new organizational culture. Deans E and J had been at
their institutions for a short period and were still acquainting themselves with their respective
institution’s policies, procedures, and culture and managing a staff they had inherited. Deans E,
J, and I had staff that were not interested in leaving the library or moving up; they said these staff
members had been there “forever” and that they were not interested in changing anything.
Although this may appear to be in contrast with transformational leadership, preparing people for
key leadership positions needs to be a joint effort between the leader and the follower.
This study adds another reason for when SP&MPs should be discouraged with certain
people in leadership roles. The implication of this finding is that if an employee in a key
leadership position is not interested in career advancement, as long as that employee is
productive and contributes to the organization; then that employee should not be pushed into
further training or forced to advance as a result of a succession planning program.
While SP&MPs are not the panacea for all library staff related issues, findings from this
study contribute to the literature and to researchers’ and practitioners’ understanding of academic
library deans’ leadership styles and factors that contribute to their decisions towards the

129

implementation of SP&MPs. The findings create awareness about the effects of academic library
deans’ leadership styles on SP&MP implementation and educate readers about all of the
elements that compose a complete and efficient succession plan. The findings inform scholars
and practitioners about the benefits of effectively implemented and managed SP&MPs at
academic libraries. Finally, the findings from this portion of the study confirm and extend the
literature about the practice of succession planning in organizations, not only in the Library and
Information Science field but in all disciplines.

Driving Forces for the Implementation of SP&MPs
The current status of libraries is in flux, and that should suffice as a driver for the
implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries. Hall-Ellis (2015) stated, “as flattening
organizations with a decreased number of mid-level managers, smaller professional development
budgets in an economically challenging environment, and an aging number of experienced
librarians converge, the prudent library administrator benefits from a well-developed succession
plan (p. 95). This study shows that academic library deans face some of the same issues that
other organizations in other sectors face concerning SP&MP implementation.
The deans voiced their perspectives about the driving forces for future and current
succession planning programs at their libraries. The recorded transcripts from the deans’ answers
to ten multiple part questions during the in-depth interviews were analyzed and coded into
categories. The categories were then grouped into major themes for presentation and discussion
purposes. The first group of categories that emerged from the interviews was constant change,
and it was divided into two themes; planned and unplanned change, and internal (academic
library) and external (institution and national) change. Dean A stated “we need to be prepared for

130

changes…because we in higher education and I do not care where you are - the library is under
tremendous pressures to change, good, bad, otherwise - that is the way it is.”
The interpretation here is that being aware that change is happening and that leaders need
to be prepared to manage change is a reason to implement SP&MPs, as expressed in this study
and repeated in the literature. According to Rothwell, Jones, Brower, Jackson, and Ressler
(2015),
How change is introduced and implemented in a workplace reflects the corporate culture
and the value system of the organization. The increasing speed of workplace change
dictates more dynamic competency models. A prime challenge for today’s organizations
is to recognize changing competency requirements and react in ways that enable
employees to acquire new performance behaviors, skills, and knowledge. (p. 104)
The implication of this finding is that library deans should implement SP&MPs to
prepare their key leaders to manage the constant changing nature of library work and the
environment that surrounds libraries at academic institutions. The concept of transformational
leadership and the need to manage change that permeates this study is echoed in the Library and
Information Science literature, most recently by Du Plessis and Mabunda (2016), Fox and
Keisling (2016), and Nicholson (2015). By preparing future key leaders now libraries could be
more effective and efficient in the future.
The second category grouping that emerged from the analysis of the deans’ perspectives
were the library staff, both professional librarians as well as library assistants. The three major
themes related to library staff were training to provide opportunities for advancement, retention
of qualified staff, and dealing with pending retirements. Dean H succinctly summarized the
intentions of the deans regarding their staff:

131

My strategic intent as a library leader is always to build capacity within the library to
move us forward. That’s sort of the overarching mission in a sense and when I say move
us forward, I mean that in all sorts of ways. I know that I don’t have a formal plan for
succession but what I do is, in working with staff and faculty, look for many ways to
interact with them on projects, as well as in meetings and training situations, to see if I
can identify the strengths and characteristics of individuals and try to build those through
special assignments as a team leader, or project leader, through some formal training.
(Dean H)
These workforce issues identified by the deans as driving forces for their programs are
already found in the literature. Therefore, this study validates the literature about succession
planning programs regarding the benefits of staff training to increase retention and to mitigate
the effects of retirements and the loss of knowledge capital, Rothwell (2010), provides retention
as an example of a trend that drives SP&MPs, he stated that there is reduced loyalty among
employees and workers, employers are not making long-term commitment to their employees as
a result of downsizing, and this has affected employee retention.
The implication of this finding is that if academic library leaders want to increase the
retention of their key people, they should provide opportunities for training, engagement, and
advancement from within the organization. According to Hall-Ellis (2015) “a well-designed and
coordinated succession plan that is integrated with leadership development can enable the library
administrator to avoid reliance on a replacement process that is narrowly focused on finding a
new version of the departed colleague” (p. 96).
The third groups of categories that emerged were the deans’ perceptions and beliefs about
the future of their libraries, and the purpose of the profession. Interpretations of this finding is

132

that the deans’ transformational characteristics influenced their perspectives about both their
professions and their staff. The deans demonstrated a commitment to motivate and inspire their
staff and articulated a vision of the future. Dean D stated “I want people to be empowered
enough to try new and different things.” That is an example of inspirational motivation – a
characteristic of transformational leadership. Dean H created an informal group that discusses
research agendas; that is an example of intellectual stimulation another characteristic of
transformational leaders. A thread of concern for the future of their staff and their libraries ran
through the respondents in this study. Deans C, D, F, H and I articulated those concerns and
talked about their legacies.
The implications of these findings are there should be much more enthusiasm, knowledge
and participation in SP&MPS now so that there are fewer worries about the future later.
Observations reflect a need to educate library leaders about SP&MPs and about the potential
benefits of transformation leadership to motivate, inspire, and articulate a vision for the future of
their libraries and staff.
The fourth category grouping that emerged was the budget. The deans stated that while
they are willing to send staff to training, it costs money and money are not always available. One
dean mentioned that the library faculty are allocated $1,500 per year to use for professional
development, at their discretion, and with administration approval, while other deans mentioned
that they do not have any budget for training. Four deans mentioned they have sent some of their
key leaders to national and state leadership institutes. However, none of the deans related budget
concerns to the establishment or management of a succession plan. SP&MPs cost money. Staff is
required to manage the program, staff and software are needed to track organizational staffing
issues, and other resources such, as time for program planning, may add to those costs.

133

An interpretation of this finding is that some deans are not acutely aware of mechanisms
required to initiate and successfully manage an effective, systemic SP&MP. The misconception
that providing some training to some staff in key leadership positions or to some staff who
appear to have potential, without conversations or discussion with those staff about their future,
are examples of misunderstandings about the program purpose and goals.
The implication of this finding is that library leaders and staff can benefit from education
and training about SP&MPs. Including succession planning as a component of leadership
training at the local and national levels is necessary.

Restraining Forces Against the Implementation of SP&MPs
The respondents expressed a broad range of diverse perspectives on the restraining forces
against the implementation of SP&MPs in their informal programs or in consideration of the
expansion of such programs at their academic libraries. The restraining forces identified by the
respondents were grouped into categories, and these were further divided into themes for
presentation and discussion. The two groups of categories that emerged from the findings were
too little and too much. The deans listed not enough budgets (for training), insufficient staffing,
lack of time, and not enough interest in the programs as restraining forces. The literature review
of this dissertation listed factor contributing to the limited use of SP&MPs only in the business
community because a study dedicated to the academic library community had never been
previously done.
One of the reasons for limited use of SP&MPs listed in the literature is low visibility;
organizational leaders do not see the benefits of the program because it occurs at lower levels
and it is not brought to the attention of the higher-level administrators (Rothwell, 2010). A

134

restraining force against program implementation was that succession planning was not a
priority. Five deans’ reasonability articulated that they do not view the program as priority at
their libraries for different reasons. Some deans stated they do not have the time, others said that
they do not know enough about the program or they do not think that it is feasible for their
libraries. One dean referred to the program as “good in theory, but not in practice.” The literature
clearly suggests that SP&MPs that are not supported by top leadership have no possibility for
success. Specific examples of each of these restraining forces were provided in much detail in
chapter four of the dissertation. The interpretation of the view of SP&MPs as not a priority is
problematic because it does not permit for program investigation, trial, or much less implementation.
The implication of this finding is that proponents of SP&MPs should appeal to academic
library deans encourage program participation despite too little time, budget, and staffing; and
too many institutional politics and change. The support of academic library deans is critical to
the implementation. If deans were more familiar with these programs, they might think
differently. Therefore, additional education is critical, as is publicizing information about
SP&MPs through library publications, listservs, conferences, and other venues.
Additional restraining forces articulated by the deans included that the programs take too
much time to implement, there is too much change in the organization, there are too many
institutional politics and policies about hiring, and there is a static organizational culture.
Rothwell (2010) clearly stated that leadership support is a must for the successful
implementation of SP&MPs.
A recent study of library leaders identified the top five major challenges they face in the
digital age, the fifth challenge listed was keeping library staff trained and current; the

135

participants in that study stated that the best ways to acquire the skills were “to have mentors, to
attend leadership development programs, to gain practical library leadership experience, to seek
leadership roles, and to know oneself” (Le, 2015, p. 300). This study presents SP&MPS as a
solution to address the gap in the planning for and development of current academic librarians at
their institutions to fill future leadership roles within their libraries. Some deans are not willing
or cannot effect sufficient change at their organizations now to improve the circumstances for
their staff and their futures. This study brings to light the restraining forces against the
implementation of SP&MPs and alerts other deans about some of the issues that they too may
encounter.
The implications of these findings provide the foundation, the building block, for the
continued development of these programs at academic libraries. The conversation about
SP&MPs has already been ignited with the participants of this study and should be expanded to
include academic library deans throughout the state and the nation. The strengths of this unique
study lie not only in the quality of the data collected, but in the detailed and contextual
descriptions about leadership styles, driving forces for program implementation, and restraining
forces against SP&MPs in academic libraries. Researchers and practitioners alike have a starting
point now from which to investigate further and learn about SP&MP implementation at
academic libraries.

The Usefulness of Theory and Models in the Study
Planned change theory. Lewin’s 1947 planned change theory frames this study.
Academic library deans should first be aware of and understand the driving and restraining
forces that have permitted the informal programs at their libraries to proceed at the rate that they

136

have before bringing about a formal implementation of SP&MPs at their libraries. Deans can
implement programs to produce a desirable change once they have a better understanding of the
driving and restraining forces for and against the planned change. Lewin’s planned change
theory was useful in predicting the need to identify those forces to understand planned change
better because it permits the researcher and the academic library practitioners to think about,
name, and recognize those forces. Additionally, the application of the theory in this study
provides library deans an insight into the kinds of barriers and enablers that may provide them
opportunities and challenges before the actual implementation of the programs.
The interpretation of the findings of driving forces also helps to explicate the benefits of
the program. The identification of restraining forces can be used to solve problematic issues and
practices at the library and the institutional level. Deans can share and solicit input from their
staff before implementing programs. The study helps to explain and prepare the deans how staff
reacts to planned change. The theory also helps staff understand that they will undergo a planned
change and that participating in identifying what they view as driving and restraining forces and
can be helpful in their management of a planned change. These strategies may help to bring
people on board and get stakeholders’ approval.
The implications of this finding for practitioners implementing SP&MPs as a planned
change is that they should engage the staff affected by the change in identifying the driving and
restraining forces before program implementation. Academic library deans can use the data
compiled from this study to make a convincing case for and to explain to university
administrators and library staff why the change is needed. This study also extends the literature
about planned change theory by Kurt Lewin. Lewin famously stated, “you cannot understand a
system until you try to change it.”

137

Seven-Pointed Star Model for Systematic Succession Planning and Management. It
is important to note that study was not about implementing programs, but about identifying the
forces that might impinge upon the change that the implementation of a program could represent
to an academic library. Therefore, this study did not measure the value of Rothwell’s (2016)
Seven-Pointed Star Model for Systematic Succession Planning and Management on program
implementation at academic libraries. The Library and Information Science literature are replete
with citations of Rothwell’s research (Galbraith, Smith, & Walker, 2011; Hawthorne, 2011;
Holcomb, 2006; Nixon, 2008; & Singer & Griffith, 2010). A study that employs the SevenPointed Star Model and its usefulness in an academic library setting is highly recommended.
There are many examples in the literature for the way in which organizations can conduct
or manage a succession planning program. However, Rothwell’s model was among the most
comprehensive and the author provides readers a series of templates that can, with experience
and time, be customized to meet the needs of different work settings. The only deficiency with
the model is that it is not geared towards academic libraries. Therefore, based on an extensive
literature review, conversations with the deans of the academic libraries who participated in this
study, and a consideration of the results of this study, the researcher created practical tips for
initiating, developing, and evaluating a SP&MP at academic libraries. The practical tips are
included in this chapter.
The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire Model. The model by Bass and Avolio
(1990) is used by the researcher in this study as a means of having a standardized test to measure
the leadership styles of the deans. The MLQ 5x was extremely effectively in this study as the
results from the instrument were different from those reported by the deans. The results of the
MLQ 5x were also useful for the deans. The deans commented on how informational and

138

instructive the detailed results of the questionnaire were when these were discussed at length
during the interviews. Therefore, is highly recommended that the model and the accompanying
questionnaire be used in further leadership studies at academic libraries.
If SP&MPs were icebergs, then this study about factors that affect SP&MPs
implementation and is only the tip of that iceberg. Therefore, Lewin’s planned change theory or
another similar change theory should be considered before program implementation to provide a
better understanding of how library employees may react to a planned change.

Limitations of the Study
Limitations of this study are mainly attributable to the sample in the study and the
institutions from which the population derived. However, it is also possible that there may have
been a myriad of situational factors that affected the results of this study of which the researcher
is unaware. The study consists of a small sample of academic library deans all from the same
public university and college system in a southeastern state in the United States. Therefore, the
findings from this study are not generalizable to the population. The focus of this study was in
academic libraries, not public, school, or special libraries. There may be other factors that
construe the forces for and against the implementation of SP&MPs at those libraries, and
therefore caution should be exercised in applying these findings to those other settings. While
this study broke grounds regarding being the first to find academic library deans explanations for
why they would or would implement an SP&MP at their libraries, further studies are
recommended with much a broader group of participants.
Another limitation of this study is the reliance on the perspectives of the deans who
participated in the study. The purpose of the research was repeatedly stated in the invitations,

139

prior to the in-depth interviews, and the confidentiality of participants was confirmed. The nature
of this study is sensitive because it identifies institutional policies and politics, so the deans may
have chosen to withhold information to protect the confidentiality of key people at their
institutions and libraries.

Practical Tips for SP&MP Implementation as a Planned Change in
Academic Libraries
The following figure provides some practical tips for implementing SP&MPs for readers
interested in pursuing a program at their academic libraries. The practical tips are based on the
results suggested in this study, a comprehensive literature review, and the researcher’s
observations for likely best practices at academic libraries (see Figure 13). Providing
practitioners with another option for implementing SP&MPs seemed like a natural conclusion to
this study. The following assumptions were made when writing these practical tips:
1.

The implementation of the SP&MP is a planned change, not something that is

approached serendipitously.
2.

The library dean is supportive of the SP&MP.

3.

The library deans and higher level administrators recognize that the successful

implementation of a SP&MP requires resources; such as time, staff, and possibly funding.
4.

The practical tips listed here are not like a prescription that must be followed to

the letter, each dean must decide what tips make up the right, balance for a program at their
library.
5.

There are no guarantees by the researcher that if these practical tips are followed

that the SP&MP at academic libraries will be successful.

140

Libraries. Copyright 2016 by Lisandra R. Carmichael.

It is strongly suggested that those interested in implementing a SP&MP at their library
carefully review, choose, and apply the tips that make the most sense to them in their
environments based on a myriad of situational and contextual factors and considerations. Also, a
141

tailored, informal program that is well thought out is an acceptable solution and approach to
succession planning. SP&MPs that are tailored to the institution’s needs and goals are more
likely to succeed.

Practical Tips Before SP&MP Implementation
Begin by reviewing the library’s strategic plan, goals, and other planning documents, as
applicable, to answer these two questions: (a) how does the implementation of a SP&MP help
achieve the library goals? Moreover, (b), how does the implementation of a SP&MP fit in with
the library’s strategic plan? If you cannot clearly and succinctly answer the two questions posed
here, then stop before going any further. It is suggested that more focus is placed on clarifying
library goals and revising the strategic plan before moving forward with succession planning.
Get your house in order first!
The dean can decide who the members of the SP&MP team should be. Then together: (a)
identify the driving forces for the planned change (include both internal and external forces); and
(b), identify the restraining forces for the planned change (include both internal and external
forces). Use the most compelling driving forces to create an advocacy plan for the planned
change that can be presented to key stakeholders. The plan can be as simple as a written
statement for why a SP&MP is needed at the library. The dean and the SP&MP team members
can decide who the key stakeholders are for your library. Identify solutions to the most
challenging restraining forces, work as much as possible, in a shared governance environment.
Then share those concerns with your key stakeholders. For example, if a key restraining force is
funding, then figure out how much money the library needs and make a case for funding as part
of the advocacy plan.

142

Write “The Plan” for program implementation and present it to key stakeholders for
suggestions and if needed, approval. Include: (a) the timeframe for program planning,
implementation processes, and program evaluation; (b) the resources needed, including time,
staff, and budget; and (c), the expectations of plan implementation. Clearly articulate the
expected outcomes of the planned change for the library staff, the library as a productive and
effective organization, and the impact of the change on stakeholders such as the institution’s
students, faculty, and staff. Include things like reduction in time spent on conducting searches for
vacant positions, reduction on the loss of knowledge capital and capacity for the library and the
institution; and an increase on job retention.
Present the plan to higher level administrators for approval, if necessary. The deans can
determine if they need or want the support of higher level administrators to implement a
SP&MP, as a planned change on a trial or permanent basis. Factors such as institutional policies
and politics may come into play here. Additionally, funding may serve as another factor to
consider at this time. And finally, integrate succession planning into the library’s strategic plan
and other planning documents.

Practical Tips During SP&MP Implementation
Take an inventory of library employees. Identify the key leadership position at the
library. This should include both library faculty and library assistants and paraprofessionals who
are in key leadership positions throughout various departments and units in the main and branch
libraries. Key positions can include but are not limited to Associate Deans, Program Directors,
Heads of Branch Libraries, Department Heads, and people with key duties such as fiscal officers,
human resources officials, and library openers and closers. Each academic library may be

143

different. Answer the question: do we have library faculty and staff who can step-in those
positions in case of emergencies, retirements or resignations? Identify gaps in coverage, for
example, you may have somebody who can fill-in for the Head of Research, but what if that
person is retiring within a year? Try to go more than one person deep into the coverage.
Identify additional skills needed in current and future positions. Go back to the library’s
strategic plan for referral and inspiration. Select a trial group (library faculty and staff) to initiate
the program on a smaller scale until the kinks are worked out and the program can be reproduced
and sustained at a larger scale. The trial group can be from departments or units that have been
identified as critical due to staff retention and retirements problems. The next steps include:


Identifying the trainer or persons responsible for the SP&MP and clearly state
their responsibilities in writing.



Identifying the trainees or library employees who will benefit from the program
and clearly state in writing their responsibilities.



Identifying and informing others of who has SP&MP oversight.

Decide whether or not to tell individual library faculty and staff that they have been
identified as high potential employees and are being groomed to better compete for vacancies.
There are different schools of thought here and each dean should decide upon the best approach
at their library while considering their staff and other contextual factors.
Begin training the library faculty and staff selected to participate in the SP&MP. The
training can include many methods, for example, in-house mentoring, stretch assignments, free
webinars and training opportunities via library organizations and multi-library cooperatives.
Document training and other activities related to the SP&MP (to be completed by the person
with program oversight or designee). Set up regular meetings to monitor progress (once a month

144

or once a quarter, as needed). Document meeting sessions and submit progress reports to the
dean. While keeping good records of all activities associates with the planning and
implementation processes may be a laborious task, keep in mind that succession planning is
about leaving future generations with the tools they need to succeed, and detailed documents
facilitate that path.

Practical Tips After SP&MP Implementation
Evaluate the plan in a shared governance environment with key stakeholders and evaluate
the effectiveness of the SP&MP. Answer the following questions: (a) What went well and why?
(b) What went badly and why? (c) What can be done better next time? And (d), should the plan
continue? Include the library faculty and staff who were part of the program to get their
perspectives on advantages and disadvantages of the program.
A final precautionary note for practitioners interested in implementing SP&MPs is that
much attention should be paid to current library staffing and future needs and job requirements.
A good library practice may include the evaluation of vacated positions to determine better how
the positions should be filled, rather than doing so automatically, without regard for the future or
the library’s strategic planning and other plans.

Suggestions for Future Research and Conclusions
Future research is suggested to supplement the limitation of this study and to build upon
the interpretation of the findings. Scholars and practitioners can use the findings of this study to
understand better the factors that may affect the implementation of SP&MPs. This study focused
on leaderships styles and forces driving the implementation and those that restrained it and

145

presents two recommendations. The study respondents were academic library deans and the
implementation of the programs was in academic library settings.
Future research includes the replication of this study using a larger sample. If it were
possible to conduct research at the national level with a good random sample, the generalizations
would be illuminating. Associate Deans, Directors, Department Chairs, Unit Heads, and other
key people in the organization should be invited to participate in the study and asked about their
perceptions of SP&MPs. The line of questioning could include the following: 1) What would
you consider to be the advantages and disadvantages of the program? 2) Would you be interested
in actively participating in such programs? And 3), how should these programs be implemented
at your library? This study was the first of its kind in academic libraries and should be extended
in the future to include the persons who would most benefit from participating in the program.
The deans interviewed shared valuable insights, but they are already at the top of the promotion
ladder. Seeking a different perspective from, for example, those who are still climbing the
promotion ladder and could provide another perspective and different insight into the
complexities associated with implementing a SP&MP.
It is also recommended that a concerted effort be made to educate the academic library
community, the practitioners, about the purpose and benefits of SP&MPs. It is evident to the
researcher that there are some misconceptions about some of the elements that compose an
effective and complete SP&MP. One possible solution could be to create a statewide institute
dedicated to preparing key leaders for future leadership roles where the findings from this study,
and information about SP&MPs, in general, can be incorporated and highlighted. Existing library
leadership institutes should consider the inclusion of SP&MP training for higher-level library
administrators to encourage program implementation and growth.

146

As a result of these recommendations, future opportunities for research include the
replication of this study at a much broader scale and the inclusion of other key leaders in the
organizations in the study. A comparison of both studies may lead researchers and practitioners
to gain wider perspective on the issues and to work together to determine the best next steps in
program education and implementation.

APPENDIX B
INVITATION FOR RESPONDENTS TO COMPLETE THE ONLINE
QUESTIONNAIRE
Dear Dean,

August 1, 2016

I am Lisandra Carmichael, a doctoral candidate at Florida State University. I am writing to ask
your help in a study that I am conducting about the implementation of succession planning and
management programs (SP&MPs) at academic libraries. This study intends to gather information
about the leadership styles of academic library deans and the forces that drive and restrain the
implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries. You were selected for this study because of
your position as a library dean or director at an academic library in Florida.
The findings from the questionnaire will contribute to the understanding of the leadership styles
of academic library deans and if those styles affect dean’s decision to implement a SP&MP at

forces against the implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries as a planned change.

APPENDIX C
INVITATION FOR RESPONDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE IN-DEPTH
INTERVIEW

Dear Dean,

August 1, 2016

I am a doctoral candidate at Florida State University. I am writing to ask your help in a study that
I am conducting about the implementation of succession planning and management programs
(SP&MPs) in academic libraries. I would like to conduct an in-depth interview with you,
approximately 90 minutes of your time, and I will come to your office at a mutually convenient
time. This study is part of an effort to learn about the leadership styles of academic library deans
and the forces that drive and restrain the implementation of SP&MPs at academic libraries. You
were selected for this study because of your position as a library dean or director in an academic
library in Florida.
The findings from this study will be useful in understanding how academic libraries are
preparing future library leaders to successfully deal with changes due to present and projected
workforce demographics and changes in higher education that impact academic libraries.
SP&MPs can be employed in academic libraries to identify, train, and prepare future library
leaders. For more information on this study and the sources used, please email me.
Your confidentiality is of utmost importance to me. The data will be codified, and individual
responses will not be attributable. My preference is to record the interview and I will ask for your
consent to do so at the beginning of the interview. Your identity, in terms of the data gathering
and analysis, will only be known by me. If you choose to participate in the in-depth interview
(maximum 90 minutes) you will be required to sign an informed consent form at the beginning
of the interview.
If you have any questions or comments about this study, I will be happy to talk to you. Thank
you!
Sincerely,

Doctoral Candidate

APPENDIX D
QUESTIONS FOR THE IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH ACADEMIC LIBRARY
DEANS
Introduction
The purpose of this study is to learn the factors that you considered (or would consider) that
facilitate and impede the implementation of a succession planning and management program at
your library. I am not here to judge if you succeeded or not in establishing a program, but rather
to learn from you what factors affected your decision to implement or not implement a program.
I would like to begin by defining succession planning and management programs (SP&MPs) as I
have defined and operationalized the term in my research:
SP&MPs are “a deliberate and systematic effort by an organization to ensure that the
leadership continuity in key positions retain and develop intellectual and knowledge
capital for the future; and encourage individual advancement” (Rothwell, 2010, p. 6).
This includes “any effort designed to ensure the continued effective performance of an
organization, division, department, or workgroup by making provision for the
development, replacement, and strategic application of key people over time” (Rothwell,
2010, p. 6).
Questions
1. Prior to today, you participated in a survey instrument, the MLQ 5x, it was designed to
identify your leadership style among three different leadership styles. The styles of leadership
measured were transformational, transactional, or passive/avoidant behavior. In a few minutes, I
will tell you how you rated according to the way in which you answered the questions on the
MLQ 5x, but first please tell me:
a. What do you think your leadership style is: transformation, transactional,
passive/avoidant behavior or something else?
b. How has your leadership style - as identified by the MLQ 5x survey influenced your decision to implement a SP&MP at your library?
I would like to ask you about your perceptions of a SP&MP at this library. Please answer these
questions in your role as the dean of this library.
2. Based on the definition that I just gave you of a SP&MP, does this library have such a
program?
a. If yes, would you please tell me how the program was implemented?
b. If not, can you please tell me why you have not implemented a program?
3. How do you define key leadership positions in this library?
a. How do you select key these leaders?
4. How stable do you believe the current organizational structure to be?

152

a. If a key leader was to be suddenly lost, are there individuals who could be tapped
quickly to fill the gap in leadership?
b. In thinking about this library, how do you track staffing needs? For example, how you
track what retirements are planned, what promotions are pending, what positions are
currently open, etc.?
c. Is the current organizational structure adequate to use as the basis for identifying
key positions for replacement?
d. Would you please tell me how many faculty and staff work at the university library
and how many libraries there are at this university?
Now, I would like to ask you questions about driving and restraining forces for and against the
implementation of SP&MPs. Driving forces as defined in this study are social forces that
increase or drive change and these driving forces can act either both towards or away from
something; restraining forces oppose driving forces. Ambitions, goals, needs, and fears can serve
as examples of driving forces for the change and an example of a restraining force may be a lack
of time and monies to establish a program.
5. What do you (in your role as the dean of library) perceive to be the driving forces for the
implementation of a SP&MP as a planned change at this library?
a. Which of these are most important and why?
b. What others do you see as critical and why?
6. What do you (in your role as the dean of library) perceive to be the restraining forces against
the implementation of SP&MP as a planned change at this library?
a. Which of these are most important and why?
b. What others do you see as critical and why?
7. Are there any situational factors at this university that may affect the implementation of
SP&MPs at this library? By situational factors, I am referring to university politics, realities,
contexts, and other issues that may affect your decision.
8. What are your thoughts about approaching a succession planning and management in this
library as a planned change?
9. Should this organization implement a SP&MP or improve its approach to SP&MP?
Please explain why you feel the way you do.
Closing
10. What other thoughts do you have that you would like to share with me about implementing a
SP&MP at this library?

APPENDIX E
FSU BEHAVIORAL CONSENT FORM

Title of Study:
The implementation of succession planning and management programs at academic libraries:
Factors that affects deans’ decisions.
You are invited to be in a research study about the implementation of succession planning and
management programs (SP&MPs) in academic libraries. The research addresses the gap in the
planning for and development of current academic librarians to fill future leadership roles as
revealed in the Library and Information Science literature. SP&MPs are an option for identifying
and preparing potential leaders to assume key leadership roles within their academic libraries.
You were selected as a possible participant because you are the dean of an academic library in
the Florida State University or College System. Please read this form and ask any questions you
may have before agreeing to be in the study.
I am conducting the study as part of my doctoral degree requirements at the College of
Communication at the Florida State University.
Background Information:
The purpose of this study is to address three areas. First, to learn if certain leadership styles of
academic library deans affect their decisions to implement SP&MPs at their academic libraries.
Second, to identify the driving forces that might influence a library dean's’ decision to implement
SP&MPs as a planned change at their academic library. And third, to identify the restraining
forces that might impede a library dean’s decision to implement SP&MPs as a planned change at
their library.
Procedures:
If you agree to be in this study, we would ask you to do the following things: complete one
online questionnaire that should take approximately 30 minutes to complete. You will also be
asked to answer a series of questions during one in-depth interview that should take
approximately 90 minutes. You will be asked if you agree to have the interviews audio recorded
for me to review and transcribe.
Risks and benefits of being in the Study:
The study has several risks. First, answering questions about your leadership style, and/or what
you perceive to be factors for and against the implementation of succession planning programs
may cause you stress. And second, you may have concerns about confidentiality. You nay chose
to terminate the study at any time that you feel that you would like to do so.

154

The benefits of participation are that this research may contribute to your knowledge and
understanding about the implementation of SP&MPS and may help to make academic libraries
more effective and productive.
Compensation:
There is no compensation associated with your participation in this research.
Confidentiality:
The records of this study will be kept private and confidential to the extent permitted by law. In
any sort of report, I might publish, I will not include any information that will make it possible to
identify a subject. I will be the only person to have access to the audio recording or transcripts
and these will be destroyed one year after the research is completed. However, research
information that identifies you may be shared with the FSU Institutional Review Board (IRB)
and others who are responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations related to
research, including people on behalf of the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).
Voluntary Nature of the Study:
Participation in this study is voluntary. Your decision whether or not to participate will not affect
your current or future relations with the University. If you decide to participate, you are free to
not answer any question or withdraw at any time without affecting those relationships.
