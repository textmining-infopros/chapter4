AN ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION OF
NORAH OMAR ALSANA, for the Doctor of Philosophy degree in CURRICULUM &
INSTRUCTION, presented on March 20, 2017, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.
TITLE: FEMALE SAUDI PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS’ COMPETENCY IN INFORMATION
LITERACY, PERCEPTIONS OF FUTURE CLASSROOM PRACTICE,
AND THE ROLE OF LIBRARIANS
MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. John McIntyre
The purpose of this concurrent triangulation mixed- method study is to identify preservice teachers’ competency and future classroom practice regarding information literacy.
Another purpose was to identify pre-service teachers’ perceptions of the librarian’s role in
developing information literacy practice. The study was also designed to identify the faculty
members’ perceptions of pre-service teachers’ practice of information literacy. The sample
contained 117 female pre-service teachers in the Quantitative phase and 8 pre-service teachers
and 4 faculty members in the qualitative phase at Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic
University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
The finding revealed that pre-service teachers were knowledgeable about information
literacy skills. However, their knowledge competency was a mostly theoretical knowledge that
they did not have time or learning experiences to practice. Also, The pre-service teachers showed
limited preparation to practice information literacy not only as students but also as teachers.
They also showed a positive interest to learn how to practice information literacy in their future
teaching only to improve their students’ knowledge about the subject, not to teach students these
skills, which is related to the second level of IL practice skill. The finding also showed that preservice teachers were dependence on instructors to explain IL skills processes, believing these

i

were the faculty’s role rather than the librarian’s who did not have the role more than finding
resources to them.
Base on the result, I recommend an integrated to the information literacy skills to
practice through all the subject matters and evaluate their (pre-service teacher) practice not only
as students but also as future teachers. Also, I recommend the university from administrators,
faculty members, and librarians to enhance the awareness among students about the important of
IL skills and work cooperatively to influence the students’ capacity to practice that not only as
seekers but also as future providers to this competency.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
In the last two decades, the computer and the internet have become used abundantly
around the world (Bushong & Boff, 2008). This integration has resulted in an information
revolution, with knowledge becoming increasingly available to a larger number of people than
ever before. However, such information is sometimes of low quality, which affects how it is used
as many can effectively use technology but lack adequate skills to identify useful information
(Hinchliffe, 2004). As a result, evaluating information is a vital skill. People must “recognize
when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the
needed information” (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000, p. 1).
These skills are referred to collectively as information literacy (sometimes abbreviated
IL). Information literacy is an umbrella term that encompasses research and library literacy,
critical literacy, information technology, mass media literacy, and academic information ethics
(Tiemensma, 2012). A proficient person in these areas is called information literate. Information
literate people are lifelong learners who work to improve their ability to find, evaluate, and
analyze information to become knowledgeable in a field as independent learners as well as to be
able to use it in academia and daily life (Tiemensma, 2012). According to Özdemir, Akbaş, and
Çakır (2009), those who are develop information literacy direct their learning independently.
Information literacy is also defined as " all variations on the ability to engage effectively
in a process of defining information needs, evaluating, selecting and synthesizing information
from a range of sources, and applying the information to the task or problem in hand" (Williams
& Wavell, 2007, p.199). However, it is difficult to teach these skills throughout the curriculum
because these are skills that need to be acquired or obtained through practice. Therefore, to be

2
proficient with these skills, educators need to apply them with students at a young age so that
they begin to understand how to use these information literacy skills.
Also, Information literacy is a particularly important skillset for students to achieve
success in their studies. It has therefore become an essential in countries around the world
(Alamoudi & Alsulami, 2008; Aloshan, 2013; Alshehry, 2014; Alsereihy & Alsuraihi, 2009;
Amer, 2015; Asselin & Doiron, 2004; Branch, 2003; Williams & Wavell, 2007).
Developing information literacy skills helps people become more independent learners,
making them more responsible for their own learning. It also benefits learners by making them
more engaged with the social, cultural, and political issues around them. The Association of
College and Research Libraries (ACRL), the American Association of School Libraries (AASL),
the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IALA), and UNESCO all
agree on the importance of implementing these skills in the curricula for students in K-12
through higher education. The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education
(NCATE, 2008) standards mentioned that pre-service teachers and candidates must be “able to
appropriately and effectively integrate technology and information literacy in instruction to
support student learning” as well as to “understand the importance of using research in teaching
and other professional roles and know the roles and responsibilities of the education profession”
(p. 22). However, gaps remain in helping for K-12 students develop these skills in preparation
for higher education (Gross & Latham, 2009). Many undergraduate students graduate from the
university “without ever attaining these much-needed information literacy skills” (Gross &
Latham, 2009, p. 336), a situation that might be related to their major requirements. Therefore, to
determine whether students are meeting these search requirements, the ACRL (2000) created a
standard that serves as a guide to measure information literacy competency and performance

3
among higher education students. However, after collecting the data for this study in 2015, the
ACRL revised their standards to a newer framework of information literacy for higher education.
Numerous researchers from around the world, including Canada, New Zealand, the USA,
the UK, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia… etc., have emphasized the importance of these skills
because they help students, librarians, teachers, school faculty members, and educators cope with
the rapid changes in information resources (Alhumood, 2011; Alamoudi & Alsulami, 2008;
Aloshan, 2013; Alshehry, 2014; Alsereihy & Alsuraihi, 2009; Farag, 2015; Floyd, Colvin &
Bodur, 2008; Miller, 2005; Almulhim, 2014; Seely, Fry, & Ruppel, 2011).
Some studies on higher education systems around the world have examined these skills in
terms of how knowledge gained from self-research can be beneficial for the individual to meet
his or her learning and research goals. Self-research skills are useful for meeting the demands of
university work, job requirements, as well as success in life (Alhumood, 2011; Alamoudi &
Alsulami, 2008; Aloshan, 2013; Alshehry, 2014; Latham & Gross, 2008; Miller, 2005;
Almulhim, 2014).
Other studies on higher educational systems have focused on information literacy skills
as instructional knowledge that could be imparted to students by their instructors. However, to
practice information literacy within a classroom setting, teachers, faculty members, and
librarians need to receive specialized training or take classes that concentrate on these skills
(Branch, 2003; Miller, 2005; Seely, Fry & Ruppel, 2011; Stockham & Collins, 2012).
The importance of these skills has led many governments to take notice. The government
of Saudi Arabia has been working to develop and improve its national education system.
According to Almulhim (2014), “improving any educational system significantly depends upon
teachers’ training and professional development” (p. 488). Therefore, the Ministry of Higher

4
Education (2011), in 2011 Saudi Arabia spent 22.8% of its budget on education in order to
implement new curricula and teacher preparation programs that could promote education.
Despite heavy investment in public education, Saudi students begin university studies
with a lack of information literacy skills (Lee, Reed, & Laverty, 2012). This lack of information
literacy originates primarily from the absence of preparation programs to train teachers to apply
these skills in the classroom setting (Branch, 2003; Miller, 2005; Shipman, 2014). Another
reason for this problem comes from the lack of librarians and specialists capable of training
students in these skills at school libraries (Alsereihy & Alsuraihi, 2009). In addition, some
teachers simply fail to integrate these competencies as required by the curriculum (Kaplowitz,
2012; Lee, Reed, & Laverty, 2012). Finally, many students do not even know they can learn
these skills from librarians, specialists, or instructors (Alhumood, 2011; Aloshan, 2013;
Alshehry, 2014; Alsereihy & Alsuraihi, 2009; Almulhim, 2014).
As a result, university students face serious difficulties understanding and acquiring
information literacy, and even when they develop these skills it is usually a result of self-research
to meet university learning requirements or to improve their self-research skills as a graduate
student or faculty member at the university level, as opposed to learning them from an instructor
or specialist (Alhumood, 2011; Amer, 2015; Alamoudi & Alsulami, 2008; Farag, 2015).
Moreover, based on my personal experience as a student, information literacy skills were
not apparent until entering college. At college, I found that students were lacking in critical,
analytical, and social engagement skills that help learners’ use and express knowledge. However,
after collecting the data for this study in 2015, the ACRL revised their standards to a newer
framework of information literacy for higher education.

5
Research Problem
The problem statement of this study was that pre-service teachers or practicum students
were starting their teaching life with two major limits. First, they believe that information
literacy is exclusively research-seeking competency. Second, they have limited skills to apply
information literacy in their classroom.
Currently, information literacy skills are an academic subject in Saudi Arabia that
examines these skills only for faculty members, university employees, undergrads, and graduate
students in order to improve their research skills (Alhumood, 2011; Alamoudi & Alsulami, 2008;
Aloshan, 2013; Alshehry, 2014; Alsereihy & Alsuraihi, 2009; Amer, 2015; Farag, 2015). All of
these studies also examined library and research literacy, media literacy, and information ethics.
Other studies have focused on implementing these skills in the classroom as information
computer technology skills (Almulhim, 2014). However, extensive “evidence clearly indicates
that Saudi pre-service teachers are not being effectively prepared for the information age”
(Almulhim, 2014, p. 489). Although many studies examined these skills as self-knowledge that
learners acquired on their own, there are currently no Saudi studies that have examined
information literacy as skills that teachers can use in the classroom.
To help fill this research gap, the present study evaluated female pre-service teachers and
measured their information literacy based on the information literacy standards for teacher
education approved by the ACRL during the Executive Committee meeting on May 11, 2011
and created from the concepts of the information literacy competency standard for higher
education that aims to accomplish the following (as quoted from the EBSS Instruction for
Educators Committee, 2011, p. 1):

6
•

Guide teacher education faculty and instructional Librarians in developing
information literacy instruction for teacher education students.

•

Enable the evaluation and assessment of such instruction and curricula through
benchmarking outcomes.

•

Aim to communicate to teacher education students’ expectations for information
literacy knowledge and skills they need to develop and apply in their academic work
and pre-service teaching.

•

Aim to lead teacher education students to consider how they might integrate
information literacy into their future curriculum, instruction, and assessment activities
once a member of the teaching profession.

I was also interested to learn whether their knowledge of information literacy would be
apparent in their practice with future students and if they implemented all information literacy
components, especially critical literacy as an evaluation process on information skills. Moreover,
this study sought to determine whether participants had to work with librarians to implement
these skills during their teacher preparation program with faculty members.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to identify pre-service teachers’
competency and future classroom practice regarding information literacy. Another purpose was
to identify pre-service teachers’ perceptions of the librarian’s role in developing information
literacy practice. The study was also designed to identify the faculty members’ perceptions of
pre-service teachers’ practice of information literacy.
Significance of the Study
Short-term goals for the findings of this study included the following:

7
1. Help pre-service teachers recognize the importance of information literacy skills as
lifelong learning skills not only in the academic field, but in their daily life as well.
2. Help pre-service teachers understand the role of librarians and the library to cooperate
with faculty to enhance their information skills.
3. Investigate the importance of implementing information literacy with future students,
not only as research skills, but as evaluation skills as well.
Some long-term goals of this study were as follows:
1. Improve pre-service teacher programs, enabling them to provide practical
instructional classes that improve information literacy for their training and future
classroom practice.
2. Show the importance of the librarian’s role and provide more practical training
programs in which faculty members and librarians collaborate to show pre-service
teachers the importance of cooperative work among faculty.
3. Show the importance of encouraging information literacy skills before students enter
the university.
4. Foster a new generation of citizens that understands the importance of information
literacy skills for independent and lifelong learning.
Assumptions
This study assumed that participants honestly presented their information literacy
competency for evaluation. They were also expected to share their perceptions about librarians
and their future use of information literacy.

8
Limitations
This study encountered limitations in the quantitative as well as the qualitative phase. In
the quantitative phase, the limitation was the number of academic disciplines represented in the
sample by the social science colleges students’ majors that I accessed such as: Arabic,
Fundamentals of Religion, Sharia, Addiaoh, Social Science and English. For the qualitative
phase, included only Social Science students as a major in the social science college. The
university did not allow me to interview more than eight students due to the students’ workloads
with their teaching practice and major.
Delimitations
Since this study was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn
Saud Islamic University and targeted a specific major, perspectives from other majors,
universities, and nationalities were absent. Because all participants were women, the perspectives
of male teachers and students were likewise absent.
Research Questions
The following research questions were used to guide the study data collection and
discussion of finding.
RQ1: To what extent are female Saudi pre-service teachers knowledgeable about
information literacy? This question is broken down into two sub-questions:
a) How do they find, identify, articulate, evaluate, synthesize, and effectively use
information?
b) Is the purpose of this knowledge to seek information for themselves as future teachers
or to improve their future students’ information literacy competence?

9
RQ2: How do female Saudi pre-service teachers describe their perceptions of practicing
information literacy in their future classrooms? Are they prepared to apply information literacy
in their teaching?
RQ3: How do female Saudi pre-service teachers describe their perceptions of the
librarian’s role in enhancing information literacy?
RQ4: How do female Saudi faculty members describe their perceptions of their students’
information literacy practice?
Theoretical Framework
From the research questions, four important themes stood out that I sought to gain a
deeper understanding of:
1. Pre-service teachers’ competency in information literacy
2. Pre-service teachers’ preparation to practice information literacy with their students
3. The librarian’s role in increasing information literacy
4. Faculty members’ perceptions about their students’ practice of information literacy
A social constructivist paradigm was chosen as the theoretical framework for this study
because it focuses on the relationship between pre-service teachers, information literacy
competency, and pre-service teachers’ future practice in the classroom. This helped me
understand whether participants’ information literacy could be transferred to their future students
or was specific to their research needs as college students. The librarian’s role was examined as
to how it supported participants’ teaching practices and helped them address their future
students’ needs.
Vygotsky believes that the individual influences his or her cognitive system by
interacting with others in a social group, a theory known as social constructivism (as cited in

10
Oxford, 1997). This means that people learn through collaboration with others to influence their
understanding and to improve society. Therefore, this theory was expected to be useful in
examining how pre-service teachers’ information literacy improves by working with librarians to
enhance their cognitive skills. The theory also supports improving teacher-student collaboration
in regard to information literacy and the librarian’s role in encouraging it.
Vygotsky mentioned that social constructivism focuses on the importance of the learning
environment and social interaction because these factors shape the learner’s interests (as cited in
Oxford, 1997). This interaction is related to any stage of communication between people, which
“involve[s] sharing, comparing, and debating among learners and mentors” (Applefield, Huber,
& Moallem, 2001, p. 7). This perspective on social constructivism is related to the present study
as it seeks to understand the relationship between students, faculty members, and librarians and
how that relationship shapes information literacy competency. The study also examined whether
the interaction between pre-service teachers, librarians, and students empowers student interests
and enriches their cognitive knowledge.
In support of this theoretical framework, Emmons et al. (2009) studied how evidencebased practice could enhance information literacy practice in a teacher preparation program.
They presented eight courses that implemented information literacy skills. Asselin and Doiron
(2004) claimed that inquiry-based learning supports information literacy competency among
teachers. Probert (2009) illustrated that information competency helps create “literate and
numerate; critical and creative thinkers; active seekers, users and creators of knowledge;
informed decision makers” (p. 25). Moore (2005) mentioned, “information literacy exists, in
pedagogical terms, at the confluence of resource-based practice, constructivist and metacognitive
theories, and the practice of developing thinking skills through modeling and scaffolding” (p. 2).

11
These researchers presented information literacy skills as a way to influence different instruction
and learning skills related to constructivist theory. They also illustrate the importance of the
learning process in developing the learners’ interest in understanding the function and context of
the information around them.
Definition of Terms
Information literacy and information literate:
To be information literate, a person must be able to recognize when information is
needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed
information. Producing such a citizenry will require that schools and colleges appreciate
and integrate the concept of information literacy into their learning programs and that
they play a leadership role in equipping individuals and institutions to take advantage of
the opportunities inherent within the information society. Ultimately, information literate
people are those who have learned how to learn. They know how to learn because they
know how knowledge is organized, how to find information, and how to use information
in such a way that others can learn from them. They are people prepared for lifelong
learning, because they can always find the information needed for any task or decision at
hand. (American Library Association, 1989, p. 1)
Information literacy skills: “refer to an individual’s ability to know when there is a need
for information, and be able to identify, locate, evaluate, and effectively use that information for
the issue or problem at hand” (Kovalik, Jensen, Schloman, & Tipton, 2010, p. 147).
Information literacy standards: curriculum standards developed to help evaluate to
what degree students use information literacy depending on their level of education.

12
Information literacy as seeking: ability or competence of individuals to practice
information literacy skills to support their information research and improve as researchers.
According to Taala (2016), “Information [literacy] Seeking Behavior is congruent to [the]
Information Needs of an individual dealing [with] the process [of] how to find needed
information” (p. 1).
Information literacy as providing: ability or competency of individuals to practice
information literacy skills to support and improve their information research as well as to
become instructionally knowledgeable to provide these skills to students and enhance their use of
those skills.
Pre-service teachers: student teachers who have finished the majority of required classes
in the education department and apply for teacher training with cooperating schools.
Information literacy teacher:
[An] IL teacher should recognize and determine the need and extent of information,
evaluate it with respect to its sources, classify, store, manipulate and redraft information
collected or generated, and use information. Teachers according to Information Literacy
standards need to create new knowledge, solve problems and make decisions, and
understand economics, legal, social, political and cultural issues in the use of information.
(Al-Atyat & Jwaifell, 2014, p. 102)
Librarian: media proficient or professional teacher who has a minimum of two years of
practice in classroom instruction and experience with library resources, manages library
knowledge, and collaborates with teachers to build lesson plans and classroom activities.

13
Summary
Chapter 1 demonstrated the overall importance of this topic and focused on pre-service
teachers’ information literacy and their interest to use these skills as researchers and future
teachers. It also focused on the importance of the librarians’ role to collaborate with pre-service
teachers to improve their learning and teaching experiences. This chapter stated the research
problem and purpose of the study as well as the limitations, assumptions, research questions,
definition of terms, and theoretical framework that shows the research philosophy of the study.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
As stated before, information literacy is a set of skills that students need in order to cope
with the demands of the information age. These skills assist individuals in responding to news
about world issues and in knowing how to use their knowledge to address these issues.
Information literacy has recently occupied a more important status in the education system,
especially in higher education. The Association of College and Research Librarians (ACRL), the
American Association of School Libraries (AASL), the International Federation of Library
Associations and Institutions (IFLA), the American Libraries Association (ALA), the Chartered
Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP), and the National Forum on
Information Literacy (NFIL) have focused on these skills as an educational hot topic that helps
teachers, faculty members, and librarians assist students with these skills and link their research
to their teaching practices.
Numerous studies (e.g., Alhumood, 2011; Alsereihy & Alsuraihi, 2009; Floyd et al.,
2008; Lee, Reed, & Laverty, 2012; Lombard, 2010; Probert, 2009) adopted the ACRL definition
of information literacy as “the ability to recognize when information is needed and have the
ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information (Association of College
and Research Librarians, 2000, p. 4). In addition, Alamoudi and Alsulami (2008) as well as
Aloshan (2013), defined information literacy as a way of locating information, applying it
correctly at the right time, and communicating it ethically. Alhumood (2011) agrees with the
ACRL’s definition of information literacy as the capability to find information resources and to
use their standards to evaluate, synthesize, and present information. These studies focus on the
information literacy as abilities that learners should have in order to acquire information literacy

15
skills, which is more focused in research skills. Those studies recognized information literacy as
a research skill developed during research classes that could not be woven into other subject
matters classes (Lee, Reed, & Laverty, 2012). In this case, the learner will be better equipped to
cope with research assignments.
In contrast, Emmons et al. (2009) defined information literacy as the ability of the student
to extend his knowledge to “solve problems, create new ideas, make informed decisions, and
turn data into meaning” (p. 142). It can also be the ability to add questions to answers (Miller,
2005). Other studies argued that information literacy is more than the coping skills that students
use, but also can be an aid to a lifelong learning process (Latham & Gross, 2008; Tiemensma,
2012). Under this definition, learners’ work to enhance their ability to locate, evaluate, and
analyze information in order to use it at the academic level and in daily life. The desired outcome
of using these skills is to help learners go further in their work by solving academic and workrelated problems or to be better socialized in society.
Specialized training will not only allow pre-service teachers to improve their research
skills but also to enable them to teach said skills to future learners, a topic related to this study’s
main interests. Hence, information literacy is the ability to know how to find information from
various media and to articulate, evaluate, and synthesize that information depending on the
individual’s needs in an academic or everyday setting in order to become a lifelong learner.
Importance of Information Literacy
Information literacy is significant in formal educational as well as throughout the
learner’s life beyond academia. Information literacy encourages skill development that
influences people to become independent lifelong learners (Alsereihy & Alsuraihi, 2009).
Encouraging these skills from a young age improves learners’ interests in discovering new

16
knowledge. These skills also encourage them to develop their metacognitive learning strategies,
which will improve such learning skills as evaluation, critical thinking, discovery learning, and
creativity (Ornstein & Hunkins, 2009). In this sense, information literacy is important not only to
improve research skills but also to help individuals independently construct their learning
experience. Therefore, many librarians from the last thirty years encouraged integrating practice
in learning these skills through the education system, depending on the learners’ level (Kovalik
et al., 2010). Waggoner and Ranger (1996) commented on this topic as follows:
Without information literacy skills, graduates [students who graduate form
school] are ill-equipped for lifelong learning. They are ill-equipped to manage their
information needs. We live in a rapidly changing, complex world. Information literacy is
no longer a matter of looking up a title in a card catalog, if it ever was. It is a difficult
competency to acquire, but it is a necessity. (pp. 82–83)
Information literacy skills also help learners become more competitive in the 21st century
educational environment (Alamoudi & Alsulami, 2008; Lee, Reed, & Laverty, 2012). Emphasis
on these skills influences the instruction technique of ‘meaning-making search’ that involves
students in the learning process by helping them use their own experiences to interpret new
information (Applefield, Huber, & Moallem, 2001).
Floyd et al. (2008) demonstrated that information literacy among college students is
beneficial in the form of research skills but would be even more effective if integrated into
homework assignments and research papers. In the fall 2014, these researchers designed a
research course that integrated IL skills and then developed a case study based in their
experiences as elementary teachers. In this course, the pre-service teachers were required to
implement more scholarly resources throughout their practice. However, the participants did not

17
experience any improvement in IL. So, during spring 2015, the researchers again did the study,
but with integrated a partnership with librarians. As a result, these participants demonstrated
positive scores when applying to these IL skills through their research work as opposed to the
participants in the fall 2014 semester. Consequently, the researchers concluded the importance of
integrating these skills through course assignments and that the inclusion of the librarians proved
to have a positive effect. Likewise, Alhumood (2011) found that 64% of students and faculty
members who participated reported information literacy to be important for fulfilling research
requirements and only 27% for achieving self-knowledge. Since individuals surveyed tended to
focus their attention on this competency solely for the purpose of passing a class, they did not
attempt self-knowledge, which powers longer-term skills, such as critical thinking, problem
solving, and discovery learning.
According to Alsereihy and Alsuraihi (2009), information literacy’s importance goes
beyond defining, finding, accessing, and evaluating information academically; it is also
applicable to cultural, economic, legal, social, and political concerns. From this point of view,
information literacy competency could be actively applied in everyday life in ways that could
lead to improvements to society. Information literacy competency can make learners not only
self-knowledgeable about topics that are interesting to them but also more likely to collaborate
with others to influence knowledge and understanding to improve society (Lee, Reed, & Laverty,
2012). This point is directly related to the research interests of the present study as connecting
the significance of information literacy skills to the individual’s life practice can help improve
society.
However, the present study examined pre-service teachers and thus had a more academic
focus. Information literacy comprises important skills for any academic researcher (Alshehry,

18
2014; Alhumood, 2011; Farag, 2015); these skills can improve their research and enable them to
teach those skills in the classroom (Alamoudi & Alsulami, 2008; Amer, 2015). For pre-service
teachers and university faculty, integrating information literacy skills through their class work
assignments is more useful than helping students address their individual research needs.
Furthermore, helping pre-service teachers understand that these skills can be instructional, rather
than purely for self-research, encourages teachers and their students to become lifelong,
independent learners (O’Hanlon, 1988). It is also important for instructors to integrate these
skills into their future teaching practice (Branch, 2003). Emmons et al. (2009) addressed issues
surrounding evidence-based practice on classroom work. Van Ingen and Ariew (2015)
mentioned that information literacy skills in pre-service teacher preparation should not omit the
relationship between research and practice. However, they did not explain whether the practice
element referred to research practices used to manage teaching methodology or to going beyond
that to influence the information literacy of their students, which was an important concern of the
present study.
For in-service teachers, information literacy skills should be integrated first as a skills
because they need to increase their subject matter knowledge to enhance their lesson plans and
teaching methods to ending up with good attitude to develop that with their students (Miller,
2005; Seely, Fry, & Ruppel, 2011). However, Shipman (2014) mentioned that some in-service
teachers faced difficulties coping with the demands of the information age when developing their
professional work, enhancing their cognitive information skills, and addressing their students’
lack of reading skills and ability to find information (Miller, 2005). Such problems show the
importance for teachers to develop these skills. Such skills could enhance the learning process,
the search for information, and problem solving abilities to create a new generation of

19
information analysts and critics. The lack of research along these lines is an important gap the
present study seeks to address.
Information Literacy Competency
Information literacy competency consists of the ability to recognize when information is
needed and to be able to locate, evaluate, synthesize, and present that information. This process
is becoming increasingly recognized among educators; however, its practice is often less than
uniform. Each educator’s perspective on these skills has resulted in different ways of
understanding this competency, which affects their practice. Depending on their point of view,
some educators see information literacy as influencing the learner’s research ability but only
during the learning process in a class (Lee, Reed, & Laverty, 2012). However, to other educators
it is more important to influence their students’ interests. These different ways of understanding
the importance of these skills influences the educators as instructors to teach their students how
to apply these skills in one of two different ways. First, the instructor influences these skills
between students as a researcher seeking practice to enhance their knowledge only. However, the
second way is by influencing these IL skills as a researcher with the ability to understand how to
provide it in their future teaching and how to influence their future students to use it. In the first
way, we create a generation of educators who are interested in research, but the second approach
enhances educators who are capable of research and demonstrates how to apply this competency
for the generations after them.
To show the levels of information literacy competency, I used the Information Literacy
Standards for Teacher Education, created by the EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee
(2011) as a conceptual framework to evaluate pre-service teachers’ information literacy skills,
which include defining the need for, locating, organizing, synthesizing, evaluating, and ethically

20
using information. Under each standard there are different indicators that educators could use to
evaluate students’ information literacy competency level.
Defining the Need for Information
Defining the need for information is the ability to define, articulate, select strategies, and
use tools to find and understand needed information (EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee,
2011, pp. 2–4). This definition is based on the learner’s purpose for finding information, such as
to improve research papers, build a lesson plan or presentation, or influence class activities. This
point illustrates the division between being a seeker or provider of information.
According to Alamoudi and Alsulami (2008), information literacy is often defined as
seeking out research information that the learners use for classwork. According to the
Information Literacy Standards for Teacher Education, information literacy involves learners
determining what information they need, which includes their ability to recognize “The nature,
extent, type, and format of information needed; the intended audience such as school children,
college classmates, or professional educators; or the scope, length, purpose, and role of the
specific information-seeking task” (EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee, 2011, p. 3).
Furthermore, learners are more willing to evaluate their information needs depending on the
assignment. Students or pre- and in-service teachers will seek to understand information that they
need depending on the reason for presenting it. For instance, the needs for presenting to a class
will likely differ from those for presenting to an education conference.
To define the information needs of learners (e.g., teacher education students), learners
need to explore a variety of information sources to increase their understanding of the topic.
Therefore, library and web research skills are invaluable for learners to enhance their cognitive
learning skills (Shipman, 2014). This process also involves “defining or modifying the

21
information needs to achieve a manageable focus” (EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee,
2011, p. 3). Learners can also formulate their information needs depending on their learning
interests. Defining information needs empowers learners to explain and revise the given
information to feed their interests and influence their drive to learn. Enhancing this ability will
make learners more capable of exploring information and engaging in problem solving (Bruner,
1960). However, for many undergraduate students, “successful information seeking need only be
measured by the ability to find the information, not the process used to get there” (Gross &
Latham, 2009, p. 341). According Julien and Barker (2009) many students preferred using a web
search rather than the library “because it is perceived as convenient and familiar, and searching
by keyword is easy” (p. 14), which saves them time to search through the library stacks.
Therefore, students’ ability to find the needed information is limited and depends on their ability
to use the library, Internet, and other resources to meet their academic needs.
Articulating the need for information is the learners’ way of coherently explaining or
exploring ideas in words. The Information Literacy Standards for Teacher Education sets out
certain target outcomes for articulating information needs, which in turn help determine the
learner’s level of information literacy (EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee, 2011). These
outcomes include “Formulating the key questions to develop and clarify the information need,”
“Breaking down the information need into component concepts and terms,” and “Brainstorming
and selecting synonyms and alternative words that represent the component” (p. 3). The process
of articulating information needs influences critical thinking and problem solving, allowing
learners to construct their own meaning and improve their metacognitive skills (Lee, Reed, &
Laverty, 2012; O’Hanlon, 1988). However, depending on the interests of teacher education
students, these skills could become purely research skills or influence their teaching skills.

22
Whether these skills influence teaching approaches depends on whether the learners’
environment encourages this practice.
Teacher education students also need to select strategies and tools to address their
information needs. In order to select such strategies, learners need to be knowledgeable about
using library and web resources (EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee, 2011). For
instance, pre-service teachers must be able to effectively use keywords in searches, consider
other relevant sources related to the topic, and know how educational resources are organized.
To select the tools for defining their information needs, pre-service teachers need to be
knowledgeable about using professional and academic sources to identify useful information. In
this case, the learner has to select appropriate resources and use the library services for support if
needed. Floyd et al. (2008) reported that many undergraduate students did not understand the
importance of selecting the appropriate tool by examining their bibliographies during their search
for information; therefore, the authors built courses that help students understand how to select
appropriate academic tools.
Locating and Selecting Information
Another part of information literacy is the ability to locate the information that learners
need outside of educational resources. For instance, the learner should be familiar with using
data sources, such as the Library of Congress, the Dewey Decimal system, and search engines,
such as Boolean and proximity operators. According to Islam and Rahman (2014), most of their
participants (67% of the 207) did not use all the tools in the Boolean operators to search for
information. This figure demonstrates that universities and teaching institutions need to offer
more courses to address gaps in student knowledge in this area.
Learners should also be knowledgeable about hyperlinks, citing references in online

23
sources, and library services, such as interlibrary loan (EBSS Instruction for Educators
Committee, 2011). Overall, the learners must be able to use any academic research material,
whether electronic or paper.
Organizing and Analyzing Information
The organization of information is the ability to maintain information in a way that makes
it accessible and useful later, which can take the form of using organizational programs and
resources, such as Zotero or EndNote (EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee, 2011).
Analyzing information involves “analyzing the structure, logic, and presentation of
information and any supporting arguments or method” (EBSS Instruction for Educators
Committee, 2011, p. 5). In this case, pre-service teachers have to understand the information that
they need and determine how their educational philosophy and theoretical perspective could
influence how they use that information. Learners have to recognize the difference between
formal and informal information and understand their appropriateness to the situation.
Undergraduate students often show a lack of knowledge about the differences between resources,
such as research reports, case studies, or primary vs. secondary sources (Floyd et al., 2008).
However, as undergraduate students they did not analyze how theoretical perspective and
educational philosophy affect how the individual reads, writes about, and presents information.
Synthesizing, Processing, and Presenting Information
Synthesizing one’s information needs involves locating new information and connecting
it with old information to form and present a deeper understanding of it. The ability to synthesize
is difficult to manage for many graduate and undergraduate students because of their difficulty
understanding how to apply these skills in practice (Alamoudi & Alsulami, 2008). To synthesize
information, learners need to know how to use different resources, such as multimedia and

24
documents, to present the information clearly. This process could be learned by seeking out
information and building research papers and presentations; however, a more successful
approach may be when teachers use different student learning materials for synthesizing
information.
To process information, pre-service teachers should have the ability to use the
information that they gathered. This involves “extending ideas, information, and concepts when
possible, to a higher level of abstraction to construct new information, theories, or hypotheses”
(EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee, 2011, p. 6). This part of the EBSS Instruction for
Educators Committee standard reflects an interest in providing information to students and
connecting research to teaching practices. Pre-service teachers need courses that increase their
competency in information literacy skills and their understanding of how to apply it in their
teaching process by influencing their modules (Bushong & Boff, 2008), such as by combining
teaching methods from different fields. Stockham and Collins (2012) mentioned different
strategies to help students become information literate learners, such as “Information Power
Standards, Handy 5 or Big 6, all of which address competencies recognized for K-12 IL skills”
(p. 66).
Lastly, learners have to be willing to present information by organizing it, using different
technologies, and adjusting the presentation to the audience. The learner also has to respect
academic copyright and use information accurately and ethically. Learners have different
techniques for presenting information, depending on whether they are primarily researchers or
teachers.

25
Evaluating Information
To evaluate their information needs, pre-service teachers should examine and critically
analyze the information to determine its reliability. They must also question the information and
the sources that use it. In this case, learners should examine this information through their
particular perspective and recognize and evaluate the writer’s perspective, philosophy, and biases
(EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee, 2011). The evaluation as a IL skill process not only
enhances the pre-service teachers’ evaluation of the information-seeking process itself, but also,
the students will be more confident in their IL skills in order to evaluate other research skills
(Kovalik et al., 2010). Through this evaluation process, pre-service teachers can become
successful in pre-review skills and assessment of information literacy as skills.
Ethical Use of Information
The ethical use of information is the ability to use information in a logical, ethical way
that avoids plagiarism. The learners should provide the resources they have used in a systematic
list and respect the copyright of other authors. To this end, learners should have the ability to use
the “appropriate documentation style to cite or give credit to original information sources”
(EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee, 2011, p. 8).
Pre-service Teacher Preparation
Although universities should require pre-service teachers to gain information literacy,
there are still some teacher preparation programs that do not include these skills as an important
element. As a result, studies have shown this competency to be lacking. According to Miller
(2005), the teachers in her study had not received any training about information literacy during
their pre-service program. Likewise, Branch (2003) illustrated that in interviews pre-service
teachers felt the preparation program did not present information literacy and that their

26
knowledge was dependent on self-learning. Learners in these studies improved their information
literacy competency by working independently. However, even if they attain this knowledge to
support their work, they still need guidance about the standards in order to teach them. In these
cases, the learning environment failed to provide opportunities to practice these skills. Alsereihy
and Alsuraihi (2009) mentioned that at the libraries of King Saud University, King Abdul-Aziz
University, and Imam Muhammad bin Saud University, students and faculty lacked information
literacy training or workshops to improve their knowledge as self-researchers because the
librarians themselves lacked this knowledge. While the study found a lack of support from the
librarians and library, the study did not examine the university educational program to determine
whether it had any information literacy competency practice. The study also is more focused on
the role of the library, which in my perspective tends to focus more on self-research skills in its
assistance to faculty and students.
Some studies have mentioned that in university educational programs, especially preservice teacher training, there is a need for information literacy courses, but the implementation
of these courses depends on the university’s view on information literacy content. Therefore,
some universities include information literacy as information seeking research for learners to
improve their classwork (Alamoudi & Alsulami, 2008; Alhumood ,2014; Amer, 2015; Aloshan,
2013; 2011; Farag, 2015; Floyd et al., 2008; Latham & Gross, 2008; Miller, 2005). This happens
when universities connect information literacy competency to library research skills. Therefore,
as research I found that universities required research and library skills classes for their students,
which is a way to improve their research skills.
However, according to the EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee’s Information
Literacy Standards for Teacher Education (2011), to gain information literacy, students must

27
improve their presentation and evaluation skills in addition to library skills. However, other
universities see themselves as information literacy providers to help pre-service teachers improve
their future teaching practices (Asselin & Doiron, 2004; Branch, 2003; Emmons et al., 2009; Van
Ingen & Ariew, 2015; Lee, Reed, & Laverty, 2012; Probert, 2009; Seely et al., 2011; Stockham
& Collins, 2012; Williams & Wavell, 2007). These studies have shown that pre-service practice
focuses on improvement to research work, which according to the standard for information
literacy competency is considered self-research seeking skills. For example, according to Witt
and Dickinson (2004), pre-service teachers have the opportunity to improve their skills in
information literacy at the Illinois Wesleyan University by cooperating with librarians. This
cooperation not only mentors pre-service teachers’ self-seeking teaching skills, but also helps
them become knowledgeable in these skills for the purpose of their future teaching careers. In
addition, to improve their information literacy skills, students need to practice these skills by
incorporating them into the curriculum (Anafo & Filson, 2014).
Information Literacy as Seeking
Seeking information is a form of knowledge acquisition whereby individuals work to
improve their information literacy, but seeking knowledge depends upon the needs of the seeker.
According to Alhumood (2011), faculty and students at the University of Kuwait believed that
knowledge about information literacy tended to be self-research knowledge related to their
academic research purposes and was used to meet university requirements. Similarly, Amer
(2015), at the University of Zawia in Libya, found that faculty members believed their
knowledge was limited to self-research knowledge in order to be successful in their work or
daily life. According to these studies, information literacy competency is limited to the learners
enhancing their research work and building a research environment. This means that encouraging

28
these competencies will improve the learners’ cognitive skills as well as the society around them.
Alamoudi and Alsulami (2008) mentioneded that university students were more
interested in information literacy as research-seeking knowledge; however, their level of interest
was related to their major and learning requirements, with 88% of the education majors and 87%
of science majors showing interest. This shows that the students’ information literacy was more
practiced in the education department than in the science department. Additionally, in this study
improvement in this competency was required for classwork and educational reasons.
Aloshan (2013) conducted a study with visually impaired college students and found a need for
using media information literacy to focus on their self-seeking knowledge and achieve university
learning requirements. Overall, these studies focused on the importance of information literacy
competency for meeting learners’ educational requirements. However, none of these studies presented
the importance of these competencies in terms of developing learner interest, improving self-efficacy, or
improving society. To become an independent and lifelong learner, it is necessary to understand how
information literacy can have a positive effect not only on learners’ education but on their social life as
well. Therefore, teacher education programs and faculty members need to encourage information
literacy to be taught beyond basic research skills and for instruction to include more library or
information literacy instruction (Witt & Dickinson, 2004). This will help learners as future teachers go
from using these skills mainly for self-research to being able to provide this knowledge to students.
Teaching Information Literacy (Providing)
To impart information literacy skills in the classroom to pre- and in-service teachers,
their knowledge must become more than self-research oriented. They also need to understand
how these skills can improve their teaching environment and their students’ learning practices.
Teaching information literacy in the classroom provides information literacy in self-work but

29
also helps teachers improve their subject matter content, lesson plans, teaching methods, and
extends to students to make them information literate learners. Floyd et al. (2008) mentioned that
pre-service teachers could not be considered knowledgeable about information literacy by taking
one course through their four years of study. This knowledge is self-research knowledge
acquired for research classes and to provide their future students with more self-knowledge work
improvement (Probert, 2009; Van Ingen & Ariew, 2015).
As mentioned in Asselin and Doiron (2004), “the skills associated with information
literacy such as working with the research process are very much a part of revitalized methods
courses, but little is done to show pre-service teachers how to develop these skills with their
future students” (p. 24). Therefore, pre-service teachers need a deeper knowledge about the
content of information literacy to understand how to apply it to future classes with more
confidence. Nevertheless, Stockham and Collins (2012) mentioned that pre-service teachers at
Kansas University were knowledgeable about the concept of information literacy but that this
competency was limited to self-provided information. As a result, they could not extend these
competencies to their classroom practice with students because they were not prepared to use
modules to help pre-K-12 students become information literate learners; these modules included
“Information Power Standards, Handy 5 or Big 6, all of which address competencies recognized
for K-12 IL skills” (p. 66). These modules help students become information literate.
Numerous studies have shown that pre-service and in-service teachers had greater
information literacy in regard to improving classwork but were not prepared to teach information
literacy skills, which also improve solving problem and critical thinking skills. This is
connecting to Bushong and Boff (2008) who recommended removing the gap between research
and practice by implementing information literacy model classes for pre-service teachers to

30
practice these skills. According to them, this course would make pre-service teachers “able to
create effective learning experiences for PreK-12 students that integrate the research process into
the curriculum” (p. 7). They also mentioned that preparing pre-service teachers to apply
information literacy models, especially Big6, in their teaching would enhance students’ interest
in becoming information literate. Big6 is a research model that “demonstrated in the course by
using the example of purchasing a new automobile and includes research terminology familiar to
educators” (Bushong & Boff, 2008, p. 9). This model also empowered teachers to practice
information research by using library guides and technology tools to influence practicing this
model and others like it. The model could thus help pre-K-12 students accept the idea of using
information academically, preparing them for future lifelong learning. In turn, fostering this
ability in pre-K-12 students can influence them to use information literacy to improve the
community around them.
Emmons et al. (2009) sought to improve pre-service knowledge about information
literacy for both self-research purposes and future classroom instruction. Therefore, the
researchers integrated information literacy in eight courses from the second to the fourth
semesters of a teacher preparation program, including a special education class for methods, field
experiences, classroom organization and management, teaching students with reading problems,
teaching social studies for elementary students, curriculum, assessment, and professional
seminars. This integration of skills for all classes was meant to improve self-knowledge skills
because as Emmons et al. (2009) mentioned, “historically there has been a gap between theory
taught in teacher preparation programs and the reality our students find in their classrooms and
schools” (p. 147). This means that the teaching of information literacy should be improved to
make it easier for pre-service teachers to integrate it into their classrooms.

31
According to Lee, Reed, and Laverty (2012), 36% of pre-service teachers mentioned that
they had “planned a lesson for students that focused on how to search for information” (p. 11),
but no “opportunity to learn how to teach their students the IL and other information skills” (p.
16). This was in accord with Seely et al. (2011), as they stated that pre-service teachers needed
information literacy to develop the content of lesson plans and research-based teaching practice.
Making these skills woven into all teaching methods rather than relegating them to research
could apply this finding.
Furthermore, Miller (2005) stated that teachers did not have any self-knowledge that they
could transfer to their students and that “all agreed that it would have been useful to have had
training in the implementation of information literacy” in their classroom and for their students
(p. 10). Branch (2003) added that “these information literacy outcomes were aimed at facilitating
the pre-service teachers’ own school success rather than toward helping pre-service teachers
think about how they would teach information literacy skills in their own classrooms” (p. 37).
Accepting that information literacy competency is a positive first step to improving the
educational system and society by encouraging independent, lifelong learning, one resource for
the improvements mentioned in this section is working with specialists, such as librarians.
Witt and Dickinson (2004) claimed that preparing pre-service teachers with information
literacy is not enough to handle using these skills in their teaching. They also need pedagogical
training and cooperation with librarians. Pre-service teachers thus need to acknowledge the
librarian’s role as an educator that can provide them with support and to influence information
literacy skills in their teaching practice. Witt and Dickinson (2004) stated that collaboration
between information literacy and pedagogical instruction has “had the effect of moving the

32
instruction of pre-service teachers from teaching resource and behavior based skills to processbased teaching with the intention of information future pedagogy” (p. 78).
Witt and Dickinson (2004) explained that pre-service teachers needed to understand how
to apply information literacy competency as part of assignments that require students to use
library and research resources. Merely performing research assignments does not prepare preservice teachers to become providers of this competency. Instead, pre-service teachers need to
understand and experience information literacy models in their teaching practice; this connection
can allow them to close the gap between research and the actual practice of teaching information
literacy. According to Bushong and Boff (2008), pre-service teachers become aware of how they
can use information literacy in their teaching after participating in practice courses that integrate
information literacy models and techniques in the curriculum. Their results were derived from
the following:
Surveys and informal conversation with students [pre-service teachers] indicate
that at the conclusion of the course there is a much greater awareness of online
resources available through INFOhio, OPLIN and OhioLINK; they have begun to
master the based activity using a comfortable software application. (p. 15)
This idea of using information literacy to seek out and provide information is closely
related to the present study’s main interest. The strategy described above can help close the gap
between seeking information and providing practice; more courses that incorporate teaching
models of information literacy and integrating librarians can serve to enhance this practice
among pre-service teachers in their future classrooms. This strategy will close the gap between
those seeking and providing practice because it will influence the pre-service teachers interested
in practicing their research skills depending on their course requirements that are related to their

33
major. Also, it will encourage them to move with confidence to not only understand how to
apply it in their teaching, but also to provide the search process for their students to be apply. To
determine their success, pre-service teachers also need to work with the librarians through all
their teaching needs that are required of them to implement research skills.
The Librarian’s Role in Improving Information Literacy
Miller (2005) defines the librarian as follows:
a professional teacher with a minimum of two years of successful classroom
experience and additional qualifications in the selection, management and utilization of
learning resources, who manages the school library and works with other teachers to
design and implement resource-based instructional programs. (p. 2)
Miller (2005) and Floyd et al. (2008) also mentioned that librarians—which could be
called media specialists, school librarians, school librarian media specialists, or librarian
instructors—could teach students to improve their research skills.
The librarian’s role is to help patrons find the information they need; however, this role is
broad and can include other functions. According to Asselin and Doiron (2004), the librarian’s
role is to improve the curriculum and to “Collaborate with teachers, teach information skills,
promote reading and lifelong learning, provide a wide range of resources, [and] use information
technology for learning” (p. 23). Moore (2001) mentioned the following:
Well-developed school library programmers are associated with particular levels
of physical resources and include specialist staff who:
•

Spend time explicitly teaching information literacy to students

•

Collaboratively plan instructional units with teachers

•

Provide in-service training to teachers

34
•

Teach cooperatively with classroom teachers

•

Attend to curriculum integration issues (pp. 4–5)

In regard to their relationship with teachers, librarians help teachers with subject matter
content and program design. According to Miller (2005), librarians or teacher librarians are those
who “work with other teachers to design and implement resource-based instructional programs”
to improve their class materials by including a research component and providing students with
different resources that are related to their class subject (p. 2). Branch (2003) and Emmons et al.
(2009) added that librarians act as partners who assist faculty members with workshops that help
pre-service teachers improve their information literacy skills. In this case, including librarians as
part of the learning process could increase information literacy used as learning skills. There are
a variety of places to include the librarian’s role in the pre-service teaching program; for
instance, they could be guest speakers or attend class discussion during the lecture to work
closely with pre-service teachers, not only to plan their research aims but also to improve their
learning strategies (Asselin & Doiron, 2004).
In addition, some researchers have seen the librarian’s role as a type of instructor that
teaches students and improves their research skills (Floyd et al., 2008; Miller, 2005; Tiemensma,
2012). Likewise, Seely et al. (2011) and Van Ingen and Ariew (2015) illustrated that the
librarians in their study taught pre-service teachers about information literacy, especially how to
evaluate the quality of information sources that they used in their final projects. Furthermore,
librarians can become counselors to help students identify their research questions, choose
studies related to their interests, and narrow their study focus (Van Ingen & Ariew 2015).
Librarians can also increase pre-service teacher knowledge about information literacy,
encouraging them to become lifelong learners. Stockham and Collins (2012) mentioned that

35
librarians provide “tools that can enhance their [pre-service teachers’] lifelong learning habits,
perhaps, in turn, those education students can impact their future students not just sporadically,
but as a matter of practice throughout a student’s educational career” (p. 59).
According to Lee, Reed, and Laverty (2012), “the majority of pre-service teachers (80%)
reported that they had not learned about the role of the teacher librarian in any” bachelor’s
degree in education (p. 12). In addition, Alamoudi and Alsulami (2008) stated that graduate
students reported the function of librarians to provide them with the information and training
programs needed to understand how to use the library resources. Seely et al. (2011) mentioned
that some students were overwhelmed by formative assessment with librarians because they
believed in their knowledge about information literacy and lacked an understanding of the
librarian’s role as an information provider. This showed that the educational system has to
change its point of view about the role of the librarian; universities should work with faculty to
enhance the role of the librarians to improve information literacy as well as support the needs
and interests of learners. Witt and Dickinson (2004) supported this sentiment:
The role of the library in providing instruction in critical competencies such as
research and critical thinking has gone largely unnoticed by the national and statewide
bodies that enact and implement the educational and teaching standards that are often the
impetus behind the curricula of teacher education programs.” (pp. 78–79)
In this case, understanding the real role of the librarian and the library should be part of
the education of faculty and teachers as well as expected from students and pre-service teachers.
Collaboration of Faculty Members to Increase Information Literacy
Working collaboratively with librarians carries several advantages that improve teacher
education programs and pre-service teacher knowledge about information literacy. According to

36
Kovalik et al. (2010), “teacher education programs may not be doing an adequate job in
preparing future teachers in information literacy skills and knowledge” (p. 148). Therefore,
encouraging collaboration between librarians and teachers could ultimately foster a learning
environment for pre-service teachers and their future students that incorporate information
literacy. This practice also encourages pre-service teachers to understand the meaning of this
partnership with librarians and to learn to incorporate it into their future teaching. Moore (2005)
claimed that any educational programs “involving teachers and teacher-librarians in authentic
learning situations that require intensively doing information literacy, through instructional
design and action research, appear to reap the most powerful changes in knowledge and practice”
(p. 11).
Additionally, Floyd et al. (2008) found that collaborative work with a librarian improved
student performance. Collaboration between the librarian and faculty can show learners the
importance of the librarian’s work and enhance their future teaching. According to MontielOverall & Hernández (2012), “teachers who participated in the intervention workshops changed
perception about collaboration between teachers and school librarians being important to
students learning, as did the librarians” (p. 16). This finding showed that adopting a more
collaborative point of view at the faculty level could also help build a new generation of teachers
who work more with librarians. According to teachers need the knowledge to be capable to
incorporate the technology with their teaching to cope with literacy and learning. He illustrated,
“Teaching students creative problem-solving, collaboration, and fluency with technology is not
only difficult, but it also represents a significant shift for most classroom teachers who are
tentative about using technology to support and extend learning” (p.480). This collaboration

37
would increase information literacy competency and learners’ motivation to improve themselves
and their society.
Summary
The relationship of the research literature to the research problem is key to understanding
and ultimately answering the research questions (Creswell, 2014). This literature review has
addressed each important theme of the present study. First, the discussion of information literacy
competency will be important when analyzing participant information literacy. While the studies
presented used a variety of methods when examining information competency, the present study
will use the EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee’s (2011) Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Teacher Education. The review focused on the importance of these
skills for students, teachers, and educators, as well as its use of the ACRL standard to evaluate
and understand information literacy. The second theme was the preparation of pre-service
teachers. The literature helped distinguish information literacy used for seeking information as
opposed to teaching information literacy. I found that many studies accepted using information
literacy for seeking information but not for encouraging students to improve society, which will
also be explored further in this study. The final theme was the role of librarians to improve
information literacy education and collaborate with teachers. Through the years, the librarian’s
role has become more like that of a teacher in addition to a provider of information at a library
helpdesk. This theme was discussed in the literature review because many studies minimize the
role of librarians, and I wish to understand pre-service teachers’ perspectives on this topic.

CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY
This chapter discusses the methods and research design used to answer the four research
questions:
RQ1: To what extent are female Saudi pre-service teachers knowledgeable about
information literacy? This question can be broken down into two sub-questions:
a) How do they find, identify, articulate, evaluate, synthesize, and effectively use
information?
b) Is the purpose of this knowledge to seek information for themselves as future teachers
or to improve their future students’ information literacy competence?
RQ2: How do female Saudi pre-service teachers describe their perceptions of practicing
information literacy in their future classrooms? Are they prepared to apply information literacy
in their teaching?
RQ3: How do female Saudi pre-service teachers describe their perceptions of the
librarian’s role in enhancing information literacy?
RQ4: How do female Saudi faculty members describe their perceptions of their students’
information literacy practice?
Research Method Design
In this study, I used a mixed-methods approach. Mixed methods is defined as “a
procedure for collecting, analyzing, and ‘mixing’ or integrating both quantitative and qualitative
data at some stage of the research process within a single study for the purpose of gaining a
better understanding of the research problem” (Ivankova, Creswell, & Stick, 2006). Mixed
methods is the most appropriate methodology design for collecting the data for this study

39
“because of its strength of drawing on both qualitative and quantitative research and minimizing
the limitations of both approaches” (Creswell, 2014, p. 218). Using mixed methods also helps
bridge the gap between the quantitative and qualitative research paradigms (Johnson &
Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). Furthermore, this methodology assisted me
in interpreting the data collected from the survey for the quantitative part and the interview for
the qualitative part. The quantitative part measured the participants’ competency in using
information literacy and its future applications in classroom practice. The qualitative data
measured the participants’ perceptions of their information literacy practice and the librarian’s
role in providing a deeper understanding. The qualitative data also measured the faculty
members’ perceptions of their students (pre-service) practice regarding information literacy.
This methodology is appropriate here because it afforded me a better understanding of
the quantitative data collected from the survey to build the qualitative interview questions.
According to Probert (2009), the questionnaire phase showed how teachers were knowledgeable
and familiar with information literacy. However, during the interviews he found that teachers did
not know how to practice information literacy with students. This is evidence that mixing
quantitative with qualitative techniques could give results that would lend themselves to a more
accurate conclusion (Creswell & Clark, 2011). Therefore, I selected a mixed methodology design
because it adds depth to the quantitative research, which could positively affect the results.
Likewise, Lee, Reed, and Laverty (2012) mentioned that pre-service teachers viewed their
knowledge narrowly as research skills rather than as instructional knowledge skills, as the
researchers indicated “they felt only somewhat prepared (39 percent) or poorly prepared or not
prepared (38 percent) to teach IL skills to their future students” (p. 9). This result shows that only
giving percentages reflecting their knowledge is not sufficient data because readers need more

40
evidence to understand and determine whether the research problem is important enough for
further study. Combining quantitative data derived from closed-ended questions with qualitative
data from open-ended questions will also increase the overall understanding of how to respond to
the research problem by answering the research questions from different perspectives.
I used the concurrent triangulation approach as a mixed-methods design. In this approach,
I collected the quantitative and qualitative data parallel and then compared the results to
determine if there were differences (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Concurrent Triangulation Mixed-Methods Design (Creswell, 2009, p. 210).
Reprinted with permission.
This mixed-methods model is described as, “ This model generally uses separate
quantitative and qualitative methods as a means to offset the weaknesses inherent within one
method with the strengths of the other” (Creswell, 2009, p. 213). This design can be used with
the quantitative and the qualitative data collection in an equal way. However, through the
practice of this design, the researcher can give one more attention rather than both.

41
Therefore, implementing a concurrent triangulation design increased the likelihood of
solving the research problem by providing a deeper understanding of the data through one
approach or the other. Also, this design has advantages in the data collection process that saves
time since both can be gathered at the same time.
Participants and Setting
The data were collected in Saudi Arabia at Imam Mohammed Islamic University.
Participants consisted of female pre-service teachers in their last year at the university and their
faculty members. For pre-service teachers, the study examined their information literacy
competency, how they will implement this knowledge in their future teaching, and their
understanding of the librarian’s role in enhancing their understanding of information literacy. I
used a non-experimental design to study the sample in the quantitative phase, as descriptive
research. The participants were students in the College of Social Science studying different
disciplines, including Arabic, Fundamentals of Religion, Sharia, Adiaoh, Social Science, and
English. They must finish all of their studies before taking a practicum class requirement that
relates to their major. However, for the faculty members, the study examined their perception
about their students (pre-service teachers) practice of information literacy.
Initially, the sample size for the mixed research design differs between the quantitative
and qualitative phases. Therefore, I adopted the Probert (2009) method of collecting the samples
for the two phases. I thus began with quantitative sampling, which “is [meant] to draw a
representative sample from the population, so that the results of studying the sample can then be
generalized back to the population” (Marshall, 1996, p. 522). The selection of the participants in
the quantitative phase was a systematic sample, whereby “the researcher chooses a random start
on a list and selects every X numbered people on the list” (Creswell, 2014, p. 158). In this case, I

42
chose a random group of students from each college because each had more than one section to
teach for practicum (Coyne, 1997). The use of random sampling helped reduce bias. The
selection technique also helped generalize the results because the accessible population had the
same weaknesses and strengths, which could be widespread in the target group.
The researcher surveyed 117 participants out of the overall population of 1,115 female
pre-service teachers, by distributing a survey. The sample size helped avoid potential random
sampling errors that come from selecting too small a group of participants (Marshall, 1996, p.
522). After introducing myself and presenting an overview of my research topic, I requested
participants to voluntarily sign the consent form and to give their permission to be participants in
the study. I distributed the survey on paper because of the impossibility of communicating with
all students electronically. However, as was mentioned previously, participation in this survey
was voluntary which is a reason there are higher numbers of participants in some majors than in
others.
In the qualitative interview phase, the researcher obtained responses to open-ended
questions that further explained the quantitative survey results (Marshall, 1996). Therefore, I
used purposeful sampling for the qualitative phase, whereby “the researcher actively selects the
most productive sample to answer the research question” (Marshall, 1996, p. 523). However,
there are numerous types of purposeful sampling techniques depending on the researcher’s needs
regarding open-ended questions, such as “homogeneous sampling, typical case sampling,
criterion sampling, and snowball sampling” (Palinkas et al., 2015, p. 3). I employed convenience
sampling, due to its ease of use in this case; I had a prior connection with the population in the
form of a common language, region of origin, culture, and lifestyle. I also had access to this
university as a former student.

43
To determine sample size, I examined the methodologies of related studies. Probert
(2009) chose 15 participants from three schools and 10 teachers from different disciplines. As a
result, I tried to examine each participant with her discipline and interests in mind. However, the
sample size of 25 participants might be too large for a thorough data analysis. Miller (2005)
studied five novice teachers who had a pre-existing relationship with the researcher. Such a
relationship could affect the data; in addition, the sample size would not be large enough for the
present study’s purposes. Therefore, I initially decided to use a sample size of 12 students
selected from the six colleges of the university and 4 from the faculty members. This sample size
was anticipated to be large enough to understand a variety of perspectives but small enough to
support a thorough analysis of those perspectives. It would also allow for connecting the results
to different academic disciplines. However, the university did not allow me to interview more
than eight students due to the students’ workloads with their teaching practice and major. As a
result, I only interviewed eight students from the Social Science Department and four from the
faculty members.

Instrument
Because this study adopted a concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design, it was
conducted in two phases. For the quantitative phase, the study included three important sections:
information literacy competency, pre-service teacher’s perceptions of their future practice of
information literacy and the librarian’s role. Therefore, I adopted Marshall’s (2006) instrument to
measure the information literacy competency of the pre-service teachers in the first section. This
instrument was used before as a tool to measure freshmen at St. Dominic College of Asia and
included 30 items (Taala, 2016). This instrument results in a reliability score using Cronbach
Alpha of .87%. Also, this study indicated that the majority of the freshman lacked the ability to
use information technology in a presentation, which indicated they needed further practice.
Also, this instrument was used as a reference point with instruments from other studies

45
focusing on Information Literacy competencies and was modified for a study by Zervas, Stavrou,
and Kounoudes (2015). In this study, the researchers built the survey based on the original
instrument and stated that it was more appropriate for the needs of their study. However, for the
present study’s needs, I took the same instrument as Marshall’s (2006), which contained only 10
themes, each containing four indicators, which in total included 40 indicators. As a researcher, I
believed that this instrument presented the standards of ACRL in detail, which helped me to
identify the pre-service teachers competency in information literacy.
In Taala’s (2016) study, indicators were measured on a seven-point Likert scale that
ranged from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree. The purpose of this instrument was also
to measure the individual’s understanding of how to use information. However, I modified this
instrument to include a five-point Likert scale that ranged from (Strongly disagree, disagree,
neither “no opinion”, agree, and strongly agree). This change was to facilitate the translation of
the instrument from English to Arabic as it was expected to improve the participants’
understanding of the instrument. This change also limited possible misconceptions that could
occur when participants had to choose between slightly disagree/agree and agree/disagree,
because sometimes these categories have the same meaning in Arabic. Also, According Dawes
(2012), who stated, “With a five-point scale, it is quite simple for the interviewer to read out the
complete list of scale descriptors (1 equals strongly disagree, 2 equals disagree...). This
clarification is lengthier for the seven-point format.” (p.2). The data also was easier to analyze on
a five-point Likert scale rather than the seven-point version (Questions 41–48).
To further adjust the instrument for the current study, I built the last two sections to add a
more supportive five-point Likert scale that helped expand the qualitative questions related to the
future practice of information literacy section, which had seven statements that divided to a five-

46
point scale. The last section is the librarian’s role, which included four points (Questions 49–53)
measured on a five-point Likert scale.
The final version of the instrument consisted of four sections. The first collected
demographic information related to the pre-service teachers’ name, major, grades taught, and
library use, which is closely related to the research goal. The second section collected data on
their information literacy. It focused on the 10 indicators of information literacy standards for
teacher education (EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee, 2011). Each part included four
statements that used a five-point Likert scale. The last two sections examined the use of
information literacy and the librarian’s role (See appendix D). This part helped build the
qualitative section that focused on participant perceptions.
For the qualitative phase, I was interested in using group discussion to collect data, but
from my cultural knowledge, I found this method might compromise data accuracy. Therefore, I
decided to use interviews instead, so that the participants could have the opportunity to discuss
their perspective without being influenced by the opinions of their peers or be concerned about
what they said in front of others. Interviews also allowed me to study the body language of each
participant (Lichtman, 2013). I made sure that all participants could answer the questions as they
preferred and that everything they shared would be confidential.
The qualitative phase focused on four points that helped me collect information about the
participants’ perspectives. The first part consisted of open-ended questions about pre-service
teacher information literacy competencies. The second part was about pre-service teachers’
preparation to practice information literacy with their students, which also helped collect data
about their perception on information literacy practice. The third part focused on the pre-service
teachers’ perception on the librarian’s role in increasing information literacy. The last part

47
focused on the faculty members’ perception about their students’ information literacy practice
(see appendices E and F).
Validity and Reliability
Validity and Reliability for the Quantitative Instrument
Content validity is “the extent to which a measure covers all aspects of the construct it is
supposed to measure” (Price, 2012, p. 122). Therefore, I attempted to connect the research
content with the study’s instrument. For instance, I presented the information literacy
competency and the ACRL standard for information literacy to measure this. I also connected
that with the Marshall (2006) instrument to present the information literacy competency. The
validity of the instrument was established from the content related validity. I also established
validity from the expert panel and the literature review of information literacy, which guided me
in developing the instrument (Gliner, Morgan, & Leech, 2009). As a researcher, I met with
experts in the information literacy field to evaluate the instrument and connect it to the research
purpose and reviewed relevant literature to meet the research goals. To maintain validity, I also
evaluated the instrument in both languages to ensure an accurate translation into Arabic by the
translators (see appendix C).
To ensure reliability in the quantitative instrument, I discovered that the adopted
instrument from Marshall (2006) has shown a great deal of reliability in two different settings.
The first study was conducted during the spring of 2001 with 276 participants and included
Cronbach’s Alpha (.90) for the reliability. The second study was conducted during the fall of
2005, and the instrument showed the same reliability as the first study. Because I added more
sections directly related to the practice of information literacy and the library and translated the
instrument from English into Arabic, I had to conduct a pilot study to recalculate the reliability

48
before conducting the main study. This method ensures the reliability of the instrument to
measure pre-service teacher competency in using information. therefore, I tested the reliability
by using the SPSS, which concluded with .92 as Cronbach’s Alpha.
Trustworthiness of the Qualitative Instrument
To establish the trustworthiness of the qualitative instrument, I had to define its
credibility, which is an important feature according to Shenton (2004). As a result, I developed
research questions focused on the research themes.
Thick description. As a researcher, I used thick and rich description to promote more
detailed information about the research setting or different perspectives about themes. This
description is helpful to provide a deeper understanding for the qualitative part through the
method, results, and the discussion sections (Creswell, 2014; Ponterotto, 2006). According to
Ponterotto (2006) thick description could be accomplished in the interviews as the observations
through the data collection. This occurs when the researcher presents a thick and rich explanation
to the participants, process, results, and/or the discussion of the study.
Iterative questioning. As a researcher, during the interview I used propping or follow up
questions to help me to gain more depth to the interviewee’s response. This strategy also helped
the participants to remain focused on the question. Also, it helped me to understand the
participants’ thinking and to connect their answers to each other to show common threads
between the different responses (Shenton, 2004;Turner, 2010).
Transcripts and audio recordings. As a researcher, I made sure that the transcripts
contained the same information as the audio recordings to avoid any mistakes, ensuring stronger
reliability (Creswell, 2003). First, I listened to the audio recordings and transcribed the data.
Then I went back and forth between the two to check the information before analyzing it.

49
Transferability (external validity). As a researcher, I established my study based on
other studies’ findings and thus built the research questions that could then be transferred or
applied to my setting, which helped to establish the trustworthiness of the study (Shenton, 2004).
Lastly, conformability. As a researcher, I interviewed the pre-service students and their
instructors separately to understand their perceptions about IL. These interviews with both the
students and their instructors helped me to reduce my bias as a researcher during the research
investigation and enhanced triangulation of the results (Shenton, 2004).
Data Collection
I used the concurrent triangulation model, integrating quantitative and qualitative data,
which were the two phases of data collection. The first phase consisted of the quantitative
research method. The quantitative data were gathered first and used to build the qualitative phase
of questions and generate general information for the qualitative phase. Therefore, I created a
survey that “provides a quantitative or numeric description of trends, attitudes, or opinions of a
population by studying a sample of that population” (Creswell, 2014, p. 13). This survey
combined a Likert-scale, yes/no, and closed-ended questions. The first part gathered personal
information that included participant’s major, use of the library, and student level in practicum
training.
The second part of the survey addressed different items that helped measure the preservice teachers’ information literacy competence compared to the Information Literacy
Standards for Teacher Education. Also, this survey addressed different items to measure the
participants’ perception about future practice of IL and librarians role. I collected this data by
handing out the survey for participants to complete. It would have been simpler to use email or

50
Survey Monkey as Probert (2009) used in her mixed-methods study; however, because of the
lack of an email connection among the participants, I collected the data manually.
The qualitative phase depended on the interview question data in order to answer the four
research questions. The interviews were not only about the pre-service teachers’ perceptions of
teaching information literacy, the librarian’s role, and work experience during their teaching
practicum, but also about the IL competency and the faculty members’ perceptions about their
students practice. Data collection for this phase followed the quantitative phase of data collection
and analysis (Creswell, 2014). Therefore, after analyzing the quantitative survey, I conducted
face-to-face interviews with the participants. I chose the interview method of data collection to
be able to interpret the participants’ body language (Lichtman, 2013). This procedure also
assisted me in collecting more detailed information, similar to Probert’s (2009) study.
Data Analysis
In the quantitative phase, I used SPSS software to analyze the survey data to assess the
pre-service teachers’ information literacy competency, their future practice of it with their
students, and the librarian’s role. This statistical analysis format used a descriptive statistics
approach to present percentages, means, standard division, and frequencies (Gliner, Morgan, &
Leech, 2011). I adopted the ordinal and nominal scale to measure the pre-service teachers’
information literacy knowledge level and their understanding of the librarian’s role by using a
five-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5), or from always
(1) to never (5).
The qualitative phase followed with face-to-face interviews and audio recording
equipment. Later, I transcribed the written and recorded data so that it could be organized.
Following that step, the information was open-coded into themes and sub-themes to show the

51
relationships between these themes and to interpret them (Creswell, 2014). This form of data
analysis is called thematic analysis, which “focuses on identifiable themes and patterns of living
and/or behavior” (Aronson, 1995, p. 3). Based on that, I used vivo coding that “ is taken directly
from what the participant himself says and is placed in quotation marks” (Saldaña, 2015, p.4).
This coding is easy to practice for the researcher who practices qualitative coding for the first
time. Also, this coding process works very well with the thematic analysis that is presented in
this study (Aronson, 1995; Creswell, 2009). To follow that step, I developed tables focusing on
three themes that are related to the study’s questions, which are: information literacy
competency, future practice, and librarians’ roles. After that, I categorized the codes depending
on the participants’ responses under each theme in pattern codes. Then, I started to write about
the pattern codes in a memo to explain the significance for each one. Therefore, by vivo coding I
reduced the collected data to categories and achieved the result of the study in the qualitative
part.
Finally, as the literature review has shown, there is a gap regarding pre-service teachers’
future teaching practice. Therefore, learning more about pre-service students’ perceptions will be
the first step to improving the education system at the university by better incorporating these
skills into the curricula.
The results thus contribute to my discipline because as a former librarian instructor and
current curriculum studies major specialist, I will be in a position to use the findings to help
improve curriculum studies instruction. Creating an information literacy program would increase
teachers’ opportunities to practice information literacy in their teaching methods and help their
students become information literate, independent, lifelong learners.

52
Timeline of the Study
I gathered the quantitative data in the middle of the 2016-fall semester for the teacher
practicum class in the Colleges of Arabic, Fundamentals of Religion, Sharia, Adiaoh, Social
Science, and English. I started the qualitative phase at the end of that semester for the teacher
practicum class and during winter break for the Colleges of Arabic, Fundamentals of Religion,
Sharia, Adiaoh, Social Science, and English, after analyzing the quantitative survey using an
concurrent triangulation model.
Summary
This chapter presented the methodology of the study, including the research design and
the sampling technique. It also included the instrument, which consisted of two phases: a
quantitative phase and a qualitative phase. The instrument helped ensure the validity and
reliability of the quantitative research. The data collection method and timeline were presented.
The data analysis as explained in this chapter also established the trustworthiness of both the
quantitative and qualitative sections.

CHAPTER 4
RESULTS
This chapter presents the answers to the research questions, which sought to determine
the competency of female Saudi pre-service teachers’ regarding information literacy, their
perceptions of practicing information literacy in the classroom, and their perceptions of the role
of librarians in developing information literacy. The study also examined faculty members’
perceptions of their students’ information literacy practice. After demographic information is
briefly discussed, the sections are organized by research question.
Demographic Information
All 117 participants were gathered from the female section of Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn
Saud Islamic University and were grouped according to major, the grade level of their students,
and their use of the library.
Major
Participants had one of six different majors (see Table 2): Arabic, Fundamentals of
Religion, Sharia, Adiaoh, Social Science, English. Most participants who completed the survey
were majoring in Social Science (83.8%), followed by Sharia (8.5%), Arabic (6.0%),
Fundamentals of Religion (0.9%), Adiaoh (0.9%), and none from English (0%).

A total of 39.3% of the participants (n=117) responded “Yes” to using the university
library and 60.7% responded “No” (see Table 4). This percentage could be due to female
students having less than five hours per day during the weekdays to use the library, which may
overlap with class time.

Research Question 1A
The first research question was as follows: To what extent are female Saudi pre-service
teachers knowledgeable about information literacy? This question can be broken down into two
sub-questions:
a) How do they find, identify, articulate, evaluate, synthesize, and effectively use
information?

55
b) Is the purpose of this knowledge to seek information for themselves as future teachers
or to improve their future students’ information literacy competence?
Sub-Question A is discussed below. It was based on the Information Literacy Standards for
Teacher Education, created by the EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee (2011) as a
conceptual framework to evaluate pre-service teachers’ information literacy skills, which include
defining the need for, locating, organizing, synthesizing, evaluating, and ethically using
information. Under each standard, there are different indicators that educators could use to
evaluate students’ information literacy competency level.
The instrument of the present study contains 10 sections, each of which includes four
indicators evaluated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly
agree.” The sections are as follows: Identify a topic, Determine resource requirements, Search
for needed information, Locate and retrieve information, Evaluate information, Synthesize and
organize information, Ethical and legal use of information, Use mass media to present
information, Present information, and Learn from feedback and apply feedback to other projects.
The findings for these statements are explained below.
Quantitative Findings
Identify a topic. This section contains four statements that focus on the ability to
identify, understand, and break down a topic (see EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee,
2011; Rubric for Assessing the Information Literacy Standards for Teacher Education EBSS,
2014). The majority of pre-service teachers from all majors reported a positive competency to
identify the topic. However, when going deeper into their ability to define the purpose or type of
information needs, they reported less positive results. See Table 5 for statistical information.

56
Table 5
Mean and Standard Deviation for “Identify a Topic”

1. I feel confident about determining what topic I
need to search for.
2. Sometimes I feel lost because the topic I want to
research is not very clear to me.
3. I can break a complex topic down into simpler,
more useful items.
4. “Confused” is probably the best word to describe
me when starting a project.

For Statement 1, participants were asked to describe their confidence when they had to do
research a certain topic. The statistical analyses showed that 51.3% of participants agreed with
this statement, 16.2% strongly agreed, 26.5% selected neither (nor agree or disagree), and 6%
disagreed or strongly disagreed. The participants thus showed confidence and a positive attitude
about their ability to search for a topic.
For Statement 2, “Sometimes I feel lost because the topic I want to research is not very
clear to me,” 36.8% selected Neither, 33.3% strongly agreed, 6.0% agreed, 15.4% disagreed, and
8.5% strongly disagreed. Overall, there seems to be a conflict in the student’s responses
regarding to their feeling of lost during their search for topic. For instance, 33.3% of the students
agreed with that they feel lost when searching a topic; however, 36.8% had no opinion “Neither”
about this statement. Most likely, they did not understand the question or this may be due to their
not having the skills needed to meet their individual research needs.
For Statement 3, “I can break a complex topic down into simpler, more useful items,” 64.
1% agreed or strongly agreed, 29.1% selected Neither, and 6.9% disagreed or strongly disagreed.

57
Thus, the majority (64.1%) of participants reported a high amount of confidence in their ability
to break down a complex topic.
For Statement 4, “Confused is probably the best word to describe me when starting a
project,” 36.8% agreed, 6.0% strongly agreed, 33.3% selected Neither, 15.4% disagreed, 8.5%
strongly disagreed. Overall, there seems to be wide fluctuation in the students’ responses
regarding their confusion when beginning a research project. Nearly 43% stated they were
confused but over 33% had no opinion. It is possible they just didn’t understand the question.
Determining resource requirements. Statements 5–8 focused on determining resource
requirements, the ability of the individual to recognize the different formats for presenting
information and to use those formats according to their research needs (see EBSS Instruction for
Educators Committee, 2011). For this part, the participants indicated that they had a good
understanding in determining the difference between primary and secondary sources. However,
when asked if they could determine which formats to use when searching for information, many
stated that were unsure and get confused. (See Table 6 for statistical information).
Table 6
Mean and Standard Deviation for “Determine Resource Requirements”
5. I am unsure of how much information I need for the
assignment.
6. I know the difference between “primary” and
“secondary” sources.
7. I get confused because of the many different
formats (print, electronic, etc.) when searching for
information.
8. I am certain that I can use the information I find.

For instance, statement 5, “I am unsure of how much information I need for the
assignment,” 32.5% agreed, 0.9% strongly agreed, 29.9% selected Neither, 28.2% disagreed, and

58
8.5% strongly disagreed. The students were nearly equally split on this question as 33.4% were
unsure of how much information they would need and nearly 40% were sure of how much
information they would need.
For Statement 6, “I know the difference between ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ sources,”
53.8% agreed, 6.8% strongly agreed, 24.8% selected Neither, 10.3% disagreed, and 4.3%
strongly disagreed. Overall, this statement showed that majority of students did know the
difference between primary and secondary sources.
For Statement 7, “I get confused because of the many different formats [print, electronic,
etc.] when searching for information,” 35.9% agreed, 4.3% strongly agreed, 29.9% selected
Neither, 20.5% disagreed, and 9.4% strongly disagreed. Therefore, 40.2% of the participants
reported confusion about using sources from different formats, while 29.9% reported that they
were able to work with different formats.
For statement 8, “I am certain that I can use the information I find,” 63.2% agreed, 12.8%
strongly agreed, 14.5% selected Neither, 5.1% disagreed, and 4.3% strongly disagreed. This
statement showed participants’ confidence in their ability to evaluate and use information.
Overall, 76% reported that they believe that they can use the information they find in their search
while only 9.4% reported that they were unsure if they could use that information. For a

Search for needed information. Statements 9–12 addressed the ability to search for
needed information. Participants were questioned about their ability to use and employ the right
strategies with data search engines (EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee, 2011). Through
this indicator, the participants presented a positive self-report about their ability to search for
needed information. However, in statement 10 the participants indicated their lack of ability to
interpret results, which showed a lack of knowledge and/or skill in this competency. (See Table 7
for statistical information).

9. I know how to use Boolean operators (AND, NOT and

For Statement 9, “I know how to use Boolean operators [AND, NOT and OR] and
truncations to broaden or narrow a search,” the statistical analyses showed that 50.4% agreed or
strongly agreed in their ability to use Boolean operators. Only 15.4% disagreed or strongly
disagreed. However, 34.2% answered Neither, which would suggest that the participants chose
this answer because they had a lack of knowledge about Boolean operators.
For Statement 10, “It is easy to interpret the results of a search,” 47.9% selected Neither,
21.4% disagreed, 5.1% strongly disagreed, 19.7% agreed, and 6.0% strongly agreed. This
statement involved advanced search skills to select the appropriate tools to help interpret the
results of a search. For example, a roughly equal percentage showed positive (25.7%) and
negative (26.5%) assessments about their ability to interpret search results easily, while nearly
half (47.9%) did not answer, which count as negative.
For Statement 11, “I’m not sure how to use an index [e.g., catalog, database, etc.],” The
data from this question would seem to indicate that there is some uncertainty about whether or
not the students know how to use an index to aid their search. Over 37% indicated that they
knew how to do so by strongly agreeing or agreeing to this statement. Nearly 40% of the
students seemed unsure by selecting Neither.

61
Approximately 87% agree with statement 12, “I can confidently get my hands on the
material I need [by printing, e- mailing, using interlibrary loan, etc.],” Only about 13% indicated
that they were unable to do so. Therefore, the majority of the participants showed positive ability
of using the material and recognized the different between them.
Locate and retrieve information. Statements 13–16 were about the competency to
locate and retrieve information. This section covered the ability not only to use basic library
resources but also covered all data sharing resources, such as interlibrary loan or other resources
that could improve search results (Rubric for Assessing the Information Literacy Standards for
Teacher Education EBSS, 2014). The statements showed that participants had a positive
understanding of the library, but their understanding of other data resources was limited or
unclear because they tended to answer Neither between 47.0% to 47.9% (see Table 8).
Table 8
Mean and Standard Deviation for “Locate and Retrieve Information”
13. I understand the organization of materials in libraries

A majority of the students agreed with statement 13,“I understand the organization of
materials in libraries,” However, there were still a high number of students who either did not
know how a library was organized or were unsure how library materials are organized.
A high percentage of students either agree that “Government documents are confusing to
me” (Statement 14) or are unsure of government documents. Nearly half of the respondents
(47.9%) selected Neither, 36.5% agreed, 1.7% strongly agreed, 20.5 disagreed, and 3.4%

62
strongly disagreed. This response is likely related to the use or lack of use of government
documents in their learning and teaching process. The percentage for “Neither” could be seen as
suggesting more of a negative understanding of these documents.
The highest number of students who believed that “Web search engines are unreliable”
(Statement 15) were those who basically had no opinion while a little over 32%, agreed. This
would seem to indicate that the students did not have a lot of confidence in the search engines
they use in their research.
For Statement 16 “I know the difference between an abstract and an article,” 66.6%
reported that they were able to understand the difference between an abstract and an article. Only
around 12% reported that they are unable to do so. For a comparison of Statements 9–16, see

Evaluate Information. Statements 17–20 focused on the competency to evaluate
information. In this part, participants evaluated their understanding of how to critically analyze

63
information for reliability, stability, accuracy, etc. (EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee,
2011). The individual also needs to understand the authority and reputation of the information
and information producer. Over all, the participants reported positive responses on some
statements, but on others, such as the statement 19, they may have misunderstood the statement
or they lacked the ability to recognize the author. (See Table 9 and Figure 4).
Table 9

17. I cannot figure out for whom the information is
intended.
18. I can use many different types of media (print, video,

19. At times, the producer (author) of the information is
not clear.

For Statement 17, “I cannot figure out for whom the information is intended,” the
majority of the students were either unsure (40.2% selected Neither) or believed they did have
the ability to figure out for whom the information is intended (41.9%).
A majority of the students believe they can use many different types of media [print,
video, photography, etc. confidently as information for their topic (Statement 18). This statement
showed that nearly two thirds (64.1%) of the participants reported an understanding of how to
use media.
For Statement 19, “At times, the producer [author] of the information is not clear,” 47.0%
selected Neither, 39.3% agreed or strongly agreed, and only 9.4% disagreed, 4.3% strongly
disagreed. Overall, the results showed that while a large portion of participants understood how
to critique information and the author, nearly half (47%) showed some uncertainty.
Not even a majority of students stated that they ”confidently spot inaccuracy, errors, etc.
in the information from mass media” (Statement 20). Slightly under 50% (49.6%) selected either
strongly agree or agree that they could confidently spot inaccuracies or errors in mass media
information. This would seem to indicate a serious weakness in their education about
information literacy.
Synthesize and organize information. Statements 21–24 focused on the ability of
students to synthesize and organize information. This is when the individual has the ability not
only to organize and summarize information but also to synthesize information and create a
logical argument based on their understanding and individual point of view about the
information (EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee, 2011; Rubric for Assessing the
Information Literacy Standards for Teacher Education EBSS, 2014). The majority of participants
reported a positive ability to organize information. However, in the process of synthesizing and

65
understanding the logical accuracy of the information, they tended to be more noncommittal
Neither (see Table 10 and Figure 5).
Table 10
Mean and Standard Deviation for “Synthesize and Organize Information”

21. The information I find is so confusing that I don’t
know if I can use it.
22. I am not confident that the information I get is accurate.

24. I am sure that the information I have answers my
question or addresses my topic.

The statement 21, “The information I find is so confusing that I don’t know if I can use
it,” revealed that the participants were strongly divided about whether they agreed (26.5%) or
disagreed (30.8%) about how confusing information was for them. In fact, most of the students
(42.7%) selected Neither.

66
For Statement 22, “I am not confident that the information I get is accurate,” slightly over
44% indicted that they were not confident in the accuracy of the data they retrieve during their
research. A large number of students (39.3%) shared that they were uncertain by selected
“Neither”s.
However, for Statement 23, “The information I use is complete and reliable,” nearly 52%
agreed that the information they use is complete and reliable while only slightly under 13%
believe it is not. This does seem to contradict, in some way, the response to the previous
questions about confidence in the accuracy of the information.
The majority of students (63.3%) replied either Strongly Agree or Agree for the statement
24, “I am sure that the information I have answers my question or addresses my topic.” The
response to this statement is more aligned to the previous statement regarding the completeness
and reliability of the information.
Ethical and legal use of information. The ethical and legal use of information was the
topic of Statements 25–28. This part asked participants to evaluate their ability to cite sources
and use information following standards of academic ethics (Rubric for Assessing the
Information Literacy Standards for Teacher Education EBSS, 2014). The pre-service teachers
did indicate their ability to understand the ethical use of information. For more detailed
information see Table 11 and Figure 6.

Only 18.8% of the students agreed or strongly agreed with the statement 25, “A lot of the
information I find is irrelevant or unnecessary.” Thus approximately 42% believed in the
relevancy of their information but still a high number, 38.5%, selected “Neither”. One might
assume that these students also have no opinion as to the relevancy of their information.
The majority of students agreed or strongly agreed (58.1%) with Statement 26, “After

68
collecting my information, it is easy to sort by content that is similar.” As a result, over half of
participants reported the ability to sort information by similar content.
For Statement 27, “My question changes depending on what information I find,” over
half of participants (56.4%) reported in having the ability to search for information depending
their questions and where it is take them. Only 9.4% stated they were unable to do so.
There is no strong consensus for the statement, “If my topic outline doesn’t make sense, I
get discouraged.” Only 27.4% of the students disagreed with this statement while 41 either are
agreed or strongly agreed that they became discouraged if their topic outline didn’t make sense.
Use mass media to present information. Statements 29–32 focused on the use of mass
media—such as radio and TV—to present information. This ability not only helps learners
understand the news, current events, and how to be an informed citizen, it also helps pre-service
teachers connect the issues around them that are related to their major in order to increase their
knowledge and provide new techniques in their teaching styles. However, to present information
through mass media, one must be able to evaluate and cite the resources used and to take into
account audience grade level and age (EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee, 2011; Rubric
for Assessing the Information Literacy Standards for Teacher Education EBSS, 2014). For more
information, see Table 12.

69

(transparencies, slides, videos, etc.) is appropriate for the
delivery of this information.
30. I know my audience (Students, Scholars...etc.) and that
the information I present meets their needs.
31. I sometimes have doubts as to why I am
communicating this information.

For Statement 29, “I am not sure which communication medium [transparencies, slides,

strongly disagreed (40%) with this statement than agreed or strongly agreed (27.3%). Again, a
large percentage (32.5%) checked Neither. As a result, there does seem to be a high degree of
uncertainty as to which communication medium to use.
A large majority of students (74.3%) agreed or strongly agreed, that they know their
audience [Students, Scholars...etc.] and that the information they present meets their needs
(statement 30). In addition, 40.1% of the students did not agree with the statement that they have
doubts as to why they are communicating information while only 21.4% agreed or strongly
agreed with the statement 31. This would seem to suggest that the participants were more sure
about the purpose of the information they presented
For Statement 32, “I am confident that my information is clearly and confidently
presented,” the majority of participants (60.7%) agreed or strongly agreed, while 28.2% selected
Neither, and only 11.1% disagreed or strongly disagreed. This indicates greater confidence
among students in their ability to present information competently.

70
Present information. Statements 33–36 were about presenting information. This section
differs from the previous one as this one focused on the overall methods used to create the
finished products that are presented. In this case, the individual is able to use a variety of
technologies to present work and to keep track of recent advances that help present information
in new ways (EBSS Instruction for Educators Committee, 2011). Overall, the pre-service
teachers were positive about their competency in presenting the information. (For more details,
see Table 13).

33. I’m not sure how to record or cite all my sources.

For Statement 33, close to 50% believe they know how to record or cite all of their
sources. Only 18.8% seemed to indicate that their knowledge in this area was limited. On the
question as to whether or not students have questions about the privacy of the information they
receive (statement 34), it appears that 35.9% agreed or strongly agreed that they do have
questions about the privacy of information while only 18% disagreed or strongly disagreed.
Interestingly, 46.2% selected “Neither” seeming to indicate they also had no idea.
Interestingly, for Statement 35 which stated, “I can tell when information is biased,”
48.7% selected Neither, 33.3% agreed or strongly agreed, and only 17.9% disagreed or strongly
disagreed. This showed that only a 1/3 of the students were certain they could determine bias

71
whereas the others either did not know or were certain they could not determine if information if
biased.
For Statement 36, “I know when material is confidential or should not be used,” 47.9%
agreed, 16.2% strongly agreed, 25.6% selected Neither, 7.7% disagreed, and 2.6% strongly
disagreed. This part focused on the ability to evaluate whether information or materials could or
could not be used. Overall, participants reported being competent in this area.
Learn from feedback and apply feedback to other projects. Statements 37–40 focused
on feedback and how to apply it to later projects. This ability helps individuals develop their
presentation skills by learning from earlier work and applying new ideas with confidence to new
projects. This section also aimed at helping individuals develop the confidence to assess the
effectiveness of their own work before presenting a project and to be able to address any
questions or issues to meet the needs of the audience or subject matter (EBSS Instruction for
Educators Committee, 2011). For more details, see Table 14.

Statement 37, “While preparing a project, I am certain about how others will receive it,”
described the ability to understand the audience needs and level of tolerance for information.
Therefore, an individual should have the ability to evaluate information before presenting it and

72
to adjust it according to the audience. Over half (57.2%) agreed or strongly agreed that they had
this ability, 29.9% selected Neither, and 12.8% disagreed or strongly disagreed with this
statement.
The next statement, “Feedback is demoralizing to me,” addressed whether or not the
students participant felt encouragement and confidence from feedback and used it to improve. A
total of 46.1% disagreed or strongly disagreed meaning they did not feel demoralized by
feedback. However, 29.9% agreed or strongly agreed, while 23.9% selected Neither.
Statement 39, “I am able to learn what processes would be helpful for finding
information in the future,” was concerned with how accepting feedback helps individuals build
their information literacy as well as their awareness about the information they use and the skills
needed to find information in the future. The majority (59.8%) agreed or strongly agreed with the
statements while 30.0% selected Neither, and 9.4% disagreed or strongly disagreed.
Statement 40 gauged participant ability to assess a presentation and feedback based on
audience reaction by stating, “After I present information, I’m not sure how it was received.”
The largest group (41.0%) selected Neither, 29.1% either agreed or strongly agreed, that they are
not sure how the information was received while 29.9 responded that they either disagreed, and
strongly disagreed with the statement meaning they knew how their information was received.

Figure 7. Information literacy competency: Process and present information.
Qualitative Findings
After analyzing and cross-analyzing each interview in the qualitative phase, themes
became apparent within the participants’ discussions about information literacy competency.
They presented their competency according to the six statements or themes in the Information
Literacy Standards for Teacher Education, created by the EBSS Instruction for Educators
Committee (2011). Although the pre-service teachers had a great theoretical knowledge that
showed in the quantitative phase about information literacy, they still complained about their
inability to practice it. According to five of them (Alanwed, Rawan, Samaher, Nora, and
Lowloah), the university put considerable effort into the courses on theoretical knowledge but
failed to show them how to practice these ideas as students and future teachers. For instance,
Alanwed stated, “I understand all the competencies but don’t have experience from practice.”

74
This comment was related to something Rawan said: “I have high competency in information
literacy but don’t have the freedom to practice it in research or presentations.” Along these lines,
Aljwahara mentioned, “When searching for an interesting topic, for me it’s more challenging to
establish the accuracy of the information.” Samaher likewise said, “I need more preparation to
practice information literacy in my research.”
However, other participants, such as Ohood and Rwana, said that they had improved their
teaching practices by strengthening their theoretical knowledge and working by themselves.
Ohood stated, “I developed my research ability on my own because there is no help to improve it
from the faculty members whose research classes I have taken.” Similarly, Rwana said, “I
developed my competency by myself during leisure time reading and researching.”
Therefore, the first theme focused on the students’ ability to access information resources
(identifying and articulating, locating and selecting), participants described their competency in
more detail. In regards to identifying a topic, Alanwed, Aljawhara, Rawan, and Nora said that
they could identify research topics that were of interest to them, but their instructors rejected
these because their job was to identify the topic based on class interests. For instance, all of them
mentioned their ability to identify and define resources from the library and Internet. However,
their instructors preferred there choose to be practice from their students rather than their
interests. Alanwed stated, “The instructor did not accept my topic and asked me to choose one of
the topics that she mentioned because it was easier to search for.” Rawan said, “Actually, this
semester I was really interested in researching ‘polling’ and selecting resources based on my
interest, but my instructor rejected that topic and encouraged me to work in a group on a
different topic, which affected my interest in looking for information.” However, other
participants liked the idea of using a topic given by the instructor because of their limited interest

75
in developing information literacy. For instance, Samaher stated, “I know I’m not interested in
this and have limited abilities with all the research requirements to meet information literacy
competency, so I like to go through the instructor’s requirements and not work too much to pass
the class.”
In addition, for the second themes (articulation) participants described being able to
articulate resources to different degrees, which influenced their ability to set goals, understand a
topic in greater depth, critique ideas, and solve problems. Lowloah mentioned, “I believe that
articulating the resource helped me improve how I cognitively think about information of
interest; however, I would like to have more leeway in researching my own interests for classes.”
Other participants, such as Reem, described her limitations in this aspect of information literacy
and preferred working in groups to avoid the process of articulating information. Describing
these feelings, Reem said, “I agree that in group work, instructors concentrate less on assessing
the individual work of each student.”
In locating and selecting information as the third theme, Nora, Alanwed, Aljwhara, and
Ohood presented different levels of expertise using library resources and selecting information
from the Internet. However, their ability was also related to their interest in the resource. For
instance, Alanwed thought that online resources were always correct, as she stated, “I trust any
PDF source on the Internet to use in my work because they are always accurate.” Ohood and
Samaher agreed with her statement. Aljawhara said that “Using the library database and search
engines was easy if you have the ability to use it.” However, she also mentioned, “I’m not
always sure about the relevance or accuracy of information from the Internet.” Ohood said, “I
use library loan to find resources, and it is helpful in finding the resources that could not be
found in the library.”

76
When the interviews turned to organizing information as the fourth theme, Aljwhara,
Nora, Ohood, Samaher, Alanwed, and Lowloah indicated that what they knew about organizing
information in databases or apps was not to be found in their learning material, but they would
like to learn more about it. However, when discussing analyzing information, they revealed that
they often did not use international resources or understand the correct process for identifying
useful information from them. For instance, Alanwed said, “Honestly, I faced difficulty using
international data sources to search for information. To understand the process for doing that, I
asked the librarians in the university library, but no one helped me with it.” Aljwhara and Rawan
mentioned the importance of establishing the accuracy of sources, such as when Aljwhara
commented, “I have a lack of understanding about the relevance or accuracy of information from
the Internet, so I always got comments from the instructor because from my perspective any
information from the Internet from an educated author is relevant.” On this point Rawan
mentioned, “I always trust the .pdf document type on the Internet.” Many of the other
participants agreed with this point, such as Reem, Samaher, and Nora. Samaher stated, “I taught
my younger sister to only use PDFs because they are always relevant.” On the other hand, Nora
and Lowloah mentioned that their understanding of the analysis process helped them summarize
their sources.
The synthesis process as the fifth theme was the most divisive issue among all
participants because they connected this issue with analyzing and summarizing information.
Aljwhara said, “It is easy to evaluate a resource, connect studies, and summarize the main point.”
Rawan agreed with that opinion, mentioning, “I summarize the information after reading the
source and show my perspective on some point.” However, Ohood said, “My ability to research
and use synthesis is limited because these skills are not explained to us in any deep way. I would

77
like to have a deeper understanding of how to connect my prior knowledge with new
information.”
With regard to presenting information as the last theme, all of the participants not only
agreed that they understood this process but also focused on the importance of audience age and
grade level. For instance, Alanwed, Samaher, and Norah all said they considered their audience’s
age before giving a presentation because their responsibility was not only to present information,
but to do so in a way their audience could understand. Alanwed stated, “I need to know my
students’ age and grade level, so I can teach the information based on that. When presenting
information, I always use the traditional way of explaining it, but if they require newer resources,
I do that.” Nora agreed with this, but added that “I like to use different ways to present
information to my audiences, which is not only related to their age and grade level, but also to
the type of information being taught because some information should be presented with
particular technology.” Lowloah considered her ability to present information to be limited and
that she needed to improve it, especially as a future teacher: “I would like to increase my skills
and understanding about how to present information.”
In terms of evaluating and ethically using information, Nora, Reem, Rawan, Lowloah,
Aljwhara, Alanwed, and Samaher agreed that they could meet this competency because they
were using relevant information and understood the rules for quoting and citing information.
Interpretation of Quantitative and Qualitative Results
The integration of the quantitative and qualitative phases showed that the pre-service
teachers were knowledgeable about information literacy skills. However, their knowledge was
mostly theoretical knowledge that they did not have time to practice. This was apparent in the
quantitative phase when participants showed an understanding of these skills, but during the

78
interviews many of them mentioned needing more opportunities to practice and connect their
skills with their specialized knowledge. They also wanted deeper explanations of some
statements more than others, such us articulating, analyzing, and synthesizing information. In
regards to integrating, participants wanted to put more effort on the survey statements they
marked as “Neither” and showed in the qualitative phase that they used these points all the time
but were concerned about the statements that could measure their information literacy
competency.
Research Question 1B
Research Question 1 was, “To what extent are female Saudi pre-service teachers
knowledgeable about information literacy? This question can be broken down into two subquestions, the second of which was, “b) is the purpose of this knowledge to seek information for
themselves as future teachers or to improve their future students’ information literacy
competence?” This sub-question is discussed below.
Quantitative Findings
This phase sought to identify participants’ competency in implementing information
literacy, which depended on their individual learning process and their interest in improving their
skills to progress from seeking to provide information. Statement 41, “What is your purpose for
using information literacy? Check as many that apply to you,” asked three yes/no questions.
Participants focused on the second and the third which is “To improve my future teaching
practice” and “To be better equipped to improve my future students’ competency in information
literacy,” and ignore the first statement which is “find information to my research,” which related
to building and coping with the IL skills to move to the next part of seeking information. In
Alamoudi and Alsulami (2008), university students were more interested in research-seeking

79
knowledge, the first level of seeking information. Stockham and Collins (2012) mentioned that
most pre-service teachers at Kansas University were knowledgeable about the concept of
information literacy, but that this competency was limited to self-provided information. This is
the second level of competency, which focuses on helping individuals improve research skills as
well as their work as a teacher. Lastly, according to Bushong and Boff (2008), educational
programs should seek to bridge the gap between research and practice by developing models that
pre-service teachers can use to improve the way they teach information literacy to future
students. From this level, I could evaluate the participants’ interests in practicing information
literacy.
According to the data analysis of this question, the participants were interested in
information literacy in general (see Figure 8). They were most interested in improving their
future students’ information literacy competency, as 41.0% checked Yes for this question. “To
improve my future teaching practice” was the next most popular, with 31.6%. At 24.8%, “To
find information related to my research” showed the least interest. However, their desire to
competently teach information literacy to future students could not be achieved until they are
first confident seekers of information.

Qualitative Findings
The qualitative findings for this question were challenging because all of the participants
agreed that the most important aspect was coping with information literacy as students, which is
related to seeking information. However, not all agreed on future practice. For instance, Rawan
said, “The university has taught us information literacy skills to help us move forward in our
research, seeking information, learning, and finishing the program, but there is no instruction on
how to practice these skills in the future.” Alanwed stated, “I really want to find information that
will help me improve my teaching process, but to do that I need to update the material according
to my students’ needs and age.” Aljwhara said, “I am preparing myself to be aware of
information literacy and how to use it with my future students, not for the university
requirements.” Reem clarified that “Information literacy will help me improve myself and my
teaching skills, but it is not my job to develop the students’ ability to practice information
literacy. If there is other teachers who required to teach that way not we need to influence these
skills from small age with our the students.” Samaher stated, “Actually, using information

81
literacy in my research helps me improve my skills as a researcher and learn from that
experience to improve my future teaching practices. However, my responsibility is to present the
information to the students, and I am not prepared to show them how to find that information.”
Interpretation of Quantitative and Qualitative Results
When contrasting the quantitative and qualitative results, an inconsistency appeared in
participants’ responses and attitudes toward how information literacy should be taught and used.
In the quantitative phase, 41% of the participants emphasized practicing information literacy
with their students, while only 24.8% emphasized seeking information. However, in the
qualitative phase, they said that they would practice information literacy in their future teaching
only to improve their students’ knowledge about the subject, not to teach students these skills
because that was not their job.
Research Question 2
The second research question was, “How do female Saudi pre-service teachers describe
their perceptions of practicing information literacy in their future classrooms? Are they prepared
to apply information literacy in their teaching?”
Quantitative Findings
To address this question, participants were asked to provide their perceptions about
information literacy and their future teaching practice by answering Statements 42–48 on a fivepoint Likert scale ranging from “Always” to “Never”. Overall, the majority of the pre-service
teacher participants revealed a negative perception about their practice of information literacy in
their future classrooms.
For Statement 42, “Do your faculty members require you to apply information literacy in
your assignments?”, 40.2% of participants answered Never, 16.2% answered Rarely, 20.5%

82
Sometimes, 17.9% Very often, and 5.1% Always. This is showed that that the students were not
asked to apply the IL skills in most cases since almost 40% of the participants mentioned that
they had never been practiced this skill during their class assignments.
For Statement 43, “Do your librarian and faculty members work cooperatively to enhance
your class assignments?” 39.3% reported that sometimes their faculty members and librarians
work cooperatively to gather to enhance their IL skills. Only around 22.2% reported that it
happened very often. However, 11.1% of the participants mentioned that their faculty member
and librarians cooperated to improve their class assignments.
The majority of students (pre-service) in Statement 44,“Does your librarian or faculty
member prepare you to encourage information literacy in your future teaching practice?” a
majority (54.7%) mentioned that they were never prepared by their faculty members and
librarian to implement IL skills in their future practice.
For Statement 45, “Do your librarian or faculty members prepare you to influence
information literacy between students and to enhance their ability to search for information?”
slightly under 30% of the participants (32.5%) selected that they were Never prepared to
influence their future students with the IL. However, 9.4% of the participants responded that they
were always prepared to influence with their students with influence IL, which is a concern since
one could conclude there is a lack of these skills among K-12 students.
However, for statement 46 “Do you have any experience learning [e.g., through courses]
about information literacy models to apply in your future classes?”), which is aimed to determine
their perceptions about whether their learning experience reflected information literacy teaching
models. In total, 36.8% of the participants selected that they sometimes learned about IL
modules and how to apply them but 10.3% mentioned that were “Rarely” having that

83
experiences. Overall, this statement showed that students lack experience learning about IL
modules.
Only 27.4% of the students selected “Very often” For Statement 47, “Have you practiced
any teaching method [problem solving, critical thinking…etc.] that required you to add
information literacy as an important component?” However, 24.8% of the participants
“Sometimes” practiced this teaching method, which appears that only a limited number of
students’ teachers’ practice teaching strategies that support problem solving or critical thinking.
Finally, the Statement 48, presented the question “Have you built a lesson plan that
required students to search for information related to the lesson topic?” Nearly 26.5% selected
“Sometimes” they built lesson plans that required students to search for information on a related
topic, while 23.9% were mentioned “Very often”. However, 15.4% of the students participants
reported that they were “Never” required to build lesson plans that required students to search for
information. These results are compared in Figure 9.

84
Qualitative Findings
In the qualitative phase, I asked questions related to participants’ preparation, future
practice of information literacy, and the role of faculty and librarians. In the interviews, the
participants showed a general lack of practice with information literacy or preparation to practice
it with their students. For instance, Alanwed, Rawan, Aljwhara, and Reem agreed that the role of
faculty members was to enhance these competencies depending on their interest. From a positive
perspective, Alanwed had the following to say:
Some faculty members embower us to use information literacy skills. For instance, one of
the instructors explained and discussed the use of information, and she sometimes asked
us to read more about a point and wait till next week to discuss it. This influenced me to
focus more on information literacy skills.
Nora agreed with this sentiment, and Reem stated, “Some instructors influence us to use new
resources and apps to learn from. Some have also shown us the process for how to do that, but
others were limited to the subject matter and teaching materials.” On a more negative note,
Rawan said, “Actually, some of our instructors need to learn more about how to teach
information literacy to their students because I don’t learn anything from them.” In the same
vein, Aljwhara said, “I’ve taught myself to be aware of information literacy and how to use it in
my future teaching; I didn’t learn this from faculty members or the university program.”
Regarding collaborative work between librarians and faculty members to enhance preservice teachers’ practice of information literacy, all participants agreed that there was virtually
no such collaboration. Samaher said, “The faculty members do not present the librarians in their
instructional classes to help us or even mention them to support us in our research work.”

85
However, Ohood said, “I have some instructors who discussed their collaboration with librarians
but just for research, not to enhance our skills as students.”
Aljwhara, Alanwed, Samaher, Nora, and Ohood agreed that they had received no
preparation to practice information literacy with future students. Aljwhara said, “Actually, there
is no connection between research and practice. I mean that research classes are for research, and
we didn’t have the opportunity to practice what we learned in other classes, so how can we
transfer that to our students if we didn’t have it?” Alanwed stated, “In the teacher training
practice, when I discuss any point with my students, I like to give them the information because
there is no need for them to search for it and because I am worried their questions could show
my limited preparation for practicing information learning with them.” Samaher said, “We are
not responsible for teaching that because the program did not teach us how to practice that with
students.” Similarly, Ohood said, “I prefer not to practice information literacy with my students
or prepare them for that because I am not prepared to do it. I just need to improve myself.” Nora
stated, “I improved my skills from my learning experience, not from others. I would like to be
more prepared to practice information literacy when teaching my students.”
Regarding the teaching strategies that implement information literacy, Reem mentioned
that time constraints could be an obstacle. She said, “Because I only have 35 minutes to teach the
material for the class, I found that teaching time is limited, and so I don’t have time to use
strategies that enhance the research competency of students.” In contrast, Ohood stated, “I do not
know any teaching strategies that implement information literacy as skills.”
Interpretation of the Quantitative and Qualitative Results
Comparing the quantitative and qualitative phases, I found that pre-service teachers
showed limited preparation to practice information literacy not only as students but also as

86
teachers. The quantitative phase presented participants’ limitations to practicing information
literacy in their classes with faculty members and in their teaching practice with their students
through specialized modules or teaching strategies. According to the quantitative data, 40.2% of
participants mentioned that faculty members had never required them to apply information
literacy in their assignments. Furthermore, 54% claimed that they had never received
encouragement from faculty or librarians to practice information literacy with their future
students. In addition, 32.5% of participants mentioned that they had never received preparation
from faculty or librarians to teach information literacy to students or enhance their ability to
search for information. These important points were supported in the qualitative phase.
Research Question 3
Research Question 3 was, “How do female Saudi pre-service teachers describe their
perceptions of the librarian’s role in enhancing information literacy?”
Quantitative Findings
Participants were asked to answer Statements 49–53 on a five-point Likert scale ranging
from “Always” to “Never.” This question addressed the pre-service teachers perceptions of the
librarian’s role in enhancing information literacy.
For Statement 49, “As a student, do you have any experience working with librarians to
enhance your understanding of a topic or issue?,” the data from this question seems to indicate
that there is uncertainly about whether or not they have working experience with librarians,
which may depend on their school district’s requirement or socioeconomic standard of the
distract. Therefore, the pre-service students replied with 29.9% that they never had any of these
experiences, while 28.2% said they sometimes had these experiences. However, 8.5% of the preservice teachers replied they “Always” had this experience.

87
For Statement 50, “As a student, do you have any learning experience in the library that
encouraged you to use library resources?,” 27.4% reported that they “Sometimes” had the
learning experience, which was still limited to undergrad level students.
In this Statement, the pre-service teachers asked if they have any experiences working
with a librarian to build a lesson plan and/or activity to enhance there teaching practice
(Statement 51). Only 27.4%, indicated that this happened very often. This would seem to
indicate that the students do not realize that the role of librarians includes assisting the teacher
with their lessons.
For Statement 52, “Have you ever collaborated with a librarian to plan or present a lesson
that required searching for information resources?,” the majority of the pre-service students
replied that they “Never” (41%) collaborated with the librarian to build lesson plans that include
searching for information. (For a comparison, see Figure 10)

88
Qualitative Findings
In the qualitative phase, Aljwhara, Alanwed, Reem, Rawan, Samaher, Ohood, and
Lowloah agreed that the only help librarians offered them was to find resources. For instance,
Alanwed mentioned, “To me, I saw how librarians provided intensive support to the master’s and
PhD students more than us as undergrads, so the role of the librarian is to find the location of
resources in the library. Honestly, this is the first time I’ve heard of librarians having a role other
than finding books for us.” Aljwhara said, “The only support I get from the librarians is to find
sources. I had previous learning experiences with them but at a public library.” Samaher said, “I
haven’t had any learning experience about how to work with librarians. I just understand that
they help us go through the Dewey numbers to get books; otherwise, there is no work or learning
involving them.” She also added that “One time one of our instructors taught us how to search in
the library online website for resources and it was a great experience that I learned from.” Nora
also mentioned a positive experience: “I went to the public library, and they were a great help;
they helped me find past studies about my topic and showed me how to organize it.”
Rawan and Reem focused on the librarian’s educational background because they
thought that theirs were not well educated. Rawan said, “I think the librarians who worked at the
university were not librarians or educators because they did not do more for me or my friends
than find books.” Regarding other roles librarians could provide, Alanwed stated, “I wish the
librarians would show us how to search for information, synthesize sources, or use different apps
to organize and present information.”
However, Samaher stated the following:
The university provides optional workshops that teach different skills and strategies about
the library and how to use resources. And the faculty members also advised us to go

89
attend them. But we are not interested in attending because of the time and lack of focus
on important skills.
Lowloah agreed with Samaher and mentioned, “I would like it if the librarians could help me by
showing me examples I could use in my work and explain how to use apps or technology in our
work.”
Interpretation of the Quantitative and Qualitative Results
When I examined the quantitative and qualitative phases focusing on the librarian’s role,
pre-service teachers indicated that they understand the librarian’s role when choosing from the
quantitative Likert scale. However, in the qualitative phase their answers showed a lack of
awareness about the librarian’s role, claiming that they only found resources. It showed their
dependence on instructors to explain these processes, believing these were the faculty’s role
rather than the librarian’s. It also suggested that librarians did not help undergraduate students as
much as graduate students.
Research Question 4
Research Question 4 was, “How do female Saudi faculty members describe their
perceptions of their students’ information literacy practice?” This qualitative question supports
all previous questions, as it looks at the pre-service teachers from the faculty’s perspective. Four
faculty members were interviewed for their thoughts on their students’ information literacy
competency and preparation to adopt these skills as future teachers. During these interviews, I
attempted to ask probing questions, asking about their major, views on information literacy,
practice, and their students’ future practice. The four participants were from the Curriculum &
Instruction Department at the same university and were required to teach pre-service teachers in
classes about teaching methods, research, and learning and teaching theories. The first

90
participant, Nada, had a PhD in Curriculum and Instruction with a background in Arabic
language teaching. Lama also had a PhD in Curriculum and Instruction with a background in
Sharia law. However, the last two, Mona and Hoda, were lecturers who held master’s degrees in
C&I and had backgrounds in nutrition and health education, respectively.
Qualitative Findings
The faculty members showed considerable awareness of information literacy. For
instance, Mona, Hoda, and Nada all agreed that these skills focused on the ability to identify
resources and use them ethically when evaluating and synthesizing the information to present it.
In contrast, Lama said that information literacy was merely the ability to use technology in the
learning process to search for information.
However, the faculty members’ perceptions of their students’ (as pre-service teachers)
practices of information literacy were limited to their belief that these skills had to grow through
practice and that this growth depended on the interests of the instructor. For instance, Mona,
Nada, Hoda, and Lama all agreed that these skills did not appear in practice in the syllabus goals.
Regardless, Mona stated, “In my class syllabi, we presented the information research skills as an
important goal to reach, but this depends on whether the instructor is interested in meeting this
goal or giving it more attention.” Hoda mentioned, “In our teaching process these skills are not
implemented as part of the goals of the class, but I add these skills and evaluate my students
based on them in the process of applying them when synthesizing and presenting information.”
Nada said, “I add these skills in my teaching classes and make sure that my students practice
them during their practicum because I evaluate their process for using these skills with their
students.” Likewise, Mona mentioned, “As one of the faculty members, I see myself as an
example to our students to learn from. Therefore, I am careful about what I present and how and

91
what I use to present the information because they learn from me.” On the other hand, Lama
stated, “I don’t give these skills a lot of attention. I do my best to present locating for information
sometimes, but I don’t include it as an evaluation process.” She went on that “I feel that my
students’ practice in these skills is good. From my own learning experience as a student, there is
no influence or interest in practicing information literacy in my major. It is not important.”
Based on their teaching experiences, the interviewees found pre-service teachers’ practice
of information literacy to be limited. For instance, Mona stated that, “When I started teaching my
class about research skills, I was thinking they would have a background in locating the
information, but I was surprised that some of them did not use academic or trustworthy
resources. So I worked with them to focus on intellectual authors rights.” Nada had a similar
comment when she said, “I like to focus on increasing the credible use of information in my
students’ work, to make them understand how to do that, because many of them showed a
limited understanding about it.” Mona commented on the uneven distribution of skill among
students:
My students’ level of awareness and practice in information literacy depends on the class
requirements. For example, I have 70 students in my class and some of them have limited
experience with it and could not carry out the process of locating information, but some
of them amazed me with their capacity to understand the correct process for
implementing these skills.
Regarding the implementation of these skills, apparent in organizing, analyzing,
evaluating, and synthesizing before presenting, all four mentioned that their students faced
difficulty with these points. For instance, Mona said, “I faced some difficulty making students
present information because their communication skills are limited, which makes me worried

92
about their future teaching and ability to communicate with their students.” Similarly, Mona,
Hoda and Nada commented on the negative aspects of their students’ inability to evaluate
information in order to critique and synthesize it. For example, Hoda had the following to say:
I like to evaluate my students in this process by give them assignments that encourage
them not only to search but to think and critique the information before using or
presenting it because they enter the university level without these skills, and when
reevaluating information we need them to be more critical and evaluative of the
information before using it.”
Nada added the following:
I faced difficulty with my pre-service teachers regarding credibility because they keep
copying and pasting the information, which is come from the information that they can
find everywhere. I wish they would focus more and start to evaluate. They have to start
questioning and critiquing information.
A major reason for the pre-service teachers’ lack of practice with information literacy
was a lack of interest in developing it. Illustrating this point, Mona said, “These seeking skills
are of more interest to the graduate students than undergrads, by virtue of research being more of
what grad students do.” Hoda stated, “I think the reason why they don’t use evaluation,
perspective, critiquing, and synthesis of information is because these skills are not adopted in the
curriculum and teaching process, not only at the university but also in the public education
system.” Nada repeated this sentiment.
Hoda and Nada agreed that pre-service teachers were not motivated to learn and improve
because they did not care anymore. Hoda stated, “Students don’t have the motivation to develop

93
their skills or enhance their teaching; they just feel that university is four years to finish and after
that no more learning,” Nada added the following:
Students get frustrated from having to learn so many things when at the end they will not
have the opportunity to get a job to practice what they learned. And they don’t take the
learning process seriously because the education is free.
Mona, Hoda, and Nada agreed that finding resources was more difficult for female Saudi
students, which could affect the accuracy of the information they use. Mona said that “Female
students face difficulty doing their research because women have limited access to the library,
which causes them to use the Internet as an easy way to get information even if it is inaccurate.”
Hoda also mentioned the following:
I have 34 students in my class, but only three of them showed the competency to
synthesize and critique information. I think that some of them understand that critiquing
is to not always agree with the information [a lack of understanding of the critiquing
process], and some still copy paste.
Nada and Hoda said their university provided workshops and lectures to improve these
skills, among others, but that students were not interested in attending. Hoda stated, “The
university provides many workshops but they do not consider the students’ needs, availability, or
the content of these workshops. For instance, a pre-service teacher showed me the certificates
they get from attending these workshops to improve their skills as teachers, but the opposite was
apparent during their practice teaching.”
Nada presented an important thought about practicing these skills, which concerns the
feedback they receive from instructors:

94
I have almost 80 students in each class, and I have to encourage them all to practice that.
However, because they require me as the instructor to respond to their work [feedback], I
sometimes feel frustrated going through all their work and responding to their practice of
theoretical knowledge. I think this is what we all feel, that it’s hard to give feedback to
this many students every week. So some of us only do it once each semester for group
work, or don’t focus on the research process.
Regarding students’ future practice, all agreed that they as faculty members worked to
improve these skills during class and that pre-service teachers needed more practice to reach the
next level of competency and be able to deliver this knowledge to their students. Nada illustrated
this point:
I see that students need to practice these skills more and collaborate during their other
classes. Also, we don’t need workshops; we need to include more practice for these skills
in our teaching because these skills will improve through practice, not memorization.
Summary
Chapter 4 discussed the results of the quantitative and qualitative phases as well as the
interpretations of the two phases taken as a whole. This integration helped not only to present the
statistical results but also provide deeper descriptive information from the participants. This
mixed-methods sequential-explanatory design allowed me to better address the four research
questions. Through quantitative and qualitative data, I was able to identify the pre-service
teachers’ information literacy competency (RQ 1), their future practice of information literacy in
the classroom (RQ 2), and the librarian’s role in improving their use of information literacy (RQ
3). Research Question 4 was addressed through purely qualitative interviews, which revealed
faculty members’ perceptions and insights about their students’ information literacy practice.

95
CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
This chapter presents the conclusions based on the data analysis. It also provides the
discussion and recommendations for future research. The purpose of the study was to identify
pre-service teachers’ competency in information literacy and its influence on their future
classroom practice. The study also examined pre-service teacher perceptions about the librarian’s
role in supporting their use of information literacy in their work. Lastly, the study examined
faculty member perceptions of their pre-service teachers’ practice of information literacy. The
research questions were as follows:
RQ1: To what extent are female Saudi pre-service teachers knowledgeable about
information literacy? This question can be broken down into two sub-questions:
a) How do they find, identify, articulate, evaluate, synthesize, and effectively use
information?
b) Is the purpose of this knowledge to seek information for themselves as future teachers
or to improve their future students’ information literacy competence?
RQ2: How do female Saudi pre-service teachers describe their perceptions of practicing
information literacy in their future classrooms? Are they prepared to apply information literacy
in their teaching?
RQ3: How do female Saudi pre-service teachers describe their perceptions of the
librarian’s role in enhancing information literacy?
RQ4: How do female Saudi faculty members describe their perceptions of their students’
information literacy practice?

96
Conclusions
The results showed that pre-service teachers had a high level of information literacy
competency; however, this competency was limited to theoretical knowledge that required
further practice to develop. Also, the limitation of the concept of Information Literacy
competency could be the result of the pre-service teachers lack of attendance to the university
library that may affect their practice of these competencies. The quantitative results indicated
that pre-service teachers preferred selecting Neither or “No opinion” in responding to many of
the skills/statements presented in the survey, which might be connected to their lack of
understanding of the questions or to their lack of an ability to evaluate their own level of
competency in these questions. The interviews revealed also that participants also needed to
expand their interpretation of these skills, which included evaluating, analyzing, synthesizing,
and presenting information. Nearly all of the participants agreed that they needed more
preparation with these skills not only for research purposes, but also to practice them to future
students.
Overall, pre-service teacher participants had a positive accept perception of practicing
information literacy. However, they wanted information literacy skills to be incorporated into the
entire curriculum to enable them to improve by applying these skills in their practicum courses
or in a professional development program. The participants also mentioned their interest in
practicing and being evaluated in these skills to get more feedback. Also, the participants
mentioned the importance of having the opportunity to practice and develop these skills in the
assignments individually and dependably to their interests, to enrich their skills and
metacognitive knowledge.

97
In contrast, student participants held a generally negative perception of librarians and
their role in helping them develop information literacy skills. For the most part, participants had
not learned from or worked with librarians in class as guest speakers or in class discussions,
when working with faculty members, or during visits to the library. Participants also believed
librarians’ assisted graduate students and faculty members as researchers more than
undergraduate students.
Faculty members displayed mostly negative perceptions of pre-service teachers’ practice
of information literacy. They reported that pre-service teachers first needed to improve their
information literacy to understand how to practice it as researchers before practicing it as
teachers. Faculty participants agreed that pre-service teachers needed improvement in evaluation,
critiquing, and synthesis to be able to employ these skills with future students. Finally, they
mentioned the importance of raising awareness among pre-service teachers about practicing
information literacy skills for research as well as for teaching purposes, which is important part
to close the gap between research and practice.
Discussion
Information Literacy Competency
The results of the quantitative and qualitative phases of the study revealed a variety of
findings about pre-service teacher information literacy. For instance, in the quantitative phase,
they showed high-to-moderate performance in measuring information literacy competency.
However, this competency was based more in theoretical knowledge used to pass their classes
than practical skills, a finding consistent with previous research (e.g., Anafo & Filson, 2014;
Floyd et al., 2008; Probert, 2009; Van Ingen & Ariew, 2015). These studies suggested that pre-

98
service teachers could not be knowledgeable about information literacy by taking a course;
rather, this knowledge only came from practicing these skills in classes and class assignments.
The interviewees mentioned that their lack of information literacy competency came
from not incorporating these skills into other subjects. One of the participants discussed the
importance of reduce the numbers elective classes and incorporating more information literacy
activities into their major classes to increase their competency, which was not consistent with
several studies (e.g., Alamoudi & Alsulami, 2008; Aloshan, 2013; Alhumood, 2011; Lee, Reed,
& Laverty, 2012) that agreed that information literacy could improve through a research class,
but that there was no need to implement these skills in other subject areas.
Results revealed that participants were more informed in locating and articulating
information, but showed a lack in interpretation skills, which was apparent in different
statements in the survey and the interviews. For instance, one of the participants mentioned that
she needed to increase her practice of these skills because they would increase her cognitive
skills, which was consistent with Emmons et al. (2009), Miller (2005), Lee, Reed, and Laverty
(2012), O’Hanlon (1988), and Ornstein and Hunkins (2009). These studies claimed that
practicing information literacy improved pre-service teachers’ critical thinking, problem solving,
and metacognitive skills.
Many of the participants mentioned their lack of preparation for synthesizing
information, which was also agreed with Alamoudi and Alsulami (2008) results. They illustrated
that synthesizing is a difficult interpretation process for undergraduate students because of the
difficulty understanding how to apply it in practice.

99
Pre-Service Teachers and Future Teaching
Many participants agreed that their program needed to offer them opportunities to
understand and practice information literacy skills with their future students. They recognized
the importance of information literacy in enhancing students’ ability to learn independently, a
finding that was consistent with Emmons et al. (2009), Branch (2003), and O’Hanlon (1988).
Furthermore, the relationship between research and practice should not be ignored when learning
these skills (Van Ingen & Ariew, 2015). This was presented in the results when one participant
mentioned the importance of practicing what she learned through research.
Pre-service teachers generally lacked practice working with teaching models that would
give them the opportunity to practice and develop their own information literacy skills, which
they could then model with their future students. This finding supported the result of Bushong
and Boff (2008) and Stockham and Collins (2012), who mentioned the importance of
implementing courses and teaching modules—such as Information Power Standards, Handy 5,
and Big 6—that increase the practice of information literacy skills.
Two participants mentioned that their preparation to practice information literacy was a
self-learning process that was not included in what they learned from classes. This finding was
consistent with Miller (2005) and Branch (2003), who illustrated that pre-service teachers felt
that their preparation programs did not emphasize information literacy and that their knowledge
in this area was dependent on self-learning.
One participant believed that practicing information literacy would help improve her
class materials and give the students a wider variety of information to learn from but that it was
not her job to teach her students to practice these skills. This lacks a referent was consistent with
several studies that recommended that pre-service practices focus on improving research work

100
through self-research seeking skills (e.g., Asselin & Doiron, 2004; Branch, 2003; Emmons et al.,
2009; Van Ingen & Ariew, 2015; Lee, Reed, & Laverty, 2012; Probert, 2009; Seely et al., 2011;
Stockham & Collins, 2012; Williams & Wavell, 2007).
Many participants revealed a lack of information literacy practice, interest in integrating
it into their teaching skills, or desire to develop it among their students, which was consistent
with Asselin and Doiron (2004), Probert (2009), and Van Ingen and Ariew (2015). These studies
highlighted the importance of showing pre-service teachers how to practice these skills with
future students.
The Librarian’s Role
All pre-service teachers showed negative perceptions of the librarian’s role beyond
finding information. Most of the participants agreed that librarians did not have the instructional
knowledge to help them, which disagreed with the results of several other studies (e.g., Floyd et
al., 2008; Miller, 2005; Tiemensma, 2012; Seely et al., 2011; Van Ingen & Ariew, 2015). These
studies showed that librarians could instruct student teachers in research skills that could
improve their learning strategies. One participant mentioned that librarians could not teach
information literacy skills because they did not possess them. This was consistent with Alsereihy
and Alsuraihi (2009). They found that the librarians in their study had not practiced these skills,
which affected the ability of students and faculty members to master them.
The participants also showed negative perceptions about collaborative work between
themselves and librarians. Furthermore, they had no work or learning experiences with
librarians. This was disagreeing with Witt and Dickinson (2004), whose participants learned
from their experience with librarians not only to improve their research skills, but also to inform
their future practice with students.

101
Faculty Members
The results showed the importance of faculty members’ perceptions of their students’
practice of information literacy. For instance, all faculty members in the interviews focused on
the need for pre-service teachers to evaluate, synthesize, and present information, not only as
students but also as future teachers who will be responsible for educating the next generation and
encouraging them to evaluate and analyze information. This was consistent with Latham and
Gross (2008) and Tiemensma (2012), who argued that information literacy skills were more than
research skills, but could also improve one’s daily life, academic performance, and society as a
whole.
Faculty members believed their students lacked an understanding of or practice with
information literacy. They mentioned spending time to ensure that their students worked with
some skills that they would not need all the time. They also stated that they had not worked with
librarians before and did not believe in collaborative work. This was consistent with Kovalik et
al. (2010), Montiel-Overall and Hernández (2012), and Moore (2005), who presented the
importance of preparing pre-service teachers by working collaboratively with librarians to
improve their information literacy skills and knowledge. Such practice strengthens their
partnership with librarians in future work.
Recommendations
The following are recommendations for future practice and avenues of research based on
the findings of this study.
Recommendations for Practice
The following recommendations are particularly applicable for policymakers at Al-Imam
Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University and the Saudi Ministry of Education. These

102
recommendations could also be used to support the preparation programs of pre-service teachers
in all majors and universities throughout the country to provide more practice in information
literacy skills. They may also help pre-service teachers increase the quality of their teaching
strategies.
Since pre-service teachers showed a lack of preparation for practicing information
literacy as researchers as well as future teachers, the university should provide more courses that
enhance these skills in different subjects. The teaching program should implement these skills as
goals in the syllabi and evaluate students based on them from the first year of college and during
practicum. Teaching methodology classes would benefit from giving pre-service teachers more
opportunities to practice their theoretical knowledge while using information literacy skills. The
educational preparation program should accept information literacy as skills vital to learner
development and take steps to make them ready to practice these skills as teachers.
The Office of Teacher Education should provide teaching opportunities and workshops
that improve faculty members’ use of information literacy with students, not only for selfresearch, but also structure their students in these skills as well. Additionally, the Office of
Teacher Education should provide workshops for pre-service teachers about information literacy
skills during times that students could attend.
This study has suggested that librarians also need to be better equipped to work with
faculty members and student teachers. Collaboration between faculty members and librarians
should be encouraged to increase student interest in practicing these skills.
Students would benefit greatly from entering college with some knowledge of
information literacy skills. Therefore, the Saudi Ministry of Education should increase practice

103
for these skills in the curricula at public education institutions and prepare teachers to practice
these skills with students from a young age.
Recommendations for Future Research
Further studies could build on the present study by exploring the following avenues of
research:
1. Include science and other majors to understand the effect of different majors on using
information literacy skills.
2. Draw participants from other universities and regions.
3. Include librarians as participants.
4. Include more data collection in the form of documents and observations of classwork.
5. Design training programs that influence information literacy as a framework for this
program by integrating more IL models.
6. Encourage partnerships between librarians, faculty and teachers to work
collaboratively, and train pre-service teachers to foster this partnership with librarians
as well.
7. Interview the pre-service teacher participants who completed the survey and connect
the responses to the their interviews to determine any gaps between them.
8. Interview female Saudi teachers (Master Degree) who study in the USA and compare
their perceptions to the female Saudi teachers who are in KSA.
Summary
This chapter presented the conclusion of the study, based on the findings. The chapter
included a discussion that connected the findings of this study with those of previous studies.

104
Finally, the study delimitations were given along with recommendations for future practice and
research.

(Student Teachers- Pre-service)
My name is Norah Alsana. I am a doctoral candidate at Southern Illinois University working on
my research study “Female Saudi Pre-Service Teachers’ Competency in Information Literacy,
their Perception on Future Classroom Practice, and the Role of Librarians.” This survey was
adapted from Marshall (2006) with some modifications to facilitate the participants’
understanding and the Arabic translation.
Dear Participants:
This study evaluates female pre-service teachers’ information literacy based on information
literacy standards. It also helps pre-service teachers recognize that information literacy does not
only consist of self-learning skills, but also skills that could be implemented in future classroom
practice with the help of librarians. Please read carefully and respond to each statement in the
survey by selecting the appropriate option on a five-point Likert scale. The survey will take 30
to 45 minutes to complete. All your responses will be kept confidential and will only be
accessible to the researcher.
Participation is entirely voluntary and you are free to withdraw without penalty at any time. If
you choose to participate in the study, read the following statement and sign your name. “I would

you about 1) your knowledge of information literacy, 2) your perceptions about the practices of
information literacy you intend to use with your future students, and 3) your perceptions about
the librarian’s role in helping develop your future teaching practices.
Information literacy is defined as “the ability to recognize when information is needed and have
the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information” (Association of
College and Research Librarians, 2000, p. 4). However, an individual’s interests can affect this
competence. For some, it is used primarily as a research skill to apply in their research work,
while others also use this competency to educate their students and the people around them to
enrich the knowledge and improve the scientific of research skills.
Please think about the last lesson you taught, or assignment/research paper that you completed
for a recent class when filling out this survey.
