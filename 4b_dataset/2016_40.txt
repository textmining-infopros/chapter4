ABSTRACT
Autism is one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the United States.
Due to impairments in social interaction and communication, autistic children face
challenges in traditional education settings where instruction is based mainly on one-way
communication between teachers and students. On the other hand, current research
indicates that the museum environment offers opportunities for free-choice, object-based,
and inquiry-based learning suitable for the educational and social needs of autistic
children. However, there is a paucity of professional literature assessing the impact of
such unconventional settings as museums on the learning experience of autistic children.
To narrow this gap in our knowledge, this dissertation investigated the effects of
museum cultural experience on learning and behaviors of children with autism, under the
theoretical framework of Falk and Dierking’s Contextual Model of Learning that has
been used to examine museum learning in personal, sociocultural, and physical contexts.
Structurally, this research was conducted during a series of visits to the Columbia
Museum of Art by a group of autistic children selected for participation by specific
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Methodologically, the researcher used a mixed methods
approach that employed the standardized Social Responsiveness Scale, parent surveys,
behavioral observations, task evaluations, and follow-up parent interviews to record
changes in the subjects’ content knowledge and behaviors throughout the museum visits.

v

The findings of the study provided support for its key argument that participation
in a tailored educational museum program positively impacts cognitive and social
behaviors of children living with autism. This research illuminated the capacity of art
museums to contribute to the overall well-being of autistic children by providing a
diverse cultural and educational experience that meets their unique needs. Another
implication of this study was that it stimulated the dialogue between the autism
community and the cultural sector about the role of social justice principles in making
museums more inclusive. Finally, the findings of the study intended to help other
museums in the region and nationwide to establish quality access programs with longterm benefits for special needs communities.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1. 1 Background of the Study
Autism is one of the fastest-growing developmental disabilities in the United
States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). Autism can cause significant
social, communication, movement, and behavioral challenges in children (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013). Due to impairments in social interaction and
communication, children diagnosed with autism may also face challenges in traditional
education settings that employ a linear model of knowledge transmission from the teacher
to students. Professional literature (Greenspan & Wieder, 2006) indicates that the
challenges for autistic children increase especially as the curriculum and intellectual
demands become more rigorous. Therefore, providing alternative or supplementary
educational solutions tailored to the specific needs of autistic students has become an
issue of national concern (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014).
Moreover, creating opportunities for accessible and inclusive education is of
paramount importance for ensuring the overall well-being of families affected by autism
and enhancing their cultural and recreational experience (Coyne & Fullerton, 2004).
Rapp (2005) also calls for a more decisive move toward inclusive education based on the
recognition of diversity and respect for multiple intelligences and different learning styles.
Museums present an ideal environment in this regard. For years, museums have

1

demonstrated their public value as educational providers, community anchors, and
stewards of our national heritage (American Alliance of Museums, 2013). Now,
museums are playing an increasingly significant role in many health care issues.
Currently, the scope of many museum services is expanding to include visitors with
special needs by designing access programs and activities suitable for people with
physical and intellectual disabilities (Langa et al., 2013).
Thus, museums as public learning institutions are adding to their traditional roles
of connecting visitors to their communities, culture and history and are becoming more
and more integral to public health (American Alliance of Museums, 2013). The existing
museum practice (Baldino, 2012; Gardner, 1991; Museum Access Consortium, n.d.;
Stringer, 2014) indicates that autistic children, especially those who are high-functioning,
tend to be interested in museum activities and may benefit from unique interactive
opportunities available in the museum environment. The sensory needs of autistic
children can also be satisfied through object-centered, inquiry-based learning that is at the
forefront of most modern museum education initiatives (Stringer, 2014). Falk & Dierking
(2000) call museum learning free-choice as it happens through visual thinking, craft
making, storytelling, and other forms of engagement. It is clear then that the lives of
autistic children can be enriched through leisure pursuits and participation in organized
recreation, such as museum visitation (Coyne & Fullerton, 2004).
1. 2 Statement of the Problem
Numerous museums nationwide are beginning to understand the premise behind
the American Alliance of Museums’ Diversity and Inclusion Policy Statement (American
Alliance of Museums, 2014). Although they are opening their doors to special needs
2

populations, extensive research is needed to grasp the not yet fully-understood capacity
of cultural institutions to reach out to users who have long been marginalized. In addition,
our understanding of visitors with special needs and the nature of their learning and social
interactions in leisure settings is not yet well-established.
Despite efforts to create diverse and inclusive learning environments in museums,
there is a paucity of museum accessibility literature assessing the impact of such
unconventional settings on the learning experience of children with Autism Spectrum
Disorder (Langa et al., 2013). The problem exists because until now much of the autism
research has focused on the medical aspects of this disorder, such as causes, treatment
options, and behavior improvements that can be made in formal educational settings
(Koegel, R., Bradshaw, Ashbaugh, & Koegel, L., 2014). At the same time, scholars and
educators in the United States have not devoted enough attention to investigating how
leisure environments, such as museums and other cultural institutions, may contribute to
knowledge acquisition, cognitive development, and reduction in social or communication
deficits typical for children on the autism spectrum. Therefore, there is a clear need to
narrow the gap in the existing knowledge by exploring how a tailored museum
experience affects learning and behaviors of autistic children.
1.3 Research Questions
This dissertation addressed broad issues of inclusion and equity of access to
cultural heritage in the context of contemporary museums. A growing number of
museums are now exercising their exceptional capacity to provide learning-rich
experiences and information resources for visitors with special needs who have
previously been marginalized. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder represent one of
3

those populations. The purpose of the proposed research was to investigate the effect of
museum experience on learning of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The study
addressed the following main question:
How does the museum experience influence learning and behaviors of children
diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder?
In this study, museum experience was operationally defined as a series of six
museum visits within the specified period of time during spring 2015. Each visit
consisted of an inquiry-based guided gallery tour followed by a related hands-on artmaking activity. Furthermore, learning was operationally defined as changes in the
knowledge of the art-related concepts, as well as improvement in social behaviors of
autistic children. Lastly, social behaviors were defined as participating in mutual positive
interactions with others and responding appropriately to others’ social cues (Beaumont &
Sofronoff, 2008).
In an effort to answer the main question in this study, a series of sub-questions
were considered:
1. What are museum experiences of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder?
2. How does the Contextual Model of Learning (Falk & Dierking, 2000) apply to the
educational and social museum experiences of children diagnosed with Autism
Spectrum Disorder?
3. What are the needs and motivations of families affected by Autism Spectrum
Disorder for visiting the museum?

4

4. Does the museum experience increase the autistic children’s knowledge in a
particular cognitive domain?
1. 4 Significance of the Study
Museums can be effective public educational institutions only when they meet the
needs and expectations of a diverse population of visitors (Adams, Falk, & Dierking,
2003; Chang, 2006; Hooper-Greenhill, 1999). For years, museums have demonstrated
their public value as educational providers, community anchors, and stewards of our
national heritage. Presently, museums are playing a significant role in many health care
issues. They are expanding the scope of their services to include visitors with special
needs by designing access programs and activities suitable for people with physical and
intellectual disabilities.
The exploration of the cultural and learning experience autistic children gain in
museums is a critical area of research because it allows for a better understanding of the
value museums hold for special populations. This research aimed to bridge the gap
among several disciplines and draw attention to the broad issues of accessibility of
cultural institutions and equity of access to cultural heritage. It used the art museum
setting to establish and quantify the potential of contemporary cultural heritage
institutions to provide rich learning and social experiences to visitors with special needs.
Expanding the boundaries of traditional research on special needs populations, this study
attempted to prove that museums could play a vital role in enhancing the well-being and
the overall quality of life of children living with autism. These improvements could be
made because of the unique environment offered by museums with the emphasis on
visitor-centered and object-based learning.
5

The other goal of the study was to inform and inspire more museums to take
advantage of what is already in place—a setting conducive to multisensory, engaging,
and free-choice learning—the type of learning environment where children with autism
can reach their potential. Further, this research was intended to stimulate dialogue
between the autism community and the cultural sector about integrating the principles of
social justice into current educational practices of cultural institutions to make our field
more inclusive and relevant to all of its service communities. From a broader perspective,
this research was undertaken to find out how cultural institutions could be transformed to
ensure equity of access to human cultural heritage for all users, regardless of their
physical or intellectual ability. Therefore, this study will serve as a model for other
museums looking to enhance their programmatic offerings to local communities with
special needs.

CHAPTER 2
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
This chapter presents a review of the literature relevant to the research focus of
the study. The chapter begins with the general discussion of Autism Spectrum Disorder,
including its features, characteristics, and challenges it presents to children affected by
this developmental disorder. The chapter continues with an overview of the evolution of
the accessibility movement in cultural institutions, with the special emphasis on its legal
underpinnings. In order to more appropriately frame the study in the context of the
current museum research and practice, the chapter considers some of the best inclusive
practices that have already been adopted by museums nationwide. The chapter then
examines the Contextual Model of Learning that was used as the study’s theoretical
framework. Finally, the review offers a broad perspective of the nature of museum
learning and concludes with the discussion of its applicability to the museum experience
of special needs children.
2.1 Autism Spectrum Disorder
Autism was first described in the 1940s by pediatrician Leo Kanner (Kanner,
1943) and today it is one of the fastest-growing developmental disabilities in the United
States. In March 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cited the
incidence of autism at an alarming rate of one in 68 children and one in 42 boys (Centers

7

for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014), so that CDC regarded it as an issue of
national concern.
There are still many unknowns about this extensive group of developmental
disorders but our understanding of the variability of the condition has improved over time.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and autism are both general terms for a group of
complex disorders of brain development. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), Autism Spectrum Disorder is described
as a range of complex neurodevelopment disorders characterized by social impairments,
communication difficulties, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of
behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Autistic disorder, sometimes called
autism or classical ASD, is the most severe form of ASD, while other conditions along
the spectrum include milder forms of autism such as high-functioning autism, childhood
disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Autism is a spectrum disorder that is genetically linked and typically appears in
the first three years of life. Manifestations of autism vary, including different degrees of
severity of symptoms, the starting age, and communication impairments and language
delay. Many features of autism impact the children’s learning ability and participation in
recreational activities. Learning and recreational activities have inherent social aspects.
The first major feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder is impairments in social interaction.
Since autistic children may appear aloof and indifferent to other people, their behavior
does not easily fit into others’ perception of what is normal. Individuals with autism may
have difficulty reading social cues or maintaining eye contact. The second major feature

8

is impairments in verbal and nonverbal communication, such as gestures or facial
expressions (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
These impairments are exhibited in difficulty processing spoken or written
language, or difficulty using language in a typical manner. Autistic children may have
problems understanding abstract concepts and experiences, which affects their
engagement with cultural content and instructional materials. Communication problems
are often caused by the unusual way information is processed, organized, and used by an
autistic individual. Understanding gestures and facial expressions is also difficult for
autistic children, even smiles and nods that encourage good behavior are hard for them to
comprehend and process. Since they lack the skills to communicate their intentions
properly, autistic children often express themselves by screaming, scratching, kicking,
and saying, “No” (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
The third major feature is repetitive and stereotyped behavior. It can negatively
affect the children’s ability to participate in learning and recreational activities. Due to
the narrow range of interests, it may be hard for teachers to find activities that would
motivate autistic children. They tend to enjoy simple expressions and manipulations of
objects, such as banging, twisting, and lining up according to size, color and shape. The
fourth feature is resistance to environmental change or to change in daily routines.
Autistic children find stressful those situations in which they are asked to make even
minor changes to their routines. They experience difficulty with transitions and making
adjustments. Without support, autistic children are not likely to enjoy new activities or
explore new environments on their own (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

9

The fifth and final major feature of autistic children is unusual responses to
sensory experiences. They can be over-stimulated by lights, excessive sounds, crowds,
and other environmental elements. These factors may cause extreme anxiety and
discomfort. Sensory overload may result in aggressive behaviors and consequently lead
to exclusion of an autistic child from regular recreational or cultural activities (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Understanding all these characteristics is important for museum educators and
program providers as they design special programs for the children with autism. Lack of
knowledge of special needs populations, particularly children with ASD, as well as lack
of understanding of the required support mechanisms can deny them access to cultural
heritage and resultant learning opportunities. Therefore, it is vital for museum
professionals to equip themselves with the knowledge and skills to deal with special
behaviors caused by autism in order to effectively plan and manage access programs in
contemporary museums and other cultural institutions.
Current autism literature and research mainly focus on the problems and medical
needs of individuals with ASD. With a growing number of studies about diagnosis and
interventional possibilities, there is limited literature assessing the educational potential
of the museum setting for children with ASD as well as the impact of such a setting on
their behaviors and social skills. Nevertheless, museums and other cultural organizations
across the country are responding to the call for greater inclusiveness and diversity. They
are implementing programs that support individuals with special needs in their learning
and recreation activities. Those efforts can suggest practical tips for colleagues in the
field who are concerned with building more inclusive service communities. Steps like

10

preparing sensory bags or social stories to get autistic children ready for a museum visit,
more expressive communication, using visual schedules to reinforce the day’s plan, and
simply focusing on the students in the room can help museums to take advantage of what
is already in place—a multisensory setting conducive to active learning and student
engagement (Baldino, 2012).
2.2 Accessibility of Cultural Institutions and Its History
According to the Institute of Museum and Library Services, there are more than
17,000 museums in the United States (Institute of Museum and Library Services, 2009).
The term “museums” is used broadly and encompasses other cultural institutions, such as
zoos, historic sites, botanical gardens, and aquariums. They are known as public service
and learning institutions carrying out the mission to serve the general public by making
their programs and facilities as broadly accessible as possible. As museums expand their
role in contemporary society and evolve into centers of community engagement and
learning, accessibility of their collections and educational services becomes an issue of
primary concern for their administrators.
The Museum Access Consortium, a flagship New York-based advocacy
organization in the Northeast, defines accessibility broadly, to include architectural,
physical, programmatic, communication, attitudinal and other forms of access (Museum
Access Consortium. (n.d.). The accessibility movement has been gaining momentum
among cultural heritage institutions since the 1970s. Operating under this basic but
powerful tenet, museums strive to become more equitable, diverse, and widely-inclusive.
The first step in this direction is to open their doors to people with disabilities and grant
them access to the riches of human cultural heritage. Meeting the needs of special
11

populations is an important part of the effort to diversify museum audiences and market
museum services to a growing segment of the community that has previously been
marginalized and excluded. Therefore, cultural institutions have made consistent efforts
to embed diversity and equality into their policies and practice.
Visitors with disabilities present both an opportunity and a challenge for the
cultural sector. Millions of Americans with physical or developmental disabilities pay
taxes, attend schools, and are part of the workforce. Their number has been on a steady
rise. In the United States, more than fifty-six million people, or approximately 18.7% of
the total population, live with a disability (Stoddard, 2014). Although they receive
educational support, their involvement with the cultural sector is insufficient (Coyne &
Fullerton, 2004). To change this situation, contemporary museums invest time and money
to remove barriers from their facilities, design accessible exhibitions, and provide
effective communication for their programs. There is a growing awareness in museums
that providing a variety of ways to access cultural information can facilitate a wide range
of learning experiences as well as improve access for more people.
The movement toward accessibility of cultural institutions is deeply rooted in the
notions of civil rights and diversity. The second half of the twentieth century saw the
emergence and an increase in influence of the disability rights movement in the United
States. In the mid-1970s, there were several landmark historical and legal developments
that brought people with disabilities into the mainstream of society. The first of those
significant laws was the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (1974). This Act affects a wide range
of rights and services, including recreational services. Section 504 prohibits
discrimination on the basis of disability in programs conducted by federal agencies,

12

including cultural and recreational programs. Furthermore, the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was passed in 1972 (Office of Special Education
Programs, 2007). IDEA is a regulation that describes how states and public agencies
should provide early intervention, special education, and related services to eligible
children and youth with disabilities. IDEA is the key federal legislation relevant to
children with autism.
Finally, another piece of legislation worth mentioning is the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 (1991). Under the ADA, no individual may be
discriminated against on the basis of disability with regard to equal enjoyment of goods
and services in places of public accommodation, including museums. This law provides
similar protection against discrimination for disabled people as the Civil Rights Act of
1964 (1965). The significance of the ADA is that it has changed the public perception of
the concept of accessibility as something related only to physical conditions. The ADA
redefined disability to include both mental and physical conditions. Under the ADA,
disability also began to be understood as a legal term rather than just a medical term.
Therefore, the ADA was the first major legislation that provided the promise of equality
to all people with disabilities. The ADA specified that a condition did not need to be
severe or permanent to be a disability, which enabled more visitors to participate in
special programs offered by cultural institutions.
These congressional statutes have helped to form a solid legal foundation for
integrating the principles of diversity and accessibility into cultural organizations’ longterm strategic planning. The concept of “Access for All” began to factor in day-to-day
operations of museums, from general programming to audience development process.

13

The broadened notion of accessibility signified a shift in museums’ approach to this issue.
For decades before the ADA, museums had considered accessibility issues mainly in
terms of barrier-free physical access while there was an obvious exclusion of people with
intellectual disability from the museum world. With the consistent legal basis firmly in
place, museums began working toward inclusion of all visitors, including those with
intellectual or developmental disabilities. Museum administrators understood it was their
legal obligation to provide accessible services to all target communities.
The way to put this new service philosophy to practice and meet the ADA
requirements was through the application of the universal design principles that intend to
remove all physical barriers to access. Universal design can be defined as the design of
products and environments to be usable by all people without the need for adaptation or
specialized design (Story, Mueller, & Mace, 1998). The guiding principle is that the
universal design techniques enhance the educational experience for learners of all
abilities. The principles of universal design, originated as an architecture concept, quickly
expanded to broad-spectrum ideas that applied to buildings, exhibits and environments to
make them inherently accessible to people of all ages, abilities and size. Gradually,
universal design techniques spread beyond the physical aspect of museum operations.
These principles were increasingly applied in the educational context to provide equal
access to learning that was happening in museums. Using universal design to facilitate
learning is a sign of progress in museums’ attempts to position themselves as centers of
teaching and learning. By now, museums across the country have committed to the
universal design practices because visitors with disabilities are finally recognized as part
of the diverse museum audience.

14

2.3 Diversity and Inclusiveness in Museums
Museums as cultural institutions have for a long time been considered as centers
of public learning. There exists an extensive body of literature that discusses the
evolution of museums from elitist institutions that served a limited public into agencies
that support diversity and inclusion (Stringer, 2014). From their earlier days, many
museums realized their great potential to advance knowledge among all members of
society, and the calls for museums to embrace an educational mission came from both
scholars and practitioners in the field (Falk & Dierking, 2000). More widespread
adoption of inclusion policies has had a profound impact on museum educational
practices. During the early 1990s, museums went through a paradigm shift from the focus
on collections and objects preservation to their current emphasis on educational
programming and visitor learning experience.
Although in the past museums served mainly as repositories of objects from
wealthy donors, education is a primary goal of contemporary museums (Schwartz, 2006).
In its project “Museums, Libraries, and the 21st Century Skills,” the Institute of Museum
and Library Services (2009) identifies museums as strong community anchors that,
together with formal education and other community organizations, create a network of
learning within a community. In this capacity, museums should have a mission to equip
citizens with a range of skills necessary to succeed in the dynamic twenty-first century
world. The International Council of Museums (ICOM) agrees with this assessment,
identifying museums as places of education, study, creativity, and enjoyment for all
(International Council of Museums, 2007).

15

In the early 1990s, many museums across the country made efforts to improve
accessibility and diversify museum audiences. Several scholars have claimed that
recreational opportunities and leisure experiences need to be prioritized in the education
and preparation of citizens with disabilities (Fine, 1991; Dattilo & Schleien, 1994).
Individuals with ASD represent a growing segment of the general population and
therefore, it is important to provide them with an opportunity to engage in various
museum and cultural activities.
The Standing Professional Committee on Education under the American
Association of Museums (1990) first published its Statement on Professional Standards
for Museum Education that was the first attempt to re-examine issues critical to museum
education. The Statement promoted education as central to the museum mission and
encouraged integration of education programming into a wide array of museums’
activities. Since then, visitor education has come to the forefront of museums’ strategic
efforts. As Falk and Dierking (2012) observe, in recent decades museums have
increasingly positioned themselves as educational institutions, which explains why a
growing number of exhibitions, as well as websites, programs and other activities are
driven by educational goals.
Numerous authors (Adams, Falk, & Dierking, 2003; Chang, 2006; HooperGreenhill, 1999) have argued that museums can be effective public educational
institutions only when they meet the needs and expectations of a diverse population of
visitors. Currently, museums are making efforts to respond to the call for greater
inclusiveness by prioritizing programming that supports individuals with special needs in
their learning and recreation activities (Golden & Walsh, 2013; Graham, 2013; Kirk,

16

2001). Further, the American Alliance of Museums (2014) published the Diversity and
Inclusion Policy Statement that calls for promoting diversity of participation, thought,
and action. In doing so, museums are recognizing their increased role in promoting social
justice and advocating for human rights (United Nations General Assembly, 1948).
Shepherd (2009) points out that the concept of inclusion within society is rooted in
human rights. Inclusion as a phenomenon stems from a history of exclusion where
individuals with ‘special educational needs’ have been traditionally segregated from
society, especially in educational settings (Florian, 1998).
While the concept of social inclusion is now a widely accepted notion, the
challenge for cultural institutions is to develop programs, practices, and services that
support the diversity of users’ learning needs, especially for those with physical and
developmental disabilities (Florian, 2008). Back in 2002, the American Association of
Museums Committee on Education published Excellence in Practice: Museum Education
Principles and Standards (2002) that combined the 1990 standards with more current
directions in best practice. It is interesting to note that accessibility, inclusiveness, and
equity of access was the first standard mentioned in the 2002 document, clearly
indicating this as a top priority in museum work. Stringer (2014) also comments on the
transformation of the museum from a place of research and knowledge for elite scholars
to a place of learning for all audiences, including communities with special needs. These
audiences can derive benefits from informal and creative learning opportunities presented
by the museum environment.
The casual and informal style of teaching and learning through direct interaction
with museum objects is in contrast with how learning happens in the traditional

17

classroom. Formal education typically takes place in a rigid environment with standardsbased curricula and the standardized test atmosphere of schools (Gardner, 1991). It is not
surprising that scholars, such as Rapp (2005), have urged museums to move toward more
innovative, collaborative, and student-centered practices, particularly for students with
learning and developmental disabilities. The valuable form of collaboration is described
in recent studies (Tam, Nassivera, Rousseau, & Vreeland, 2000) as school-museum
partnership for students with disabilities. It is necessary for every individual and society
as a whole to embrace the need for diversity and inclusion. Now the notion of inclusive
museum is becoming increasingly embedded in the design of physical and virtual exhibits
as well as other education programs and practices. In such an inclusive environment,
students of all abilities are able to complete their individualized learning tasks. All these
access and inclusion efforts in modern museums are aimed at fulfilling a social justice
agenda and making a difference in the lives of museum audiences.
2.4 Museum Access Programs: Best Practices
Museums are fulfilling their newly-defined roles in society and advancing their
social justice agenda. In a broad sense, accessibility implies inclusiveness, diversity,
equality, as well as creation of participatory culture. Specifically, accessibility can be
understood as identifying barriers to cultural heritage, adapting content and delivery of
programs to people with special needs.
A number of widely-known museums are on the forefront of the accessibility
movement. They offer opportunities for adaptation and amplification for smaller
museums and cultural centers. The Smithsonian Institution, a flagship cultural
organization for the country, has created a number of special programs for families with
18

children on the autism spectrum. "Mornings at the Museum" is available for this
population to visit the museum half an hour before it is open to the general public
(Smithsonian Institution, n.d.). The purpose of this special time is to reduce the
distractions that autistic children may face during the busy hours of the day. To reduce
sensory stimuli, staff members lower the light level for the children and start with only
one exhibit at a time. To reduce anxiety and the fear of the new experience, pre-visit
materials called "social stories" are also available for the parents to share with their
children before they visit the museum. Some materials offered by the Smithsonian
Institution describe the future visit and the rules of behavior in a way that autistic
children can easily understand. The Smithsonian has put these pre-visit materials online
and intends to create a structure for a predictable environment so that autistic children
know what they may expect in every specific situation or what will come next.
The New York Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met) is another example of a
cultural institution that welcomes visitors with special needs, including children with
ASD. The “Met for All” offers a series of multisensory workshops called “Discoveries”
that include tactile opportunities and art-making activities (Metropolitan Museum of Art,
n.d.). Each “Discoveries” workshop focuses on a theme, such as America: Yesterday,
Today, and Tomorrow, Surrounded by Art, Shape Up!, Made from the Earth, and
includes a gallery tour followed by a related art activity in the studio. Similar to the
Smithsonian accessibility program, “Discoveries” workshops come together with online
pre-visit resources including social narratives, interactive sensory friendly maps, Tips for
Parents of Children on the Autism Spectrum, and My Met tour that parents can take with

19

their children. Besides assistance for autistic visitors, the Met provides extensive online
resources for visitors with all disabilities.
The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston also has special programming targeted at
visitors affected by autism. First, “Artful Healing” offers a specially designed program
for children ages 8-12 on the autism spectrum (Museum of Fine Arts Boston, n.d.).
Children attend this program accompanied by a parent or caregiver. All children go
through a brief evaluation process and are divided into groups by age or their specific
needs. Second, there is the “Beyond the Spectrum” program which meets one Saturday
per month (Museum of Fine Arts Boston, n.d.). Each class lasts an hour and a half and
combines gallery exploration with an art-making activity. Participating autistic children
get a chance to develop their creativity and fine motor skills while working on hands-on
tasks. These programs create a welcoming learning environment for families of autistic
children. For example, the children can have a sensory break during their visit or are
provided sensory cool-down items.
The Dallas Museum of Art features an initiative called “Autism Awareness
Programs.” This program provides a safe, comfortable way to introduce the museum to
children with autism and their families (Dallas Museum of Art, n.d.). For example, in
January the museum offers a program with a winter theme featuring staff-led gallery
experiences and snowy art-making experiments in the studio. Autistic families are
encouraged to have an interactive performance with a music therapist and even relax in
the sensory room facilitated by occupational therapy students from Texas Woman’s
University. The museum offers free early admission to pre-registered families who can
come before the museum opens to the public.

20

Discovery Museums in Acton, Massachusetts, have developed “Especially for
Me!” in partnership with the Autism Alliance of MetroWest to serve families in the
region affected by ASD (Discovery Museums, n.d.). Their two programs “ASD Friendly
Afternoons” and “Free Evenings for Families of Children with an ASD” offer
opportunities to explore and enjoy the museum without limitations and the fear of being
judged. To make the visits more comfortable, the museum does not schedule school
groups or birthday parties during the program time in order to avoid overcrowding and
support access to exhibits for autistic families. A dedicated room is available to welcome
families with an autistic child to orient them to the programs and provide a quiet space
for children needing a break from the stimulation of the Discovery Museums.
Finally, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Jacksonville, Florida, has offered a
program called “Rainbow Artists,” an educational initiative designed exclusively for
children with ASD (Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville, n.d.). The program
creators believe that the creative art-making activities enable autistic children to foster
new means of self-expression and communication. Using art studio and galleries, the
“Rainbow Artists” program focused on creating collaborative art projects, at the same
time improving children’s motor and social skills. The program was created in 2007 and
offered on Saturdays through 2014 with only five children enrolled at the very beginning.
In seven years, the program grew to serve over two hundred autistic children and has
been nationally recognized by museum associations and health care providers alike.
In all, what these initiatives have in common is the goal to make all visitors feel
welcomed by providing consistent, effortless access to a wide range of programs,
collections, and facilities. All these successful access programs help address the special

21

challenges autistic children have with social interaction, sensory processing, verbal and
nonverbal communication, and repetitive behavior. In a broader sense, they illustrate the
idea that museums which operate within the sphere of human rights are more effective in
developing inclusive and diverse practices.
2.5 Theoretical Framework
The Contextual Model of Learning (Falk & Dierking, 2000) has been used in the
museum scholarship as a major theoretical construct for examining and investigating
learning within free-choice environments, such as museums and other public learning
institutions. The Model is widely considered to be centerpiece for helping understand
why and how people learn, as well as what they may take away from each learning
experience. The Contextual Model of Learning can be better understood as a framework
rather than a model because it does not aim to make predictions about the course of
learning or its outcomes.
Falk and Dierking (2000) conceptualize learning as a conscious continuous effort
of an individual to make meaning of the world around them. This effort takes place in a
particular physical and sociocultural environment. The interaction between the individual
and the environment is always situated within a set of contexts. Drawing from a number
of constructivist, cognitive, and sociocultural theories, Falk and Dierking (2008) portray
learning as both the process and the product of the interactions over time between three
contexts: the personal, the sociocultural, and the physical. Although in theory these
contexts can be separated into three distinct entities, in reality they are always intertwined
and connected with each other. Thus, the three contexts allow one to consider learning as
a holistic experience.
22

Personal context
The personal context is represented by a learner’s motivation and expectations,
previously-developed interests, prior knowledge and experience with the subject-matter,
as well as the choice and control over what is to be learned and in which way. If personal
expectations are met, then learning is facilitated and the visitor feels motivated to learn
even more. On the other hand, if the visitor’s initial motivations are not fulfilled during
the visit, then learning takes place to a much lesser extent or does not happen at all.
Importantly, differences in visitor personal context help anticipate many of the
differences in visitor behaviors and learning styles. Given that the ultimate goal of
learning is meaning-making, the meaning is naturally unique for each individual so that
they tend to define their own learning experiences that may best help to fulfill particular
learning needs. Falk and Dierking (2000) conclude that museum learning is personal in
nature because it is constructed around and determined by each visitor’s personal
background, and those backgrounds vary greatly across groups of visitors or even within
the same group.
Sociocultural context
However, the personal context alone cannot fully explain the unique nature of
each museum visitor experience. The sociocultural context must also be taken into
consideration because each visitor’s perspective is strongly influenced by it. The
sociocultural context recognizes the social nature of human beings. In this context, people
are viewed as integral parts of their culture and society. As typical free-choice learning
settings, museums provide a fertile ground for individualized perception, interpretation,
and knowledge construction. However, museum visitation does not take place in a
23

vacuum, so that visitors are presented with numerous opportunities to share their
experiences and form social bonds in the process.
The sociocultural context of a museum visit covers the social interaction between
the visitor and his or her immediate companions, as well as other visitors and even
museum staff during the visit. Therefore, the sociocultural context consists of the
following essential parts: learner cultural background, within group social mediation, and
mediation by others outside the immediate social group. Simply put, the sociocultural
context implies that learners are deeply influenced by the collaborations and interactions
they have within their social group. The sociocultural context may refer to people with
whom the learner primarily interacts, as well as those he or she may encounter during the
learning process. These instances of socialization include interactions not only within
groups but also between learners, and learners and staff. Research (Falk & Dierking,
2012) has demonstrated that interactions with others outside one’s own social group, such
as facilitators, performers, or other social groups, can make a substantial difference for
the effectiveness of learning.
Physical context
Finally, the physical context describes the physical environment in which learning
occurs, such as advanced organizers (supervisors), orientation to physical space, building
architecture and the overall environment, as well as programming and technology
available to learners. Since learners are influenced by the physical design, a stable
physical context is particularly important for the learning process. In general, searching
for meaning and making sense of the environment are deeply ingrained in the human
nature. Therefore, people tend to learn better when they feel secure and oriented in their
24

surroundings. Additionally, the physical context may extend beyond the building walls,
and learning may or should continue after the actual experience is completed. The
acquired information is further processed in the learner’s consciousness as it is enriched
and made more meaningful after the learning experience by the contexts outside the
original setting.
In Learning from Museums: Visitor Experience and the Making of Meaning, Falk
and Dierking (2008) summarize the Contextual Model of Learning as a combination of
the following factors: the personal context that consists of (1) visit motivation and
expectations; (2) prior knowledge and experience; (3) Prior interests; and (4) choice and
control. The sociocultural context consists of (1) visitor cultural background; (2) within
group social mediation; and (3) mediation by others outside the immediate social group.
The physical context consists of (1) advanced organizers and orientation to physical
space; (2) building architecture and the overall environment; (3) programming and
technology available in the museum; and (4) reinforcing experiences outside the museum.
Learning is an active and individual process that must take place in an engaging
and safe environment. More specifically, learning is affected by the environment in
which it takes place, by an individual’s personal experiences, and by the sociocultural
sphere. As a result, the three-dimensional nature of the Contextual Model of Learning is
highly usable in the practice of cultural institutions, particularly museums. The Model
helps to understand the museum experience from the visitor’s perspective. Since the
museum experience is inherently about learning and cognition, the Contextual Model of
Learning provides museums with a better understanding of how museum visitors make
sense of their experiences. Given the growing diversity of present-day museum visitors,

25

understanding why they decide to go to a museum, what they do there, and what they
take away presents a considerable challenge. It is the Contextual Model of Learning that
helps clarify the obscurity around the visitor experience by analyzing numerous factors or
variables that contribute to visitor behavior and learning in the museum setting.
2.6 Nature of Museum Learning
In order to apply the Contextual Model of Learning to the current research, it is
first necessary to examine and define the nature of learning in museums. Learning as it
happens in the museum setting features several characteristics that distinguish museums
from the traditional classroom.
Museum learning is, by its nature, free-choice because visitors get to decide what,
how, and when they learn. Falk and Dierking (2000) argue that in this sense the museum
experience is similar to other recreational activities people engage in, such as reading a
newspaper, watching TV, or surfing the Internet. The visitor has considerable freedom if
and when to engage in the learning process and what to take away from the visit. The
idea of free-choice learning (Falk, Donovan, & Woods, 2001) describes the museum as a
unique out-of-school environment that allows the learner to identify several learning
options in a variety of spaces and finally to choose a specific option, theme, or space for
learning. Since participation in museum activities is not compulsory, learning is a desired
but not required outcome. Even guided museum tours provide visitors with a variety of
activities to choose from, and what is more important, the visitors feel they can choose
and control their exploration and learning activities.

26

Museum learning is also object-based. It builds on the human desire to explore
things that are new, to grasp the unknown, and to get a glimpse of the past by interacting
with objects and artifacts that exemplify the past. Baldino (2012) notes that a museum is
a place where visitors can interact with objects and experiences directly without
following some prescribed educational procedure. Object-based learning represents a
hands-on, active mode of learning where learners naturally stay engaged with the content
and are encouraged to use different ways of communication to express their attitudes to
the experience of a museum visit. Moreover, learning in museums is inquiry-based. It
involves a process of exploring the natural or material world that is supposed to stimulate
questions and making discoveries in search for new understanding.
Finally, museum learning can be described as participatory. Effective learning
takes place in the environment where all students learn from each other based on their
individual abilities (Bruner, 1996). This type of learning happens through conversations,
discussions, and other forms of exchanging ideas. Due to the aforementioned interaction
with objects and freely-expressed common interests, visitors form communities of
learners and museum can be viewed as the bridge between these communities. Thus, the
museum setting is especially conducive to learning through participation and engagement
in activities that are both educational and recreational. Roschelle (1995) further confirms
that developing the ability to participate in a community-based culture is critical for
knowledge acquisition. In summary, learning in and through museums, with its emphasis
on freedom of choice, visitor engagement, active participation, and object orientation
provides an innovative and promising solution to the challenges of the historically
accepted traditional education practice.

27

2.7 Application to Current Study
Given the unique nature of museum learning and the characteristics of autistic
children, the Contextual Model of Learning was used as a major theoretical construct to
explore how the museum experience influences learning of a group of children with
autism. Children of all abilities learn more from active engagement and inquiry-based
instruction than from just listening to a lecture in the regular classroom. However,
children with autism often have difficulty responding to the demands of standard
education curricula, including the need for creative and logical use of ideas, the stress of
engaging in emotional interactions with peers and instructors, and the rigorous
requirements to participate in classroom activity for prolonged periods of time. Therefore,
it is necessary to develop alternative educational solutions in order to provide quality
learning experiences tailored to the needs of autistic students.
Museums have the ability to develop vital qualities in children with autism, such
as creativity, aesthetic appreciation, spirituality, ordering, or making sense. In museums
learning happens through craft making, conversation, storytelling, and other forms of
engagement. Such an informal learning environment makes it possible for children to
learn easily and pleasantly. This way, visiting families can address not only the most
common emotional and communicative deficits associated with autism but also meet all
the other unique educational needs of autistic children. They can fully take advantage of
educational and cultural experiences museums offer in a comfortable setting that is
conducive to multisensory, engaging, and self-paced learning. The museum learning
environment can help children with autism to thrive both socially and intellectually, as
well as to live productive lives all the way into adulthood.

2.8 Summary
This chapter contained a review of the existing literature relevant to the topic of
the current study. The chapter highlighted some of the key points of previously conducted
research and positioned the Contextual Learning Model as the theoretical framework for
the study. Discussions of major characteristics of autism relevant to learning process, the
cultural experiences of autistic children, history of the accessibility movement in cultural
institutions, the issues of diversity and inclusiveness, and the nature of museum learning
contributed to a better understanding of the study’s foundation. This chapter determined
that while there existed a number of studies focusing on the medical side of autism,
including causes, symptoms, learning impairments, and various treatments, not enough
research had been done to explore the role of cultural and recreational opportunities in
helping autistic children cope with the challenges of this developmental disorder. The
review of the literature presented in this chapter provided justification for the current
study by articulating the need for additional research on learning and socialization of
autistic children in cultural settings.

CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction
This study employed a mixed methods design that helps to develop a better
understanding of the complexity of the museum experiences for children with Autism
Spectrum Disorder. The mixed methods approach to gathering, reporting, and
interpreting data entailed converging quantitative and qualitative data to obtain valuable
evidence from a variety of sources and consider the phenomenon under investigation
from multiple angles and perspectives. This research aimed to describe the factors and
processes that influence the learning and socialization of children with autism in a
museum environment.
This chapter discusses the mixed methods approach, the research design, data
collection methods, study participants’ profile, recruitment procedures, development of
materials, and data collection procedures, as well as the pilot study conducted to test the
data collection instruments.
3.2 Mixed Methods Approach
There are three major approaches to research design and data collection:
qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. The choice of a particular approach is
determined by the nature of the research problem and, to a lesser extent, by the

30

researcher’s personal preferences. Naturally, the distinctions between the three
approaches are not as rigid as they may seem, so John Creswell (2014) suggests they can
be viewed as different ends of the research spectrum rather than completely separate
research methods. Gorman and Clayton (2005) elaborate on the fundamental differences
between the qualitative and quantitative approaches by examining the basic assumptions
behind them. Quantitative methodology is rooted in the objective reality of social facts
while qualitative methodology stems from the socio-constructivist view of reality
(Gorman & Clayton, 2005).
Mixed methods approach combines qualitative and quantitative methods to
provide a better understanding of the research question than either qualitative or
quantitative data alone. Creswell (2011) points out that combining two types of data
collection techniques in the mixed methods design can provide powerful information
about the topic at hand. The mixed methods approach is used to investigate problems that
deal with understanding the relationship among variables and exploring the topic in
further detail (Creswell, 2014). This design emphasizes both the outcomes in quantitative
research and the process in qualitative research. It also provides the possibility of
triangulation, or the use of multiple sources of data to validate the findings of the study.
The use of the triangulation technique allows the researcher to identify a phenomenon
more accurately by approaching it from different angles.
For a number of years, the mixed methods approach has been recognized as
appropriate for museum studies. Madden (1985) claims that trying to control for the
many variables of a museum setting takes away from the true understanding of the
learning that occurs in the museum. In addition, Smith (1990) argues that the qualitative

31

component of the mixed methods design lends itself well to the museum setting because
it emphasizes the uniqueness of the setting itself rather than trying to control it in order to
generalize the findings to a larger population.
3.3. Research Design
This study was grounded in a rich description of the research site, the study
subjects, and the complexities of their behaviors exhibited through their actions and
interactions with peers, museum educators, and art itself. Since one data source was
insufficient to answer the research question of the study, the mixed methods approach
was chosen in order to develop a more complete and in-depth understanding of the
impact of a museum experience on autistic children. The use of qualitative methods
enabled the researcher to collect data from many perspectives over time (Miles &
Huberman, 1994). The use of numerical data enabled the researcher to measure
psychological characteristics and changes in the social behavior of the study participants.
The current understanding of visitors with special needs and the nature of their
learning and social interactions in leisure settings such as museums is not yet wellestablished. To contribute to the scholarship on this phenomenon, this study explored
how museum experience influences learning and behaviors of children affected by
Autism Spectrum Disorder though the lens of the Contextual Model of Learning (Falk &
Dierking, 1992, 2000). This theoretical framework provided a lens through which to
examine the unique learning and socialization needs of special populations in the
personal, sociocultural, and physical context of a museum.

32

The Columbia Museum of Art (CMA) was chosen as the research site for this
study. As a flagship cultural institution in South Carolina, CMA has made a consistent
effort to increase the accessibility of its collections and services (Columbia Museum of
Art, n.d.). In addition, education is viewed as an integral part of the CMA mission and
strategic vision. The CMA was opened to the public in 1950 in Columbia, South Carolina.
During the 1950s-1960s, the CMA grew substantially and became a premier cultural
institution featuring collections in art, natural history, and science. During the 1970s1980s, the museum saw a significant increase in acquisitions of European, American,
Asian, and modern and contemporary art. The CMA’s collection numbers over 7,000
objects housed in 20,000 square feet of gallery space. The current building is suitable for
the needs of diverse audiences, with its well-designed workspaces, art studios, a large
auditorium, a museum shop, and numerous event spaces (Columbia Museum of Art, n.d.).
During the summer and fall of 2014, the researcher developed a partnership with the
CMA administration and met with the Education Department staff numerous times to
discuss collaboration related to this research study. Those efforts helped secure the CMA
commitment to the project in the context of its Art and Autism access program.
The CMA access program consisted of six museum visits during April and May
2015. The program structure that included a combination of guided gallery tours and
hands-on art-making activities helped the researcher to gather diverse data to answer the
main research of the study: How does the museum experience influence learning and
behaviors of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder?
This mixed methods research employed several data collection instruments to
address the stated research question including the pre- and post-visit parent surveys, the

33

standardized Social Responsiveness Scale, pre-gallery and post-gallery tour task
evaluations, parent interviews, and onsite behavioral observations. The instruments were
chosen to measure the museum impact on a group of high-functioning autistic children
who were given an intervention in the form of six museum visits under the umbrella of
the Art and Autism access program.
3.4 Art and Autism Access Program
In response to the American Alliance of Museums call for diversity and inclusion,
the CMA developed the Art and Autism access program to meet the educational needs of
a group of special needs children diagnosed with autism. The program was a perfect fit
for the CMA mission and vision as a museum that strives to reach diverse communities
and create inclusive learning environments. The program grew out of the belief by the
museum educators that the museum experience could be used as a vehicle to enhance
learning and social skills of children with developmental disorders. It was also driven by
the intent to advocate for accessible and inclusive practices in the institution itself, the
community, and across the field.
In order to prepare themselves to work with this particular audience, the staff of
the Education Department received extensive training from behavior specialists in the
South Carolina Autism Society, as well as certified applied behavior analysts and
therapists in the Autism Academy of South Carolina. The training workshops included
discussions on teaching strategies for high-functioning autistic children, understanding
sensory needs, and addressing challenging behaviors in children with autism. This
knowledge and experience was crucial for designing and implementing the Art and
Autism program. A typical program session consisted of a guided gallery tour followed
34

by a hands-on art-making activity. During the program, museum educators introduced a
variety of art concepts. The children could then put those concepts to practice through
hands-on exercises, texture bags, and other means. In all, they could explore what they
learned by creating their own art in the museum art studio.
In the Fall 2014, the researcher approached the CMA Director of Education
regarding the possibility of collaboration for this study. After a series of meetings, a
range of topics were identified to form the core of the six-week program scheduled for
Spring 2015. The specific duration of the program was dictated by the feasibility
concerns and the convenience of the spring offerings for prospective participating
families. Each of the six weekly visits focused on a particular topic and included a 45minute guided gallery tour, a 10-minute break, and an art-making studio component.
Additionally, social story was another essential part of the experience that aimed
to help the participating children better cope with the novelty of the museum environment.
Social Story has been defined by Gray and Garand (1993) as a written or visual guide
describing various social interactions, situations, behaviors, skills, or concepts in a
particular style and format. The purpose of social story is to help individuals with autism
reduce the anxiety and stress associated with a new environment. Through the use of
visuals and written text, the social story created by the CMA staff prepared the
participants for the visits by describing the environment with relevant social cues to
facilitate the understanding of the museum rules and expectations. In particular, the social
story began with the general description of the building, including its layout and physical
address. Then, it briefly described the museum collections and gave the children a sense
of the nature and the order of the activities they were to participate in. Lastly, the social

35

story included a section that addressed the museum behavioral guidelines to help reduce
the likelihood of confusion or unpredictable behaviors.
Six lesson plans were designed so as to provide a rich learning experience for the
program participants and introduce them to some of the themes commonly taught in a
typical art education classroom. Another purpose of these tailored lesson plans was to use
art and hands-on activities to engage the children in expressing concepts, thoughts, and
feelings and thereby address the most prominent communicative deficits of autism.
Week One theme was Still Life. The lesson, combining the gallery tour and an
art-making activity, aimed to introduce the study participants to the concept of still life.
They were to identify elements of still life in the artworks they interacted with within the
museum collection and name familiar components in the artworks. They also began to
recognize how still life could be found around them in everyday life. Finally, the
participants reinforced the knowledge obtained through the gallery tour instruction by
creating their own still life artwork in the course of the subsequent art-making activity in
the CMA art studio.
Week Two theme was Animal Art Texture Collage. The lesson introduced the
study participants to animal artworks within the CMA galleries and the various media
used to create the artworks. The second goal of the lesson was to discuss the concepts of
dimension and shape, focusing on the difference between three-dimensional and twodimensional objects. During the gallery tour, the museum instructor distributed texture
bags prompting the participants to use their sense of touch to explore the paintings in
addition to the typical museum experience using only sight. The participants further

36

explored the concept of texture as they created their own collage during the art-making
activity. The lesson addressed the deficit in the communicative function of the study
participants as they were asked to verbally identify organisms within the works of art,
such as plants, animals, and habitats, and discuss or support their ideas using their
observation skills.
Week Three theme was Warm and Cool Colors. The lesson intended to introduce
the study participants to the concept of warm and cool colors. The participants were
expected to identify cool and warm colors in the artworks they encountered during the
gallery tour, as well as to sort and group artworks based on this concept. In addition, the
participants were taught to identify feelings associated with certain colors and their
personal preference for warm or cool colors, thus addressing some of the emotional
deficits characteristic of children living with autism. Then, they applied the newlyacquired knowledge to creating their own works of art during the art-making activity.
Week Four theme was Lovely Landscapes. The lesson intended to introduce the
participants to the concept of landscapes through the examination of three works of art by
Charles Courtney Curran. The participants were expected to recognize elements of a
landscape within the works of art, as well as to identify the foreground, the middleground, and the background in each of the paintings visited during the gallery tour. The
museum instructor emphasized the difference between a landscape and a cityscape. The
final goal of the lesson was to teach the participants to identify how landscapes could be
found around them in everyday life. During the art-making activity, the participants were
instructed to draw a landscape of their choice using watercolor pencils. The museum

37

educator guided them to apply the concepts of the foreground, the middle-ground, and the
background learned during the gallery tour.
Week Five theme was Patterns. The lesson intended to teach the study
participants about the concept of pattern: what it is, how to discover patterns in art, as
well as how to recreate or mimic a pattern. The lesson further addressed how patterns in
contemporary art could add a strong element of interest to a painting or drawing. Finally,
the participants became familiar with the effect of repetition and rhythm in an artwork
and were asked to use the art-making activity time to recreate such an effect in their own
art by tracing their hand on paper three-to-five times with a black marker or crayon. The
participants then created a different pattern to fill in the background of their paper.
Week Six theme was Monotype Portraits. The lesson intended to introduce the
study participants to the monotype printmaking process involving experimentation with
line and texture. Specifically, the lesson aimed to develop an understanding of this
process and the skillset necessary to create one’s own set of prints. The museum educator
instructed the participants how to create a set of prints and print out a monotype portrait
using the printing press.
3.5 Study Participants
To establish anonymity and protect confidentiality of the study participants, only
general information is provided in this section. The study subjects were a group of ten
children with clinically diagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorder, aged 8-15 years old.
Eighty percent of the study participants were between the ages 8 and 11.The children in
the group included nine boys and one girl. In terms of their racial make-up, seven

38

participants were white, two were African American, and one was biracial.
Geographically, all the participants were located in the Midlands area of South Carolina.
They came from various classroom settings. Four children participated in inclusive
classes. Burke & Sutherland (2004) define the inclusive classroom as a learning space
where each student is integrated in the general education curriculum as much as possible.
Two children participated in self-contained classes while four participants received
education in a mix of both inclusive and self-contained classes.
To control the variability within the group, predefined inclusion and exclusion
criteria were used to select the study subjects, along with their parents. The inclusion
criteria were: officially diagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorder, aged between 8-15,
functional language ability, hearing and visual acuity within normal limits, no additional
clinical diagnosis, and availability to attend museum workshops on predetermined dates.
The exclusion criteria were: severe vision and hearing impairments and severe behavior
problems. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined in consultation with
faculty in the Department of Psychology and the College of Education at the University
of South Carolina. Eligibility for the study was determined through initial parental
screening addressing participant selection criteria. The parents of the selected study
participants were required to participate in all six museum visits. The small number of the
participants was due to the feasibility concerns and data collection considerations.
3.6 Recruitment Procedures
Recruitment of the participants took place through several different avenues. First,
an Art and Autism museum program flyer was created and distributed through a number
of autism advocacy organizations, such as the South Carolina Autism Society (SCAS),
39

the Autism Academy of South Carolina (AASC), and Family Connection - South
Carolina. The researcher contacted the Information and Referrals Coordinator of the
South Carolina Autism Society regarding advertising the program through the
organization’s social media channels, including its listserv and the Facebook account. As
a result, the program flyer was posted on the SCAS Facebook page in February and
March 2015, as well as distributed to the autism community through the society’s listserv.
The promotional flyer was also published in the March 2015 issue of the SCAS
newsletter. Additionally, the flyer was on display at the main office of the Autism
Academy of South Carolina during the months of February and March 2015 and was
distributed to the participants of the “Light It Up Blue” event on April 2, 2015. Through
the collaboration with Family Connection - South Carolina, program flyers were
distributed to the attendees of its Annual Conference on March 6, 2015, along with a
Facebook page posting.
Another main participant recruitment effort was related to the communication
with the Special Education Coordinators in three school districts in the Columbia area,
including Richland District One, Richland District Two, and School District Five of
Lexington and Richland Counties. In order to distribute the program flyer, the researcher
obtained the official approvals from the Office of Accountability, Assessment, Research
and Evaluation in District One, the Office of Accountability and Evaluation in District
Two, and the Office of Public Information in School District Five of Lexington and
Richland Counties. The flyer was also distributed through the Special Needs Coordinator
in Palmetto Pediatric and Adolescent Clinic, Team Therapy Clinic, as well as through the
University of South Carolina Speech & Hearing Research Center. Moreover, the program

40

flyer was shared with members of the local autism community through the South
Carolina Department of Education's Office of Special Education Services. Finally,
recruitment of the participants also took place at the South Carolina Assistive Technology
Expo 2015 in Columbia, SC.
3.7 Data Collection Methods
To address the research questions of the study, this research employed several
data collection instruments, including survey, standard scale, behavioral observation, task
evaluation, and semi-structured interview. The survey is a popular social scientific
research method for collecting data from people. These data may be about people’s vital
facts, current attitudes, opinions, beliefs, motivations, and behavior (Kerlinger, 1973).
Standard scales are generally used to assess the baseline level of autistic children’s
behaviors and monitor the subjects’ progress over time. The observation technique is
useful for evaluating behaviors, states, physical characteristics, and permanent products
of behavior (Salvia & Ysseldyke, 1998). There are two ways to conducting observation:
qualitative and quantitative. Salvia and Ysseldyke (1998) point out that qualitative
observation often precedes quantitative observation. However, this study employed the
quantitative technique alone to measure behaviors that were deemed particularly
important. The interview was the final data collection technique because of its ability to
provide in-depth information related to the participating children’s experiences.
Specifically, the purpose of the interviews was to capture how the participating parents
felt about the museum access program, as well as to discover the complexity of the
participants’ experience with the program (Patton, 2002). A more detailed description of
each method follows.

41

Parent survey
Parent pre-program and post-program surveys (see Appendix F & Appendix G)
were designed by the researcher and administered before the start and at the end of the
Columbia Museum of Art access project. The surveys consisted of both open-ended and
close-ended questions. The purpose of the parent pre-program survey was to investigate
family motivations, needs, and expectations for visiting the museum. The pre-program
survey also included a question about the children’s major interests in order to make sure
that they would get the most out of the museum access program. Finally, the pre-program
survey featured a question about the children’s previous museum experience. The
answers allowed the researcher to obtain a better understanding of the participants’
backgrounds before the start of the museum access program.
At the completion of the project, the parents were surveyed again to determine
how they viewed the effect the museum experience had on their child. More specifically,
the post-program survey intended to collect information about the perceived impact of the
museum program on the cognitive and social aspects of the autistic children’s behavior.
In addition, Likert-scaled questions were used to find out the parents’ level of satisfaction
with the project as well as their assessment of the overall experience their child had at the
museum. The parents were also asked to indicate how often their child exhibited certain
social behaviors, such as following directions, sharing objects, and taking turns in
conversation. Likert scales are typically used to evaluate behaviors, perceptions, or
phenomena of interest on a continuum (Leedy & Ormrod 2010).
The post-program survey also asked the parents to reflect on their expectations of
the program and describe how well or poorly those expectations had been met. The
42

researcher also intended to discover the parents’ opinions about the children’s behavior
change, as well as increase or decrease in the level of the children’s interest in art that
might have resulted from the CMA access program. Another question dealt with what the
parents liked most about the museum program, along with the inquiry about how the
program might have changed their attitudes toward visiting museums in general.
Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)
The parents’ perspective of the impact was also investigated by means of the
Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a 65-item quantitative instrument covering the
various dimensions of interpersonal behavior, communication, and repetitive behavior
often exhibited by children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The scale is designed for
completion by parents and teachers who can consistently observe a child’s social
interactions in naturalistic social contexts. The choice of this data gathering instrument
was made in consultation with several faculty in the Department of Psychology who have
expertise in Autism Spectrum Disorder research. Constantino & Gruber (2012) observe
that the SRS is an efficient tool to quantify subtle differences in degree of impairment.
Thus, the scale was chosen as a data-gathering technique to measure the behavior
changes of the participating children over time in response to an intervention.
This standardized scale provides a clear picture of a child’s impairments in five
areas of behavior, including Social Awareness, Social Cognition, Social Communication,
Motivation, and Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior. The SRS focuses on
specific and observable elements of social behavior. The scale only refers to the behavior
itself and avoids any judgment. For the purposes of this study, the School-Age Form
(ages 4 to 18) was selected as it best encompassed the age range of the study participants.
43

Each form came with a single Profile Sheet to facilitate scoring for all the rated
individuals. The SRS contains four scale points ranging from 1 (not true) to 4 (almost
always true) on the basis of the frequency of occurrence of the observed behaviors. It was
administered to the parents before the first and after the last museum visit. The parents
were instructed to rate their children’s behaviors based on observations of their
interactions with the museum instructor and the peers in the naturalistic setting of the
museum environment. Overall, the purpose of using the SRS was to define the baseline
level of the participants’ social interaction and communication behaviors, as well as to
assess the change in these behaviors after a series of museum visits.
Behavioral observation
Behavioral observation can be used to complement other forms of data collection
(Creswell, 2011). In addition, behavioral observations are recognized as an effective form

of assessment for interaction and communication skills (Spears, Tollefson, & Simpson,
2001). Observation was employed in this study to enhance anecdotal evidence obtained
from parent reporting and ratings of standardized scales. A behavioral observation sheet
(see Appendix H) was developed by the researcher in consultation with faculty members
from the University of South Carolina Psychology Department and Special Education
Department, as well as the Autism Academy board-certified behavior analyst. Since the
purpose of the observation was to assess a specific behavior, the following observable
indicators were included in the behavioral observation sheet: asking questions, answering
questions, and making requests for self.
These three behavior characteristics represent socialization and communication,
the two domains where autistic children often experience deficits (Oswald & Ollendick,
44

1989). In fact, research (Prizant, 1996) indicates that autistic children fail to develop
vocal speech or do so at a slower pace than their non-autistic peers. The observation
method is especially efficient for collecting information about individuals who have
difficulty verbalizing their ideas, such as children autism. In all, behavioral observations
allow the researcher to record first-hand information about the actual behaviors
systematically and with as much detail and objectivity as possible, instead of focusing on
just attitudes or perceptions (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010).
Behavioral observations were conducted during the gallery tour of each museum
visit. The gallery tour each week lasted about forty-five minutes. In order to increase the
accuracy of the observations, the study participants were divided into two groups of five.
The following social and communication behaviors were tallied: asking questions,
answering questions, and making requests for self. Three graduate students were
recruited to conduct the observations. One graduate student was from the USC
Psychology Department, while the other two were from the USC School of Library and
Information Science. All observers received formal training from the researcher and were
provided a copy of the observation sheet. Each graduate student was required to review
the observation sheet to become familiar with the behaviors to be tallied. When a
question was raised about how to record a particular behavior, the researcher and the
graduate students discussed it until all agreed on the consistency of the recording
procedure. Observations were scheduled during the gallery tours to capture the maximum
number of interaction opportunities. The gallery tour represented the most interactive
portion of the museum visits since participant engagement was facilitated by the museum
educator with the use of the Visual Thinking Strategies. The observers were instructed

45

not to interact with the study participants and not to interfere with the museum program.
Participant behaviors were recorded by two observers, while each observer focused on a
single group of five study participants. The third observer served as a back-up in case one
of the primary observers was unavailable for any of the six weeks.
Task evaluation
A task evaluation sheet was designed by the museum educators in collaboration
with the researcher to assess the study participants’ cognitive activity and their
comprehension of art-related topics introduced to them during each of the six museum
visits. This particular data collection technique was included in the study based on the
recommendations of several leading museum scholars. One of the suggestions was to
conduct a learning assessment for each participant by creating a set of questions related to
the concepts covered during each museum session. The learning assessment would
complement and enhance the social assessment achieved through the parent surveys,
behavioral observations, and the Social Responsiveness Scale.
Assessment via task evaluation was done by quantitatively measuring the
accuracy of completion of a theme-based task called “measurable”. The task evaluation
instrument was implemented each week before and after the gallery tour of each museum
visit. The CMA staff assisted with the implementation of the task evaluation portion of
the access program. At the beginning of each CMA visit, the staff received task
evaluation sheets tailored to the specific theme of the week. Each staff member was
responsible for recording the task completion accuracy for a single participant. At the
conclusion of the gallery tour, the same staff member measured the tasks performed by
the same participant.
46

Thus, the measurable for Week One theme, Still Life, consisted of assembling a
still life puzzle before and immediately following the gallery tour. The participants were
to complete the puzzle modeling the reproduction of a painting shown to them in the art
studio. During this activity, the museum staff measured the accuracy of the completed
task expressed in terms of the number of correctly and incorrectly placed puzzle pieces.
Week Two measurable, addressing the theme of Animal Art Texture Collage,
consisted of using pre-cut shapes to put together an animal of the participants’ choice.
The participants were instructed to use multiple shapes to represent the diverse body parts
of the chosen animal. The second part of the task evaluation activity involved
identification of an art object as either 2-D or 3-D. The participants performed the task
before and immediately following the gallery tour. Similar to Week One, the museum
staff measured the accuracy of the task expressed as the number of correctly and
incorrectly placed shapes representing five parts of an animal body (head, neck, body,
legs, and tale).
Reflecting the theme of Warm and Cool Colors, Week Three measurable involved
sorting out laminated color cards into two groups divided by either warm or cool colors.
The museum staff measured the accuracy of the task for each participant before and
immediately following the gallery tour that featured content related to the concept of
warm and cool colors. During the second part of the task evaluation, the CMA staff
showed each participant six pictures of Dale Chihuly’s seaforms. The participants were
asked to group the seaforms belonging either to the warm color or the cool color category.
The museum staff recorded the accuracy of this task as well.

47

To evaluate the comprehension of the concepts related to Landscapes, the theme
of Week Four, that week’s measurable had the participants point out the foreground, the
middle-ground, and the background in a landscape painting demonstrated to them by the
CMA staff. For each participant, the museum staff recorded the accuracy of the task
completed twice: before and immediately following the gallery tour. The second part of
the task evaluation activity involved identifying landscape paintings among several
different types of artwork. The museum staff measured the accuracy of the task
completion for each participant as well.
Week Five introduced the study participants to the concept of patterns in art.
Therefore, Week Five measurable entailed using laminated shapes to create a pattern
from as many pieces as possible. The CMA staff measured the accuracy of the task
completion for each participant before and after the gallery tour. For the second portion
of the task evaluation activity, the participants were asked to identify patterns among six
different works of art demonstrated to them. The museum staff measured the accuracy of
completion for each participant as well.
Week Six theme was Monotype Portraits. Since it was the final week of the
program, the assessment component targeted the participants’ comprehension of all the
concepts introduced to them during the six-week program period. The study participants
received Ziploc bags with fifteen images of different types of art they had previously
learned: Still Life, Landscapes, Animals, Patterns, and Portraits. The participants were
asked to sort out the images and place them into appropriate genres on five separate
sheets labeled by category: Still Life, Landscapes, Animals, Patterns, and Portraits. The

48

CMA staff measured the accuracy of the task completion for each participant before and
after the gallery tour.
Parent interview
The final data collection method used in this study was the semi-structured parent
interview. The researcher decided to use this method to enhance the quantitative results
collected through the parent surveys and ratings of the Social Responsiveness Scale. The
primary purpose of the semi-structured interviews was to clarify ambiguous answers and
seek follow-up information. The semi-structured interview format was chosen because it
allowed the researcher to follow a set of formal interview questions with individually
tailored questions to better understand parent reasoning. Mertler and Charles (2011) point
out that the semi-structured interview format is ideal for gathering truly qualitative data
where consistency is not a concern. Therefore, the researcher makes the decision whether
or not to use probing questions based on the need to stimulate the conversation and thus
further enrich the data collected through quantitative means (Mertler & Charles, 2011).
The rationale for using this qualitative technique in sequence with quantitative
methods was to explain and verify the general picture of the impact the museum
experience had on the study participants. This mixed methods design captured the best of
both the quantitative and the qualitative data and made the central argument of the study
more persuasive. The semi-structured interview also provided an additional opportunity
for the participating parents to describe detailed personal information relevant to their
child and his/her experience with the museum access program.

49

Ten parent interviews were audiotaped and later transcribed by a professional
transcriptionist. Eight interview questions (see Appendix I) were asked to assess the
parents’ perceptions of how the children’s learning and social behaviors had changed
over time as a result of participating in the CMA access program.
3.8 Pilot Study
In January 2015, a two-week pilot study was conducted at the Columbia Museum
of Art to investigate the feasibility of the proposed mixed methods research design that
combined quantitative and qualitative techniques. Therefore, the pilot study intended to
test the data collection instruments and refine the overall design. The pilot study involved
six autistic children aged 5 to 15. The subjects were recruited with the help of the Autism
Academy of South Carolina. The pilot study subjects visited the museum twice
accompanied by parents and in some cases by therapists. The first visit focused on the
Landscapes theme, while the theme for the second visit was Warm and Cool colors. To
test the clarity of the survey questions, the parents were asked to fill out the parent previsit survey form before the first pilot visit. At the beginning of the pilot study, the
parents were also instructed to fill out the Social Responsiveness Scale form to determine
the ease with which they could record their responses and the time it took them to
complete the form.
The pilot study also intended to test the behavioral observation sheet which in its
original version featured fifteen behavior indicators grouped into three broad categories:
Learning, Social Interaction, and Communication. During the two-week pilot program,
two graduate student observers tallied instances of the behavior of interest to the
researcher and recorded additional comments in the “Observer Comments” area of the
50

observation sheet. The pilot testing revealed problems with the current design of the
observation sheet and the need to reduce the number of observable behaviors and thus
increase the observation accuracy. Based on the outcomes of the pilot study, the
researcher redesigned the behavioral observation sheet to limit the number of observable
behaviors to three, namely Asking Questions, Answering Questions, and Making
Requests for Self. These behaviors were deemed relevant to the research question of the
study. They were selected because they best reflected the cognitive and communicative
activity of the autistic children participating in the museum access program.
After the second visit, the parents were asked to fill out the post-visit survey form
that included a combination of open-ended and closed questions. The researcher aimed to
test the logistics of the survey as well as the survey form itself. In addition, the parents
were asked to complete the post-visit Social Responsiveness Scale. Little change was
observed between the pre- and post-visit Scale scores due to the short duration and the
limited impact of the pilot on the study subjects.
Finally, task evaluation was the last data collection instrument to be tested in the
pilot study. The CMA staff measured the accuracy and completion time of topic-specific
tasks performed by the study participants before and after the gallery tour during each of
the two museum visits. Interference from the parents and/or therapists undermined the
validity of the data collected via task evaluation. Based on the pilot testing, appropriate
modifications were made to the data collection procedures and instruments in preparation
for the formal study. Besides the above-mentioned changes to the behavioral observation
sheet, an important modification was made to the task evaluation process. After a
conversation with the museum instructor, the researcher decided to conduct the task

51

evaluation procedure one-on-one with each study participant. Although this modification
required greater involvement of the CMA staff and graduate student assistants, it allowed
the researcher to streamline task evaluation and enhance the quality of the data collected
through this method in the formal study.
3.9 Summary
This chapter discussed the choice of the methodology for the current study. To
answer the main research question of the study: How does the museum experience
influence learning and behaviors of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder?,
the researcher employed the mixed methods design. Data were collected through a
combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including the parent pre-program
and post-program survey, the standardized Social Responsiveness Scale, the behavioral
observation of the study participants in the naturalistic museum setting, topic-specific
task evaluation called “the measurable,” and the follow-up semi-structured parent
interview. The wide variety of techniques allowed the researcher to collect data directly
from the study participants (through behavioral observations and task evaluations) and
indirectly from their parents (through the surveys, parent ratings of the Social
Responsiveness Scale, and responses to the follow-up interview questions).
Using the mixed methods approach, the researcher was able to collect rich data to
both quantify and at the same time better understand the impact of non-traditional
learning environments, such as museums, on learning and socialization of autistic
children. Due to the presence of the interpretive aspect, the validity criteria used in
empirical research alone were not sufficient for the current research. Therefore, data
triangulation was an important consideration when choosing a methodological approach
52

to this study because of the complex nature of its central phenomenon. Glesne (2015)
points out the fact that by increasing the number of data-gathering methods, the
investigator can arrive at more multidimensional findings. Throughout the current study,
the researcher aimed not only to find quantifiable evidence of the effect the museum
environment had on knowledge acquisition and communication of children with Autism
Spectrum Disorder but also to investigate parent perspectives on the museum setting as
an alternative learning environment for children with special needs. By collecting and
analyzing data gathered from multiple sources, the researcher was able to view the
phenomenon of the study from more than one angle and thus increase the study
trustworthiness by eliminating or reducing the number of potential discrepancies in the
interpretation of the findings.

CHAPTER 4
DATA ANALYSIS RESULTS
4.1 Introduction
This chapter presents the data collection procedures, data analysis strategies, and
the findings of the data analysis activities. The results of the data analysis are provided in
light of the research questions of the study that investigated the impact of the museum
experience on learning and social behaviors of autistic children. The museum experience
was understood in this study as a series of visits to the Columbia Museum of Art, with
each visit consisting of a topic-specific gallery tour followed by an art-making activity.
For the purposes of this study, learning was understood as knowledge about art concepts
acquired in a free-choice, inquiry-based unconventional setting, which is the museum.
Further, social behaviors were understood as instances of communication and interaction
autistic children engaged in involving both their peers and museum educators.
This chapter is composed of four sections: data collection procedures, data
analysis procedures, quantitative results, and qualitative results. The first section
describes the data gathering process, including pre-program and post-program survey
logistics, pre-program and post-program administration of the Social Responsiveness
Scale, on-site behavioral observation protocol, on-site task evaluation, and the semistructured parent interview. The second section focuses on how the collected data were
analyzed, including open-ended and closed survey questions, calculating the quantitative

54

score on the five categories of the Social Responsiveness Scale, calculating the tally of
the behaviors included in the behavioral observation sheet, measuring the accuracy of onsite tasks completed by the study participants, and establishing common themes that
emerged during the ten semi-structured parent interviews. The third and fourth sections
present the results of the data analysis, reporting both the quantitative and the qualitative
findings as part of the mixed methods merged analysis.
4.2 Data Collection Procedures
The purpose of gathering data in this mixed methods study was to address its
research problem and to develop an answer to its main research question and four subquestions. The mixed methods design enabled the researcher to use persuasive qualitative
data gathering procedures and rigorous quantitative procedures at the same time. The
researcher purposefully selected the Columbia Museum of Art (CMA) as the research site
for this study. The choice of the research site was made after a careful consideration of
the study target population as well as the feasibility of implementing the project within
the timeframe established by the researcher. As the leading cultural institution in the
region, CMA is committed to the principles of diversity and inclusion in its programs and
activities. The museum is well-known for its experienced and well-trained Education
Department staff, as well as for its diverse programming for underserved and special
needs populations. Finally, given the social and communication impairments typical for
autism, the art museum was an appropriate environment for a study involving autistic
children because of the power art has to foster emotional engagement and healthy selfexpression without the need to verbalize one’s feelings (Baldino, 2012).

55

The researcher used multiple recruitment avenues, including two autism advocacy
organizations and three local school districts, to identify potential study participants—
families with high-functioning autistic children interested in art. Families who expressed
interest in participating in the study were asked to fill in a screening form. As a result, the
researcher selected ten families who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study.
Prior to the beginning of the formal study in the spring 2015, the researcher met with
each family in person to provide the participants with a detailed description of the project,
distribute written Parent Consent Forms and then collect the signed forms, discuss the
museum access program schedule to make sure it worked for both the parents and the
children, and secure each family’s commitment for the entire duration of the six-week
program that was designed to take place in April-May 2015.
Although all the families committed to participate, the researcher respected their
right to withdraw from the study at any point and clearly articulated this right in the
Parent Consent Form. The Consent Form and the Parent Permission Form created under
the principle of respect, the principle of beneficence, and the principle of justice were
acknowledged by the University of South Carolina Intuitional Review Board (IRB). The
study received the official IRB approval by the University of South Carolina Office of the
Vice President for Research.
At the start of the formal study, the researcher fully understood the underlying
complexity of interweaving the quantitative and the qualitative data under the umbrella of
a single research study. Therefore, the researcher exercised careful planning to collect
quantitative data drawn from the parent responses to the closed questions in the preprogram and post-program surveys, behavioral observations, standardized assessment in

56

the form of the Social Responsiveness Scale, and on-site task evaluations. Qualitative
data came from the parent responses to the open-ended questions in the pre-program and
post-program surveys and from the semi-structured interviews conducted individually
with the parents.
All the interviewees were contacted in advance of the actual interviews. The
interviews allowed the researcher to explore the parents’ perspectives on the impact of
the museum program. Based on the answers from the post-program survey, the researcher
prepared a set of pre-established questions. These questions served as a guide for the
interviews. The researcher remained open to re-forming and adding to those questions, as
well as incorporating impromptu probes as needed throughout the interview sessions.
All the data gathering procedures were administered in a standard way throughout
the six-week CMA access program. The researcher assumed a supportive role during
each visit, instructing the graduate student observers, taking care of the logistics issues,
and assisting the CMA staff when needed without interrupting the flow of activities.
4.3. Data Analysis Procedures
Data analysis and interpretation in this mixed methods research consisted of
analyzing separately the quantitative data and the qualitative data. The researcher made
the decision about how to organize, represent, and interpret the data and results.
Regarding the quantitative data collected from the closed questions in the parent
surveys, the standardized scale, task evaluations, and behavioral observations, the
researcher assigned numeric values to each response and tally on the observation sheets,
recorded them in the Statistical Program for the Social Sciences (SPSS), generated

57

descriptive statistics including the mean and standard deviation, and calculated t-scores
for statistically significant difference between the pre-program and post-program scores
on the Social Responsiveness Scale. The next step was to move from descriptive analysis
to more in-depth inferential analysis. Finally, appropriate visual forms, such as tables, bar
charts, and line graphs, were selected to represent the quantitative findings accompanied
by the researcher’s interpretation of the meaning of the results.
Regarding the qualitative data collected from the open-ended survey questions
and ten parent interviews, the researcher decided to employ thematic analysis to identify
themes and patterns in the data. The survey responses were organized for initial review,
and the interview audio files were transcribed for further analysis. The researcher
proceeded to examine the transcripts to determine the common trends and themes from
the perspective of the participating parents. Next, memos were made to develop
preliminary understanding of the information. Meaningful data chunks were identified,
retrieved, and isolated for analysis. This process was important for forming codes or
categories of information that emerged during the analysis. To develop the codes, the
researcher divided the transcripts into smaller units based on different questions, assigned
a label to each unit, and constructed a draft code for classifying the answers. Using the
hand-coding technique, the researcher recorded code words and themes on the margins of
the printed transcript pages. Organizing the responses by themes made it possible for the
researcher to see the relationship among them. The researcher continued to group the
emerging themes to reflect larger perspectives and achieve a deeper understanding of the
phenomenon under the investigation. To present the qualitative results, the researcher

58

built connections among the themes, addressed the evidence for the themes, and
explained how the findings answered the research questions of the study.
In order to secure the quality of the data and ensure the trustworthiness of the
interpretations, several validity procedures were utilized. The data triangulation approach
helped to ascertain that the researcher’s interpretation of the findings accurately reflected
the impact of the museum experience on the cognitive activity and social behavior of the
study participants. Examining evidence from several strands of data enabled the
researcher to build a more coherent justification for the themes that became apparent
based on the convergence of the sources.
Another validity strategy used in the study was the use of a rich thick description
to convey as many details as possible. In order to better depict the context for the
interpretation, the researcher made a special effort to provide an extensive description of
the setting, the components of the museum access program, and the data gathering
methods. Emphasizing the details throughout the description made the results more
realistic and credible, thus enhancing the validity of the findings.
4.4 Quantitative Survey Results
This section presents the analysis of the quantitative data collected from the
closed questions of the parent pre-program and post-program surveys.
Pre-program Survey Item 6 asked about museum visitation within the twelvemonth period prior to the start of the CMA access program. Given the participants’
interest in art, it did not come as a surprise that all of the families had visited a museum at
least once during that period of time. Parent responses are summarized in Figure 4.1.

59

Most families had been to a museum one-to-three times, as this response was chosen by
six parents. Three parents indicated that their children had been to a museum four-to-six
times within the previous year, and one family emerged as the most frequent museumgoers with ten or more museum outings in the twelve months preceding the study.

Figure 4.1 Number of Museum Visits within Previous Year
Pre-program Survey Item 7 asked about family motivations for visiting museums.
Based on the literature review and numerous conversations with the CMA educators, the
researcher created a list of characteristics typically associated with the museum
experience that ranged from being pleasantly occupied, expanding the child’s horizons
and challenging his or her abilities to having a change from daily routine. The parents
were asked to rate their responses to the question “What are your and your child’s
motivations for visiting museums?” on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not
important) to 5 (very important). Table 4.1 summarizes the parents’ responses to the
motivation question. The numbers in Table 4.1 indicate how many parents selected each

60

response. The column containing the “Not Important” option is not presented in Table 4.1
because no respondents chose this option.

The parents’ responses to the motivation question revealed that there may be a
variety of personal, social, and educational needs families seek to satisfy by visiting
museums. The most significant motivations mentioned by the parents were to discover
new things and expand the child’s horizons. Nine respondents rated these two reasons as
very important while one respondent rated them as important. The next group of reasons
rated by the majority of the respondents as very important was to use imagination and
connect with the child’s interests, which indicated a perception of the museum visit as a
family-bonding experience. Eight out of ten survey respondents noted that those two
reasons were very important to them. Additionally, the respondents thought that such

61

motivations as feeling happy and satisfied and challenging the child’s abilities were
important as well, the fact reflected in six parents’ responses.
The parents’ responses demonstrated that the two least important motivations for
visiting were to socialize and build friendships as well as to get a feeling of achievement
as a result of the museum experience (see Table 4.1). The choice of these two factors as
the least important motivations can be explained by the spontaneity of a museum visit as
an experience and the fact that it typically takes a considerable amount of time to build
friendships. Moreover, while a museum visit normally provides plenty of interaction with
the content of the collections, opportunities to engage in hands-on activities and thus
develop a feeling of achievement may be limited due to the time a family gets to spend at
the museum at any given point, the logistics of the visit itself, or other external factors
beyond the visitor’s control.
Post-program Survey Items 1 and 3 asked about the parent perceptions of the
museum experience and their overall satisfaction with the museum access program,
respectively. Parent responses to Item 1 revealed that 50% of the respondents rated the
museum experience as “very positive” while the other 50% rated it as “positive” for their
children. As evidenced by Figure 4.2, none of the parents used the response options on
the other end of the range, including the “slightly positive” and “negative” answers. The
results of Survey Item 3 summarized in Figure 4.3 demonstrate that the majority of the
parents were very satisfied with the CMA access program, since 70% of the parents
chose “very satisfied” as their response and 30% marked “satisfied.” None of the
respondents rated their level of satisfaction in lesser terms, such as “somewhat satisfied”
or “not satisfied.” These ratings are indicative of the success of the access program in the

62

parents’ eyes and the perceived positive impact of the museum experience on the
participating children both as a social and educational activity.

63

Post-program Survey Item 4 asked about the parents’ views on the changes in
their child’s behavior that they believed could have been related to the participation in the
CMA access program. Responses to Survey Item 4 proved to be critical for investigating
the influence of the museum as an alternative learning environment on cognitive and
social development of autistic children. Since the parents were present during the six
museum visits and observed their children’s socialization and learning in the museum,
parental feedback was important in the context of the study.
The data in Figure 4.4 show that six out of ten parents fully agreed that their
children’s behavior had changed because of the participation in the museum program,
while only two parents disagreed. Two survey respondents were not sure whether their
children’s behavior changed and noted that a longer intervention would be needed for the
children’s behavior to change.

Figure 4.4 Program Influence on Child Behavior

64

Post-program Survey Item 7 asked the parents whether or not the museum
experience influenced the way their child interacted with art. The majority of the
respondents recognized such impact. Specifically, 90% of the parents mentioned that the
museum program had affected their child’s interaction with art, and only one parent was
not sure (see Figure 4.5).

Figure 4.5 Program Influence on Child Interaction with Art
Post-program Survey Item 8 asked the parents whether or not the museum
experience influenced the way their child interacted with others. In their responses, seven
parents acknowledged the influence, two parents stated that there was no influence on
their child’s interaction with others, and one respondent picked “not sure” as the answer
noting that their child’s interaction with others depended on the environment, the topic,
and the level of interest in the subject of the communication (see Figure 4.6).

65

Figure 4.6 Program Influence on Child Interaction with Others
Post-program Survey Item 5 asked about particular social behaviors of the
participating children during the six museum visits. Data were collected through a
measure that involved the parents’ rating of the behavior on a 5-point Likert scale ranging
from 1 (never exhibited) to 5 (always exhibited). Table 4.2 presents data summarizing the
parents’ perspective of the frequency of social behaviors of their children during the
program. Among the most frequently exhibited behaviors, the parents identified
participation in group activities, following directions, and making requests for self.
According to the results from Table 4.2, nine parents marked “often exhibited” and
“always exhibited” for the participation in group activities, while eight parents marked
“often exhibited” and “always exhibited” for the instances of following directions and
making requests for self. Also noteworthy was the fact that seven out of ten parents
marked sharing objects and toys as a behavior they frequently saw their child exhibit.
This can be interpreted as a positive sign of the museum program impact on the social
awareness of the participating children.

66

The less frequently exhibited behavior categories, from the parents’ perspective,
included taking turns in conversation and paying attention to the museum instructor. Fifty
percent of the parents rated taking turns in conversation as an “occasionally exhibited”
category while 40% rated paying attention to museum instructor as “occasionally
exhibited” and another 40% rated it as “often exhibited.”

Post-program Survey Item 6 asked about the benefits derived by the children from
participating in the museum access program. Data were collected through a 5-point Likert
scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Table 4.3 illustrates how
many parents selected each response on the Likert scale. The most notable program
benefits identified by the surveyed parents were providing joy and motivating to learn
new skills, followed by providing a sense of accomplishment. Regarding the benefit of
providing a sense of accomplishment, the parents rated this option higher than the similar
response option to the motivation question on the pre-program survey. In other words,
before the program the parents did not consider getting a feeling of achievement as one of

67

the top motivations for visiting museums, whereas after the program they acknowledged
that it was on of the major benefits.
On the other hand, more than half of the surveyed parents did not see reducing
self-stimulatory behaviors as one of the benefits of their child’s participation in the
museum access program. In addition, four parents did not agree that the museum program
played a role in improving their child’s gross and fine motor skills.

4.5 Social Responsiveness Scale Results
The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) was used as a standardized instrument to
objectively measure the baseline level of the study participants’ behaviors associated with
autism at the beginning of the museum access program. To identify any changes in those
behaviors, the scale was administered again at the completion of the program. The parent
report version of the SRS was used. The instructions on the completion procedures and
the time to fill out the form were given to the parents before they rated the scale.

68

The analysis of the parent ratings of the SRS entailed the use of the Scoring
Worksheet to calculate the SRS raw scores. The design of the Scoring Worksheet enabled
the researcher to easily obtain raw scores on five categories, including Social Awareness
(Awr), Social Cognition (Cog), Social Communication (Com), Motivation (Mot), and
Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior (RRB). Then, the researcher used the raw
scores for the five categories to calculate the total raw score for each rated child. Based
on the SRS-2 Manual (Constantino & Gruber, 2012), the scores from four categories,
such as Social Awareness, Social Cognition, Social Communication, and Motivation, are
bound together as the score for the Social Communication and Interaction (SCI) domain.
The next step entailed transferring the raw scores for each child from the Scoring
Worksheet onto the Profile Sheet which provides t-score results. Finally, the researcher
determined t-scores by finding the corresponding t-score for each raw score in the “SRS2 Total Score Results” section of the Profile Sheet. The researcher followed the same
procedure to determine the t-scores for both the pre-program and the post-program Social
Responsiveness Scale.
Examination of the difference between the pre-program and post-program scores
allowed the researcher to identify the impact of the museum access program on the
autistic children’s behaviors in the SCI and RRB domains. To determine the statistical
significance of the museum program impact, the researcher performed a paired samples ttest using the SPSS software. Data obtained from the t-test are presented below.
First, the researcher ran a paired samples test for the pre-program and postprogram SRS scores for the four categories bound under the Social Communication and
Interaction (SCI) domain, specifically covering Social Awareness, Social Cognition,

69

Social Communication, and Motivation. The mean pre-program SCI score for the group
of ten participating children was 73.2, while the mean post-program SCI score for the
same participants was 63.4, which indicates a 9.8-point reduction (95% CI: 3.85 to 15.75)
of the average SCI score for the study participants (see Table 4.4 and Table 4.5).
It should be noted that since the purpose of the SRS is to identify the presence and
severity of social impairments within the autism spectrum, a reduction in the mean postprogram scores can be interpreted as a sign of the positive impact of the cultural
intervention. Further, the paired samples t-test for SCI yielded a p-value of .005 (p-value
< .05), which implies a statistically significant difference between the pre-program and
the post-program SRS scores in the Social Communication and Interaction (SCI) domain
(see Table 4.5).

Then, the researcher performed a paired samples t-test for the pre-program and
post-program SRS scores for the Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior (RRB)

70

domain. The RRB domain includes stereotypical behaviors or highly restricted interests
characteristic of autism, as defined by the SRS-2 Manual (Constantino & Gruber, 2012).
Analysis of the descriptive statistics revealed a mean pre-program RRB score of 71.9 for
the group of ten children, while the mean post-program RRB score for the same
participants was 63.7 (see Table 4.6), which indicates a 8.2-point reduction (95% CI: 1.68
to 14.72) of the average RRB score for the study participants (see Table 4.7). The paired
samples t-test for RRB yielded a p-value of .019. Although this p-value is higher that the
p-value obtained from the paired samples t-test for Social Communication and Interaction
(SCI) domain, it is still below the .05 threshold and thus indicates that the difference
between the pre-program and the post-program RRB scores was statistically significant
for the group of ten autistic children participating in the study.

To further determine the statistical significance of the difference between the preprogram and post-program scores, the researcher also examined the individual scores on

71

each of the four categories in the SCI domain. Regarding the Social Awareness (Awr)
category, SPSS statistical analysis demonstrated a 4.1-point reduction (67.1 vs. 63.0) in
the mean group score at the completion of the six-week museum access program (see
Table 4.8). This reduction proved not to be statistically significant because the p-value
yielded by the paired samples t-test for Social Awareness category was above the .05
threshold (p = .153 > .05, see Table 4.9).
This outcome was not surprising to the researcher. Social Awareness, understood
as the ability to pick on social cues, represents one of the more difficult skills to develop
for autistic children who may have trouble reading and following social cues and
therefore naturally tend to shy away from social situations. As mentioned previously, the
sensory aspects of reciprocal social behavior might be improved with the help of targeted,
intense interventions and behavior therapies over an extended period of time.
By contrast, analysis of the mean pre-program and post-program scores for the
Social Cognition (Cog) category revealed the difference of 8.4 points (72.0 vs. 63.6, see
Table 4.8). This was a statistically significant difference proven through the paired
samples t-test. The p-value of .003 is significantly lower than the .05 threshold used by
the researcher in this study (see Table 4.9). The Social Cognition category represents the
cognitive-interpretative aspects of reciprocal social behavior. The statistically significant
difference between the pre-program and post-program mean group scores for the Social
Cognition category indicate that the museum access program did have an impact on the
study participants’ cognitive processes in social interactions.

72

Regarding the Social Communication (Com) category, analysis of the mean
difference between the pre-program and the post-program group scores revealed a
reduction of 10.6 points, from 71.6 to 61.0 points (see Table 4.8). The paired samples ttest confirmed the statistical significance of this change expressed through p = .007 < .05
(see Table 4.9). This quantitative evidence of the museum program impact on the
communication of the study participants played a key part in answering the research
question of the study.
In addition, analysis of the mean difference between the pre-program and the
post-program group scores on the Social Motivation (Mot) category showed that the
mean group score decreased from 71.0 to 61.7 points which indicates a 9.3-point
reduction (see Table 4.8). p = .013 < .05 is an indication of the statistical significance of
the change the parents perceived in their children’s social motivation, understood as
willingness to engage in social interactions, at the completion of the museum access
program (see Table 4.9).

In terms of the overall impact of the museum access program on the behaviors of
the study participants across all five categories featured in the Social Responsiveness
Scale, a 9.5-point reduction (95% CI: 3.9 to 15.1) in the mean group score was observed
decreasing from the 73.7-point mean score on the pre-program SRS to the 64.2-point
mean score on the post-program SRS (see Table 4.10 and Table 4.11).
The paired samples t-test yielded the two-tale significance of .004. Since the
overall p-value = .004 < .05 (see Table 4.11), the researcher was able to conclude that the
six-week museum access program did have a statistically significant impact on the study
participants’ behaviors rated by the Social Responsiveness Scale.

Given the relatively small (n=10) sample of the study, in addition to the paired
samples t-test, the researcher also chose to perform the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test to
verify the statistical significance of the data yielded by the pre-program and post-program
parent ratings of the Social Responsiveness Scale. The Wilcoxon test is a non-parametric
statistical test that can be used as an alternative to the paired samples t-test when the
sample size is not large enough to assume the normal distribution of the population
(Sheskin, 2011). The results of the Wilcoxon test (p = .012 < .05) confirmed the findings
of the paired samples t-test and pointed to a statistically significant impact of the museum
access program on the autistic children who participated in the study.
4.6 Behavioral Observation Results
To further enhance understanding of the influence the museum experience had on
learning and social behavior of the autistic children participating in the CMA access
program, the researcher used direct observation as another data collection method.
Observations focusing on such indicators of behavior as answering questions, making
requests for self, and asking questions, were conducted during the gallery tour instruction
session of each of the six museum visits. Data from the participants’ behavioral
observation sheets are presented and analyzed below.

75

As stated above, throughout the museum access program, the autistic children
were encouraged to engage in various types of interactions with the museum instructor
and fellow program participants. Each week, behaviors were tallied on the observation
sheet in the areas of answering questions, making requests for self, and asking questions.
Figure 4.7 demonstrates how the number of interactions in each area changed from Week
One to Week Six. The numbers in the “answering questions” area were lower in the first
two weeks and steadily increased in Weeks Four, Five, and Six. The highest number in
this area was observed in Week Three when the children answered 150 questions due to
the popularity of the theme, Warm/Cool Colors, which was well-received by the
participating children.

Figure 4.7 Behavior Observation Data by Category
The numbers related to the area of “requests for self” reflect a similar trend, an
increase in the number of communications from Week One to Week Six. Since the theme
of Week Four was Landscapes, another popular topic with the children, the highest

76

number of interactions in this area was observed. The category “asking questions” turned
out to have the lowest number of interactions, with the number decreasing from Week
One to Week Six (see Figure 4.7). This result was to be expected because social
initiations make one of the core and more difficult-to-address behavioral deficits for
children with ASD (Koegel, R., Bradshaw, Ashbaugh, & Koegel, L., 2014).
Figure 4.8 provides a more detailed representation of the data by week in the two
areas where increases were observed: answering questions and requests for self.

Figure 4.8 Totals of Answering Questions and Requests for Self by Week
Further, Figure 4.9 reflects the total number of interactions, from Week One
through Week Six, observed from all the participating children as a group and across all
three areas. Data from the observations were combined for all ten participants, resulting
in a total number of asking questions, answering questions, and requests for self. Overall

77

group communication consistently increased and through the second half of the program
stayed above the numbers of Week One and Week Two (see Figure 4.9).

Figure 4.9 Totals of Group Communication, All Categories by Week
Lastly, the data in Figure 4.10 reflect percentage changes in behavior tallies in
Week Six compared to Week One. As the data demonstrate, the CMA access program led
to a 41% increase in the “answering questions” area and a 362% increase in the “making
requests for self” area. On the whole, there was a 58% increase in the total instances of
group communication covering all three areas in Week Six compared to Week One.
In general, the data collected through behavioral observations indicate a positive
role that the museum as a learning and social environment played in helping the autistic
children engage in the learning behavior and develop their sense of self, along with the
confidence to voice their individual concerns and needs. This evidence obtained from
behavioral observations was corroborated by other forms of data as well, including parent
surveys, interviews, and ratings of the Social Responsiveness Scale.
78

Figure 4.10 Percentage Change in Communication Behavior, Week 1 vs Week 6
4.7 Task Evaluation Results
Quantitative data about the participants’ learning in the museum program were
collected through the task evaluation method. Each week, the researcher aimed to
examine art-related knowledge acquisition of the autistic children by measuring the
baseline level of their familiarity with a certain art concept before the gallery instruction
and then measuring their knowledge of the same concept immediately after the gallery
instruction. To achieve this goal, the study subjects were instructed to complete a topicspecific task, also called measurable. Since each week in the program focused on a
different art theme, a new evaluation task was implemented each week.
Using the data from the task evaluation sheets, the researcher calculated the
number of correct responses by each student before the gallery instruction and compared
those data with the number of correct responses the children gave after the gallery

79

instruction was completed. The researcher intended to address the changes in the total
number of correct responses provided by the ten children as a group from the pre-gallery
tour tasks to the post-gallery tour tasks. So, the sum of the correct responses was
calculated for each task the children completed before and after the gallery tour of each
museum visit (see Table 4.12).

As the data in Table 4.12 indicate, instruction during the six 45-minute guided
gallery tours had a positive effect on learning of the ten children who participated in the
CMA access program. After the gallery tour instruction, the children consistently
demonstrated a higher level of knowledge of each of the six art concepts they were
introduced to by the museum educator. The greatest percentage increase in the number of
correct responses before and after the gallery tour happened in Week One when the
children learned about Still Life. Following the gallery tour, as a group the children
provided 26.5% more correct responses to the task presented to them by the CMA staff.
Week Two saw a moderate 9.1% increase in the number of the correct responses the
children provided to the task related to Animals and Shapes. This result can be explained
by the fact that the children were quite familiar with the topic and made relatively few
mistakes in the original task. A similar trend was observed in Week Three when the

80

children demonstrated a slight 8% increase in the number of the correct responses to the
post-gallery task compared to the pre-gallery task.
Finally, analysis of the task evaluation data from Weeks Four, Five, and Six
demonstrated that the participating children continued to provide higher numbers of the
correct responses after the gallery tour instruction than they did before. The percentage
increases in the correct responses to post-gallery tasks in Weeks Four, Five, and Six were
16.1%, 16%, and 12.5% respectively (see Table 4.12).
4.8 Qualitative Survey Results
This section presents the analysis of the qualitative data collected from one openended question in the pre-program parent survey and ten open-ended questions in the
post-program parent survey. The qualitative data were analyzed thematically through
developing codes and labels and then establishing common themes. Seven topics were
captured and are presented in the order of: participant interests, parent expectations,
parent satisfaction with the program, program influence on participant behavior, program
influence on participant interaction with art and others, overall program impact on
participants, and feedback on the CMA program sustainability.
Participant interests
Pre-program Survey Item 4 asked about the children’s major interests. The
purpose of this question was to familiarize the researcher with the range of the program
participants’ art-related and everyday interests in order to make sure that the nature and
the content of the access program best fit their educational and social needs. Figure 4.11
summarizes the parents’ responses to this question. While the parents predictably

81

provided a wide range of activities their children engaged in, the top interest mentioned
by six parents was playing video games. It was closely followed by such interests as
science, Lego, and—importantly for an art program—drawing. Four parents indicated
that these three activities were among their children’s favorites. Among the other
categories of interests mentioned by the parents were animals (three responses), movies
(two responses), and comic strips (one response). Many of the participants’ interests,
including drawing, animals, and shapes, were integrated into the access program content.

Figure 4.11 Participant Interests
The researcher shared this information with the CMA staff, and members of the
Education Department provided additional opportunities for the study participants to
engage in activities of interest to them during the recess period between the gallery tour
and the hands-on part of each of the six museum visits. In particular, to reinforce the
concepts learned throughout the museum access program, the CMA Education Gallery
that served as a Break Room was decorated with additional animal artwork and several

82

Lego toys were made available for the participants to design various shapes and
structures using the Lego bricks.
Parent expectations
Pre-program parent Survey Item 2 asked about the parents’ expectations from the
museum program. The data were collected before the start of the museum access program.
All the parents’ responses were carefully reviewed and the most frequently used words
were identified. They were: fun, communication, and art. Then, the five most common
expectations emerged, including having fun, learning about art, developing
communication skills, expanding the child’s horizons, and benefiting the autism
community. Other expectations that were also mentioned in the answers included
developing creativity, following directions, learning how to behave in a public setting,
and improving fine motor skills.
Post-program Survey Item 2 asked whether the above-listed expectations had
been met. All the respondents agreed that their pre-program expectations had been met.
Nine out of ten respondents were able to provide rich qualitative data on why they
thought the museum access program was successful in meeting their original expectations.
One respondent’s answers turned out to be excessively concise and somewhat ambiguous
so that they needed to be clarified in the follow-up semi-structured interview.
Improving communication skills emerged as one of the major expectations of the
CMA program. All seven parents who had listed communication development in their
pre-program surveys acknowledged that their expectation had been fully met. One parent
mentioned that the child was “interacting and socializing, which was extremely

83

rewarding for me.” Another parent expressed a great deal of satisfaction with how her
child progressed through the museum program from separating himself from other
children at first to initiating a conversation with peers and even other parents beginning
with the second museum visit. The child willingly shared his artwork and even talked to
another parent about science and math. He also engaged in an argument with another
participant about the meaning of a habitat.
When the child could not hear the question posed to him by the museum
instructor, he calmly asked the instructor to repeat the question. This behavior, observed
during the third museum visit, “was a huge step for [him] because he usually
gets…agitated when he is unable to hear a question.” During the final two weeks of the
museum program, the same child continued to demonstrate positive communication
behaviors. While touring the galleries, he waited for his turn to answer questions and did
not attempt to talk over an adult during the museum instruction.
Feeling more comfortable with peers was another expectation noted by the
parents. One survey respondent commented that with a longer program in place, the
participants would have formed deeper relationships with one another. In general, those
program participants who did not interact in the beginning appeared to be quite social at
the end. One of the participants, a teenage boy graduating from middle school, took three
visits to feel comfortable in a group of younger children. His parent was pleased to
acknowledge that the museum experience had triggered the boy “to speak freely about
what he saw and learned” in front of a fairly large group of people. On several occasions,
the subject-matter of the participants’ interaction extended beyond art itself and included

84

a wider range of topics, such as video games, an interest shared by a couple of boys and
the only female participant in the program.
Another major program expectation commonly expressed by the parents was
related to learning about art. Seven out of ten parents mentioned in their responses that
learning about art and developing a greater appreciation of art was one of the outcomes
they expected their children to achieve in the course of the museum access program. The
parents provided examples of learning, such as discussing and answering “questions
about the art correctly more frequently than not,” demonstrating the ability to determine
the colors correctly, and developing an understanding that art “comes in a variety of
forms, whether it comes from a pen, brush, clay, [or] marble.” One parent commented
that her son had “learned many lessons that he had not been exposed to before,” while yet
another stressed her child’s growing ability to retain “a lot of the concepts taught in one
hour, which is unusual for him.”
Finally, several parents mentioned that reinforcing the children’s appreciation of
art was their expectation from the program. Explaining how this expectation had been
met, the parents talked about the diversity of the CMA program content and collections.
In the words of one respondent, “[the child] was amazed at… how many pieces of art
they had in one place” and “he loved that each week he got to create a different type of
art.” Overall, the parents agreed that the museum program gave the children a wider
perspective on the subject of art and helped them become better learners “because [they]
knew the teacher wanted to see if [they were] paying attention and observing the artwork.”

85

Apart from the learning expectations, a number of parents expressed hopes that
the program would provide a fun experience for their children. This expectation was met
as well, as the post-program survey results demonstrate. The program brought joy and
happiness to the participants, evidenced by the parents’ responses like “on several
occasions [my son] wished the program was daily” and “he was sad that the Art and
Autism project had ended.” Two survey respondents linked the museum experience with
developing a greater bond with their child, suggesting that they “had a lot of fun spending
the time together and [the child] knows this was “his” time. He was proud of his projects
and we enjoyed doing them together.” Another parent echoed this sentiment by saying
that her expectation of a good experience was fully met because “[my child] and I got to
do the projects together.”
The next category of parent expectations involved developing and improving the
program participants’ social behaviors. The post-program surveys provided ample
evidence that this expectation was met, too. As one parent noted, throughout the program
her son, who had previously had difficulty maintaining focus and composure in
conversational situations, started to become “more flexible with his conversation,
allowing peers to give their input during the gallery tours… He was patient with staff and
peers even though on several occasions he was antsy to leave the gallery.”
As the program progressed, social behavior improvement was further confirmed
by the other parents as well, particularly regarding the aspect of following directions
during the art-making activity. According to a parent account, during the first two weeks
of the program the child refused to follow the guidelines or use any of the materials
provided to the program participants by the CMA educators. During Week Two, the child

86

insisted on using a different set of supplies and materials than that provided to the rest of
the group, and he took extended time to decide what he would like to draw.
By the middle of the program, the child’s attitude started to change as he became
willing to use the art materials and ask for assistance from the museum educators. This
was the first time in the program that the child successfully completed the art-making
activity in the classroom. The child was proud of his accomplishment and showed his
drawing, a volcanic landscape, to everyone around. Toward the end of the project, the
child readily worked on the assigned art projects without objecting to any of the
guidelines provided by the museum educators and completed his projects on patterns and
portraits within the expected time at the museum. According to the parent, it marked a
noticeable increase in such behaviors as cooperation and following directions for the
child who had previously refused to draw anything other than living beings.
Finally, improving fine motor skills was an expectation mentioned by one
particular parent. In the post-program survey, the parent confirmed that the museum
program had provided numerous opportunities to improve these skills through hands-on
activities such as cutting, pasting, painting, drawing, and coloring.
Parent satisfaction with the program
Post-program parent Survey Item 3 asked for a qualitative explanation of the
parent responses to the question about their level of satisfaction with the museum
program. All of the parents marked either “satisfied” or “very satisfied” as their response.
Two parents did not provide an explanation, although they did rate their level of
satisfaction. Analysis of the other parents’ explanations revealed that there were several

87

reasons for the overall parent satisfaction. First, five survey respondents mentioned that
they were extremely satisfied because the museum program was fun. Second, three
respondents said that the program was well-organized and its structure helped reinforce
the knowledge of the art concepts learned through a combination of gallery tours and the
subsequent art-making activities, thereby increasing the children’s confidence in creating
their own artwork.
Third, one respondent expressed his satisfaction with the access program because
of its focus on children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, an often forgotten segment of
the community. The parent wished the program could be expanded, both geographically
and audience-wise, as he wrote that there needs to be greater awareness of autistic
children and their talents. Fourth, another parent was satisfied because her child was able
to make improvements in several aspects of social and learning behavior with which the
child had struggled before.
Fifth, yet another parent stated that she was pleased with how much the museum
program had helped to diversify her daughter’s interests. Prior to the program, the only
activity the girl was interested in was playing video games while avoiding any interaction
with peers. Thus, the parent was happy to see that her daughter had “gained valuable
social skills by talking and playing with the boys in the group.”
Lastly, although not directly related to the purpose of the study, it should be noted
that four survey respondents mentioned the quality of the museum instruction throughout
the six-week program. The parents’ comments ranged from “the instructor was fabulous”

88

to “the instructor went above and beyond the parents’ expectations of teaching” and “the
instructor kept the children engaged and having fun.”
Program influence on participant behavior
Post-program Survey Item 4 asked for a qualitative explanation of the perceived
changes in the children’s behaviors that the parents’ believed could have been due to the
CMA access program. It was one of the central questions of the post-program parent
survey as it was directly related to the main research question of the study. Sixty percent
of the parents acknowledged changes in their children’s behaviors, whereas 20% said
there were no changes and 20% were not sure. Three parents cited an increase in their
child’s level of interest in art (or curiosity about art-related subjects) as the main behavior
change. Two respondents mentioned that they observed growth in their child’s
confidence in their ability to complete art projects and “do good work.” One of these
parents went on to describe that her son had become “more social, confident and calmer
in the past few weeks.” This confidence extended from art-making activities to the
interaction with adults and peers because the child “became less intimidated when asked
by instructor or by other children in social settings.”
The parents also noted changes in their child’s social behaviors, such as
answering the questions more politely and in a less abrupt manner. One parent suggested
that this change might have been due to the fact that the museum was a friendly learning
environment for the program participants and the CMA educators interacted with the
children in a non-threatening way.

89

Two of the survey respondents indicated that they were not sure whether the
museum program had brought about any changes in their child’s behavior mainly because
a longer period of time was necessary to see behavior changes in such aspects as
concentration or social skills. At the same time, one of these respondents described the
rise in her son’s confidence level (included in the confidence category above) but
qualified her response by saying that she treated confidence as a character trait rather than
a behavior. The other respondent, while stating that her son needed a longer time to see
improvements in communication, acknowledged the fact that the child was now more
open to participation in joint activities with both of his parents. It can be interpreted as an
improvement in the child’s social behavior within the family.
Program influence on participant interaction with art and others
Post-program Survey Items 7 and 8 asked for an explanation of the perceived
program influence on the children’s interaction with art and others, respectively.
Regarding the perceived change in the children’s interaction with art, three
parents noted that the program had taught their children to control their impulses to touch
the museum artwork. As follows from the parents’ responses, the children also learned
that it takes time to create art and that one needs to concentrate on the task at hand to do it.
Two parents noted that their child’s perspective on art had broadened because of the
content of the program and the authority of the museum educator who delivered
instruction during the gallery tours. Two other changes in the children’s interaction with
art were noted as well, including taking ownership of the created artwork and a better
understanding that art is meant to be shared with others. Both of these changes are
important in terms of confidence and socialization of autistic children.
90

Post-program Survey Item 8 provided one of the more crucial sets of data for
answering the research question of the study. Two parents stated that they did not notice
any differences in their child’s interaction with others, while eight parents acknowledged
such changes and listed examples of the ways they thought the interaction had changed or
had begun to change. The examples included enjoyment drawn from being with other
people, increased interaction with family members, overcoming the natural shyness
evidenced by the proclivity to make “the first move” and take action to meet new friends,
along with developing a feeling of acceptance within a group by bonding with other
children who are on the same level.
One parent particularly described the change in her son’s interaction with others
as “being comfortable with other people, especially those that may interact atypically”
without becoming frustrated with their reactions. Another parent gave an example of how
her daughter’s socialization evolved throughout the program. The girl enjoyed playing
with plastic and wooden blocks in the Education Gallery during the break time. While at
the beginning of the program the girl was unwilling to share the blocks and took them to
the corner of the room, at the end she found herself right in the middle of the four boys
playing blocks. Finally, one parent remarked that her child’s interaction with others
depended on the topic and the environment.
Overall program impact on participants
Post-program Survey Item 9 asked about the overall effect the museum
experience had on the participants. Analysis of the parents’ responses revealed the
following major themes: confidence-building, enjoyment of learning, the value of artmaking activities for stimulating creativity, and knowledge retention. In particular, five
91

surveyed parents believed that the program had a positive effect on their child and helped
to build his or her confidence in social situations. Four parents believed that the program
provided an enjoyable and productive learning experience for their child, allowing him or
her to acquire new knowledge of art. Three parents thought that the program developed
their child’s creativity by allowing him or her to recreate artworks that enhanced the
concepts learned through the museum instruction sessions. Two parents indicated that the
program broadened their child’s mindset by allowing him or her to expand their
understanding and appreciation of what art is and what it can be.
Specifically, the parents noted that the children appeared less frustrated or anxious,
as well as more eager to learn new things. They showed their interest by raising a hand to
answer questions and enjoying the creative process in the museum studio based on the
knowledge they had learned through the gallery tours. The parents also listed increases in
the focus level of their children as a positive effect of the museum program. As one
parent testified, her child was able to stay on task and complete all the museum projects,
while “he often does not complete projects” in other situations. Lastly, commenting about
the effect of the CMA program, the parents claimed that it played a role in developing
their children’s artistic talents because the children tended to draw more frequently and
became more observant of the elements of art in their surroundings.
Feedback on the CMA program sustainability
Post-program Survey Items 10-13 included a range of questions related to
program sustainability and possible future improvements. Survey Item 10 asked what the
parents liked most in the program. The most frequently mentioned answer was that they
liked the fact that the program took place in an environment that encouraged learning and
92

created a comfortable atmosphere for all the participants. The second most popular
answer was related to the helpfulness of the CMA staff who treated each child with
respect. Specifically, the parents emphasized how pleased they were with the fact that the
museum educators managed to engage each child equally and did not penalize the
behaviors that were hard for the autistic children to control. The parents observed that the
welcoming museum environment fostered the idea that there was no right or wrong
answer. One parent summarized it best by saying that the program’s success was due to
the teachers’ way to interact—kind and patient with every participant and also
considerate of their individual learning styles.
The parents also appreciated the hands-on element of the access program,
pointing out the fact that the art-making activities in the CMA studio helped the children
to retain the knowledge by the “application of the concept learned in the gallery
instruction session to the hands-on art project.” In fact, the parents noted that the learning
opportunity was valuable for them as well and stressed the importance of completing the
projects together. In addition to developing a closer bond with their child, two of the
parents also spoke favorably about such aspects of the access program as an opportunity
to meet with other autistic families and “share experiences and stories” that help to deal
with the challenges of autism.
Survey Item 11 was related to making improvements to the museum access
program. Six parents answered that no improvements were necessary, while four parents
provided constructive feedback ranging from a more flexible program schedule that
would include weekend sessions; taking into account the participants’ attention span by
adjusting the gallery tour time in order to allow more time for hands-on art-making

93

activities; expanding the selection of topics to cover additional forms of art, including
clay and sculpture; to expanding the project with different age brackets to make it
suitable for children of all ages.
Survey Item 12 inquired about the parents’ opinions regarding a possible return
to the museum or visiting other museums after their participation in the CMA access
program. All ten parents unanimously said yes, citing reasons such as small class size,
skill of the instructor, and encouragement of parent participation. Moreover, as the
parents stated, the CMA made the idea of a museum friendly to special needs children the
reality and taught the children patience, open-mindedness, and appreciation of art.
Survey Item 13 asked if the parents would recommend the CMA access program
to other parents of children with ASD and why. One hundred percent of the parents gave
a positive answer to this question. Three out of seven parents did not provide an
explanation. Those who did gave diverse reasons, but the major one was that the children
had derived substantial benefits from the program. According to the parents’ responses,
the program was a step in the right direction in terms of helping the autistic children learn
about art and interact socially with others in a safe environment. The parents saw
improvements in how their children followed the guidelines and at the same time
managed to participate in their own way.
The parents argued that a similar type of access program would be beneficial for
other children with ASD because of the profound therapeutic effect it had on this group,
encouraging the children to explore their creativity and teaching them a new perspective
on art and history. The parents attributed the success of the program to the team of CMA

94

instructors who “allowed the children to share their thoughts and ideas and only
unobtrusively redirected [them] when necessary.” As one parent put it, the CMA access
program is great for the autism community because “who knows what [art] could wake
up in the mind of a child with autism.”
4.9 Parent Interview Results
This section contains analysis of the data collected through semi-structured parent
interviews following the last museum visit. The interviews were conducted to clarify the
responses to pre-program and post-program surveys through direct communication with
the parents and to deepen the researcher’s understanding of the main phenomenon of the
study—the museum experience of ten autistic children who participated in this research.
During the semi-structured interviews, the researcher asked each parent a pre-designed
set of eight questions and then used prompts to elicit more elaborate explanations if
necessary. The names of the interviewees and their children were kept anonymous to
protect the identity of the study participants.
Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts revealed important constructs and
patterns that were used to complement the data collected from pre-program and postprogram parent surveys. To analyze the large amount of data gathered from the
interviews, the researcher grouped the questions into four broad categories: museum
experience, learning in the museum environment, program structure, and changes in
communication behavior. The category of museum experience included Interview
Questions 1 and 2. The learning in the museum environment category encompassed
Interview Questions 3, 4, 5 and 8. The program structure category featured data from

95

Interview Question 6. Lastly, the changes in communication behavior category included
data from Interview Question 7.
Museum experience
Several common themes emerged across the data collected from Interview
Questions 1 and 2 that asked about the children’s experiences at the museum. Regarding
Interview Question 1, all of the interviewees mentioned that the CMA access program
was a “positive experience,” which signifies the uniformity of the parents’ perceptions of
the program. Eight out of ten parents also used the words “excitement” (or “enjoyment”)
to describe the museum experience for their child. In addition, eight parents used the
words “looking forward to” to describe the children’s attitude to the museum visits. At
the same time, six out of ten parents noted that their child was “nervous” (or “anxious”)
at the start of the program but managed to overcome the initial shyness and became
“more comfortable” (or “opened up”) as the program progressed. An account from one of
the parents summarized the transition of her child “from being a shy little boy and not
answering questions to having self-confidence to answer even those questions that he
normally would not be apt to answer.”
Six parents pointed out the “excitement to learn about art” they saw in their child
throughout the program, while four parents emphasized the fact that the program
presented an entirely “new (or “different”) experience.” For example, one child not only
was very interested in learning the content of each gallery tour but also “took the program
very seriously.” His parent spoke in great detail about how much he followed directions
and was eager to watch over the younger children and set an example of good behavior
for them. He acted as a role model for the group and was very vocal when he saw any
96

infraction of the established museum rules. His parent was pleased with his leadership
and confidence growth.
Furthermore, four parents mentioned “enjoyment of hands-on activities” as the
thing that defined the museum experience for them and their child. According to the
parents, the art-making activities helped the children to better retain the knowledge
learned through the gallery tours. Moreover, the hands-on activities played a part in
calming down those children who tended to become restless and impatient during the
gallery tours. In this regard, two parents observed progress with their children’s attention
span as the children began to focus more and stay on task toward the second half of the
museum program. One parent addressed the issue in more detail saying that “[the child]
thoroughly enjoyed hands-on art-making project… The program has made him want to
go to museums more and he had a little more confidence with his art. He even can finish
his art projects at school now.”
Two out of ten parents described the museum experience in terms of helping
diversify their child’s interests. One of these parents referred to the museum program as a
way to “get [the child] away from video games,” while the other provided a vivid
example of how the theme of Week Two, Animals and Shapes, inspired the child to draw
and color a lizard which “was the first time [he] drew anything other than a person.” This
episode was the highlight of the Week Two visit. Despite his obvious artistic talent,
before the CMA program the child’s interests in art had been very narrow, limited to
sketching comic book heroes or cartoon characters. As his parents put it, “the program
showed [the child] that art can take many different forms besides the comic book
characters he liked to draw.”

97

One parent described the museum experience as an opportunity to spend time
together with the child, thus stressing the importance of the museum program as a family
outing. It should be noted that this interviewee also mentioned the time before and after
each museum visit as critical for the child’s development. On the way to and from the
museum, the child learned to become more observant and increased awareness of his
surroundings, such as people, cars, and new buildings in downtown. Another parent
described the museum experience for her son as “eye-opening” because of how quickly
the child had to learn “to transition between topics, peers, the instructor, and other CMA
staff.” While in the beginning this child “did not want to mingle or socialize with other
kids… he did not want to open up because it was a new experience for him, after the first
visit he was excited about going back.” Lastly, four interviewees mentioned the fact that
the instructors were great and made the children feel at home as defining the museum
experience for them.
The purpose of Interview Question 2 was to investigate whether the children had
any previous knowledge about art and if that experience affected their learning
throughout the museum program. The responses collected from the parents indicated that
all of the participating children had had varying degrees of knowledge about art before
the start of the CMA access program. According to the parents, the children acquired this
knowledge through art classes at school, private art lessons, or previously visiting
different types of museums with their families. However, the museum access program
refreshed and furthered their art knowledge, thus helping the children to lessen their
anxiety about the program and learn the most from each museum visit. A parent readily

98

admitted that “a tiny bit of prior knowledge kept [the child] from being so overwhelmed
with a new experience.”
The museum program was built around the concept of a free-choice, not rigid
learning environment so as to “let the children experience the art how they felt they
needed.” One of the parents said that while the limited knowledge of art her child had
acquired from school was helpful, the main factors that facilitated the child’s knowledge
and retention of the art-related concepts she learned in the museum program were the
people who worked with her, the teacher who encouraged her to try new things, and the
hands-on art-making activity at the end of each visit. At the same time, another
interviewee insisted that the previous knowledge about art did not make a lot of
difference for her child. The child is an active and warm-hearted boy who generally
welcomes any new experiences and social events. Therefore, he was open to the idea of
participating in the museum access program and looked forward to visiting the museum
during each of the six weeks the program was offered. The majority of the parents
pointed out the fact that the children liked art by nature. They also recognized the
calming effect of art on their child. When the children drew, they “became less worried
about what’s going on around.”
Additionally, one of the parents elaborated on how the program structure itself
contributed to enhancing the children’s background knowledge of art and the museum,
thus helping with their integration into the museum program. For example, one of the
children read the social story every time he and his parent went to the museum so that he
acquired detailed knowledge about the place. He initiated a conversation with the

99

museum instructor about the total number of art pieces in the CMA collection. He
assuredly stated that there were over 7,000 pieces and added: “I know. I read it.”
Learning in the museum environment
Several common themes emerged across the data collected from Interview
Questions 3, 4, 5 and 8 that asked about the children’s learning in the museum
environment. Regarding Question 3, five interviewees pointed out that experiencing the
museum access program as a group motivated their child. Three parents mentioned that
their child would have been bored and would not have stayed at the museum for as long
as he or she had being a part of the group. Two parents used the word “competitiveness”
to describe how the group setting affected their child’s willingness to learn.
In particular, the parents commented that the group setting motivated the children
to become more engaged in the museum activities. One parent observed that experiencing
the museum as a group made it more fun for her son, even though because of the
language impairments “he gets more apprehensive when he is in a group and he would
have done better one-on-one in terms of learning.” Nevertheless, the peer pressure the
child felt from the group ignited his competitive spirit and made him want to participate
in the program activities. Another parent expressed a similar opinion stating that her child
was determined to be more engaged when he saw how the other children raised their
hands and answered questions. That parent said that her child “does not socialize a lot
anyway,” but seeing other children so active “made him go along with the program.”
A third parent echoed the feeling that experiencing the program together as a
group motivated the children and impacted their interest because they saw their peers’

100

curiosity about the museum program. One parent emphasized this impact by saying that
her child would be less apt to participate in the museum visits alone. However, in a group
setting he was willing to socialize with the other children that he could relate to. In the
words of this parent, the group environment was critical for the participants’ socialization
because “in a group, children have someone to compare themselves to.”
The parents testified that even if their children typically had a tendency to
withdraw from social situations, they were more inclined to stay engaged in the museum
program if they saw other children involved and answering questions. As one parent said
referring to his son’s experience, “that tends to draw him.” Yet, as the parent noted, his
son would have mingled around more if there had been more teenagers in the group.
Another parent described her child’s experience in a positive light as well. The parent
noted a positive dynamic in both the learning and social behaviors of the child who was
willing to answer questions more frequently as a result of the group interaction. The
parent said, “It might have not been the right answer but she would still give her opinion.”
Analyzing the impact of the group on her child’s museum experience, one parent
offered a unique perspective on the cognitive aspect of the group interaction. The parent
acknowledged that the group environment enhanced the child’s learning by allowing
him ”to gather information from everyone else and then think about it, process it,” and
then contribute something new to the conversation. Regarding the child’s participation in
the discussions during the gallery tours, the parent concluded, “I don’t think he would
have been as open one-on-one as he was with the group.”

101

The last point made by the parents regarding learning and socialization as part of
the group was about a healthy amount of peer pressure the children felt from the other
group members. This positive pressure made the children more eager to see “who would
get the right answer first.” Along the same lines, the parents mentioned that the children
would have felt bored without the company and would not have enjoyed their time. By
contrast, watching their peers participate in the museum activity inspired the children to
do the same thing and become more engaged.
One child proved to be a different case. Because his autism symptoms are
manifested in a very peculiar way, his parent claimed that he did not get as many benefits
from being part of the group as the other children. According to the interviewee, the child
prefers to interact with adults, especially in learning settings. Therefore, he would have
learned more from participating with a group of adults. However, the overall parent
perception of the group environment was that it facilitated learning and contributed to
greater socialization of the autistic children during the six-week museum access program.
Interview Question 4 intended to investigate parent perceptions of the difference
between learning in the museum environment and learning in the traditional classroom.
Analysis of the parents’ responses revealed a number of common themes. First, all the
parents characterized the museum as a better learning setting than the traditional
classroom, considering the wide variety of needs and unique circumstances of children
with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Second, the majority of the parents described museum
learning as different from the classroom learning. Third, the parents pointed out the freechoice and relaxed nature of museum learning compared to classroom learning. And
fourth, the parents alluded to fact that the museum environment offered more

102

opportunities for the children to express their opinions in a non-threatening and
welcoming surrounding.
To give specific examples of why they thought the museum environment was
better than the classroom environment, the parents cited reasons such as a smaller class
size and a relaxed atmosphere where the children could roll on the floor, lie down, or
pace around if they felt the needed to do so. They did not feel the pressure to behave in a
certain way; they “could do what they needed to relax themselves and still be present and
still be involved… and still learn.” The CMA environment allowed the children “to do
the little things that made them calm down, so that they were still able to function.”
This was why one of the parents thought the museum facilitated learning more
than the school. Her son “enjoyed learning without being forced to conform.” Another
reason mentioned by the parents was that in the museum there was a “visual component
added, with the ability to get up and move…it’s a much better learning environment for
[children with autism].” Another parent emphasized the contrast with the classroom in
more detail by saying that the museum allowed the children to learn and it was “a much
better learning environment than sitting at a table with a book or a piece of paper and
looking at the blackboard.”
The interviewees provided a variety of reasons to describe in what ways the
museum learning was different from classroom learning. For example, one parent said
that in the museum the children could interact with the art more closely by being able to
see the art in person, while in the school classroom they could only “see the picture or
watch a video about it.” Additionally, the museum provided a richer learning experience

103

for the autistic children because it “has a lot of history for each piece of artwork.” The
parents were pleased that in the museum learning took place without the pressure from
teachers to meet the expectations of the structured classroom. One parent thought that this
freedom gave the children more space “to be their wiggly selves.” The parent described
the museum access program as therapeutic because it enriched the children and allowed
them to flourish while obtaining new knowledge about art. Also, the autistic children
“were all interacting in the museum and lying on the floor. They can’t do this in the
regular classroom.”
The free-choice and relaxed nature of museum learning was mentioned by a
number of the parents as well. As the father of a fifteen-year-old participant admitted, he
was glad to see the museum as a non-structured learning environment because his son
“gets bored when he is always in a structured environment.” The mother of a nine-yearold participant had a similar view as she noted that in the museum “the kids had more
opportunity.” The parent felt that “in the regular classroom, [children with special needs]
are left out a lot of times and not really purposefully but just because there are so many
more kids in the classroom and only… one teacher... Whereas at the museum, [there were]
several people that were walking around with a group and… talking to the kids and
interacting with the kids and making them feel at ease and making them feel like their
answers were important.” The same parent implied that learning in the museum setting
was beneficial for the intellectual development of the children because “the teachers
really dug deep at the museum to get answers out of the kids. I mean, just question after
question… get them to think. And I'm not saying that a regular classroom teacher doesn't
do that, but I don’t think they do it to the degree that the museum workers did.”

104

Another parent also noted that the museum environment relaxed the children and
allowed them the freedom of self-expression because their “opinion was greatly
appreciated. No one got upset. No one tried to out-speak each other.” The parent noted
that in the regular classroom, “children with those special diagnoses kind of tend to linger
in the back… They don’t get to give their opinion…they do get overlooked and they
really want to express themselves and either the teacher or the students don’t have time or
patience to allow them to do that… and they withdraw to themselves” for fear of being
wrong. On the other hand, “with this experience there was no right or wrong answer… So,
the patience and the time that the [CMA] staff had, was great.”
Interview Question 5 asked the parents about evidence of learning in their
children that might have been related to the museum access program. Seven out of ten
parents provided concrete examples of what they perceived as evidence of learning.
According to the interviewees, the children became more cognizant of the elements of art
in their everyday lives. The children began to see patterns in clothing items while
shopping with their parents, landscapes in images they saw, as well as warm and cool
colors. More importantly, they started to discuss what they observed.
According to the parents, it was not a fast process, but they were pleased to see it
“filtering into [the children’s] everyday language and routine.” One parent shared how
participation in the program made her son realize that all the warm colors were together
in the rainbow and so were all the cool colors. The boy then included that knowledge into
a weather report he had to prepare for a Cub Scout assignment. Another parent recalled
that her child was proud of the artwork he had created in the CMA art program. He was
eager to show his paintings to any relatives or friends who visited the family and “tell

105

them all about [his art].” In addition, another parent mentioned that her son had learned to
pay more attention to art-related topics brought up by others and even began to critically
analyze the accuracy of such information. For instance, when the parent misrepresented
the order of the topics in the museum program while talking to the child’s grandmother,
the boy joined the conversation and corrected his mother. Another evidence of art-related
learning came from the same child. During the Week Four visit, he learned that
watercolor pencils were an excellent tool for creating landscape art and later insisted on
taking watercolor pencils to the beach to use them on a family vacation trip.
Another program participant who had previously been fixated on sketching
cartoon characters on plain white paper started to include various backgrounds in his
sketches and improved his sense of perspective upon learning about the foreground, the
middle ground, and the background through the museum program. Several interviewees
included in their responses the children’s insightful comments about art. One parent was
quite surprised to hear her daughter’s revelation about the presence of “still life” in her
Subway sandwich.
Yet another child recognized the foreground and the background in the overcast
sky during a thunderstorm on the way back from the museum. When the child saw a
rainbow, he said to his mother, “Those are almost like the warm colors-cool colors type
scenario.” The museum program had a profound impact on this child. At the end of the
sixth visit, he said, “Well, I want to take art next year” when trying to choose electives
for sixth grade. This was how his parent summed up the impact: “he’s looking forward to
art. He’s really wanting to do it. I think when he sits in his room and just starts to draw, it

106

just kind of relaxes him, allows him to kind of free think without someone [controlling
him]. He gets to do whatever he wants. It’s like his mind, his imagination just takes over.”
Interview Question 8, the last question in the learning category, intended to find
out the parents’ perspectives on what the children had learned from the museum access
program. The majority of the parents affirmed that the children had learned the actual art
concepts and techniques taught in each or the six museum visits and also increased their
ability to generalize those concepts to their natural environment. One parent admitted that
her son had gained more understanding of what art was and furthered his knowledge in
each of the six areas of art the program covered. To confirm her point, the parent stated,
“I've seen more of an increase in talking about it and noticing things… that he hasn’t
previously noticed.”
Another parent appreciated the fact that the program gave her son “an opportunity
to learn about different artists and techniques they used and then got to practice them in
the studio.” The same child also learned to be more confident about creating his own art.
The social aspect of the program was also mentioned by the parents as crucial for
broadening the children’s awareness of the world and the people around them. The
mother of an eight-year-old participant described this journey for her son, “He learned
that he can connect with people no matter where he goes, no matter how much of a social
challenge it is.” Another parent pointed out in her interview response that through
participating in the six-week museum program her son had learned life skills, such as
patience, transition, conversation, knowing when to be expressive to other people, and
using the proper tone of voice. Lastly, another notable insight came from the father of a
fifteen-year-old participant who observed that his son had learned that art knows no

107

boundaries and no restrictions. It is individual as it means different things to different
people. In this sense, art is liberating because “art is what you make it to be. Art is what
you say it is.” That was the greatest lesson the children took away from the program.
Program structure
Question 6 of the parent interviews focused on the program structure as it asked
about the parents’ opinions regarding the most beneficial aspect of the museum access
program. The parents nearly spoke in unison in response to this question. Eight out of ten
parents identified hands-on art-making activities as the portion of the program that gave
the most impact to the autistic children. One parent mentioned the social time in the
beginning and the “way the [CMA staff] conducted gallery tours” as the most impactful
because it “got [her child] comfortable and then it showed him that you can learn things
in a fun and safe environment.” The tenth parent re-stated that being in a group was the
most beneficial for her son in terms of helping him to release his inhibitions and gain
confidence to create his own artwork.
Similar themes, confidence and independence, emerged through the analysis of
the other parents’ accounts of the hands-on experiences in the CMA art studio. One child
in particular benefitted from the hands-on sessions because “he was doing it on his own.
He loves doing things on his own where he doesn’t have to sit there and listen to
somebody tell him what to do.” According to another parent, the art-making activities
improved her son’s time management skills as he had “completed his projects within that
period of time, but yet he had the choice to go and choose how to do it.” The mother of a
teenage participant mentioned that her son enjoyed the activity time “and also talking
about the history of the paintings.”
108

In addition to art-making, one parent noted that the program benefited his child by
expanding the range of his interests in art to include not only sketches but also sculpture
and monotype printmaking. Another parent pointed out that the hands-on portion served
to reinforce the theoretical knowledge learned in the gallery tours because the child “got
to create what she had learned about while she was doing the tours. And…that really…
puts all the points together that she’s been learning throughout the whole tour… when she
can go and create one of her own.” To reiterate the benefits of the museum access
program, a parent stated that what benefited her child the most was “that flexible
conversation that they had from the time [the museum instructor] came in and was talking
about the weekend…[So,] from the time he went in, it was just a very comfortable
environment where he can… express hisself [sic].”
Changes in communication behavior
Question 7 of the parent interviews focused on the perceived changes in the
children’s communication behaviors that the parents attributed to the museum access
program. Several interviewees mentioned that the program helped make their child more
calm and focused when working on schoolwork. One parent claimed that after the
program, her son seemed less argumentative when given a task. The parent stated that
now “[the child] would actually sit down and get started… and do his work without too
much of… his usual excuses.” Another parent noticed that her child had become more
“conscious as to what he is willing to put on paper” when creating his art. Also, as one
parent observed about her daughter, after the museum program “she’ll talk to people
more… not just the family members, but, you know, people out in public… She’ll just
say, “hey.” And, you know, be more open to just strangers that she doesn't know.”

109

However, on the whole, analysis of the parent responses revealed limited
evidence of change in the children’s communication behaviors that the parents could
directly attribute to the six-week CMA art program. Impairment in the general
communication is one of the major challenges autistic children face, and it is usually
treated through intense, individually designed, specialized therapy over an extended
period of time. As one of the parents explained about the lack of change in her son’s
communication, “it’s not something you’ll see overnight. You know, it’s a gradual
[process] but I think that every little milestone with this program…definitely helps
[children on the autism spectrum].”
Another parent noted regarding the change in her son, “Everyone who saw him
commented about how much more social he is and how much calmer he is. But I can't
really pinpoint what exactly made him that way.” One of the reasons the parents did not
see much change in communication was because several children in the group already
possessed the basic communication skills they had acquired at school or from
participation in other extracurricular activities, as the parents stated in their responses.
In addition, because of the feasibility considerations, the museum access program
was offered for only six weeks. The following response from a parent reflects the general
perception of the interviewees: “I don’t think it would change [my child’s communication]
in that short of a period of time. But I am glad he went through the program. It’s an
experience he has never had before.” However, as it became clear from the parents’
responses, the children felt encouraged to talk. Although the change in their
communication was limited, they demonstrated increase in self-esteem, confidence, and
interest in the museum.

4.10 Summary
This chapter presented the analysis of data pertaining to a study of the museum
experience impact on learning and social behaviors of children diagnosed with Autism
Spectrum Disorder. The researcher utilized an analysis plan that covered both the
quantitative and the qualitative types of data collected in the course of this study. In order
to create a more complete picture of the autistic children’s learning and socialization in
the museum environment, data were analyzed from a variety of sources including parent
pre-program and post-program surveys, the standardized Social Responsiveness Scale,
behavioral observations, pre-gallery and post-gallery tour task evaluations, and semistructured parent interviews.
Analysis of the survey data related to family motivations for visiting museums
revealed that, from the parents’ perspective, there were four main motivations, namely: to
be pleasantly occupied, to enjoy themselves, to use imagination, and to expand their
child’s horizons. Regarding the CMA access program, the survey data showed that all ten
parents perceived the museum experience as either positive or very positive for their
children. Ninety percent of the parents acknowledged that the museum program
influenced their children’s interaction with art, and at the same time 70% noted the
change in the children’s interaction with others. The majority of the parents also agreed
that the museum access program contributed to improving their children’s social
behaviors, especially in such aspects as following directions, participation in group
activities, and willingness to share objects or toys.
These quantitative findings were supported by the qualitative data from semistructured interviews the researcher conducted with the parents after the final museum
111

visit of the access program. Analysis of the interview responses revealed that the parents
unanimously agreed that the program succeeded in building the children’s confidence in
their ability to do well in a group environment, appreciation of art, and understanding of
how to handle themselves in social situations. Thus, the quantitative findings from the
surveys and qualitative findings from the parent interviews were interconnected and
together they helped address the research problem investigating the museum program
impact on social behaviors of the autistic children.
Furthermore, data from behavioral observation tallies provided evidence of a
positive change in communication and learning behaviors of the participating children.
Specifically, the data demonstrated a 41% increase in the area of answering questions in
Week Six compared to Week One, which was indicative of the children’s growing
willingness to engage in the learning process to a greater extent as the program unfolded.
Additionally, the observation findings related to the area of requests for self revealed a
nearly fourfold increase from Week One to Week Six, which demonstrated the children’s
heightened sense of self, along with the confidence to voice their individual concerns and
needs. These data collected directly from study subjects proved a distinct impact of the
museum access program on the autistic children.
The positive results from direct observations were statistically affirmed by the
findings from the Social Responsiveness Scale. The results of the paired samples t-test
comparing the pre-program and post-program parent ratings of the Scale items revealed
that the impact of the museum program on the behaviors of the participating children in
both the Social Communication and Interaction and Restricted Interests and Repetitive
Behavior domains was statistically significant (p = .004 < .05). In particular, the highest

112

impact was in the area of Social Cognition (p = .003) understood as the ability to
correctly interpret and act on social cues.
Finally, analysis of the data collected from the pre-gallery and post-gallery tasks
completed by the children revealed that the accuracy of task completion increased each
week following the gallery instruction by the CMA educator. The pre-gallery and postgallery task evaluation results provided further evidence to corroborate the findings from
the parent interviews that the museum program allowed the children to master their
knowledge of art-related concepts and brought an immense motivation to learn new
things that the children were going to carry on and apply to future interactions with art or
other extracurricular activities.
In summary, analysis of data from a combination of quantitative and qualitative
sources reaffirmed the findings that pointed toward a positive influence of the museum
experience on learning and behaviors of the autistic children.

CHAPTER 5
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
5.1 Introduction
In today’s fast-paced information universe where learning can happen anywhere
any time, museums have evolved from object-based stewards of cultural heritage into
dynamic and participatory institutions of learning. In light of this paradigmatic shift and
the need to reimagine the role and functions of the museum in contemporary society,
more museums are integrating the principles of diversity and inclusion into their
programs. Museums adjust their strategic priorities in favor of opening their doors and
their practices to all service communities, including populations with special needs.
The purpose of this study was to better understand how the museum experience
can benefit children with autism by addressing the following research question: How
does the museum experience influence learning and behaviors of children diagnosed with
Autism Spectrum Disorder? The first two research sub-questions examined the
experience of a group of high-functioning autistic children in an art museum through the
lens of the Contextual Learning model. The other two sub-questions addressed the family
needs and motivations for visiting museums, along with changes in the children’s content
knowledge acquisition.
This chapter presents an in-depth discussion of the study findings and explains
how the research question and the sub-questions were answered. It also contains
114

reflections on the meaning of the data obtained in the course of this research. Finally, it
discusses the limitations of the study and considers its implications for practice, along
with recommendations for future research.
5.2 Discussion of Findings
The study’s first research sub-question focused on the uniqueness of the museum
experiences lived by autistic children while in an art museum. This experience was
investigated in the context of the six-week access program implemented at the Columbia
Museum of Art in April-May 2015. Quantitative and qualitative data were generated
from parent surveys, a standardized scale, behavioral observations, on-site task
evaluations, and follow-up parent interviews. Using a combination of such diverse data
sources allowed the researcher to create a rich description of the museum experience for
the autistic children selected for participation in the study.
Analysis of the data proved that the museum access program provided a positive
and exciting experience for the children, which led to increases in their knowledge and
appreciation of art, as well as their confidence level in situations requiring social
interactions. Empirical data provided ample evidence that the children thrived in the
museum environment due to its emphasis on engagement, inquiry-based, and free-choice
learning that left the children sufficient space to express their individuality, and
independent judgment of art. Specifically, the hands-on art-making activities contributed
to developing the children’s creativity and facilitated better retention of the art-related
concepts they learned in the guided gallery tours. The positive impact of art-making
activities on the children’s learning was evidenced by the responses from the parent
surveys and interviews.
115

Furthermore, the parents described the experience of learning in the museum as
different from learning in the traditional classroom. Evidence from the interview
responses indicated that the parents pinpointed such differences as a smaller class size
and a more relaxed museum atmosphere that encouraged the autistic children to express
themselves more freely due to the non-threatening nature of the museum learning. The
parents alluded to the fact that in the museum learning was pressure-free because the
children did not feel the burden to meet the expectations of a structured classroom.
Besides, the inquiry-based learning environment enhanced by the interaction with
authentic art objects proved to be more suitable for the autistic children.
These differences noted by the parents corresponded with the findings from the
existing literature that point out the fact that autistic children tend to face significant
challenges in the conventional classroom settings due to their reduced attention span and
reluctance to engage in social interactions in front of large groups of people (Baldino,
2012; Greenspan & Wieder, 2006). At the same time, Baldino (2012) stressed the
capacity of museums to facilitate learning for children with developmental disabilities
through active and direct engagement with real objects, thus addressing both their
intellectual and sensory needs.
A second research sub-question looked at the application of the Contextual Model
of Learning (CML) to interpret the educational and social experience of autistic children
in a museum. The study findings confirmed that the CML was a valid framework to
examine the museum learning of the autistic children in the three specific contexts outline
by the Model: personal, sociocultural, and physical. The study showed that these three
contexts did play a role in shaping the museum experiences of the study participants.

116

Coming from different socio-economic backgrounds, they had different levels of
education, different preferences in art, and varying motivations for visiting the museum,
as was reflected in the parent survey responses. However, they were immensely
influenced by the sociocultural context of the six-week museum program, particularly in
the area of within group social mediation.
The influence of the group was very vividly stated by the majority of the parents
in their interviews with the researcher. The parents noted that being part of the group
motivated the children to stay actively engaged with the museum instruction and the
subsequent hands-on activities. Seeing the participation of the other children in the group
prompted the less outgoing participants to overcome their shyness and answer questions
more frequently. Their interactions involved not only peers but also the museum
educators, which created a substantial difference for the effectiveness of learning. Finally,
the combination of experienced CMA instructors, the use of the Visual Thinking Strategy
to teach, the orientation to the physical space that the participants received in the form of
the social story, and the program itself formed the unique physical context of the museum
experience for the autistic children.
The study’s third research sub-question revolved around the needs and
motivations of families affected by autism to visit the museum. The findings obtained
from the parent pre-program survey revealed that although the parents mentioned a wide
variety of motivations, the four main ones were: to be pleasantly occupied, to enjoy
themselves, to get a feeling of achievement, and to expand the child’s horizons. Although
the parents represented families with special needs, it became evident that their purpose
and agenda in visiting museums was no different from the interests pursued by all the

117

other museum visitors. Discovering this fact helped the researcher strengthen the
argument for greater diversity and inclusion in contemporary museums and erasing the
boundaries between special needs populations and typical museum learners.
The fourth research sub-question of the study inquired whether the museum
experience held the potential to enhance learning in a particular cognitive domain, which
in the case of this study was specifically identified as art. The study produced sufficient
evidence to establish a positive influence on the participants’ learning exhibited by the
consistent increase in the accuracy of the tasks the children performed every week after
the gallery instruction compared to the same tasks they had to complete before the
instruction. For example, the children provided 26.5% more correct answers after they
learned the art concepts from the museum instructor in Week 1, 16.1% more correct
answers in Week 4, and 12.5% increase in Week 6. In addition, through the interviews
parents shared their children’s successful learning stories such as observations about
warm and cool color in the rainbow, the presence of still life elements around them, and
the ability to better describe their own artwork to relatives and friends. It follows that the
qualitative results from the parent interviews were interrelated with the quantitative
results drawn from the task evaluations because they both were indicative of the fact that
the program helped to increase the children’s knowledge of art and enhance their ability
to retain that newly-acquired knowledge.
All four research sub-questions laid the groundwork for answering the
overarching question of the study: How does the museum experience influence learning
and behaviors of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder? The researcher was
able to determine that the museum experience had a profound and positive effect on the

118

study subjects in the areas of learning and socialization. The results from the quantitative
data collected directly from the participating children through observation and task
evaluations yielded convincing evidence that the children had increased their engagement
in cognitive activities and improved their social behaviors. Also, these quantitative
findings confirmed the parents’ perception of the influence the program had on learning
and confidence level of the children. The findings from the follow-up interviews showed
that the parents unanimously agreed that the program succeeded in expanding the
children’s mind and enhancing their curiosity and interest in art, which should sustain
their desire to learn in the future. One hundred percent of the parents expressed their
satisfaction with the program and stated that they would like to continue to participate in
museum educational programs. Lastly, all these findings were scaffolded by the scores
from the Social Responsiveness Scale that was administered twice, before and after the
museum program. The results of the paired sample t-test unequivocally demonstrated the
overall statistical significance of the impact of the museum experience on the children’s
social behaviors, especially in the category of social cognition.
Interweaving data from multiple sources into one cohesive fabric turned out to be
an efficient strategy for validating the study findings. Data triangulation enabled the
researcher to visualize the impact of a special museum program on the cultural and
intellectual development of a group of autistic children. The researcher convincingly
demonstrated that a well-designed cultural event had a profound impact on a special
needs audience. Such an impact was manifested on multiple levels, including personal
satisfaction, increased socialization, cognitive engagement, and cultural enrichment.

119

These areas are recognized in the professional literature as vital for the overall
well-being and development of autistic children (Coyne & Fullerton, 2004). However, the
specific impact of a cultural intervention, defined as the museum experience, on this
growing segment of the population had not been sufficiently studied and consequently
was not fully understood before. Therefore, by providing a definitive answer to its main
research question, the study contributed to narrowing the gap in the existing knowledge
about the interplay between museums and autism and opening up new opportunities for a
broader conversation about the issues of diversity, inclusiveness, and social justice in
cultural institutions.
Numerous sources have investigated the medical side of autism, including causes,
major impairments caused by this developmental disorder, assessment instruments,
treatment options, and prognosis for future trends (Beaumont & Sofronoff, 2008;
Murdock, Cost, & Tieso, 2007; Koegel, R., Bradshaw, Ashbaugh, & Koegel, L., 2014;
Gentry, Wallace, Kvarfordt, & Lynch, 2010) . Other studies have examined the outcomes
of school-based interventions, that is, programs implemented in the educational setting
(Arick et al., 2003; Fabrizio & Moors, 2003). This attention is not accidental given the
accelerated growth and the spread of autism in recent years. In fact, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established that autism is one of the fastestgrowing developmental disorders (CDC, 2014), making it an issue of national concern.
There is also an extensive body of literature exploring various benefits of learning
through the museum environment for regular visitors (Griffin, 1999, 2004; Schauble,
Leinhardt, & Martin, 1997), such as direct interaction between students and exhibits,
more positive attitudes and motivation toward learning, and a change of pace from the

120

regular classroom routine. It was twenty years ago that scholars stressed such outcomes
of museum learning as an expanded sense of aesthetic appreciation, the development of
motivation and interest, the formation and refinement of critical standards, and the
growth of personal identity (Schauble et al., 1996).
It is interesting to note that all these positives seem to be closely intertwined with
the core deficits of autism. However, there has been a clear lack of in-depth research
dealing specifically with how museums as cultural institutions can help the autism
community. The few studies that do address this issue emphasize that understanding how
autistic children and their families experience the museum can broaden the museums’
ability to serve such audiences (Langa et al., 2013). The literature mentioned above
informed the current study by providing a platform and outlining a need for deeper and
more extensive research on the nature of learning and socialization of autistic children in
cultural and recreational settings. Baldino (2012) enunciated this need by connecting
three crucial issues: the pressure on modern museums to reaffirm their value and
relevance to society, the increasing prevalence of autism, and the growing demand for
inclusive education available to all categories of learners regardless of their physical or
mental ability.
The need for more formalized research is especially apparent in light of the fact
that in recent years a number of programs have been initiated to target visitors with
special needs in museums across the country. For example, the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston, the Dallas Museum of Art, and the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art have
offered sensory workshops, classes, customized tours, and other means to create a
welcoming learning environment for families of autistic children. These experiences are

121

designed to facilitate the children’s growth including their cognitive, social, emotional,
and physical development.
These initiatives usually receive positive feedback from both the families and the
museum staff. However, in order to firmly embed such good practices into mainstream
museum work, scholars, practitioners, and the entire autism community must move
beyond just anecdotal evidence. Using a systematic approach to data gathering, the
researcher successfully measured the impact of a tailored museum program on children
on the autism spectrum and demonstrated evidence of change in their learning and social
behavior. Therefore, this study extended previous research and filled the gap in the
existing museum literature and practice regarding the impact of cultural institutions on
children with autism.
5.3 Implications for Practice
In terms of its concrete contributions, the findings of this research had several
significant implications for the field. First, it resulted in establishing a sustainable access
program with long-term benefits for the greater Midlands community. From a broader
perspective, this research fulfilled the goal of finding out how cultural institutions can be
transformed to ensure equity of access to human cultural heritage for all users, regardless
of their physical or intellectual ability. Therefore, the knowledge gained from this study
will be useful to other museums looking to enhance their special programs to increasingly
diverse local communities.
The main outcome of the study was that it proved that exposure to cultural events
enhances the quality of life of children with autism by providing opportunities to engage

122

with art, learn, and interact with peers in a non-threatening and welcoming environment.
Specifically, the study produced evidence of change in the autistic children’s content
knowledge and social interaction skills. The aforementioned change was noted through
an increase in understanding of the exhibit content, as well as enjoyment, socialization,
and creativity during the gallery tours and the follow-up hands-on art-making activities
the children completed together with their parents.
The intent behind this research was to stimulate dialogue between the autism
community and the cultural sector about integrating the principles of social justice into
current educational practices of cultural institutions to make the museum field more
inclusive and relevant to all of its service communities. The study made the case that
civic engagement is the vehicle museums can use to address pressing social concerns and
needs. By doing so, this research carried with it a far-reaching implication for the future
of museums. The study illustrated that by diversifying their audiences to include
communities with special needs museums can not only benefit those communities but
also erase negative perceptions of exclusion, increase attendance, and bring new meaning
to a cultural experience.
In the current economic reality, engaging communities that have previously been
marginalized is a challenging task for museums but, as the CMA access program
demonstrated, it can be done through partnerships, effective leadership, and
organizational commitment. It became obvious that reaching out to new and diverse
audiences requires that museums do something bold, innovative, and different from what
they have done before. However, the benefits are far greater than the risks and
uncertainties. Access programs propel museums to become active, visible players in civic

123

life and trusted agents of change in society. Caring has always been an integral part of the
museum’s mission. Historically, museums have cared for collections and artifacts.
Therefore, there should be nothing to prevent them from caring for their visitors and their
entire communities.
By narrating the story of a successful access program, the researcher made a
compelling argument that museums should fully immerse themselves in addressing
important issues of inclusion and social unity. If museums fail to recognize this need and
act accordingly, they run the risk of alienating audiences with special needs, a growing
segment of the population. As Long (2013) observed, if there are no communities to visit,
share their lives, and engage with a museum, there will be no future for the museum.
The study has significant practical implications for different organizations and
individuals working with museums and autistic communities. First, it will be useful for
museum educators interested in designing effective museum education programs for
special needs children. Program staff in other museums may leverage similar assessment
strategies and tools to better gauge the impact of their programming on the visitors they
target. The implication for museum administrators is that the study provided insights into
ways to set strategic priorities, provide efficient leadership, develop collaboration,
allocate resources, and re-affirm the value of the museum in the eyes of its service
communities and other vital stakeholders. Second, cultural heritage consultants will find
the findings of this study helpful in supporting their recommendations to other cultural
institutions on the ways to design better cultural, educational, and social experience for
special needs community. Third, the study is important for various program staff in other
types of cultural institutions besides museums, such as zoos, aquariums, or parks. The

124

example of the CMA access program demonstrates that any work for special needs
populations is worthwhile; therefore, other cultural institutions should continue and
expand their efforts in this area.
Fourth, this research has impact for education in general and particularly for
special education teachers because students who can enhance their learning in alternative
settings are likely to do better when they return to their classroom. Teachers who
understand the value of the museum as an educational setting will be more motivated to
bring their special needs students to cultural institutions and experience learning in those
unconventional environments. Fifth, the study is valuable for researchers and scholars
who focus on Autism Spectrum Disorder. The study findings have proved that cultural
intervention, understood as the museum experience, is another effective way to address
some of the key challenges of autism. Therefore, the study posits that participation in
museum activities, and learning in cultural institutions in general, may be a great
supplement to traditional therapies for autism. Sixth, software designers and creators of
online learning tools for children with autism will also benefit from this study because it
provides a vivid picture of how these children learn, interact, and grow as individuals in
cultural and recreational settings. Therefore, educational and behavioral software
developers will be able to integrate this knowledge and make their products better
address the real needs of autistic children.
Lastly, the study had clear-cut benefits for the participating families, and it will
benefit other families with autistic children as well, by demonstrating ways in which
these children can be integrated into social and cultural mainstream and take advantage of
the wide variety of opportunities available to them. In other words, the study has

125

implications for the entire autism community by showing that autistic children who
experience cultural events do better both cognitively and socially.
5.4 Limitations of the Study
There are several limitations to the current study that need to be acknowledged.
The first one pertains to its scope since only ten families were selected for participation in
the CMA access program. Due to the limited demographics of the study, it is not possible
to generalize the results to other types of cultural institutions or to other children with
autism. Nevertheless, it was a meaningful experience between the researcher and the
study participants. The second limitation is related to the length of the program. Due to
the feasibility and timing concerns, the museum was not able to offer the program for
longer than six weeks, which would have been desirable for this type of study. A longer
intervention would have allowed the researcher to collect richer and more consistent data.
Additionally, the program schedule presented another limitation. Offering the
program on weekends would have made it possible for more families to participate, thus
increasing the number of the study subjects. The fourth limitation was the number of
graduate student observers. Due to the feasibility limitations, each observer had to
observe five children at a time. Increasing the number of observers could have ensured a
better representation of each participant’s behavior. However, data triangulation
techniques employed in the study provided ample data to fully address the research
problem of the study.
Lastly, the study focused on the museum access program as the principal
independent variable to affect the learning and behaviors of the autistic children.

126

Although the parents were instructed to keep this consideration in mind when they
provided responses, there were other intervening variables outside the museum setting
such as art classes at school, private art lessons, language development therapy, as well as
other social or family events, that could have affected the children’s learning and
behaviors during the museum program.
5.5 Future Research
The results of the current exploration suggest several directions for future
research. In future studies, it may be interesting to investigate in other settings the impact
of cultural experience on cognitive gains and behavior changes of children on the autism
spectrum. Therefore, the first line of future research proposes studying special
programming initiatives not only in art museums but also in other cultural institutions,
including science and children’s museums, as well as zoos and aquaria. The second
future direction centers on a subsequent longitudinal study involving a larger number of
subjects. The intent of this longitudinal study is to further test how the experience autistic
children gain in cultural institutions improves their learning and social skills and changes
their behaviors over time.
Thirdly, it may be valuable to pair autistic children with typical peers as more
research is warranted to investigate the effect of peer interaction on autistic children’s
academic growth, social development, and cultural participation. Fourthly, this study
underscored the need to design evaluation mechanisms to consistently assess and
quantify the impact of the cultural experience on enhancing the overall quality of life of
visitors with special needs. This can be achieved by applying and testing the assessment
tools used for the current study in other programs. The overarching goal of the future
127

research agenda is to establish a model of cultural intervention that would enable special
needs populations to fully benefit from a wide range of education and outreach
opportunities offered by cultural institutions.
5.6 Conclusions
This study was rooted in the belief that cultural heritage institutions, such as art
museums, have untapped potential to act as instruments for promoting the ideas of
diversity, equality, and inclusion. It addressed the broad issues of civic development and
accessibility of human culture to increasingly diverse communities served by
contemporary museums.
The research aimed to raise awareness of the need for greater community and
public engagement in social justice initiatives. Its overall intention was to challenge
museums and other learning institutions to better connect to their service communities
and address the nationally-recognized urge for expanding the range of educational,
recreational, and cultural offerings for special needs communities. This research
represented an effort to quantify the value of cultural institutions and promote the view of
museums as safe environments for lifelong learning open to visitors of all abilities. In all,
this study was a step toward grasping the capacity of cultural institutions to reach out to
users who have long been marginalized.
The study showed that participation in cultural and recreational events is
associated with stimulating curiosity, enhancing knowledge, as well as developing
confidence and a sense of self, thereby suggesting that cultural intervention can assist
autistic children in the core areas of autism. These areas include learning through

128

socialization, joining play opportunities, and participating in collaborative activities with
peers and parents. The impact of the six-week CMA program was fully scaffolded by the
study outcomes, vividly summarized by the participating parents. Their comments
attested to the fact that the program succeeded in unleashing the children’s creative
power and talents that would have otherwise remained hidden behind the inhibitions of
autism. The program dedicated to children on the spectrum played a key role in
expanding their minds, opening them to different social and cultural opportunities, along
with helping them to learn better. Overall, the unique cultural program at the Columbia
Museum of Art benefited the children by reinforcing both their knowledge and their
social experience.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that museums as institutions of public
learning can make a difference in the lives of families affected by autism. This research
contributed to furthering a culture shift within the museum community toward greater
access and inclusion. Above everything else, despite its focus on the museum experience
of a group of autistic children, the main lesson of the study is that increasing accessibility
for differently-abled people increases accessibility for all.

INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN A RESEARCH STUDY

142

Invitation to Participate in a Research Study
February 20, 2015
Dear Families,
My name is Liya Deng. I am a doctoral candidate and Cultural Heritage Informatics
Leadership Fellow in the School of Library and Information Science at the University of
South Carolina. I am conducting a research study as part of the requirements of my
doctoral degree in Library and Information Science, and I would like to invite you to
participate.
My research project is about how the museum experience influences learning and
behaviors in children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The purpose of
my study is to demonstrate that museums can provide a positive learning and cultural
experience for children with ASD and can enhance their learning, independence, and
social communication skills.
You will be asked to complete a brief initial screening form that will determine your
eligibility to participate in this research project. It will take you approximately 3-5
minutes to complete the screening form. After reviewing the form, I will contact you if
you are eligible to participate in the project.
If you are selected to be study subjects, you and your child will be invited to participate
in a series of six FREE visits to the Columbia Museum of Art (CMA) during the time
between April 13 and May 20, 2015. The six-week Art and Autism program is designed
by museum experienced educators to tailor to the needs of autistic children. You and your
child will visit the CMA in a group of eight families with high-functioning autistic
children. Each visit will last approximately two hours and consist of a guided gallery tour
and a hands-on art-making activity in the museum art studio. Each visit will have a
different theme, such as animals, warm and cool colors, shapes, still life, landscape, etc.
to create diverse and entertaining experiences for the children.
The exact times and dates of the visits will be determined at a later point, based on the
museum staff and participant availability. To accommodate your child’s needs, a
designated quiet room will be available at the Museum so that the children can have a
down time if necessary.

143

Before the first museum visit, you will be asked to complete a scale to evaluate the level
of your child’s social interaction and communication skills. This scale should take you
about 15-20 minutes to complete. After the last museum visit, you will be asked to rate
the same scale to help determine the improvement in your child’s social interaction and
communication behaviors.
Before the first museum visit, you will be asked to fill in a brief pre-program survey that
will address your motivations and expectations for visiting the museum. After the last
museum visit, you will be asked to fill in a post-program survey. The survey will also ask
you what you think about the overall influence of the museum experience on your child.
During each of the six museum visits, your child’s behavior will be observed and video
recorded as he/she interacts with art, the museum instructors, and peers. The museum
instructors will keep the children engaged by asking them questions to ensure proper
understanding of the content throughout the visits.
I assure you that your child’s participation in this project will remain confidential. The
survey results, observation notes, video files, and other information I may obtain will
only be used by me to complete my doctoral dissertation. Results of the study may be
published or presented at professional meetings, but your and your child’s identity will
not be disclosed. There are no foreseen physical or emotional risks from participating in
this study.
Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. There will be no additional costs
to you if you decide to participate. Your child will benefit from exposure to art and
unique hands-on learning environment provided by the museum. Your participation in
this research may help CMA build a sustainable access program with long-term benefits
for visitors with special needs in the greater Midlands community.
I will be happy to answer any questions or concerns you may have about this study at any
point. You may contact me at (478) 538-3265 or by email at dengl@email.sc.edu. You
may also contact my faculty advisor, Dr. Samantha K. Hastings of the University of
South Carolina School of Library and Information Science, at shasting@mailbox.sc.edu.
Thank you for your consideration.

CONSENT FORM
Equity of Access to Cultural Heritage: The Influence of Museum Experience on Learning
in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders
Liya Deng
You and your child are invited to participate in a study on the influence of the museum
experience on learning and behaviors of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum
Disorders. My name is Liya Deng and I am a PhD student and Cultural Heritage Fellow
at The University of South Carolina (USC), Department of School of Library and
Information Science. This study is part of the requirements of my degree. This form
explains what you and your child will be asked to do if you decide to participate in this
study.
The goal of this study is to better understand the value of the museum experience for
children with special needs. I expect to have sixteen participants in the study. If you
allow your child to participate, you will be asked to take part in six visits to the Columbia
Museum of Art (CMA) in spring 2015. Each visit will last approximately two hours and
consist of a guided gallery tour and a hands-on art-making activity in the museum art
studio. During the museum visits, your child’s behavior will be observed and video
recorded as he/she interacts with art, the museum instructors, and peers. Both observation
notes and video recordings will be securely stored in a locked location.
You will be asked to complete a scale to evaluate the level of your child’s social
interaction and communication skills in the beginning of the museum program. You will
complete the scale again to determine the improvement after the last museum visit. The
scale should take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. In addition, you will be
asked to fill in a brief survey that will address your motivations and expectations for
visiting the museum. The survey will also ask you what you think about the influence of
the museum experience on your child after the last visit takes place. The survey should
take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete.
There are no foreseen risks associated with participating in this study. You and your child
will benefit from exposure to the cultural heritage provided by the museum. Your child’s

149

participation may also help better understand the effectiveness of the museum as a
learning and educational institution for children with special needs.
Participation in this study is voluntary. You are free not to participate or to withdraw at
any time without any penalty. Any information that is obtained in connection with this
study and that can be identified with you and your child will remain confidential and will
be disclosed only with your permission. Your responses will not be linked to your child’s
name or your name in any written or verbal report of this research project. There will be
no costs to you for participating in this study, other than for any parking or gas expenses
you may have.
This research study has been reviewed and approved by the University of South Carolina
Institutional Review Board (IRB). If you have any questions about your rights in this
research study, you may contact Thomas Coggins, Director of the Office of Research
Compliance, at tcoggins@mailbox.sc.edu or (803) 777-7095.
If you have any questions regarding this study, please contact Liya Deng at (478) 5383265 or by email at dengl@email.sc.edu. You may also contact my Faculty Advisor, Dr.
Samantha K. Hastings of the USC School of Library and Information Science, at
shasting@mailbox.sc.edu.
You may keep a copy of this consent form. You are making a decision about allowing
your child to participate in this study. Your signature below indicates that you have read
