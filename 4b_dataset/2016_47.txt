ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank the members of my dissertation committee for their support and
guidance throughout this process. First and foremost, I would like to thank my committee chair,
Dr. Linda Spatig. You pushed me to work harder, and write more, than I ever thought I could.
And you stuck by me, and your other students, even after you retired. You will always be an
inspiration to me and I hope to lead and nurture my students the same way that you have led and
nurtured us.
I would also like to thank Dr. Monica Garcia Brooks who has been a friend and mentor to
me for many years. Her guidance and respect means the world to me. Without her support and
words of wisdom I would not have undertaken this challenge, let alone have completed it.
Dr. Watts was one of my first instructors in the program. I value his enthusiasm and
knowledge and thank him for his thoughtfulness and commitment to developing leadership skills
in his students.
I would like to thank Dr. Lassiter for his patience with me as a writing student and for his
guidance in class. He instilled in me the feeling that I was capable of writing for publication.
I want to thank my daughter, Jamila Jones, and my daughter, son-in-law and grandson,
Britny, Jason, and Cameron Maynard, for their love and laughter. Thank you Troy Cochran for
your support and for putting up with my "dissertation brain". I want to thank my extended

ABSTRACT
The library profession as a whole is predominantly white with a large discrepancy
between the percentage of minorities in the United States in general and the percentage of
professional librarians who are minorities. Despite past recruitment efforts, there remains a
dearth of minority librarians in higher education and the reasons for this remain unclear. The
purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate minority librarian experiences in higher
education and their perceptions of supports and barriers encountered in becoming and being
professional librarians. Five themes emerged from the data. The first theme pertained to the
spirit of service and activism which was a significant characteristic of all nine interviewees.
Theme two showed how mentoring and networking was an important part of the experience of
becoming and being an academic librarian. The third theme, microaggressions, showed the
prevalence of the daily injustices that minority librarians in higher education often experience.
Theme four pertained to the educational and work environments the informants experienced
namely predominantly white institutions (PWIs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs), and Tribal College and Universities (TCUs). The fifth theme showed how most of the
interviewees were “natural born librarians” characterized by the love of libraries and reading.
The findings provide new evidence into the experiences and perceptions of minority librarians
and will assist library schools in developing programming and curriculum pertinent to librarians
of color, assist administration in higher education, particularly in academic libraries, to create
environments more conducive to attracting minority librarians, and assist professional library
organizations in developing and improving programming designed to increase the ranks of
minority librarians in higher education.

Chapter One
Introduction to the Study
A 2009-2010 American Library Association (ALA) survey (2011) indicates that only
12.1% of professional credentialed librarians in the United States are ethnic minorities which is
in stark contrast to U.S. Census data (2011) which reports that 24.9% of the population is not
white. Of the 14,274 non-white librarians who were credentialed (in possession of an earned
Master of Library Science, MLS) in 2010, 6,160 were African American, 3,260 were
Asian/Pacific Islander, 185 were Native American (including Alaskan), 3,661 were Latino, and
1,008 identified as being of two or more races (see figure 1)(ALA, 2011). Further, women
outnumber men 98,273 to 20,393 (ALA, 2011). Librarianship is an overwhelmingly white,
female profession.

Academic libraries in particular fare somewhat worse than other types of libraries. A
2007 study by Davis and Hall for the ALA found that, in 2000, white librarians accounted for
85% of professional academic librarians compared to African Americans, at 5% of the total, and
Latinos at 2%. White staff members, non-MLS library employees, in academic libraries made
up 71% of total staff while African Americans comprised 11% and Latinos 7%. Proportions of
white librarians to white staff as compared to minority librarians and minority staff are skewed
reinforcing what Hall (2012) refers to as the “racialized constructions of intellectual superiority
and inferiority.” Hall is referring to the long held belief in the intellectual superiority of whites,
what Solórzano and Yosso (2009) call biological and cultural deficit models. In essence, the
idea is that whites are more suited for a professional capacity in the library while minorities are
more suited for support staff positions.
According to the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES), in 2012 whites
accounted for just over 60% of the 20.6 million undergraduate students enrolled in degree
granting institutions (2013). NCES also reports that African Americans account for 14.9%,
Hispanic 15%, Asian/Pacific Islanders (API) 6.3%, and Native American .9% of total student
population. NCES has recently started collecting data about individuals of two or more races:
these individuals account for 2.5% of the total number of students enrolled in higher education
institutions. Comparing these numbers to the numbers of minority librarians in higher education
shows a distinct disparity (see figure 2).

Figure 2 Data taken from ALA and NCES
Librarians and libraries in the United States have a long history of working for social
justice. In 1950, Ruth Brown was fired from the Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Public Library as the
result of her advocating for integration (Robbins, 2000). In the 1960s, U.S. librarians were at the
forefront of the civil rights movement. According to the noted librarian E.J. Josey (1987), black
librarians in the South were not only victims of discrimination at work but they were also
excluded from state professional organizations. In contrast, the American Library Association
(ALA) took a stand on racial discrimination in 1936 when their annual conference was held in
Richmond, Virginia. Though the conference venue stressed that blacks were not to be included,
ALA formed a Committee on Racial Discrimination that declared that any conference area under
ALA’s control would be open to attendees impartially. Librarians in the 1960s also worked to
end the war, create equal opportunity for women, and champion intellectual freedom. With this

3

history of advocating against segregation and social injustice, why does the profession remain so
monochromatic?
Academic Libraries
In librarianship, libraries are categorized according to mission and population served.
Academic libraries are the libraries of higher education which support the research needs of the
students, faculty, and staff in colleges and universities. According to the American Library
Association (2015) there are 3,793 academic libraries in the United States employing over
24,000 librarians (United States Department of Labor, 2015). The average salary for academic
librarians is $53,000 (American Library Association, 2015).
Academic libraries developed as higher education evolved beginning with John
Harvard’s donation of over 300 books to Harvard University in 1638 (Weiner, 2005). The first
college libraries were just rooms of books in a college building or chapel. Before the
implementation of the Dewey Decimal System in 1876, there was no formal classification
scheme for books; books were organized by author, by donor, and even by color or size (Weiner,
2005). The focus of these early academic libraries was more on collecting, preserving and
protecting books rather than sharing them.
As colleges and universities evolved, as scholarship and publishing evolved, so did
libraries. By the end of the nineteenth century, the focus of academic libraries changed from
preservation to accessibility and libraries became more integrated into the university. Books and
other materials were organized using either the Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress
Classification system. Weiner writes that by the 1940s, libraries had reference departments
designed to guide and instruct library patrons (2005). The societal changes that occurred after
the Second World War also affected academic libraries. Research and publishing opportunities
4

increased. The student body increased and diversified. And technology evolved at an amazing
rate. Academic libraries and librarians met all of these changes head on. These changes,
coupled with dwindling economic resources, have led some to “question the role and function of
the traditional library,” however academic libraries in the United States have always been able to
evolve as the result of “external influences” (Weiner, 2005).
The Function of Academic Libraries
Academic libraries exist to support the research needs of students, faculty, and staff on
campus and must therefore continually adapt to external and internal changes. Academic
libraries have mission statements that reflect these goals. For example, the mission statement for
Marshall University Libraries (n.d.) reads as follows:
The Marshall University Libraries support the teaching, research and public service
commitments of the University. To fulfill this responsibility, the libraries acquire,
organize, maintain, and preserve materials in all appropriate formats. They also provide
access and delivery of information, resources and services.
Marshall University Libraries’ mission statement also aligns with the University’s mission
statement as well as with standards set forth by national organizations such as the American
Library Association’s Code of Ethics statement. ALA’s Code of Ethics statement urges
librarians to provide high level service to all, to “treat co-workers and colleagues with respect,
fairness, and good faith,” and to “distinguish between personal convictions and professional
duties” (2008). This Code of Ethics, originally adopted at ALA’s 1939 Midwinter Meeting and
updated several times over the years, foreshadowed the activism that played a large role in
libraries and with librarians in the 1960s.

5

It is interesting to note that the first principle listed in the Code of Ethics has to do with
service. Librarianship is a service profession. The Department of Labor published a
comprehensive list of job activities that librarians perform:
Tasks may include selecting, acquiring, cataloguing, classifying, circulating, and
maintaining library materials; and furnishing reference, bibliographical, and readers'
advisory services. May perform in-depth, strategic research, and synthesize, analyze, edit,
and filter information. May set up or work with databases and information systems to
catalogue and access information (United States Department of Labor, 2015).
This list is certainly not conclusive and most librarians will not perform all of these functions.
Librarians perform a variety of tasks dependent on the type of library they work in and which
library department they are located. In general, academic libraries have at least two
components—public services and technical services. Many college and university libraries also
have Special Collections Departments and Government Documents Departments. Larger
universities may have multiple libraries across multiple campuses. Some libraries are
specialized and function to support specific disciplines, populations, or areas of interest.
Academic Librarians
To perform the duties required to successfully run college and university libraries in all of
their incarnations, academic libraries require trained employees commonly consisting of
librarians and library staff members. Library staff members may or may not have higher
education degrees but academic librarians hold Masters’ in Library Science degrees (MLS) from
ALA accredited library schools. There are 50 ALA accredited library schools in the United
States (one of which is conditional as of the writing of this paper), one school in Puerto Rico, and
seven in Canada, and 2 U.S. schools in candidacy status (seeking ALA accreditation as of the

6

writing of this paper). In 2009, the American Library Association approved and adopted a
statement of “Core Competencies of Librarianship” that address the “basic knowledge” that
librarians should have as library school graduates. Librarians should have knowledge in
foundations of the profession; knowledge of information resources; organizational and technical
knowledge and skills; research, reference and instruction skills; lifelong learning; and,
administration and management.
In most cases, academic libraries hire librarians who hold an MLS from an ALA
accredited library school. One exception is the hiring of library students as Graduate Assistants.
Graduate Assistants perform many of the same duties as a professional librarian while gaining
experience in a library setting. Graduate Assistantships are scarce in these lean financial times
and are awarded to the most competent and capable students.
Relevant Literature and Key Issues
The focus of this study is racial diversity in education, specifically in higher education
librarianship. The push for multicultural sensitivity in education was the byproduct of the social
and cultural changes of the 1960s and 1970s. However, while the population of the United
States grew increasingly diverse, the teaching profession remained characteristically white
(Bireda & Chait, 2011; Cochran-Smith, 1995; Ingersoll & May, 2011; Ingersoll & Merrill, 2012;
Villegas, Strom, & Lucas, 2012). As a result, many teacher education programs began to require
their students to take a class in multicultural issues and many studies have focused on teaching
multicultural awareness and creating “white allies” (Cochran-Smith, 1995). Cochran-Smith
(1995) takes the discussion a step further and calls these teachers “uncertain allies” – white
teachers who struggle to find the balance between being an ally to their ethnically and culturally
diverse students and their uncertainty regarding race and ethnicity. Ten years later, this was still

7

a concern. As Colombo (2005) noted, “cultural mismatch between teachers and the children they
teach can result in uncomfortable classroom experiences” and “teachers who share their students’
cultures can minimize some of the differences between home and school” (p.1).
That is not to say that a teacher of one race cannot connect with students of other races,
ethnicities, and cultures and help them succeed; however, research shows that having a teacher
who shares a racial, ethnic or cultural background with students is one of several ways to help
students succeed (Dee, 2004; Dee, 2005; Hagedorn, Chi, Cepeda, & McLain, 2006; Marin, 2000;
Paloma, 2014; Robinson, Byrd, Louis, & Bonner, 2013). Studies also have shown that students
feel more comfortable with mentors of the same race or in classrooms where the environment is
similar to their cultural background with a teacher of the same race or a preponderance of
students of the same race (Crisp, Taggart, & Nora, 2014; Howard, 2001; Irvine & Fenwick,
2011; Johnson, Crosnoe, & Elder, Jr., 2001; Milner, 2006; Moore et al, 2014; Saenz & Ponjuan,
2011; Watson et al, 2002). The literature shows lack of teachers of color in education at all
levels. When people of color do pursue careers in education, when they seek faculty positions or
advancement in higher education, they must face various barriers (American Council on
Education, 2013; Delgado-Romero, Flores, Gloria, Arredondo, & Castellanos, 2003; Pittman,
2012; Sue & Sue, 2003; Sue, Bucceri, Lin, Nadal, & Torino, 2007; Verdugo, 2003).
With academic librarians, the picture is quite similar to that of teachers in higher
education. Diversity is a desirable quality (Andrade & Rivera, 2011; Bonnet & McAlexander,
2012; Buttlar & Canyon, 1992; Chu, 1999; Jaeger & Franklin, 2007; Jaeger, Sarin, & Peterson,
2015; Josey & Abdullahi, 2002; Morales, Knowles & Bourg, 2014; Ortega & Ramos, 2011;
Subramaniam & Jaeger, 2010). However the multicultural, multiethnic staff in higher education
librarianship remains elusive (Andrade & Rivera, 2011; Buttlar & Canyon, 1992, Damasco &
8

Hodges, 2012; Davis & Hall, 2007; Hussey, 2009; Josey & Abdullahi, 2002; Kim, 2009; Love,
2001; Morales, Knowles, E.C., & Bourg, C., 2014; Ortega & Ramos, 2011; Thurston, A., 2012).
Problem Statement and Research Purpose
The library profession as a whole is predominantly white with a large discrepancy
between the percentage of minorities in the United States in general and the percentage of
professional librarians who are minorities. Despite past recruitment efforts, there remains a
dearth of minority librarians in higher education and the reasons for this remain unclear. Further,
we know that minority students respond to minority mentors and teachers. Additional minority
academic librarians in higher education would benefit students as well as minority librarians.
Thus the shortage of minority librarians in higher education is a problem for both minority
students and librarians. The purpose of this study is to investigate minority librarian experiences
in higher education and their perceptions of supports and barriers encountered in becoming and
being professional librarians. Present and future library leaders will be able to use the
information gathered in this study to address the issue of the lack of librarians of color in higher
education.
Research Questions
1. What supports and barriers have minorities experienced in becoming and working as
academic librarians?
2. What perceptions do minority librarians have about being minority librarians and
their contributions, if any, to campus diversity?
3. What factors do minority librarians perceive contribute to the small number of
minority academic librarians?

9

Context and Conceptual Framework
Glesne (2011) writes that ethnography means describing a cultural group (p.17).
According to Bogdan and Biklen (2007), phenomenological research seeks to find the meanings
that people ascribe to the events and interactions in their lives. In this study I concentrate on
minority librarians as the cultural group and determine their perceptions of the circumstances
they experience as professional minority librarians. I use a phenomenological, ethnographic
approach paired with a critical race theoretical framework. This approach can also be termed
critical ethnography which, as explained by Madison (2005), “begins with an ethical
responsibility to address processes of unfairness or injustice within a particular lived domain”
(p.5). As Milner writes, from a critical race theory perspective “knowledge can and should be
generated through narratives and counter-narratives that emerge from and with people of color”
(2012, p.28).
Before describing critical race theory, I will pause to define the terms racism and
institutional racism. For the purposes of this paper, racism is defined as the belief that a person
or group of persons is inherently superior or inherently inferior because of their
culture. Institutional racism refers to oppressive activities and patterns within systems and
institutions. For example, when a person of color goes to college then looks around to find that
all of the buildings are named after whites. Another example is the increased likelihood of being
pulled over by a traffic officer if you have brown skin. According to Nesbit (2015), blacks are
“three times more likely to be searched at a traffic stop.”
Delgado and Stefancic (2012) define critical race theory (CRT) as a movement of “a
collection of activists and scholars interested in studying and transforming the relationship
between race, racism, and power” (p.3). Critical race theory developed in the 1970s in response
10

to what some legal scholars felt was a stasis in the civil rights movement. In the 40 years since
its conception, CRT has spread to the field of education, among others, and has yielded
subgroups focused on queer, Asian American, and Latino critical studies.
CRT has, in general, a few basic precepts that guide or shape the theory. First, racism is
viewed as a normal occurrence rather than an abnormal one. Second, interest convergence, also
called material determinism, exists (Delgado & Stefancic, 2012). This means that whites have
little interest in addressing or ending racism because it benefits the white majority both
materially and psychologically. Third, race is not a scientific fact but rather a social construct
developed to explain human variation (Kosek, 2009; Delgado & Stefancic, 2012; Goodman,
Moses, & Jones, 2012) though racism is in fact a reality (Kosek, 2009; Delgado & Stefancic,
2012; Goodman, Moses, & Jones, 2012; Parker, 2015). The fourth tenet is the concept of
differentiated racism which occurs when different groups are marginalized at different times as
the result of economic factors (Delgado & Stefancic, 2012). Fifth, because each person is an
amalgam, CRT recognizes intersectionality—a term introduced by critical legal theorists to refer
to the specific conditions that exist when one holds two or more social statuses (Deaux, 2001).
For example, someone could be a Hispanic woman Democrat. And finally, due to their own
minority status, minorities are inherently able to speak on the subject of race and racism
(Delgado & Stefancic, 2012).
Critical race theory is an appropriate lens for this study. It allows for the examination,
understanding, and explanation of the lack of minority librarians in higher education through the
words and experiences of minority librarians and thus provide a means to disrupt “the causes of
structural domination and inequality” (Kumasi, 2012, p.34).

11

Research Methods
This is a qualitative study. Qualitative methods have been used in educational research
for many years and have also been applied to questions in library science (Wildemuth, 2009).
The nature of qualitative research – naturalistic, involves descriptive data, concern with process,
inductive, and making meaning is of essential concern – lends itself to research in education and
information science; further, many qualitative researchers are drawn to the ability of qualitative
methods to tell the stories of people who have been voiceless (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007).
Qualitative methods are suited to research regarding critical race theory for the same reason.
Inductive reasoning is defined by Glesne (2011) as “reasoning that moves from the
specific or concrete to the general or abstract” (p. 281). Maxwell (2013) suggests a five
component, interactive model for proposing inductive inquiry. The components are goals,
conceptual framework, research questions, methods, and validity. Goals for the study, the
conceptual framework, and the research questions were addressed earlier in this chapter.
Research methods include researcher/informant relationship, site and subject selection, methods,
and data analysis strategies and techniques.
Researcher/Informant Relationships
Establishing good relationships with informants is very important to successful
qualitative research and Glesne (2011) suggests several important concepts to remember as
researchers. I studied minority librarians in higher education and because I am also a minority
librarian, establishing rapport came naturally and hopefully effortlessly. However, as Glesne
notes, rapport does not automatically ensure trust. As I interviewed the librarians and as they
gained insight into my character, I believe that trust was built in our researcher/informant

12

relationship. I also believe that I successfully fit in. Having worked in higher education for
many years, I am comfortable in that environment.
Participant Selection
Informants for this study are minority librarians in higher education. These informants
are soon to be credentialed or already credentialed (holding MLS degrees) minority librarians. I
interviewed 9 individuals including 8 librarians and 1 library student. Because none of these
librarians were nearby or within reasonable travel distance, I conducted interviews by phone and
followed up via email.
I am a member of several professional librarian organizations including the West Virginia
Library Association (WVLA), the American Library Association (ALA), the Black Caucus of
the American Library Association (BCALA), and the Association of Research and College
Libraries (ACRL). I identified informants through these organizations, more specifically,
through use of their listservs. Several of these organizations are national which enabled me to
contact librarians in multiple geographic areas.
Data Collection
Data were collected through semi-structured, ethnographic, interviews with informants, a
method that is widely used in qualitative inquiry. Interviews were conducted by phone. Any
follow-up for clarification and/or respondent validation (member checks) were conducted via
email due to time and distance constraints. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed.
After transcription, as required by Marshall University’s Office of Research Integrity, recordings
were destroyed.

13

As Glesne (2001) reminds us, “interviewing is a complex act” (p.118). And when
interviewing with an eye toward critical race theory and giving voice to informants who may
have previously felt voiceless, I endeavored to be fully present in the interviews – listening and
observing intently with my research purposes in mind.
Analysis Procedures
Due to the need for continual reevaluation that is the norm with qualitative research,
analysis begins in some form with the commencement of data collection. Of course analysis is
not the main focus of the data collection phase but rather an area of concern that can be
addressed in field notes and a reflective journal. Since I was able to be reflective as I collected
data it served to “free (my) mind for new thoughts and perspectives” (Glesne, 2011). As data
collection ended, I engaged in formal analysis beginning with the assignment of code words,
followed by the identification of patterns, categories, or themes (Patton, 2002). Inductive
analysis enabled me to identify emergent patterns in the data and included the employment of an
open coding technique that allowed me to remain open to the data (Patton, 2002). Glesne (2011)
refers to this practice as thematic analysis which she states should not simply identify what is
readily apparent or normal but should go further and dig into underlying issues and deviations
from the norm.
Validity
In research, validity refers to the trustworthiness of the study, the accuracy of the results,
and the assurance that the instrument measures what it was designed to measure (Patton, 2002;
Glesne, 2011; Maxwell, 2012). Validity is of utmost importance in establishing research rigor
and must be specifically addressed. Qualitative research is no different.

According to Marshall and Rossman, the choice of using qualitative techniques often
stems from the researcher’s “real-world observations, emerging from the interplay of the
researcher’s direct experience, tacit theories, political commitments , interests in practice, and
growing scholarly interests” (1999, p.25). As a librarian of color in higher education, I was
struck by the low numbers of librarians of color in academe. Potential biases could have posed a
potential threat to the study. However, prior research into minorities in librarianship has been
done by monitory librarians without loss of credibility and was no different for me.
Maxwell (2013) identifies two key threats to validity in qualitative research: researcher
bias and reactivity. If bias is not controlled during research, we may not be getting the true
information. To address potential bias in this study, I incorporated reflexivity, or critical
reflection activities, to strengthen the study by allowing me to examine and address personal bias
that could be present. Glesne (2011) emphasized self-inquiry to know oneself and one’s
personal views and perspectives and to acknowledge theoretical and personal attachments. I
constantly took the reflexive stance which, according to Glesne, “involves critical reflection on
how researcher, research participants, setting and research procedures interact and influence each
other” (2011, p. 151).
Whereas addressing bias in research can control for the researcher’s subjectivity,
addressing reactivity can control for the reactions of research subjects to the researcher.
Avoiding leading questions is one way I attended to reactivity. As with addressing personal bias,
I was constantly reflexive in order to understand how reactivity may affect the study.
Conclusion
Cornell West, in his bestselling 1994 work Race Matters, tells us that “to engage in a
serious discussion of race in America, we must begin not with the problems of black people but
15

with the flaws of American society – flaws rooted in historic inequalities and longstanding
cultural stereotypes” (p.6). The same could be said of higher education and academic libraries.
This study attempts to get to the root of the reason or reasons why there are so few minority
librarians in higher education by exploring not only the impressions that minority librarians have
formed as they entered and practiced in the profession but how they perceive the institution of
the academic library in the United States. Library leaders and administrators will be able to use
the findings to undertake the question of why there is a lack of minority librarians in higher
education.

Chapter 2
Literature Review
This chapter presents the literature review for this study. The key issues include racial
diversity in education and specifically diversity in higher education and higher education
librarianship. There is a long history of racism in education in the United States which cannot be
fully addressed here. However, in the 1950s and 1960s in the United States, racial minorities
began to demand their equal rights in many areas including education. Several legal actions in
those decades, such as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), opened the
door to balancing the educational scales for minorities.
Diversity in Education
Despite the desegregation of schools that began in the 1960s as the result of Brown v.
Board of Education of Topeka in 1954 and other legal battles, school systems in the United
States have begun to re-segregate even as the numbers of minority students enrolled steadily
increases (Orfield, Frankenberg, & Lee, 2002). Orfield, Frankenberg, and Lee reviewed data
from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau, to come to this conclusion (2002).
And various researchers have stated that there was never a game changing surge in the minority
teacher population (Bireda & Chait, 2011; Ingersoll & May, 2011; Ingersoll & Merrill, 2012;
Villegas, Strom, & Lucas, 2012). Ingersoll and May (2011) analyzed data from the National
Center for Education Statistics. This analysis found that there was an upturn in recruitment of
teachers of color, however there remains a gap between the percentage of minority teachers and
the percentage of minority students due to the rapidly diversifying population in the United
States and, interestingly, the inability to retain teachers of color. In 2012, Ingersoll and Merrill
looked at additional data about teacher trends and demographics in the United States. Their
17

review solidified the findings of Ingersoll and May in 2011. Villegas, Strom and Lucas (2012)
also analyzed national teacher demographic data in addition to state policies promoting teacher
diversity. Similar to the findings of Ingersoll and May and Ingersoll and Merrill, Villegas, Strom
and Lucas found that there was an increase in the diversity of the teaching population but that
white teachers continued to be over-represented between the years 1987 and 2007 (2012). The
teaching profession, much as the ranks of public and academic librarians, has remained
staggeringly white.
At the same time, for many years African American students have been ignored and
reprimanded to a greater degree than their white counterparts (Casteel, 1998; Fenning & Rose,
2007; Shirley& Cornell, 2012; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights, 2014).
Casteel’s empirical, observational study of eight 7th grade classrooms found that white teachers
directed fewer process question and offered less praise to black students than to white students
(1998). White teachers offered white students more clues to correct answers (Casteel, 1998). A
review of several qualitative research studies highlights the “general targeting of those who do
not fit into the school norms (e.g. poor students of color with academic problems)” (Fenning &
Rose, 2007, p. 546).
Shirley and Cornell also studied middle school students (2012). Their analyses of a
school climate survey and school discipline records indicated that African American students
were more likely to be disciplined and suspended than their white counterparts. Several reports
by the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (2014) detail statistics for
the 2010-2011 school year that bolster the argument that the majority white ranks of teachers
hold negative racial stereotypes. Issue Brief Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 (2014) list very telling statistics
regarding the schooling experiences of minority students in the U.S. today:
18

•

Blacks are suspended and expelled three times more often than white students;

•

Black girls are suspended more than girls of any other race;

•

Black students are referred to law enforcement at a proportionately higher rate
than white students;

•

Native-Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, American Indian and Native-Alaskan
kindergarten students are held back almost twice as much as white students;

•

Higher percentages of schools serving predominantly minority students offer
fewer math and science courses than majority white schools; some offer only one
of the core math and science courses;

•

Black, Latino, American Indian and Native-Alaskan students are enrolled in
schools with a higher percentage of first year teachers than their white
counterparts.

Twenty-five years ago, Casteel’s (1998) research found that the difference between the
way white teachers treated white students and the way they treated African American students
was substantial. In addition, white students were more likely to raise their hand in class than
were African Americans (Casteel, 1998) indicating that the white students felt more at ease in the
environment. Dee asserts that when minority students have a teacher of the same ethnicity, they
have not only a role model but that the teachers of color tend to spend more time with the
minority students and have higher expectations of their success (2004, p.195). Casteel (1998)
and Dee (2004) reinforce the point that students of color feel uncomfortable in a classroom
headed by a white teacher. Black students respond better to black teachers because of shared
culture and the students’ perceptions that white teachers believe in the stereotype of the less

19

intelligent black student (Dee, 2004; Dee, 2005; Egalite, Kisida, & Winters, 2015; Milner, 2006;
Paloma, 2014).
Egalite, Kisida and Winters’ research also found that own-race teachers make a positive
impact on students and serve as role models and cultural translators (2015). Their quantitative
study evaluated a data set gathered over eight years by the Florida Department of Education.
Their overall results indicate that there are significant positive influences on reading scores for
black and white students who are placed in a class with a same ethnicity instructor and for black,
white, and Asian-American students’ mathematics score when placed in a same ethnicity
instructor environment (2015). And though the authors do not speculate as to why this is so,
they do feel that their study has potential policy ramifications. Dee’s research examined data
collected through Tennessee’s Project STAR (2004) and the National Education Longitudinal
Study (NELS:88) (2005). Results from each study indicate that race makes an impact in the
classroom. Dee’s 2004 research found that there were important educational gains to be had
when students were placed in a classroom with a teacher of the same race. Dee’s analysis of the
NELS:88 in 2005 was even more telling. Results showed that students with a teacher of another
race were more likely to be seen as disruptive and more likely to be seen as inattentive (Dee,
2005).
Milner’s (2006) qualitative study identified several themes from the analysis of
interviews with educational experts including the black teacher as role model for black students
and black teachers empathizing with rather than pitying their students. His research reinforces
the idea of black teachers as role models for black students, stresses the importance of proper
education and training for all teachers and removing barriers that stand in the way of black

20

people entering the teaching profession, and explains how the culturally informed relationship
between black teachers and black students allows for a deeper connection (2006).
Diversity in Higher Education
In the face of the historical inherent and institutional racism in the United States and
despite legal action, higher education did not begin to truly integrate until the 1960s with
President Lyndon Johnson’s signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. One of the outcomes of
years of court battles, protest, and legislation was the legitimizing of a set of ideas called
Affirmative Action. Affirmative Action means many things to many people. Mostly however,
Affirmative Action is looked at in two ways—as a positive way to ensure diversity or as a
handout to people based solely on the color of their skin.
In challenges to Affirmative Action in 1977 (Regents of the University of California v.
Bakke) and 2002 (Grutter v. Bollinger), the United States Supreme Court decisions reinforced
the benefits of diversity in education. As Garry (2008) explains, the U.S. Supreme Court
decisions indicate that diversity represented a “constitutionally compelling interest” (p.652).
The main theme of this study is diversity, particularly diversity in higher education,
which was addressed for many years in the court cases discussed above. According to Smith and
Schonfeld (2000),
Diversity remains an important imperative for the United States, its cities, and its
communities, and it is one in which higher education has an important role. Our
campuses are laboratories for diversity issues that continue to evolve over time (p.17).
Kujovich (1994) tracked the history of higher education for African Americans
specifically in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Although whites
21

historically used segregated schools as “a vehicle for social oppression” (Kujovich, 1994, p.66),
allocating much less money and many fewer resources, they did educate black teachers to teach
in the blacks-only schools providing African American youth the opportunity to be taught by
people who looked like them. But the poorly funded schools left students ill-prepared for college
perpetuating the second rate education provided to blacks, especially in the south. The all
African American schools did, however, foster racial pride among the students.
In the HBCUs, blacks were instructed in the trades—plastering, dressmaking,
laundering—or prepared to be teachers in all black schools rather than receiving the same well
rounded education, including scientific and technical instruction that whites received (Kujovich,
1994). Historically, racial minorities and women have been underrepresented in the science,
technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Price analyzed data from public four-year
universities in Ohio and found that racial matching has a positive effect on black students’
persistence in STEM courses and black teachers have a positive influence on the persistence of
white students as well (2010). Price’s research suggests that increasing the numbers of black
instructors in the STEM fields would positively influence the persistence levels of black students
in those fields (2010).
Watson et.al. found that the biggest issue for minority students was the fact that they
could not relate to university representatives (2002) reinforcing Price’s (2010) assertion that
students of color might react more positively to faculty of color to whom they would be more
likely to relate. As the result of her ethnographic research with African American nursing
students in predominantly white programs, Coleman (2008) found that the minority students felt
an absence of cultural and educational support. Coleman suggested increasing the numbers of
African American faculty to help with African American student comfort and success (2008).
22

Coleman also found that the African American students she interviewed felt alienated and
perceived as “others” (2008). Student responses reflect the “us versus them” attitude that the
students perceived within the program. They mentioned teachers not knowing students’ names
(indicating that the group of African American students was not important enough to learn
individual names), their inability to join all white study groups (one student’s boldness was
described as scary to some students in the group), and that instructors appear ill at ease whenever
they addressed minority students (Coleman, 2008). Watson et. al. wrote that minority students
they interviewed “lament their role as spokesperson for their racial and ethnic groups, a role they
are invariably expected to play in predominantly nonminority settings” and felt that they were
not seen as individuals but rather as members of their minority groups (2002, p.67), reinforcing
Coleman’s conclusions.
A review of research into academic success outcomes for Latino/a undergraduates found
that interactions with supportive individuals led to meaningful impacts on grades and persistence
decisions (Crisp, Taggart, & Nora, 2014). When Latino/a students attend a university with a
significant Latino/a community and feel a sense of belonging and a positive racial climate on
campus, they feel more tied to that institution and are more apt to persevere (Crisp, Taggart, &
Nora, 2014). Likewise, Hagedorn, Chi, Cepeda, and McLain (2006) studied the success of
Latino/a students and critical mass meaning a “level of representation that brings comfort or
familiarity within the education environment” (p.74). They found that critical mass on campus
makes a difference to Latino/a students; higher numbers of Latino/a students and faculty led to
more satisfaction and success for Latino/a students (Hagedorn, Chi, Cepeda, & McLain, 2006).
As previously discussed, there is a lack of faculty of color in higher education. Verdugo
(2003) discusses the reasons that preclude more Latina/os from becoming faculty in higher
23

education. According to Verdugo, even though not all Hispanic faculty have experienced
prejudice, some have felt discriminated against because of their appearance, their research foci,
and the perception that Latina/o faculty got where they are because of Affirmative Action
(2003). Latina/o faculty also feel segregated and relegated to certain schools and departments
and that institutional racism exists in the form of double standards and administrative apathy
(Verdugo, 2003).
Delgado-Romero, Flores, Gloria, Arredondo, and Castellanos (2003) further explore
career challenges faced by Latina/o faculty. The total Hispanic population in the United States
grew by 43% between 2000 and 2010 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011). Even so, the numbers of
Hispanics accessing higher education and graduating remained lower than white students (Ross
et. al., 2012). As a result, fewer Latina/os seek advanced degrees and are, therefore,
underrepresented in higher education faculty and administration (Delgado-Romero, Flores,
Gloria, Arredondo, & Castellanos, 2003). Latina/o faculty are generally “instructors, lecturers,
and non-tenure line faculty” (Delgado-Romero, Flores, Gloria, Arredondo, & Castellanos, 2003).
Additionally, Hispanics are disproportionally represented in the social sciences. In higher
education, part-time, term, and non-tenure track faculty are not afforded the same respect and
prestige as full-time, tenure-track faculty. And the social sciences can be looked upon as soft
when compared to engineering and other so called hard sciences. Delgado-Romero, Flores,
Gloria, Arredondo, & Castellanos (2003) also write that culture-based research done by Latina/os
is looked down upon and/or as presenting a personal or political agenda.
Sue, Bucceri, Lin, Nadal, and Torino found that the experiences of Asian Americans in
general are often overlooked in the research on racism because most of the research focuses on
the experiences of blacks and whites with the presumption that the information is applicable to
24

all races (2007). However, an American Council on Education (ACE) brief (2013) lists several
barriers to faculty advancement that were identified by a roundtable panel of 25 Asian American
Pacific Islander (AAPI) leaders in higher education which are similar to the issues seen by other
people of color in higher education. The obstacles include: racial bias, stereotyping, lack of
recruitment efforts, being seen as the “model minority” and not in need of any assistance, and the
lack of mentors. Additional research strengthens the findings of Sue, Bucceri, Lin, Nadal, and
Torino (2007) as well as those of the ACE (2013) (Teranishi, Behringer, Grey, and Parker,
2009). As the result of their examination of a 2008 National Commission on Asian American
and Pacific Islander Research in Education (CARE) report on Asian American Pacific Islanders
in higher education, the authors found that AAPI leadership in higher education is sorely lacking;
only 2.8% of executives, administrators, and managers in higher education are AAPI (Teranishi,
Behringer, Grey, & Parker, 2009).
When faculty of color do make the ranks of professorship in higher education they often
have to deal with discriminatory practices. Research has shown that African American faculty
are underrepresented, are concentrated in lower faculty ranks, are often relegated to race specific
roles (such as advising mostly African American students, teaching only racial scholarship, and
being assigned to diversity-related committee work), and teach higher loads than their white
counterparts (Pittman, 2012). Many of these practices can be termed racial microagressions.
Sue has written about racial microagressions as a more subtle form of racism (Sue, 2003; Sue,
Bucceri, Lin, Nadal, & Torino, 2007). An example of a racial microaggression would be a white
person telling a person of color that they only got their job because of Affirmative Action.
Pittman notes that African American faculty in predominantly white institutions report being

25

mistaken for a student and not being recognized as a faculty member (2012). Sue et al (2007)
identified several themes of microaggressions in a table:

Shealey, McHatton, McCray, and Thomas (2014) wrote about the themes that emerge
from existing literature and narratives by women of color in academe. The authors use personal
narrative to explore the themes of isolation and resistance among others. Erica McCray wrote
about her personal journey as an African American female in a southern, predominantly white
institution (PWI) of higher education where the rebel flag was not just present but omnipresent
causing her to feel isolated at times (2014). Patricia Alvarez McHatton felt the pressure to
assimilate into the PWI (predominantly white institution) where she worked in order to belong
(2014).
Additional research about faculty of color by Stanley (2006) pinpointed some of the same
themes that Shealey, McHatton, McCray, and Thomas (2014) had discovered such as collegial
relationships and identity. Stanley writes that the goal of her autoethnographic study of 27
faculty members of color was to give voice to individuals who were constantly silenced; Stanley
calls this a “burdensome cycle that is rarely broken” (2006, p.701). She wants these ongoing
narratives to help PWI’s (predominantly white institutions) in their recruitment and retention
efforts by laying out the different types of circumstances that minority faculty face such as
discrimination and segregation. These personal narratives and autoethnographic studies allow us
to hear those who have previously been kept silent.
Diversity in Libraries
A goal of this study is to give voice to minority faculty in academic libraries. Although
libraries and librarians have been forerunners of social activism, libraries in higher education
remained staffed primarily by whites. The American Library Association (ALA) published
“Diversity Standards: Cultural Competency for Academic Libraries” in 2012. In the report,
ALA provides “a framework for to support libraries in engaging the complexities of … recruiting
28

and maintain a diverse library workforce” (2012, p.1). Of particular interest are standards 7 and
9. ALA’s diversity standard 7 addresses workforce diversity and encourages libraries to develop
plans to recruit a diverse workforce, review their recruitment and hiring policies to alleviate
“inadvertent exclusion of or discrimination toward underrepresented, underserved, and
historically oppressed groups” (2012, p.10). Standard 9 speaks to cross-cultural leadership and
advises library leaders to encourage and support library faculty of color within their
organizations and to develop a multiethnic and multicultural labor force (ALA, 2012, p.12).
However, the American Library Association indicated that librarians of color make up
only 15% of the total number of academic librarians. This means that 15% of the librarians
represent 23% of the population revealing a disparity (American Library Association, 2011). As
Dewey writes, academic libraries, “historically, are far from reflecting the growing racial, ethnic,
and linguistic diversity in the United States” (2009, p.356). There is sparse empirical research to
explain why this is so. Most of the published work, though steeped in experience and
thoughtfulness, consists of opinion essays, literature reviews, and best practices pieces derived
from personal experience at individual libraries.
Increasing diversity in the library is not a new concept and the library profession’s quest
to do so has led to the creation of some of the American Library Association (ALA) affiliates
such as the Black Caucus (BCALA), the Chinese Americans’ Library Association (CALA), and
the National Association to Promote Library & Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish
Speaking (REFORMA) (Ortega & Ramos, 2011). The formation of these affiliates, along with
the establishment of the Ethnic & Multicultural Information Exchange Round Table (EMIERT),
in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, came about as the result of some members’ perception that the

29

issues affecting librarians and patrons of color were not being addressed (ALA, n.d.; Ortega &
Ramos, 2011).
In addition to the creation of these organizations, librarians have been discussing
recruitment, retention, and diversity policies and procedures for many years. Though library
scholars have studied and written about potential improvements to the recruitment and retention
processes utilized in the field of LIS, little empirical research is available. Nevertheless, several
themes emerge from the data that have been collected: changing the LIS curriculum, the library
related wants and needs of university students, and the worklife of librarians and workplace
microagressions.
Changing the LIS curriculum.
Kim (2009) proposed changes to the curriculum in library and information science (LIS)
programs based on her research utilizing a survey instrument to collect data from students of
color enrolled in or graduated from an LIS program. The five improvements students suggested
most often were a climate that is supportive of diversity with a diverse faculty and staff,
increased financial support, better marketing of LIS programs to high school and college
undergraduate students, mentors for students, and better collaboration between LIS programs and
their communities (Kim, 2009). Wallace and Naidoo (2010) detail the racial background of fulltime faculty in LIS education: American Indian, 0.8%; Asian/Pacific Islander, 13.8%; African
American, 5.1%; Hispanic 3.3%; and white, 77%. Darden and Turock (2005) found that their
study participants, seven African American women library administrators, felt that LIS programs
continued to use recruitment methods that had not worked in the past and that LIS educators
were content with the status quo (low numbers of librarians of color) and therefore did not seek
to improve their stagnating recruitment efforts.
30

What students need and want from a university library.
Some empirical research delves into the needs and wants of students who use academic
libraries. Bonnet and McAlexander (2012) found a difference in students’ perceptions of
librarians’ approachability based on ethnicity. Bonnet and McAlexander found that African
American students rated whites as less approachable and African Americans and Asians as more
approachable whereas Asian students rated whites and Asians as more approachable (2012).
Interestingly, white students did not note any difference in approachability with regards to
librarian ethnicity (Bonnet & McAlexander, 2012). Bonnet and McAlexander conclude that
service to students of color in higher education may be improved by bringing more librarians of
color into higher education (2012). In survey research conducted by Elteto, Jackson, and Kim,
university students of color indicated that they felt they received a cool response from staff of
another race and that seeing a more diverse staff, a more welcoming staff, would appeal to
minority students and encourage them to seek help more frequently (2008).
Latino/a students are a rapidly increasing segment of the minority student population.
Long (2011) studied Latino college students’ attitudes regarding the academic library. His
results correspond with those of Bonnet and McAlexander and Elteto, Jackson, and Kim.
Students in Long’s research reported that they felt more at ease when they interacted with a
librarian who “shared their cultural identity” (2011, p.509). One student related that she was
offended when, upon visiting the circulation desk, the staff at the desk spoke to her quite loudly
and slowly, presuming from her accent that she could not speak English well (Long, 2011). In
addition, students were disappointed in the lack of Spanish-language materials (Long, 2011). To
make matters worse, several students mentioned that Spanish-language materials had been
available but that they could no longer find them in the library leaving the students feeling a lack
31

of inclusivity in the library (Long, 2011). Whitmire’s research is a secondary analysis of a
student satisfaction survey conducted at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2004). Whitmire
(2004) reviewed specific data sets including demographics and statistics measuring the campus’
racial climate. Minority students reported feeling less comfortable on campus, less confident in
the university’s response to student concerns and creation of a sense of community (Whitmire,
2004). Students of color also indicated that it was important for the university to increase
administrator, faculty, staff, and student diversity on campus (Whitmire, 2004).
Worklife and racial microagressions.
In their 2012 study of the worklife experiences of academic librarians of color, Damasco
and Hodges found that formal and informal mentoring by senior colleagues was a major asset for
minority librarians seeking promotion and tenure. The participants is this study also identified
several barriers to their progress including large service related duties (including diversity related
committees whether or not the librarian is interested in diversity issues) that take away from
research time, the lack of faculty of color especially in administrative roles, and a pattern of
systemic racial inequality (Damasco & Hodges, 2012). Barbara Simpson Darden and Betty K.
Turock (2005) surveyed and interviewed with seven African American women library
administrators and identified barriers to advancement for people of color that foreshadowed the
findings of Damasco and Hodges. Participants in Darden and Turock’s study pinpointed race
and institutionalized racism as impediments to promotion (2005).
Racism also features in the results of Le’s survey of 12 Asian Americans in leadership
positions in academic libraries (2015). Survey respondents indicated race was a barrier to
advancement in librarianship as were cultural misperceptions about Asian Americans (Le, 2015).
Cultural values such as respect for authority, aversion to conflict, and reserved nature were listed
32

as additional obstacles (Le, 2015). Le’s survey participants did offer suggestions for improving
their numbers—finding mentors, broadening their library experience, improving their
communication skills, and greater involvement in professional and professional development
activities (2015).
As a result of her research, Thornton also concluded that race is a factor in determining
job satisfaction for librarians of African descent in academic libraries (2000). Of the 146
librarians of African descent who responded to the survey, 41% felt a moderate to high amount
of isolation at their university; 41% felt they had to work hard to fit in; 60% indicated that the
diversity programs were inadequate; and, over 80% were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the
number of librarians of African descent in the library (Thornton, 2005). Love’s research into
workforce diversity in academic libraries found academic libraries are not welcoming nor
supportive of diverse staff (2001). Love’s surveys of librarians and staff in academic libraries
examined the respondents’ perceptions of their institutions and led her to conclude that “many
academic libraries still view diversity as a movement rather than a way of life” and that
organizational and individual behaviors and attitudes must be critically assessed in order for
effective change to occur (2001, p.100).
Organizational and institutional racism is sometimes expressed in racial microagressions.
The term was conceived by psychologist Chester Middlebrook Pierce in the 1970s to label the
subtle, and not so subtle, hostilities inflicted on African Americans by non-blacks (Sue & Sue,
2012). The term has come to reflect offenses towards people of any non-dominant group as well
(Sue & Sue, 2012). Racial microaggressions are defined as “brief and commonplace daily
verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that
communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults towards people of color”

33

(Sue, Capodilupo, Torino, Bucceri, Holder, Nadal & Esquilin, 2007, p.271). Alabi (2014, 2015)
has studied racial microagressions in academic libraries. Her 2014 study found that some
minority academic librarians have experienced racial microagressions at work such as being
treated differently than white counterparts and being seen as having less education because of
their race (Alabi, 2014). Alabi determined that librarians of color have experienced overt as well
as covert aggressions including microassaults (blatant racism), microinsults (subtle racially
insensitive comments or stereotyping), microinvalidations (assumptions about minorities that
negate their culture such as “You speak English so well for an Hispanic”), feelings of exclusion,
and environmental microagressions (lack of diversity in the environment) in a 2015 survey of
139 academic librarians of all races.
Summary and Future Research
The literature shows us that diversity and disparity in education has long been a focus for
educational scholars in the United States. Despite the attention paid to the issues surrounding
diversity in education, the teaching profession remains predominantly white (Bireda & Chait,
2011; Ingersoll & May, 2011; Ingersoll & Merrill, 2012; Villegas, Strom, & Lucas, 2012) even
though research suggests that students benefit from learning from a teacher of their own race
(Dee, 2004; Dee, 2005; Egalite, Kisida, & Winters, 2015; Milner, 2006; Paloma, 2014). The
research into diversity in higher education has identified barriers faced by both students
(Coleman, 2008; Crisp, Taggart, & Nora, 2014; Hagedorn, Chi, Cepeda, & McLain, 2006) and
faculty of color (Delgado-Romero, Flores, Gloria, Arredondo, & Castellanos, 2003; Pittman,
2012; Shealey, McHatton, McCray, & Thomas, 2014; Stanley, 2006; Sue, Bucceri, Lin, Nadal, &
Torino, 2007; Teranishi, Behringer, Grey, & Parker, 2009; Verdugo, 2003). Students feel they

34

are not supported and are seen as “others” (Stanley, 2006). Faculty also feel they are not
supported and are segregated and relegated to lower ranks (Pittman, 2012).
Though empirical research on diversity in academic libraries is limited, several themes do
emerge. Darden and Turock (2005), as well as Kim (2009), suggest changes to the curriculum in
Library and Information Science (LIS) programs. College students have indicated that they feel
more welcome in an academic library when the librarians and materials reflect them and their
culture(s) (Bonnet & McAlexander, 2012; Elteto, Jackson, & Kim, 2008; Long, 2011; Whitmire,
2004). A third theme that appears in the literature is that of minority librarians’ worklives and
workplace microaggressions (Alabi, 2014; Alabi, 2015; Damasco & Hodges, 2012; Darden &
Turock, 2005; Le, 2015; Love, 2001; Thornton, 2005). Librarians of color have experienced
subtle and not so subtle racism and hostilities in the workplace.
This study about minority librarians in higher education addresses those three themes
using qualitative methods and a critical race theory framework. Hussey (2009) studied the
motivations of people of color who chose librarianship as a career. For her qualitative study,
Hussey interviewed 32 LIS students across the United States in an attempt to discover successful
diversity initiatives and to identify avenues or methods that had been overlooked. The research
participants named various reasons for choosing librarianship as a career including a history of
positive experiences in libraries and the experience of encouragement from another person
(Hussey, 2009). As the result of her study, Hussey found that existing recruitment programs are
a good start but they have not been the answer to the question of diversity in librarianship (2009).
Hussey (2009) argues that the barrier to true diversity in librarianship is the unrecognized power
inequality between whites and non-whites and reliance on the status quo. She concludes that
until there is large scale change in how the profession views itself and the profession
35

acknowledges that libraries and librarianship are acting as “tool(s) of cultural hegemony” rather
than diverse institutions (Hussey, 2009, p.211). Hussey recommends additional studies about
diversity and librarianship adding that studying failures as well as successes will help researchers
in the profession to “address unearned privilege, power relationships and inequality of
opportunity” in librarianship (2009, p.212).
This study will expand the existing research on minority librarians in higher education.
A substantial gap in the literature is an absence of research addressing what Hussey claims is the
heart of the problem of increasing the numbers of librarians of color in higher education—power
(2009). Using critical race theory as a framework for interpretation, the analysis will address the
question of power and the perceptions and experiences of minority librarians in higher education.

Chapter 3
Research Methods
The library profession as a whole is predominantly white with a large discrepancy
between the percentage of minorities in the United States in general and the percentage of
professional librarians who are minorities. This study adds to the body of knowledge regarding
minority librarians in higher education. Using information gained from this study, and hearing
about the experiences and perceptions of current minority librarians in higher education, library
educators and administrators can make better decisions regarding the recruitment of minority
librarians to academe.
Design Overview
When engaging in a research project, the researcher must identify the type of research
design that fits their research questions and purpose. For this study, qualitative methods were
selected over quantitative ones because one of the goals of this study is to give voice to
individuals who may have felt or been voiceless. Giving individuals the opportunity to speak for
themselves, to tell their stories, requires that the researcher be open to any and all responses and
for participants to use their own words and actions to describe their feelings, observations, and
experiences. Using the naturalistic and emergent design strategies of qualitative research helps
to do just that. As Patton writes, naturalistic inquiry lessens researcher interference and “places
no prior constraints on what the outcomes of the research will be” (2002, p.39). Maxwell adds
that in qualitative research, elements of the research design may need to change as new
developments or changes occur (2013).
This study can also be termed phenomenological. According to Bogdan and Biklen
(2007), phenomenological research seeks to find the meanings that people ascribe to the events

37

and interactions in their lives. Since one of the goals of this study is to ascertain the feelings and
experiences of minority librarian in higher education, a phenomenological approach is most
appropriate.
Participant Selection and Sampling
I am a member of several associations—both regional and national—for professional
librarians including the West Virginia Library Association (WVLA), the American Library
Association (ALA), the Black Caucus of the American Library Association (BCALA), and the
Association of Research and College Libraries (ACRL). Membership in these organizations
allows me access to other minority professional academic librarians and I was able to identify
many potential informants through these organizations.
Several sampling techniques were employed together for this study. Snowball sampling
was used to identify potential informants. Snowball sampling involves identifying potential
informants “from people who know people who meet research interests” (Glesne, 2011, p.45). I
identified these potential informants through the use of organizational email listservs to inform
other minority librarians in higher education about my topic and request participation. The
organizations include: the Black Caucus (BCALA), the Chinese Americans’ Library Association
(CALA), the National Association to Promote Library & Information Services to Latinos and the
Spanish Speaking (REFORMA), the American Indian Library Association (AILA), and the
Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL).
Also, maximum variation sampling was used to identify librarians representing a variety
of ethnicities. Maximum variation sampling works at "capturing and describing the central
themes that cut across a great deal of variation" (Patton, 2002, p. 235). Maximum variation
sampling assures that "common patterns that emerge from great variation are of particular

38

interest and value in capturing the core experiences and central, shared dimensions of a setting or
phenomenon" (Patton, 2002, p. 235). In this study, constants include education level and current
or past employment in an academic library. All participants hold a Master’s Degree in Library
Science or will graduate with an MLS in the near future, and are, or were recently, employed in
higher education. I strove to find participants who represent the major ethnic minority groups in
the United States: African American, Latino, Asian-Pacific Islander, Native American, and
individuals of more than one race.
Data Collection
I gained IRB approval in December of 2015 and began the process of selecting
informants and setting up interviews and gathering any additional data. This study does not
focus on just one higher education institution but rather on the individual experiences and
perceptions of librarians of color in higher education. Part of the negotiation process to gain
access to the informants will involve providing a lay summary and consent form (Glesne, 2001).
In this research summary I addressed who I am, why I am working on this study, how I will use
the results, benefits and risks to participants, the promise of confidentiality, and a request to
record interviews (Glesne, 2011).
Interviews were conducted by phone due to time and distance constraints. Because this
study examines the thoughts, experiences, and perceptions of librarians working in higher
education, every attempt was made to interview informants outside of working hours and outside
of their working environment however I allowed the participants to schedule interviews at their
convenience. Semi-structured interviews were conducted. Semi-structured interviews consist of
the interviewer beginning with a list of open ended interview questions. The interviewer remains
open to modifying and/or adding questions in the interview (Glesne, 2011). Interviewees have

39

their unique perspectives and broached topics or subjects that I had not thought of, allowing them
to tell their own stories from their own perspectives (Bogdan & Biklen, 2003). According to
Potts (2004), storytelling is a qualitative tool that allows the teller/informant to self-examine,
reconstruct memory, and construct meaning. Storytelling also has a long history with critical
race theorists who gather narratives to present reality from the informants’ perspective (Parker &
Lynn, 2009).
Questions fell loosely into three groups. First, I asked questions designed to get to know
the participant and determine why the individual chose librarianship as a career. The second
group of questions addressed their training, both formal and informal. And third, I inquired
about their employment as a professional librarian in higher education focusing on job search
and past and current employment.
Data Analysis and Interpretation
In undertaking this study, I had hoped to learn about the lived experiences and
perceptions of librarians of color and to contribute to the dialogue on diversity in academic
librarianship. For this reason, thematic analysis was employed in the data analysis phase, which
began with the completion of the first interview as recommended by Maxwell (2013). This
involves identifying themes and patterns while reviewing the individual transcribed interviews
(Glesne, 2011). Bogdan and Biklen (2003) assert that we as researchers “search through … data
for regularities and patterns as well as topics… and then write down words and phrases to
represent these topics and patterns.” I then went through a recoding process which enabled
categorization of the thematic codes. Data from fully transcribed interviews was coded and
sorted into categories with common themes. Organization of themes and coding was closely
supervised by the committee chair.

40

Analysis of data can be subjective (Glesne, 2010; Maxwell, 2013) therefore it is
important for me to be aware of my own biases or perspectives as well as any other issues that
may affect the validity of the results. Engaging in critical reflection (reflexivity) can help with
addressing threats to validity (Glesne, 2010; Patton, 2002). According to Patton, “reflexivity
reminds the qualitative inquirer to be attentive to and conscious of the cultural, political, social,
linguistic, and ideological origins of one’s own perspective and voice as well as the perspective
and voice of those one interviews and those to whom one reports” (2002, p.65). Patton (2002)
offers a list of reflexive questions, what he terms reflexive triangulation. He suggests that
researchers question themselves (what do I know?), the research participants (how do they know
what they know?), and the audience (how do they make sense of what I give them?) all through
the reflexive screens of culture, age, gender, class, social status, education, family, political
praxis, language, and values (Patton, 2002). Using Patton’s questions as a guide helped me to be
reflective and reflexive.
Maxwell (2010, 2013) and Sandelowski, Voils, and Knafl (2009) recommend the use of
numbers in qualitative data analysis. The use of numbers, or quantitizing, in qualitative data
analysis helps to “facilitate pattern recognition … account for all data … and verify
interpretations” (Sandelowski, Voils, & Knafl, 2009, p.210). Maxwell adds that using numbers
can assist the researcher to identify patterns not recognizable from review of the qualitative data
and add an additional level of validity to the interpretation of data (2010). I use some simple
numerical results garnered through analysis of the qualitative data gathered to set the stage for
the internal generalizability of the findings (Maxwell, 2010). For example, I counted patterns in
the data or instances of a certain statement, action, or event (Maxwell, 2010) a process termed
“quantitizing” (Sandelowski, Voils, & Knafl, 2009).

41

During this phase I expanded on the prior literature in the field, answering Chang’s
(2013) and Ortega and Ramos’ (2011) call for more empirical study of the issues of minority
recruitment and retention and my desire to investigate minority librarians experiences and
perceptions of being librarians of color in higher education.
Interpretation of the data was the next phase of the research process. The interpretive
process involves probing the analyzed findings for meaning, especially in light of prior research.
Using Critical Race Theory as a lens for interpretation, I reviewed the data collected through indepth interviews and analyzed using the coding process to derive meaning. Interpretations, as
with interview transcripts, were shared with participants as a part of the member check process.
Member checks served to allow participants to review and comment making sure that their words
and views were accurately expressed, identify problem areas, and offer additional information
about themes or interpretations (Glesne, 2011).
Validity
No study is without threats to validity. Researchers must be aware of these potential
threats and take steps to minimize them. Two principal risks to validity in qualitative research
include researcher bias and reactivity (Maxwell, 2013). As a minority librarian in higher
education, studying the lack of minority librarians in higher education, personal bias was
something that I addressed. In addition, participant reactivity to me as an interviewer could have
been a potential threat to the validity of this study. I employed several techniques identified by
qualitative researcher and author Joseph A. Maxwell in addition to the quantitizing discussed in
the previous section.
Maxwell (2013) lists eight validity checks to achieve accuracy in qualitative research. I
employed several of his methods to address researcher bias and reactivity. First, Maxwell

42

advocates intensive long-term involvement. I developed relationships with the academic
librarians I interviewed over months, emailing additional questions to them for clarification, and
then gaining feedback through member checks (another of Maxwell’s validity strategies) which
strengthened my confidence in the credibility of my findings. Member checks, or respondent
validation, involves asking informants to review interpretations and conclusions to verify that I
did not misinterpret their meanings addressing the threat of researcher bias and reactivity.
Collecting rich data through strong interviews, another of Maxwell’s validity checks, also
furthered the validity efforts. Adhering to the idea that I am open to different interpretations and
explanations of data and results was another way that validity was enhanced and researcher bias
was minimized.
Addressing potential threats to validity is important for any research study. The potential
threats to this study included researcher bias and reactivity. These threats were mitigated
through the development of long-term, deep relationships with participants, conducting member
checks, acknowledging biases by being open to different interpretations and explanations of the
data, and “quantitizing”.

Chapter Four
Settings and Participants

In this chapter, I will introduce the settings and participants for this study in order to
provide context. I undertook this study to investigate the experiences and perceptions of
librarians of color in higher education. To that end, I have interviewed nine individuals of color
who are now or have previously worked in academic libraries.
Participants
In qualitative research, participants can be identified in a variety of ways. For this study,
I employed snowball sampling; I sent an email asking for participants using listservs of the
following organizations: the Black Caucus (BCALA), the Chinese Americans’ Library
Association (CALA), the National Association to Promote Library & Information Services to
Latinos and the Spanish Speaking (REFORMA), and the American Indian Library Association
(AILA). Nineteen individuals responded to my email.
In order to select between five and ten participants from the pool, I employed maximum
variation sampling, selecting participants from several different minority groups. I interviewed
six African Americans, two Native Americans, and one Asian-Pacific Islander. Of the nine
interviewees there were six women and three men. At the time interview data were collected, six
interviewees were working as librarians in higher education, one was close to completing an
MLS and working as a Graduate Assistant in an academic library, and two were retired.
In the sections below I introduce the nine study participants. Four work or worked in
organizations with 5000 or fewer students while the other five librarians work or worked at
schools with between 14,000 and 30,000 students. Three of the interviewees have two or fewer
years of experience, three have five to ten years of experience, and three have over 20 years of
44

experience for a combined 127 years of experience in academic libraries. Their individual
profiles are categorized into three groups: those currently working as academic librarians, retired
academic librarians, and a current Masters in Library Science student.
Current Academic Librarians
Alexandra.
Alexandra is an African American female who, at the time of her interview, was working
as library director at an academic library in the Great Lakes region. With a calm demeanor and
soothing voice, she described herself as service-oriented and very active in her community. She
earned her undergraduate and Masters of Library Science (MLS) degrees at universities in the
Great Lakes region and began her library career in the 1980s in a public library. However,
Alexandra always wanted to work in an academic library and pursued that path. Alexandra is
also an active member of several professional groups such as state library organizations (one
general and one for black librarians) as well the Black Caucus of the American Library
Association (BCALA). She had several mentors over the years at school and through BCALA.
The university where Alexandra works is a private, non-profit school and is Carnegie
classified as a “school of business and management,” meaning that it grants most of its
bachelor’s or graduate degrees in business or business-related programs (National Center for
Education Statistics, 2015). Alexandra’s university boasts slightly more than 4,100 fulltime
students and employs two fulltime and one halftime librarian at her branch (National Center for
Education Statistics, 2015). Alexandra’s library reported a book and materials budget of just
over $150,000, with total library expenditures of over $435,000 (National Center for Education
Statistics, 2015). These library budget numbers translate to a per-year student expenditure of
$105.00 which is only 19.8% of the national average of $529.89 (National Center for Education

45

Statistics, 2015). At this school, students of color make up 66% of the student body. The
number of fulltime faculty is listed at 59 however there is no information on the number of
minority faculty (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). Alexandra indicated during
her interview that there are few African American faculty and staff on campus.
“Libraries are pivotal,” Alexandra declared. As a librarian she wants to help people to
access information. She enjoys working with students, especially African American students,
whom she hopes she has been able to help by being a buffer between them and the majority
population similar to what her library school mentor did for her. Alexandra described herself as
a servant-leader and she told me that one of the best things about being a librarian is helping
people and, in particular, helping people develop; she has successfully mentored many
individuals.
Baldwin.
Like Alexandra, Baldwin is African American. However, Baldwin is a male working as
a subject specialist librarian at a public university in the southeast. During our interview he
seemed relaxed and low-key and had an easy laugh. He grew up and attended school in a city on
the west coast. While in college, Baldwin was very involved in the Black Student Union. After
graduating with a bachelor’s degree, Baldwin wanted to continue to “be involved in research and
education” and, as the result, pursued librarianship as a career. He initially thought he would
enjoy working in a public library but, after a frustrating job search with few leads, found himself
employed as an academic librarian. Baldwin currently is active in the American Library
Association (ALA) and the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) as well as in
various campus groups at the university.

46

Baldwin’s university is one of the larger workplaces of the nine discussed here. It has a
total enrollment of almost 19,000 students (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015).
There are 24 librarians employed in the libraries’ three branches. The library has a materials
budget of over $860,000, spending approximately $470 per student annually, just $60 less than
the national average (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). About 15% of their
students are non-white and 11% of faculty are people of color
(http://www.princetonreview.com/college-education).
During his interview, Baldwin stated that his workplace, as well as the university in
general, is “terribly un-diverse.” He noted that the school is predominantly white and affluent.
And although faculty diversity is “getting better every year,” Baldwin told me that he
experiences racial microaggressions on campus, from other faculty, and, at times, feels isolated.
Constance.
Constance, soft-spoken and composed on the phone, described herself as a careerchanger. Like Alexandra, she is an African American female, although unlike Alexandra,
Constance works in a large research university in the southeast United States. Constance stated
that she had some of the “same misconceptions that many people do” about librarians, but she
was drawn to librarianship as a career where she would be able to help people. Constance found
that it was difficult to find her first job without previous experience working in a library and
therefore had a non-traditional journey to her current job. After graduating with her Master’s in
Library Science (MLS), she returned to her previous field, business, before eventually finding a
part-time, second job as a librarian.
In her current job, Constance works in library administration at a public four-year
university with an enrollment of over 27,000 (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015).

47

The library employs 57 librarians out of a total of 177 employees (National Center for Education
Statistics, 2015). The library materials budget is just over $2,000,000 or about 12% of the total
library budget (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). The library’s expenditure per
student of $639.00 is slightly higher than the national average (National Center for Education
Statistics, 2015). According to Collegedata.com, the university boasts a diverse student body
with almost 49% enrollment by students of color. Collegefactual.com offers that the university’s
faculty is approximately 70% white.
Constance indicated during her interview that she sees quite a few barriers for people of
color who desire a career in academic librarianship including the unwritten rule that, in order to
be hired, you must have professional or at least volunteer experience in a library. Another point
Constance made during the interview was that overlooking people who are different than
yourself in the hiring process is a missed opportunity. Constance asserted that “in order to have
a successful organization, you need diversity of thought.”
Dara.
Dara is an African American female who chose librarianship for a career after spending a
lot of time as a child in her local public library with one of the black librarians. “I just thought
she had the coolest job,” Dara enthused, speaking briskly and emphatically during the interview.
She has attended school on both the east and west coasts and attended library school at a
Historically Black College or University (HBCU). An HBCU is an organization of higher
learning whose principal mission was and is the education of African Americans. She loved
school and calls herself a nerd. She told me that her experiences attending an HBCU showed her
that “diversity is a very large thing” and that the “black community is a really diverse

48

community.” Dara noted that at her current institution the student body is becoming more
diverse while the faculty remain “very much of a certain hue.”
Dara works at a four-year public university in the far west; Dara’s university is the largest
workplace of the nine respondents. The university library’s 15.5 full-time equivalent (FTE)
librarians and 92 total library staff serve the student population of just over 30,000 (National
Center for Education Statistics, 2015). The library’s entire expenditures per year equals almost
$6,000,000, 3.5% of which make up the materials budget of $202,000 resulting in a per-student
expenditure of $190.00 (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). This large urban school
in the far west has a student population that is 20% white, 23% Asian American, and almost 38%
Hispanic (http://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/) However, as is true for most other
institutions in this study, collegefactual.com reports that the faculty is much less diverse; over
55% of the faculty is white, just over 16% is Hispanic, and about 14.5% is Asian American.
Interestingly, according to the same website, African Americans make up just over 6% of faculty
at Dara’s institution, but only 3.8% of the student body
(http://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/)
During Dara’s interview, she declared that librarianship, particularly academic
librarianship, needs more black librarians:
We need to be a part of that conversation where they have higher education changing.
And you’re going to have a diverse population. Black students particularly need to see us
in different positions. They need to see us in charge…. There are very few black students
I come across, but for those one or two or three or four in each class, I tried to show them
this possibility.

49

Farah.
Farah is an African American female working at a Historically Black College or
University (HBCU). During her interview she spoke passionately with a spirited laugh. She is
very involved in several committees on campus. She was attracted to librarianship for several
reasons. First, though Farah had thought of a career in the social sciences, for various reasons
she did not pursue an advanced degree in that area. She took a year off from her studies to
ponder her future when, fortuitously, the word librarian flashed across her computer screen.
Being a firm believer in divine intervention, Farah looked around her and saw that she was
surrounded by books. Since she had “always been a researcher,” she began researching the
library profession and found that there were not many black librarians in our helping profession.
Farah became a librarian “to be able to help and serve others.”
At her small HBCU, Farah is one of 17 staff members, and one of only seven librarians
serving 2700 students (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). The library’s budget is
just a bit over $1,000,000, with only $9000 earmarked for materials (National Center for
Education Statistics, 2015). The library reports an annual per-student expenditure of
approximately $400.00 which is lower than the national average (National Center for Education
Statistics, 2015). The HBCU where Farah is employed as a librarian has an undergraduate
enrollment that is almost 50% white; African Americans make up about 40%
(http://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/). Latino/as make up just over 2%, while Asians are
less than 1% of the student body (http://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/). Faculty ethnicity
follows a similar pattern with 53% of faculty listed as white and 30% listed as African American
(http://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/). Asian and Latino/a faculty constitute 3.8% and 1.7%
of faculty, respectively (http://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/).

50

Farah noted during her interview that her decision to become a librarian is “history.” As
a lifelong researcher, Farah realized that, as a black woman, becoming a librarian is history
because of the historical importance of literacy in the African American community especially in
light of the fact that learning to read and write was denied to slaves. Farah feels that her role as
“culture keeper is one of the most prestigious positions to have.”
Heidi.
Heidi is an Asian American female employed at a large research university in the plains
region of the United States. Speaking carefully and confidently on the phone during the
interview, Heidi said that she always knew that she wanted to help people in some way, to
provide a “service to some greater good.” Similar to other respondents I interviewed, Heidi
enjoys being a lifelong learner, another reason she chose librarianship as a career. Once she
decided on librarianship as a career path, she benefitted from living near a university with a
library school. While pursuing her Masters in Library Science (MLS) she enjoyed being with a
group of like-minded students but found that the curriculum was not as challenging as she had
anticipated and opted to complete an additional master’s degree in a management field at the
same time. She wanted to be a leader in academic librarianship.
Heidi now works in an academic library in a public four-year institution employing
almost 250 people, 59 of whom are librarians (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015).
The library materials budget at Heidi’s university is $2.1 million, or 10% of the total library
budget of $20.2 million. Of all of the institutions where the nine interviewees in this study were
employed, Heidi’s university library spends the most per student, $800.00 (National Center for
Education Statistics, 2015). According to http://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/, this large

51

university has over 20,000 students, 72% of whom are white, 6.7% of whom are Hispanic, 4.6%
of whom are African American, and 4.1% of whom are Asian.
When she was invited to interview for her current job, Heidi noticed “that it was very
white” and that when she gave her presentation, she didn’t see “anyone of color there.” She
went on to say that she was concerned but took the job anyway. She is also one of the youngest
people in the library organization.
Retirees
Emery.
At the opposite end of the spectrum from Heidi and Farah who are newer librarians,
Emery retired from an academic librarian position several years ago after a career spanning more
than 40 years. Emery is an African American male; he attended and graduated from colleges on
both the west and east coasts two of which were Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs). During his career he has been very involved in research, publishing, and service in
professional organizations. He continues research today and is writing a book. He came from a
family of readers and book lovers and “never considered another career.” On the phone his
voice was low-key and measured.
Over his lengthy career as a librarian, Emery worked at several public and academic
libraries on both the east and west coasts. Before his retirement, Emery was the head librarian at
a four-year public university on the east coast with approximately 14,000 students (National
Center for Education Statistics, 2015). Of 56 total library staff members, Emery was one of 22
librarians (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). The $4.8 million library budget
includes just over $250,000 for materials (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). This
translates to annual expenditures of approximately $340.00 per student which is about two-thirds

52

of the national average (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). This university lists an
undergraduate population that is very diverse with approximately 33% Asian, 25.5% white, just
over 19% Hispanic, approximately 9% black, and fewer than .5% Native American students
(www.college factual.com).
Emery was a trailblazer in librarianship for many reasons including his work on library
automation projects when library automation was still an avant-guard concept and his enthusiasm
for strategic planning. Emery struggled with bringing change to organizations and people who
tended to be satisfied with the status quo but continued to work to improve automation,
architecture, and programming. Emery shared with me a saying he had heard many years before
that summed up his philosophy: “I came here to drain the swamp, not fight with the alligators.”
Grace.
I interviewed a second retiree, Grace, a Native American female from a small tribe in the
Midwestern United States; her serene demeanor was evident over the phone. At the time of the
interview, she had been retired for several years following a varied and more than 20 year library
career in public, special, and academic libraries. She has worked as library director at several
institutions including a tribal college and a small private non-profit university. Grace was
working in a library when the director noted her excellent work ethic and exceptional people
skills and recommended her for a minority fellowship; she received her Masters of Library
Science in just one year.
When she retired, Grace was working at a small private university in the southeast United
States with an enrollment of almost 1,200 students (National Center for Education Statistics,
2015). There are just three library employees, including two librarians, at this university
(National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). The listed materials budget is almost $35,000,

53

or about 9% of the total library budget which works out to a per student expenditure of just over
$330.00 (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). This university is predominantly
white, with white students making up almost 77% of the student body (National Center for
Education Statistics, 2015). African American students number about 5%, Hispanics about
2.5%, and Asians just over 1% (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015).
Grace has been dedicated to service all of her life. She attributes her outlook to her
culture that emphasizes treating each and every person as a human being deserving of respect.
She worked tirelessly to introduce internet services to the campus of the tribal college. She
participated in various prestigious library related activities including the aforementioned
fellowship and won grants and contests. Grace summed up her experience as a librarian by
saying that, overall, it had been a fun journey.
MLS Student
Ian.
Very much like other respondents in this survey, Ian was drawn to librarianship because,
after completing his first Master’s Degree in a liberal arts field, and rather than pursuing a PhD,
he wanted “to be around books and write independently” on various topics not just the topic or
topics expected of him during his studies. In addition, he felt that he had been steered away from
research interests pertaining to his Native American culture. Ian is set to graduate soon with his
MLS and is currently employed as a Graduate Assistant (GA) at private, four-year, not-for-profit
university in the plains region of the United States. I interviewed Ian during his commute to
work; despite being on the bus, he spoke frankly, loudly, and clearly.
The university where Ian works has a student population of just over 5,000 students
(National Center for Education Statistics, 2015); the student body is almost 65% white, 11%

54

Asian, almost 10% black, 6% Hispanic, and less than 1% Native American
(www.collegefactual.com). The faculty ranks are even less diverse: 88% white, 4.5% Asian, 3%
African American, 3% Hispanic, and .2% Native American (www.collegfactual.com). This
university employs ten librarians in a staff of 30 (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015).
The library’s budget is $2.2 million of which the materials budget is just over $250,000. At Ian’s
institution, library expenditures per student are just over $500.00 (National Center for Education
Statistics, 2015).
In his interview, Ian mentioned the “high degree of professionalism” at his university as
well as “a little bit of competitiveness.” Ian’s own commitment to professionalism and tendency
to be competitive is apparent. In his current position as Graduate Assistant, he performs many of
the same duties that a fulltime professional academic librarian would including providing
reference services, creating and maintaining LibGuides (a commercially created research guide
format), and developing a diversity and outreach plan for the library.
Summary
In this chapter I introduced the nine study participants. Their experience levels range
from student to more than 20 years of working as a librarian. I interviewed both women and
men from various ethnic backgrounds. I spent many hours interviewing the informants for this
study and have been able to listen to them and hear their stories. I learned about the experiences
and perceptions that the nine informants chose to share with me. The interviews offered several
emerging themes that will be discussed in the following chapter. This study shed light on the
perceptions and experiences of academic librarians of color. Additionally, several common
threads in the interviewees’ backgrounds came out of the interviews as well.

55

Chapter Five
Findings

The purpose of this research study was to investigate the experiences of librarians of
color in higher education as well as their perceptions of supports and barriers they faced in
becoming and being professional librarians. The following research questions guided this study:
(1) What supports and barriers have minorities experienced in becoming and working as
academic librarians?; (2) What perceptions do minority librarians have about being minority
librarians and their contributions, if any, to campus diversity?; and (3) What factors do minority
librarians perceive contribute to the small number of minority academic librarians?
Thematic Analysis
Data analysis began once each interview was transcribed and continued through reading
and rereading the full transcribed data set. The research findings reported in this chapter are
based on analysis of the transcribed recordings as well as follow-up emails. Five themes
emerged from the data analysis: (1) service and activism, (2) mentoring and networking, (3)
racial and other microaggressions, (4) campus diversity, and (5) natural born librarian. These
themes, which speak directly to the research questions, are independent of one another, but there
is overlap among them. Table 2 illustrates the relationships between the themes that emerged
and the individual informants. Table 3 illustrates the relationship across the themes and the
research questions.

Theme 1: Service and activism, or “service to some greater good.”
Librarianship is considered a helping or service profession and, while reviewing the
transcripts of the interviews, I was struck by the respondents’ dedication to service as well as
their calls to action and activism. Each of the nine informants broached topics alluding to the
theme of service and activism to some extent. Though seemingly two distinct themes, I
combined service and activism into one category. The responses from the interviewees showed
me that their service is tied closely with the propensity for activism. For example, Farah stated
that she was the only one on staff who actively spoke out against administration when issues
arose in the library. The service component touched on two separate branches of service:
service to the community at large and service to the library community.
When discussing service, Alexandra, Baldwin, and Dara all specifically mentioned
service to their communities either currently, in the past, or both. Both Alexandra and Baldwin
told me that they were active in student government as undergraduates. Baldwin explained, “I
was a member of the Black Student Union. I was an officer of the Black Student Union and we
were always pushing the university to broaden their outreach capabilities.” Alexandra and Dara
were actively involved in their communities as volunteers. Grace stated that a former employer
had recommended her for a scholarship based on, among other things, her “commitment to
service.”
Service to the library community was something that all informants talked about in their
interviews. This service commitment took many forms for the respondents though. Five of the
nine informants mentioned one or more professional library associations including the American
Library Association (ALA), the Black Caucus of the American Library Association (BCALA),
and the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL). Emery was very active in ALA

59

and BCALA for over 40 years and was involved in organizational governance as president and
treasurer for many years. Baldwin described himself as “active in ALA and ACRL” where there
is “never any shortage of service opportunities.” Several also mentioned state library
associations including groups organized to serve minorities in the profession. Involvement in the
various associations ranged from general active membership, to participation in educational and
professional development opportunities (for example ALA’s Emerging Leaders Program), to
holding office.
Library service also took the form of service within one’s own library. Most respondents
offered statements demonstrating their commitment to service at their workplace. For example,
Baldwin, Heidi, and Ian have all been actively involved in diversity planning for their respective
libraries. Baldwin shared his experiences on the diversity committee:
We have a diversity committee trying to address [the lack of diversity]. I was chair of this
committee … looking at recruitment procedures. Like really obvious stuff was being
missed like we weren’t advertising our jobs on Listservs. Like Black Caucus list-servs,
like wow, this is really low hanging fruit…. No wonder we’re not recruiting.
Constance declared that, in her current position, she hopes to “advocate for the staff”
while Farah stated that one has “to be an advocate for what you want in academia” and that she
will feel that she always has “to advocate for certain things for others.”
Activism is another common thread that ties together the informants in this study. Each
of the nine librarians I interviewed mentioned involvement in progressive activities or that there
was a perception of them as “fiery” or “a troublemaker.” Two librarians expressed frustration
that recent demonstrations on their campuses stemming from the spate of protests at the

60

University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016 were small and lackluster. Dara stated that the protests
she sees around campus are similar to the ones she took part in during the 1980s:
They hosted the Voices Happen in Missouri and other campuses across the country in the
last four or five months…I thought, that looks familiar. I was dealing with that; I was
protesting and all that myself 30 years ago when I was an undergraduate in the 80s. I’ve
told people … here, I said, “Trust me, what you guys are advocating and your
counterparts at Missouri and what they’re advocating, that’s been an issue for quite a
while.”
The respondents’ advocacy took other forms as well. As previously stated, several
librarians explained that, throughout their careers, they advocated for coworkers and staff.
Alexandra, Dara, and Farah each proclaimed that they felt strongly that the profession becomes
more diverse. Farah and Emory both described themselves as very outspoken at their
workplaces, using words like “fiery” and “troublemaker.” Heidi and Ian actively pursue
conversations to amplify voices traditionally kept silent and to try to find solutions regarding
equity. Heidi told me, “I feel like I can amplify voices that aren’t necessarily heard all the time. I
feel like I actually lucked out in a way to move forward certain things that I think are
worthwhile.” Heidi talked about her desire to be useful and work “in service to some greater
good.” Grace, while working at a conservative university, ordered a subscription to the Village
Voice because she felt it was important to introduce the students there to alternative lifestyles.
She dubbed this “peaceful diversification.”
The interviewees’ responses that relate to question two reflect the theme of service
and advocacy. With respect to question two, the informants’ reports about their perceived
contributions to campus diversity fall into the category of service to the library community. As

61

previously stated, librarianship is by nature a helping profession—as Alexandra told me, “I think
we as librarians, we are, when we take that American Library Association (ALA) oath, we’re
trying to help all of the people.” Several of the librarians interviewed identified service activities
that marked their contributions to campus diversity. Constance told me that “Since campuses are
becoming more diverse, especially considering the international student population, minority
librarians can certainly work to diversify collections and programming to reflect the student body
and faculty makeup.” Baldwin expanded on Constance’s thoughts:
In my experience here, minority librarians can have a tremendous impact on diversity
practices and initiatives on campus. An example right now being that librarians have
spearheaded a project to make sure that our collections are adequate to speak to all of
the populations of students and faculty that are here. This project sort of went up the
chain of command and has received official university support and funding. I've also
been able to serve on the diversity committees of other departments outside of the
library. The library is seen as something of a hub for university activity and so
librarians are often looked to to be proactive about things like this.
Heidi agreed that minority librarians add to campus diversity and related an example of how she
specifically does so:
In terms of adding to [diversity] on campus, I think I try to do that in my work. Like I
said, I try to do a lot of programs and events in the space and so I coordinate a lot of
different services that are in the library; we have the Writing Center and things like that.
It’s up to me if I want to invite other student services if they want to come here, and I do
reach out to specific ones that I don’t think have been, like I said before, may not have
been reached out to in the past. We have TRIO on campus … it’s a federally funded

62

program to support low-income or first-generation college students; and students with
disabilities. They do a bunch of tutoring and I know that they don’t have the space, so I
invited them over here and provided a room for one of their tutoring services. I’m talking
to students on campus about having an interfaith prayer room and finding out what their
needs are…. I also try to reach out to faculty of color or women faculty when I’m doing
things. I just started doing book displays; we just did Black History Month and now
we’re going to do Women’s History Month.
Theme 2: Mentoring and networking, or “I would be their buffer, much like my
mentor was in library school.”
Eight of the nine informants talked positively about mentors and mentoring indicating
that this is another important theme. Several interviewees had mentors in library school, at work,
or both. Five informants spoke of mentoring their students and staff. Some commented on
formal mentoring programs through library organizations while one was critical of how formal
mentoring programs work and advocated for changes. Networking is an associated concept that
four interviewees talked about.
Merriam-Webster defines a mentor as “someone who teaches or gives help and advice to
a less experienced and often younger person” (Mentor, n.d.). The same dictionary defines
networking as “the exchange of information or services among individuals, groups, or
institutions; specifically, the cultivation of productive relationships for employment or business”
(Networking, n.d.). Mentoring and networking both involve interacting and sharing with others
in a constructive and dynamic way.
Alexandra, Baldwin, Farah, Grace, and Ian had formal or informal mentors in library
school. Alexandra attended library school as a part of a minority fellowship. The fellowship
63

students in Alexandra’s cohort had an African American librarian as a mentor. Alexandra
reported that her mentor “would check in on us to see how things were going so we had an
opportunity to share” and that the mentor “was really there as a buffer, and that was good.”
Alexandra explained that the mentor invited the fellowship students to her house to vent and
unwind. She also helped Alexandra with school related issues; for example, Alexandra’s
fellowship stipend check did not arrive one month and her mentor assisted by interceding with
the proper office.
Mentoring situations do not always work as hoped however. Grace also was assigned a
mentor through the minority fellowship she was involved in. However, Grace said that she was
never able to meet any of the several mentors she was assigned because they were not located
near her and she was not able to travel to where they were located.
Baldwin, Farah, and Ian all had informal mentors in library school. Though Baldwin
found some of his theoretical classes to be tedious, he did allow that he had “some very practical
teachers” including a guest lecturer to whom he referred to as “kind of a mentor.” According to
Baldwin, this individual “was all about how [the curriculum] applies to the real world and …
connecting those dots with how the theory … actually works out.” Farah’s mentor came to her
fortuitously when she enrolled in a second Masters of Library Science (MLS) program. She had
left a previous MLS program after conflicts with a professor. While attending a Black Caucus of
the American Library Association (BCALA) meeting she happened to be seated next to the dean
of another library school. While they were chatting, the dean said that Farah “would fit in very
well at [his university], so I applied … and was accepted within a week.” She was assigned a
mentor who assisted her in learning about herself and her strengths and weaknesses. Farah
stated:

64

My mentor and supervisor was …Hispanic….The program was rigorous, but rewarding.
My writing was appreciated, my voice was appreciated. Being a Black woman…. I just
got to meet a lot of different people, engage in a lot of different conversations,
collaborative work, and like I said it was like I was welcomed and appreciated.
Ian believed that his professors in library school were very open to his perspective as a
Native American which was in stark contrast to his undergraduate advisor who steered him away
from researching topics related to his Native American heritage. Ian credited one of his
professors in particular, a woman of color, stating that she “is very receptive” to his viewpoint.
Mentoring relationships were not limited to those in library school. Constance and Heidi
both discussed the value of mentors outside of school. Constance stated that she had been
“fortunate to meet people who were very helpful” in advising and guiding her. She was quick to
point out that throughout her journey not all of her mentors looked like her. She also explained
that in regard to the promotion and tenure process, without “anybody guiding you and saying you
need to do this … that it makes it really difficult for you to get reappointed let alone get tenure.”
Heidi commented that she also “really benefitted from having mentors outside of library
school.” While working as a graduate assistant in her university’s library, Heidi’s supervisor
was a source of strong support for her. Her supervisor set up a mock interview for her and
looked over some of her job search materials. Although she proclaimed that she received no
support from her library school at all, Heidi did allow that there were a couple professors as well
as a part-time diversity person who “were actually useful sometimes” in giving her advice about
working in libraries.
Five of the people interviewed for this study indicated that they try to be useful and act as
mentors to their students. As Alexandra stated, “I would be their buffer. Much like my mentor

65

was in library school.” Constance also drew on her experience with mentoring and worked to
pay it forward. She said, “I was fortunate to get help from more than one place and I’m very
appreciative of that. If anybody asks me to do anything with students, you know, I pretty much
will say yes.” Farah also devoted time to mentoring students. She relayed a story of a young
African American man she decided to hire and mentor; she “saw something in him.” Farah
explained that his employment in the library was contingent not only on his doing a good job on
a digital project but also raising his GPA from a 1.6 to at least a 3.0. With Farah’s guidance, not
only did the student catalog hundreds of books for the project, he successfully raised his GPA.
Alexandra told me several times that she enjoys “developing people,” by which she
meant mentoring, encouraging, and helping people to “move on.” She expressed enthusiasm for
“encouraging librarians to get their doctorate so they can be part of the library school experience,
to teach and interact.” She asked, “How can we reach back and encourage someone else?”
Grace mentored many of the library staff while she was director of the library at the tribal
college. She wanted to encourage the mostly female staff members to take advantage of
educational activities in nearby cities away from the reservation. However, Grace’s well
intentioned efforts fell flat much of the time because her staff did not have the resources to
participate in those activities. This experience, coupled with Grace’s own experiences with a
mentoring program in library school, have led her to develop ideas about how formal mentoring
programs could be improved. Grace allowed that many diversity programs do have a mentoring
component but that it is not funded adequately. Grace’s mentors were not located geographically
near her so she was never able to meet them face-to-face. Furthermore, she felt that the way the
mentoring pairs are set up should be revised. There is often a huge responsibility/experience gap
between mentor and mentee, for example, a mentor who is a library director and a mentee who is

66

a newly hired cataloging librarian. Also, the mentor sometimes is simply too busy to work with
the mentee.
Constance mentioned the American Library Association’s (ALA) Spectrum Scholarship
program, which includes a mentoring focus. Alexandra and Emory spoke about the Black
Caucus of the American Library Association (BCALA) and its commitment to mentoring. But
several informants described networking as the result of membership in these organizations.
Mentoring and networking are interwoven concepts; both involve advantageous interactions
between people. Alexandra told me that, although she didn’t really network at first, she is now
actively networking as a member of BCALA. Alexandra said to me, “I’m kind of isolated here
so I depend on other people. As I said, I was with BCALA; they have a formal mentor
program.” Emery concurred. He revealed “for 40-some years I’ve been going to conferences,
and one of the things that sustained me was the interaction with other librarians twice a year at
those conferences.” Farah has also networked through BCALA and ALA over the years. Her
attendance at a BCALA conference led to her enrolling in a new library school. She has also
participated in various programs put on by library organizations where she can network. Farah’s
continued alliance with these organizations have allowed her to “keep going” and know that she
is “not in this by myself.”
Respondents’ answers to interview questions related to research question one reflect the
theme of mentoring and networking. Alexandra, Baldwin, and Farah all spoke of mentoring as a
positive source of encouragement and support. Alexandra engaged in formal mentoring as a part
of the fellowship she participated in. She stated, “She [the mentor] was really there as a buffer,
and that was good.” She added:

67

I would say … that it is a fact of life and I encourage people to network, to really get a
support group. I’m kind of isolated here so I depend on other people as I said I was with
BCALA, they have a formal mentor program. A couple years ago, maybe longer than
that, I had a mentor…. She has been a really good encouragement for me.
Alexandra also believed it was important to act as a mentor especially because many librarians of
color will be working in predominantly white organizations. She commented:
So I think what I will say if you are going to have that, it’s unfortunate even in the 21st
century, that we still haven’t dealt with [the fact that librarians and libraries are mostly
white]…. I know that some of the library schools are trying to improve on it …
encouraging [minority] librarians to obtain their doctorate so they can be part of the
library school experience, to teach and interact. But also to encourage those to step up
and get into those places of administration and leadership.
Farah told me that, “with regard to support, in my own experience, having a network of
individuals that work within the professional library sphere and outside of the environment has
been a plus for my career.”
The respondents also explained that lack of mentoring or networking opportunities
constituted barriers to their becoming and working as academic librarians. Dara cited “little or
no mentoring on any rung of the career ladder” as a barrier, particularly to those on the tenure
track. Farah told me that there is no support where she works due to a campus-wide “hostile
environment.” Heidi stated that, though she felt that her supervisor and dean are trying to
support her, they don’t know how. One respondent felt that mentoring and networking through
professional organizations is also lacking. Baldwin explained:

68

I don't think there has been an awful lot of support. There are a few funding and
scholarship opportunities out there for minorities going into the profession, but once
you're out there doing the work, it's a little difficult. There are some mentorship
opportunities through professional organizations, like the Black Caucus of the ALA. I
have had a very mixed experience with groups like that. Not everyone is looking to be a
mentor or even a colleague or friend. The BCALA, for example, has been actively
fighting the perceptions that its members can be cliquey or that outreach isn't its strong
suit. Unfortunately, my experience with them is that those efforts to combat those
perceptions are very much necessary.
Alexandra noted that another barrier is self-imposed; she cited the “unwillingness on part of the
person or other staff to network within the institution or get involved in professional associations
and organizations” as an impediment at work.
Participant responses to interview questions related to research question three also
reflected this theme. As our interview was coming to a close, Emery stopped me and told me
that there was something else that he wanted to talk about, mentorship. He explained that the
mentoring he received sustained him throughout his career. As a member of several professional
library associations, most notably the Black Caucus of the American Library Association
(BCALA), Emery related:
We were working with peers but also being role models for the people coming after us.
And a lot of people looked up to me and I looked up to a lot of people who were ahead of
me in the profession. And it’s really gratifying now to look around the country and look
at people who were library directors, university library directors who have come up

69

through the system and they’re achieving things that I did not think were possible when I
was back in library school in 1965.
Other interviewees also indicated that mentoring would help recruit and retain minorities to the
profession. Baldwin said, “I think that [librarianship as a career] can be better sold by mentors in
the field and professional organizations, as well as advisors in MLS programs across the
country.” Grace agreed and offered that the lack of mentors can also be seen as
microaggressions that simultaneously require minorities to assimilate into dominant culture
while also relegating them to second class citizen status. She stated:
Institutions recruit for diversity but often do not provide supportive environments for
retention of the hired diversity candidate. The minority hire frequently does not have a
peer group amongst colleagues and is funneled towards committees and service that tend
to segregate them with students who are minorities.
Dara summed up many respondents’ feelings when she stated that there is “little or no mentoring
on any rung of the career ladder.”
Theme 3: Microaggressions or, “and I’m like, ‘Do not touch my hair’.”
Unfortunately, another way that most of the nine respondents are not by themselves is
that they all spoke about activities that can be labelled microaggressions. Alexandra told me
that, while in library school, her classmates excluded her and the other person of color in their
cohort from study groups. She said, “[In] some of the discussions in the classes were, they were
wondering why can’t the urban librarians do this, why do the librarians have to help those
communities, meaning people of color.” Alexandra twice commented that her classmates felt
that she and the other student of color “were just there for affirmative action.” Emery stated that

70

he chose a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) so that he would “be looked at for
what [he was] doing, not looked at because [he was] the only black student in class.”
The path to finding a job can be fraught with barriers too. Constance related several
issues she felt were racially charged barriers to education and employment for minority librarians
in higher education. Constance first mentioned that people “want to hire the known quantity,”
“people hire who they know.” She also pointed out that many library school programs are set up
for full-time students which hinders many students of color who would like to enter the
profession: “So some class offerings that you wanted to take were only offered in the daytime,
which left people who were … going part-time and making career changes, it might have left
them at a disadvantage.” Constance meant that, in her opinion, minority students generally do
not have the means to attend graduate school full-time or to work for free to gain experience and
that the majority white library establishment’s historical insistence on these two hiring criteria
constitutes a microaggression. She called out the library system for giving preference to recent
Masters of Library Science (MLS) graduates who have worked, or at least volunteered, in
libraries:
There’s so many people that are entering librarianship as a second career. They literally
don’t have the opportunity to quit their job, or work another job, or go volunteer to get
experience so someone can say, “Oh you worked at a library so then I can hire you.” I
have a bias against that and [it is] my own personal feeling; I can’t say whether that’s
backed up by data. But I can say that at least people of color are at a distinct
disadvantage [because they do not have the opportunity to do volunteer work].

71

Constance worked full-time while attending library school and spoke from experience. While
searching for her first library job, Alexandra was told that she was young and didn’t have the
necessary experiences yet. She wondered how she was supposed to get that experience.
Grace also talked about the stigma of affirmative action. She stated that when people of
color are labelled or self-label as minorities they are then tagged as affirmative action hires
whereby whites think that any praise a minority hire receives is based on the color of their skin
rather than any merit. Heidi related that when she arrived at the university for her job interview
she noticed that it was “very white” and that when she gave her presentation there were no
people of color in attendance which worried her.
Other respondents discussed specific events at their workplaces. Baldwin relayed the
story of a work-life satisfaction survey that was implemented on his campus. As he and others
were reviewing the responses they noted that “some of the comments were really disturbing.
Our people were saying things like, ‘Is diversity even an issue anymore?’ and, ‘I oppose
quotas.’” Baldwin discussed microaggression training on his campus and how “people in that
meeting expressed that they felt like they were always nervous because they didn’t want to say
something that was offensive.” Ian mentioned a similar situation where he works. Although he
began by stating that he has “never really been harassed or anything like that for being Native
American,” he continued that there is not much discussion of racial issues and added that “when
you try to talk about it there’s a lot of … you can feel like it kind of changes the atmosphere in
the room.”
Culture clash plays a role as well; some microaggressions communicate to minorities that
they must assimilate into the dominant culture and that their own cultures are not good enough.
For example, after working very hard to get a server for her institution it was removed from

72

Grace’s library due to perceived staffing shortages. In native culture it is a common occurrence
for traditional funeral services to last for four days resulting in staffing shortfalls. Grace had to
work hard with the state library organization to have the server reinstated. Dara offered another
example; she shared that she clashed with a co-worker of Latino descent. Dara always got the
feeling from this individual that she was not “the right type of black person.” And Baldwin told
me, “People say things without thinking about the implications… Like silly things like wanting
to touch my hair. ‘It’s so different and exotic!’ And I’m like, ‘Do not touch my hair.’ Why would
someone think that’s acceptable?”
Heidi left me with strong words about administration’s place in the discussion
surrounding microaggressions in the workplace. She asserted, “I think a lot of it has to do with
the fact that they haven’t read up on the ideas that have to do with, basically, white privilege, or
about who created these institutions and put these structures in place, and about how that might
not be comfortable for people of color.” She added, “Maybe it just has to do with thinking
critically about how you talk to your librarians of color. The term ‘microaggressions’ is around
for a reason. And even … having a diversity committee that, I think, makes a difference.”
In responses to interview questions related to research question one, the theme of
microaggressions was prominent. Six of the interviewees spoke about microaggressions as
barriers for people of color who wish to pursue a career as an academic librarian. These
microaggressions take on many forms. Traditionally, many minorities are at a distinct socioeconomic disadvantage, an example of an environmental microaggression. Several respondents
discussed the financial burden of pursuing a Master’s in Library Science degree. Constance
explained:

73

I think the barrier to entry for librarianship is higher than some other professions like say
being a teacher or nurse, which you could be with a bachelor’s. But being a librarian
means you have to get an MLS, and very often the pay is lower than those jobs that you
only need a bachelor’s degree.
Dara concurred. She felt that both the debt that students incur as undergraduates as well as the
perception that in order to work as an academic librarian a second advanced degree is required
are hindrances for minorities who may think about pursuing librarianship as a career. Ian offered
a personal example:
My mom financed her entire undergraduate and graduate education through student
loans. She’s 66 years old now and she still has tens of thousands of dollars of debt
because she didn’t have that kind of support, you know. Consequently I don’t have as
much support from her that one of my white friends would.
Grace told me about her experience trying to encourage her employees to take advantage
of professional development activities, offering an example of how the dominant culture
“pathologizes” a culture as well another example of environmental microaggressions. She
encouraged the women employed at the library to attend educational sessions 70 miles off of the
reservation. Her employees resisted, telling her that they were embarrassed to attend because of
their clothing, which they thought would stand out as weird in the majority white towns. The
employees had no money for lunch. Her employees could not even afford to attend training let
alone incur debt in the attempt to further their education. However, microaggressions rooted in
socio-economic factors are not the only barrier the respondents identified.

74

Microaggressions figure prominently in the responses of the interviewees. Baldwin
discussed his experiences as one of only two librarians of color at his institution offering another
example of how those in the dominant culture perceive other cultures as deviating from the
norm, as exotic or foreign:
One of the things I never have been able to shake is that I often get the feeling that if I
say something that because the frame of reference of my colleagues is so small…they
think I’m speaking for more than just myself. Like “that’s the black librarian’s
perspective on this.” No, this is just mine. But it’s kind of just like a feeling, some
people have tried to generalize it in that way. And I try to [discourage] it when I hear it
but I feel like it’s kind of more widespread than it should be. This idea that we have our
token black librarian, and he can give us our diverse opinions on these things. It does not
feel very good. It feels very isolating to not have people with similar experiences in the
organization. So if I talk about something I don’t know if people are really relating to
what I’m saying. Like when I talk about microaggressions here and things like that, like
does it only exist in theory for people in this room…. People say things without thinking
about the implications. I’ll hear it and I’ll know you really shouldn’t have said that. It’s
offensive. But it’s hard to explain that to someone in the moment.
Constance related a story about a job interview where the Chair of the Friends Board was
present along with some library employees; the chairperson, exhibiting what Sue et al (2007)
explains as the dominant culture’s perception of a person’s deviance, in this instance a perceived
inability to get to work on time, asked Constance if, because of where she lived, she would be
able to get to work on time. Constance responded, “if I got to the interview on time, I should be
able to get to work on time.” She told me:
75

Also, in terms of this being a professional position, I thought, is this really your major
concern? I’ve got a resume that says I have had jobs for years. Clearly if I had a problem
getting to work on time, I’m thinking they would have fired me by now. I was just, at
this time again I was new and I thought, is this the kind of questions we’re asking
professional people? Is this the kind of people that we’re, that are allowed to intervene in
an interview? I talked to the director later and he said, “I’d really like to hire someone
like you. You’ve got a background that I’m looking for. This is a second career for you.”
But I guess [the board chairperson] was the person who blocked it.
Ian had mixed emotions about his experiences as a person of color in the library though his
example fits into what Sue et al (2007) termed color blindness. He told me:
I have never really been harassed or anything like that for being Native American. It’s
just when you try to talk about [diversity] there’s a lot of…you can feel like it kind of
changes the atmosphere in the room [to something negative]. All of a sudden you’re the
old New One talking. I guess…. I expect that conversations will still be touch and go.
People will probably continue to not want to offend, and of course in doing so, not really
having answers to the questions that they have. Or not really change some essential
attitudes that get in the way of progress. And so I guess I look at my future in
librarianship as wanting to have the conversation and trying to find solutions. I’m
hopeful for change but I’m also realistic based on my experiences here that change will
be hard to accomplish. You know, we are looking at demographic shifts in the United
States. White people are going to be less than 50% of the population, and I don’t know
that will necessarily make things more equitable. You know what I mean? I think things

76

still might be, power might still be located in white communities, regardless of the
demographic situation.
The respondents also discussed other negative perceptions they had sensed about the
contributions of minority librarians to campus diversity. Their observations are examples of
what Sue et al (2007) called the myth of meritocracy, or the tendency of whites to assume that
people of color received an unfair advantage because of the color of their skin. They felt that the
majority population on campus saw minority hires as contributing to campus diversity because of
higher education’s focus on increasing diversity and tendency towards affirmative action hires.
Ian told me:
I think I make a statistical contribution, being a Native American, right? ... I’m part of the
project of getting libraries to reflect the communities they serve. So there’s that, but the
thing is, as far as what I do, I think it’s tough for me. I would like to be able to just exist
as a librarian, you know. I would like to not have to worry about bringing up a
conversation that is difficult for people to have. It would be nice to feel like, normal?
Like this is just a career that I’m doing and not a cause that I have to fight for. At the
same time I realize if I’m not doing it, it’s not very likely that somebody else will be
driving that conversation. I feel an extra responsibility for that, and I know people in my
experience are likely to look to me for that. Because I am that statistic right? A number
on the chart of People of Color.
Other respondents made comparable comments. Grace related that sometimes there is the
perception that minorities are hired to meet a quota. Grace further stated that, when minority
librarians are hired, the institution doesn’t truly value “the individual for professional
accomplishments on par with other librarians and faculty.” She continued:
77

Not infrequently, non-minorities will ascribe well-earned and well-deserved promotions
and recognitions given to those with minority status as due to minority status and not due
to hard work and high standards. There is even hinted inference that minorities are held to
lower standards, a subtle branding of assumed inferior socioeconomic class. As if
affirmative action hires are a sophisticated form of welfare.
Heidi felt her employers were able to “check off [a minority] box” when they hired her.
Constance stated that:
You know, or you should know, that if you are a member of a minority group, you will
be one of the few, or sometimes the only minority person working. Often times the staff
members may have more minority members, but the professional ranks will be made up
mostly of white females. I don't think many students think of librarians as faculty
members, so students don't think about librarians when discussing campus diversity. If
there is a focus on diversity within the library by students, that focus may be directed
towards collections and/or programming, but not staffing. Also, if they see minority
people working in the library, they have no idea who is a librarian and who is a staff
member.
Though many were positive about their contributions, the respondents clearly believed that their
contributions to diversity on campus are very often looked at as fulfilling a requirement rather
than being welcome additions.
The theme reemerged in responses to interview questions related to research question
three; several respondents mentioned barriers that can be termed microaggressions. Money, the
lack of which inhibits someone’s access to higher education, was mentioned as a barrier. This

78

socio-economic obstacle is an illustration of what Sue et al deem an environmental
microaggression, a systemic level microaggression. Constance told me that the expense of a
graduate degree could be a barrier for many who might have otherwise sought a Masters in
Library Science (MLS) degree. Grace, Farah, Dara, and Baldwin concurred. Grace stated that,
beyond the necessity of an MLS, many academic librarian positions require a second master’s
degree in a subject specialty area “which can be an insurmountable hurdle after overcoming the
other hurdles of getting through high school and undergraduate programs.” Both Farah and Dara
also mentioned that lack of funding for graduate school is a barrier for minorities resulting in a
low economic pay-off for people choosing librarianship as a career. Baldwin added:
I also think that there is a lot of competition from other disciplines. Disproportionately
few minorities, especially African Americans and Latinos, go for advanced degrees, so
when they do, there is probably a desire to get as much value as they can from them.
Hence, becoming lawyers, MBAs, engineers, etc. holds more appeal as a choice for the
relatively few of us who have the opportunity, inclination, and means to get a graduate
degree.
Theme 4: Campus diversity or, “the library faculty is not diverse,” or “there’s
nothing like the black college experience.”
All of the people interviewed for this study talked about either predominantly white
institutions (PWIs) or libraries, or Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) or
Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs). Some mentioned both. In context, the interviewees
discussed their job searches or working environments having a majority white population or
about attending or working with a mostly minority population at an HBCU or TCU.

79

Heidi and Alexandra both mentioned that during their job searches, they were struck by
the “very white” institutions where they first interviewed for jobs. Heidi got the job; Alexandra
did not. Though Heidi was concerned about the lack of minorities at her interview and
presentation, she thought that since she was not planning to stay at the university forever she
would just “see how it goes.” Though Alexandra did not get the job, the one person of color she
saw at the university, a non-librarian staff person who turned out to be the person who showed
her around the university, called her later to tell her she did well and to wish her luck in her job
search. Six of the respondents divulged that their current workplaces are, as Dara proclaimed
“very much a certain hue” by which they meant staffed by mostly white people. Alexandra,
Baldwin, Constance, Dara, Heidi, and Ian all expressed varying degrees of concern regarding
their monochromatic work environments.
Two of the librarians interviewed attended HBCUs. Dara chose an HBCU because her
school had a “long history of educating black librarians.” She added, “There is nothing like the
black college experience.” Emery grew up in a “very white part of the country” where the only
classmates of color he had were siblings and cousins. He chose an HBCU “to get more involved
with the black experiences.” He appreciated the experience that he and his fellow African
American students had stating that “we were all there together. … I just knew most of the
African American librarians because so many of us had gone to [the same university].”
Though they did not attend an HBCU or TCU, Farah and Grace worked at an HBCU and
a TCU, respectively. Farah summed up her experience as follows:
To be a librarian of color, I think it’s a great thing to have started at a HBCU. I
never would have thought that would happen ever, in a million years. I don’t

80

know why I say it like that but I just never thought I’d be at an HBCU. It’s been a
rewarding experience.
After completing her MLS, Grace returned to her previous job but soon answered an ad, applied
for, and was hired to be the library director at a TCU library. She expressed pride at her
accomplishments at this institution where she served 500 customers each day from both the
college and the local community. She shared a memory of a fulfilling art program for children
where the art instructor worked for two days putting together a mural inspired by the symbolic
and sacred four-point stars made by the native children who participated in the program.
The theme of campus diversity was seen in participants’ answers to interview questions
related to research question three. Interviewees talked about environmental factors that hindered
minorities in pursuit of a career in academic librarianship. While public libraries boast many
librarians of color, libraries in academe remain predominantly white. Farah asserted that the lack
of library school programs in general, as well as at HBCUs, is the prime reason that “our
profession is lacking diversity.” So even when students can raise the funds to attend, they must
be near one of the 50 accredited MLS programs in the United States (which are clustered to the
east of the Mississippi River) or be admitted to one of the 27 all online programs. If, like Dara
and Emery, MLS students wanted to attend an HBCU they would have only two programs from
which to choose; no Tribal College or University (TCU) or Hispanic Serving Institution (HIS)
has an MLS program.
When a person of color does receive an MLS, the job search can be a barrier to
employment into academic libraries. Constance related that “there are also more jobs within the
public library sector, so people who want to be a librarian might be able to find a job faster in a
public library than in an academic library.” In fact, Alexandra, Emery, and Dara all began their

81

careers in public libraries. Baldwin had initially thought of public librarianship before finding a
job in higher education and Candace interviewed for a public librarian job before landing her
current appointment. Grace worked in both a public library and a university library that also
served the local population.
The stereotype of the typical librarian can also be a barrier. As previously related by
Constance, Farah, Heidi and Emery, academic librarians are predominantly white women. Heidi
and Alexandra also see retention as a problem. Heidi said, “I think it has to do with retention.
Once you’re here, they don’t have to do anything special to keep you here.” Alexandra added,
“In the past, the focus has been the number of minorities represented and not being considered
for promotion. My personal observation is that the next generation librarians are more aware of
the leadership qualities and managerial skills needed to build a strong career.”
Theme 5: Natural born librarian or, “I grew up in a family of readers.”
When interviewing the informants, four mentioned a childhood enhanced by books and
reading. One librarian spoke of family trips to the local public library and involvement in
summer reading programs. Dara described herself as “a bookworm as a kid” who spent her
“summer vacations at the library.” Other librarians I interviewed spoke of their decision to
pursue librarianship as a career because of their desire to be involved in research, education, and
reading.
Alexandra, Constance, Dara, and Emery all discussed reading and books and indicated
that their love of reading led them to librarianship as a career. Alexandra offered that she and
her family were frequent library visitors and she knew she wanted to be a librarian from an early
age. In fact, she called it a “childhood dream. I grew up in a family of readers.” Dara also spent
summers in the library as a child and was influenced to become a librarian after observing one of
82

the black librarians at the library and thinking she had the “coolest job …. to spend all day with
the books.” Emery had an uncle who inspired his interest by gifting him books. And Constance
quipped, “I learned of librarianship as a career … and of course, I like to read and those people
just sit and read all day.”
Research and education also played a part in some respondents’ desires to become
librarians. After completing various undergraduate degrees, and while deciding on where they
wanted to go next, Baldwin, Farah, and Ian looked inward and realized that their love of reading
and research was a natural fit for librarianship. Heidi acknowledged that she likes “being able to
learn new things all the time” and that being a librarian is a perfect occupation for her for that
reason.
It is interesting to note that all nine respondents spoke about a love of reading, research,
or life-long learning indicating that minority librarians often look at their profession as a calling
tying this theme to research question three. Alexandra was always involved in summer reading
and knew she wanted to be a librarian at an early age. Baldwin wanted to continue working in
research and education as well as give back to the community. He stated:
I think that librarianship is not sold very effectively to minority undergraduates as a
career option. When it is, it's more often packaged as a way to give back to the
community in more of a 'public library' setting. That's wonderful - that's why I initially
went to library school.
Ian and Farah talked about their love of research and both saw librarianship as a perfect vehicle
for them to continue with research activities. In addition, Farah wanted to help others. She
recounted:

83

when I started researching when libraries opened up to black people in the United States
of America I mean, it was close to the 1960s when we could walk in [to a library] without
anybody having to say anything to us … I was just like you know, this is history. I’m
making history. This is not something small here…. It was something that I knew I
needed to do for myself to be able to serve and help others.
Constance also wanted to help others “find the information that they needed.” She
cautions however, that, I also think many people think anyone can be a librarian, so librarianship
is not often considered a viable career.” Grace had always had a strong commitment to service.
She was working in a library when her supervisor noted her passion for helping people and
recommended her for a prestigious minority fellowship; she completed library school in one
year. Heidi enjoyed helping others as well as lifelong learning. She said:
I always knew that I wanted to help people in some way, and my previous attempts at
careers in other fields I did not really feel like I was ever working toward anything that
was particularly helpful or maybe useful in the way of like service to some greater good.
I like being able to learn new things all the time, and I definitely think as a librarian I am
able to do that. Because I’m on the public services side, so I get to interact with people
which I really enjoy.
Dara, who spent her summers reading at the library, decided to change careers. She told me:
That positive imagery [of the library] stayed with me well into my adulthood and when I
was thinking about changing careers, I was in higher education before as a counselor. I
thought about maybe switching gears and I thought, how about librarianship, and I
looked into it. And I think I found my niche.

84

Emery worked in his high school library and at the Library of Congress while earning his
undergraduate degree. He never pondered another profession because “librarianship has been it
from the beginning.”

85

Chapter Six
Interpretation and Conclusions
With the increasing diversity of the higher education student body in United States, and
the continued monochromatic nature of the faculty, including academic librarians, in higher
education, it is important to explore the reasons why people of color are not seeking to become
librarians in higher education. The purpose of this study was to investigate minority librarians’
experiences in higher education and their perceptions of supports and barriers encountered in
becoming and being professional librarians. Present and future library leaders will be able to use
the information gathered in this study to address the issue of the lack of librarians of color in
higher education. Chapter four contained descriptive information about the settings and
participants and provided context for the study. Chapter five consisted of an analysis of the
findings of the study based on interviews with informants.
Based on the data analysis, five themes emerged. The first theme is related to the spirit
of service and activism apparent in the librarians’ responses. The second theme focused on
mentoring and networking as a part of the experience of becoming and being an academic
librarian. Microaggressions emerged as the third theme, emphasizing the daily indignities that
minorities often experience. The fourth theme evolved from the interviewees’ discussions of
their school and work environments as predominantly white institutions (PWIs), Historically
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Tribal College and Universities (TCUs). The
fifth and final theme highlights the love of libraries and reading that the interviewees had as
“natural born librarians.”
This chapter features interpretation of the five themes in relation to current literature in
the areas of diversity in education, particularly in higher education, diversity in libraries, and
86

microaggressions. In addition, themes will be discussed in relation to Critical Race Theory.
Implications for practices in higher education, particularly academic libraries, and
recommendations for future research will be discussed.
Theme One: Service and Activism, or “I see libraries as pivotal and helping … even
more so now.”
The nine interviewees in this study all discussed aspects of their character and work
which emerged as the theme of service and activism. This theme does not appear prominently in
prior research. However, librarians and libraries have been beacons for service and activism for
many years, beginning with the annual American Library Association (ALA) conference in 1936
in Richmond, Virginia. The conference organizers balked at the venue’s discriminatory racial
practice and declared that any part of the venue under the Association’s control during the
conference would be open to all regardless of race.
Librarians’ commitment to service and activism carried forward to the 1960s where
librarians were activists for social justice in the United States. More recently, newly appointed
Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first African American and woman to ever hold the
office, was praised for keeping the Baltimore Public Libraries open to patrons during the 2015
riots in that city after a young black man, Freddie Gray, died suspiciously while in police
custody. A year earlier, the library in Ferguson Missouri became a haven for locals during the
often angry protesting that erupted after Michael Brown, an unarmed black man, was shot and
killed by police.
This study adds to the limited research in this area because service and activism emerged
as such a strong theme. Each respondent in this study noted specific behaviors and activities
related to service and activism such as actively working on diversity initiatives and being an
87

advocate for fellow employees. Previous research such as Winston and Quinn’s 2005 study of
403 articles published in peer-reviewed library science journals around the world between 1999
and 2003 indicated that there was an increased focus on “war and terrorism and large-scale
economic and technical change” in the library literature though the literature did not, however,
note specific steps library leaders are taking in terms of service or activism. On the other hand,
this study reinforces Hicks’ research (2016) which found that many librarians felt that advocacy,
for the profession as well as libraries and library services, was a professional activity, meaning a
part of their jobs, as well as research by Wolverton and Heiselt (2009) which found that
community service was an important part of librarian’s jobs at Mississippi State University.
The study participants all spoke of their service and activism within the community and
within the profession. The respondents shared a commitment to service and activism with
former and current librarians indicating a potential identifying characteristic which could help in
the recruitment of minority librarians to academe.
Theme Two: Mentoring and networking or, “where I currently work there is no
support”
Eight of the nine respondents talked about mentoring and/or networking, both formal and
informal demonstrating the importance of this theme. The interviewees indicated that they felt
that mentoring and/or networking was, for the most part, a positive experience and that the lack
of mentorship opportunities was a barrier. Additionally, mentoring and/or networking with other
librarians of color was seen as particularly beneficial. This study reinforces prior research in K12 settings which has shown that minority students benefit from same-race teachers (Dee, 2004)
and that same-race teachers also serve as mentors and role models (Egalite, Kisida, & Winters,
2015; Milner, 2006). This study also reinforces research into similar issues which exist in higher

88

education. Coleman (2008) and Watson et.al. (2002) write that students of color in higher
education lament the lack of support that could be achieved through interaction with faculty of
color. Coleman (2008), Crisp, Taggart, & Nora, 2014, and Price (2010) contend that minority
faculty have positive influences on their students of color. This study expands on the prior
research as it addresses the issues of mentoring and networking of and for librarians of color in
higher education.
The interviewees indicated that mentoring and networking opportunities, though not
always optimal, served them well during school and at work. Respondents lamented the lack of
mentoring and/or networking options. This study adds to the literature on the positive effects of
mentoring in library school and in libraries (Gieskes, 2010; Goodsett & Walsh, 2015; James,
Raynor, & Bruno, 2015; Kenefick & DeVito, 2015; Lee & American Library Association, 2011;
Lorenzetti & Powelson, 2015; Munde, 2000; Rastorfer & Rosenof, 2016) and in particular the
literature that identifies mentoring as a benefit for librarians of color (Damasco & Hodges, 2012;
Gandhi, 2000; Howland, 1999; Johnson, 2007; Le, 2015; Olivas & Ma, 2009; Ross, 2013).
Theme Three: Microaggressions or, “you kind of have a sense of who is for
you and who is against you.”
The interviewees in this study also identified microaggressions as barriers to becoming
and working as academic librarians. Four respondents discussed economic issues that they
perceived as racial microaggressions. Three respondents identified racial and/or socio-cultural
microaggressions that they had experienced during their journeys.
This study reinforces prior research in this area. Minority faculty in higher education are
generally underrepresented, paid less, and discriminated against because of their appearance and
their research foci (Delgado-Romero, Flores, Gloria, Arredondo, & Castellanos, 2003; Pittman,

89

2012; Verdugo, 2003). Often, faculty members of color are given the impression that they are
Affirmative Action hires (Verdugo, 2003), are seen as having less education (Alabi, 2014) and
are, similar to several of the interviewees, assigned to race-specific roles such as diversity-related
committee work (Pittman, 2012). Additionally, this study is consistent with prior research which
has revealed that faculty of color are often relegated to race-specific coursework or committee
assignments however they are also treated negatively by the majority due to the perception that
minority faculty members’ culture-based research represents personal or political motivation.
Current literature on academic librarians of color is limited as is the literature on
microaggressions in academic librarianship. This study adds to the research in these areas.
Several interviewees felt they were the token diversity hire and as such were expected to be the
voice of their ethnicity. Baldwin explained that he believed that colleagues looked to him as the
voice of all African Americans while Ian expressed that he felt as if he was looked upon as the
diversity expert based solely on his race. Both Baldwin’s and Ian’s experiences are examples of
what Delgado and Stefancic (2012) describe as minorities’ status as an indication of “presumed
competence to speak about race and racism,” a clear example of a behavioral microaggression.
These examples show that microaggressions can be non-verbal as well as what Sue et.al. (2007)
term a microinvalidation. According to Sue et.al. (2007), a microinvalidation is a
communication that effectively negates a person of color’s “experiences as racial/cultural
beings;” the assumption that one minority speaks for their entire race invalidates that individual’s
personal experiences.

90

Theme Four: Campus Diversity, or “I happen to be in a very white state at a very
white institution.”
All of the respondents in this study talked about campus diversity in one way or another.
Dara and Emery deliberately chose to attend HBCUs. And Farah and Grace chose to work at an
HBCU and a TCU, respectively. Alexandra, Baldwin, Constance, Dara, Heidi, and Ian were
disturbed by the lack of diversity at their workplaces.
This study reinforces prior research that found that minority students in K-12 settings feel
more comfortable in a classroom led by a teacher who shares their race and culture because
students perceive that white teachers think less of them (Dee, 2004; Dee, 2005; Egalite, Kisida,
& Winters, 2015; Milner, 2006; Paloma, 2014) and that students of color in higher education do
not feel that they can relate to the predominantly white faculty and administration (Coleman,
2008; Price, 2010; Watson, Terrell, Wright, Bonner, Cuyjet, Gold, Rudy, & Person, 2002). This
study also adds to the research into the experiences of faculty of color at predominantly white
institutions (PWIs) (Shealey, McHatton, McCray, & Thomas, 2014; Stanley, 2006).
This study also expands on the limited empirical research on the lack of diversity in
academic librarianship. Prior research has found that minority students have felt affronted or
ignored by white librarians in higher education and that the students would welcome more
diverse library staffs and collections (Bonnet & McAlexander, 2012; Elteto, Jackson, & Kim,
2008; Long, 2011). Prior research has also studied recruiting minorities to the profession
(Buttlar & Canyon, 1992; Hussey, 2009; Roy, Johnson-Cooper, Tysick, & Waters, 2006), and
job satisfaction of minority librarians (Alabi, 2015; Bugg, 2016; Freedman, 2012; King, BallardThrower, & Mills, 2009; Neely, 2009; Squire, 1991; Thornton, 2000). This study examined the
experiences and perceptions of minority librarians in higher education in their own words rather
91

than through survey, thus giving voice to individuals who have traditionally been voiceless. In
contrast to a survey which generally gathers statistical data, qualitative research collects rich
descriptive data that chronicles the thoughts and impressions of interviewees. The two
interviewees who chose to attend HBCUs both described intense feelings for being involved in
the black college experience. Emory’s discussion of his unique experience of growing up in a
very white community and then seeking to explore his blackness by attending an HBCU could
not have been addressed as powerfully through a static survey.
Theme Five: Natural Born Librarian, or “I knew I wanted to be a librarian at an
early age.”
This study is consistent with prior research such as Julian’s 1979 study which found that,
of the 56 library school students sampled, 27 (48.21%) had visited a library before age six yet
only 18 (32.13%) had considered librarianship as a career before college. Twelve respondents
decided on librarianship as a career while employed in other fields (Julian, 1979). Forty-nine of
the students (87.5%) were or had previously worked in a library (Julian, 1979). Dewey’s
research found that interaction with a librarian was the most compelling factor in the
participants’ decisions to become librarians (1985). Ard et al (2006) detail studies by Van House
(1988) and Gordon and Nesbit (1999), as well as anecdotal information from librarians
indicating that positive experiences with libraries and librarians as well as a love of reading
influenced the choice of librarianship as a career. Ard et al found that 89% of their study
participants only chose librarianship as a career while attending college or after graduating from
college (2006). Paralleling the prior research, all but one of the participants in this study
expressed a love of reading and libraries, often from a young age, as well as positive

92

relationships with librarians. Several interviewees mentioned that they had not thought of
librarianship as a career before college and a few chose librarianship as a second career.
This study adds to prior research in that it identifies that the study participants not only
felt a calling towards books and reading, and in turn librarianship, but also a propensity for
service and activism. Additionally, this study adds to the body of knowledge in that it gives
voice to the librarians of color interviewed by recording their experiences and perceptions in
their own words.
Theoretical Interpretations
This section will address the interpretation of the themes in relation to existing theory
using Critical Race Theory (CRT). I chose critical race theory as a lens for this study for several
reasons. First, it fits well with ethnography, creating critical ethnography which Madison
explains as a way to address unfairness and injustice (2005). Milner adds that in critical
ethnography knowledge is gained through the voices of people of color (2012).
Critical race theory as defined by Delgado and Stefancic began as a movement that
evolved to study and transform “the relationship between race, racism, and power” (2012, p.3).
In this study, racism refers to the power certain individual groups maintain as the result of beliefs
that a person or persons of one cultural group are inferior to the dominant group based on culture
and/or skin color. For example, when one respondent was repeatedly asked to explain her
actions and account for her time when none of the majority culture employees were asked to do
so. Institutional racism, or the activities and patterns that promote oppression in the institutions
and systems in which we work and live, has been evidenced in this study as well. Interviewees
in this study, for example, described their discomfort at being in job interviews conducted by all
white panels rather than racially diverse ones.

93

Exemplifying that stance, Delgado and Stefancic identify several tenets of CRT: racism
is not aberrational; interest convergence, where the white majority has little incentive to change
the status quo that benefits them, exists; race is a social construct rather than a scientific fact;
differentiated racism occurs when different minority groups are discounted at different times
depending on economic factors; intersectionality is the set of conditions a person experiences as
the result of the intersection of their social statuses, for example one could be a male, Native
American college student; and minorities are fundamentally able to talk about race and racism
due to the fact that they are minorities. The themes identified in this study were examined to
determine how and where they fit within the tenets of CRT. The results are summarized in Table
4.

Table 4
All of the themes identified through the collected data in this study reflect at least one of
the CRT principles. The nine informants in this study relayed many negative stories about their
experiences and perceptions which mirror the CRT tenets. The interviewees’ discussions of
events and impressions of barriers they faced at school or at work illustrate the overarching CRT
premise that, despite years of changed laws and evolving attitudes, “racial inequality permeates
every aspect of social life … [including] the schools we go to…” (Zamudio, Russell, Rios, &
Bridgeman, 2011, p.3). The respondents offered examples that support the assertion that racism
95

is a normal, everyday occurrence rather than an unusual one. For example, respondents reported
having a commitment to activism and participating in events that stem from racial or other
injustice such as Dara’s participation in protests in the 1980s. Furthermore, several of the
individuals interviewed described explicit instances of racism they had experienced. One person
was excluded from a study group while in school based purely on her race. Another interviewee
chose an HBCU for library school because he wanted to be seen purely as a student and not a
“black student.” Interviewees have had to address prejudiced comments and small-minded
actions by those they work with. The interviews illustrate the everyday racism they have faced.
Another aspect of CRT is also reflected in the interviews—the concept of interest
convergence. Several interviewees felt that their predominantly white institutions (PWIs) were
quite content with people of color being added to the ranks since it helps the university add to
campus diversity though the campuses remain very monochromatic. Other respondents felt coworkers looked at them “as affirmative action hires whereby whites think that any praise a
minority hire receives is based on the color of their skin rather than any merit.” Though the
numbers of librarians of color on campuses remain low, the interests of the majority white
campuses are met by the addition of just one or only a handful of minorities.
Even when the majority does make more of an attempt to recruit people of color to higher
education or a profession in order to appear more diverse, it does not do much to assist minorities
to overcome the barriers they face in becoming and working as professional librarians. One
interviewee offered the example of her mentor/mentee relationship while a part of a minority
fellowship. The mentoring program was neither well designed nor sufficiently funded. Another
librarian interviewed related that she felt her supervisors don’t think critically about race or
racism at all.

96

Interestingly, Delgado and Stefancic write that, despite the common misconception that it
is a scientific fact, the concepts of “race and races are products of social thought and relations.
Not objective, inherent, or fixed, they correspond to no biological or genetic reality; rather races
are categories that society invents, manipulates or retires when convenient” (2012, p.8). One of
the librarians I interviewed related that people have asked to touch his hair calling it “different”
and “exotic.” He was outraged. Although born in the United States, the interviewee’s physical
appearance was deemed foreign because it did not conform to the white norm.
All of the interviewees discussed PWIs, HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and
Universities), or TCUs (Tribal Colleges and Universities). Respondents indicated that their
experiences at HBCUs and a TCU were valuable and rewarding. I note this because HBCUs
were designed in the 1890s to “serve the educational needs of black Americans” (U.S.
Department of Education, 1991) thus perpetuating the segregated educational system that
stemmed from the white majority’s unfounded “notion of a distinct biological type of human
being, usually based on skin color or other physical characteristics (emphasis added)” (Delgado
& Stefancic, 2012, p. 170). Tribal colleges (TCUs) came about in the 1960s as the result of the
American Indian Movement and Native Americans’ push for more self-determination (American
Indian Higher Education Consortium, 1999). Historically, Native Americans have been at a
socio-economic disadvantage and higher education was unattainable for the most part. TCUs
allowed Native Americans to take control of their own education, bypassing, to a certain extent,
the institutional racism inherent in higher education in the United States (American Indian
Higher Education Consortium, 1999). The different ways in which HBCUs and TCUs came in
to being foreshadow the CRT tenet of differentiated racism. According to Delgado and
Stefancic, differentiated racism “maintains that each disfavored group in this country has been

97

racialized in its own individual way and according to the needs of the majority group at
particular times in history” (2012, P.77).
The data I collected as the result of this research indicated that the interviewees
experienced microaggressions differently. Four of the African American respondents described
experiencing racial microaggressions in either library school or at work. On the other hand, the
Native American library school student stated that he had never felt ill at ease at his workplace
because of his race. The Native American retiree spoke to me about the “stigma of affirmative
action,” though she did not relate to me any stories where she felt personally affronted for her
heritage.
Referring to the interviewee in the previous paragraph as a female Native American
retiree illustrates the next tenet of CRT I will discuss: intersectionality. Intersectionality is the
concept of the intersection of one’s various and varying positions such as race, gender, class,
sexuality and citizenship status. The respondents in this study were people of color, both male
and female. Some were at the beginning of a career while two have retired. They grew up in
low-income families and in middle class families. CRT scholars note that most civil rights work
is only singly dimensional rather than multi-dimensional and does not view people as multifaceted (Zamudio, Russell, Rios, & Bridgeman, 2011). Individuals, or whole classes, can
experience multiple disadvantaged or privileged statuses at once, further reinforcing the
disparities between those individuals and groups. For example, one of the interviewees is a
working class African American female who came to librarianship as a second career. When she
decided to pursue a second master’s degree, in Library Science, she had to continue working to
support herself. She faced challenges in library school. Because she worked full time during the
day, she was forced to take classes in the evening which left no time for her to volunteer in a

98

library to gain experience. Many library supervisors, as in many professions, prefer to hire
individuals with experience putting this woman at a double disadvantage because of both her
race and her social class. Another respondent pointed out that often the white majority ascribe
an inferior socioeconomic status to individuals based solely on race.
The focus of this research is the experiences and perceptions of academic librarians of
color. Though looked upon favorably for the most part, the profession of librarian on a college
campus is often viewed by others on campus, in particular the teaching faculty, as unequal. The
terminal degree for a librarian is a master’s while the terminal degree for most teaching faculty is
the doctorate which leads some members of the teaching faculty to question the status of
academic librarians. Thus minority librarians in higher education face the stigma of their status
at the institution as well as that of race.
The last tenet of CRT that I will discuss has to do with “the notion of a unique voice of
color” (Delgado & Stefancic, 2012, p.10). This idea suggests that “minority status … brings
with it a presumed competence to speak about race and racism” (Delgado & Stefancic, 2012,
p.10). Many of the interviewees noted that they had been actively involved in representing their
libraries and institutions on various diversity committees and that they feel that they are the
“diversity person” in their library. One librarian told me that he often feels as if the majority
white group of librarians in his organization look to him to provide the “black librarians’
perspective.”
The results of this study illustrated the tenets of CRT, most strongly in relation to the
theme of microaggressions. There are also notable links between CRT and the themes of service
and activism and networking and mentoring. The relationships between CRT and campus
diversity and the natural-born librarian are the weakest in this study. Identifying the

99

relationships between the themes identified in this study and CRT can, according to Zamudio,
Russell, Rios, and Bridgeman, make a positive impact by documenting racism in everyday
experiences (2011).
Implications for Practice
Based on the findings of this study, I suggest potential implications for practice for
present and future library leaders in addressing the issue of the lack of minority librarians in
academic libraries. The interviewees in this study have offered suggestions and the themes that I
identified as the result of data analysis offer some additional ideas for practice.
Many of the respondents in this study discussed their commitment to service and
activism indicating a willingness to help and serve. Identifying students or library employees of
color who have a dedication to service, most notably in the library, could be a useful tool in
finding potential recruits to the profession.
Mentoring and networking were also talked about by the interviewees in this study. In
the spirit of service to others, several respondents stated that they have actively sought to mentor
others including students and co-workers. In general, the respondents spoke very highly of the
mentoring they received as well as the networking opportunities they had. The mentoring and
networking experiences often stemmed from the interviewees’ membership in professional
organizations including the American Library Association (ALA), the Black Caucus of the
American Library Association (BCALA), as well as a facet of their library school experience.
This theme indicates that once individuals decide on librarianship as a career, mentoring and
networking is a vital component for success in their careers.
Though mentoring is a part of many library school programs and library organization
efforts, I recommend that all of these programs and endeavors be assessed to note any areas for
100

improvement. Additionally, subsidizing the mentoring efforts would be beneficial. One
interviewee noted that she was never able to meet her mentor face-to-face. A subsidized
mentoring trip might have helped that relationship to grow and be more beneficial.
Another very important theme that emerged from the study data is that of
microaggressions. Most of the respondents explained how they had experienced some form of
offense, either a comment or an action, which reinforced a societal stereotype. Although the
term microaggression has been around for a while and many organizations are realizing that they
need to address diversity and issues in a diverse workplace including microaggressions. Yet,
despite the focus on diversity, the interviewees in this study indicated that racism and other
forms of discriminatory practices are alive and well. One interviewee summed up how
microaggressions could be combatted when she stated that she wished that her supervisors would
read about “white privilege” and think more critically about how they speak with and interact
with librarians of color. Unfortunately, even after years of training and talking and directing
energy towards the destruction of racism, it remains an ever-present fact of life.
The library community, particularly the academic library community, has an opportunity
to address the problem of microaggressions head on through the development of different types
of training programs. I attended an LGBT Safe Space training program where the workshop
leader handed out different colored paper stars. The training participants were asked to bend
back different arms of the stars to represent different events that typically occur in the lives of
LGBT youth, for example a family disowning the young person or bullying. We stood and held
our bent stars and got a glimpse into the daily world of many LGBT youth. An interactive
approach to teaching our colleagues about microaggressions could have a bigger impact than
traditional lectures and discussions.

101

Campus diversity, or the lack thereof, is another fact of life in the United States. Most
interviewees attended and/or worked at a predominantly white institution (PWI). A couple of
them went to historically black institutions (HBCU) where they enjoyed the camaraderie of an
all-black college. One stated that he knew most of the African American librarians because they
had all attended graduate school together. Other interviewees worked at either an HBCU or
TCU (Tribal College or University). They both expressed honor and joy at being able to serve
those particular populations. Only one of the Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI), San Jose State
University (SJSU) in California, offers a Masters of Library Science program. In 2005, after
years of debate, the School of Library and Information Studies at Clark Atlanta University, an
HBCU, closed its doors as the result of money problems and declining enrollment (Mulligan,
2006). At the present time, there are only Masters of Library Science programs at two of the
HBCUs and no programs at TCUs. Attending and/or working in an HBCU or TCU was noted as
a fulfilling experience for several of the respondents in this study. Their responses suggest that
recruiting could be enhanced by at the least targeting HBCUs, TCUs, and HSIs. Another option
would be to fund and support a Master’s of Library Science degree program at a TCU, and/or
HSI.
Dovetailing with the discussion of campus diversity and library schools is the theme of
the natural born librarian. The interviewees talked about their love of reading and research.
Targeting undergraduates of color in disciplines that are reading and/or research oriented would
help identify students who may be more open to considering a career in librarianship. One thing
colleagues and I have noted at our library is that many of the Graduate Assistants that we hire go
on to library school. Establishing a program to “Grow Your Own Librarian,” similar to the
“Grown Your Own Teacher” programs could be a way to recruit minorities to the profession. As

102

described in a U.S. News & World Report article about “Grow Your Own Teacher” programs,
“many of the best candidates already live in the neighborhood” (Ramirez, 2007).
Strengths and Limitations of the Study
Due to the nature of qualitative inquiry, the findings in this study cannot be generalized.
However, an argument can be made that the experiences and perceptions discussed by the nine
study participants would be similar to those of other librarians of color in higher education
because of the similarities in Master of Library Science programs as well as in academic
libraries. Locating a wide variety of study participants using snowball sampling was a strength
in this study. Study participants were both male and female, represented three racial minority
groups, as well as varying socio-economic statuses. The interviews and follow-up emails, along
with member checks and continual reflexivity allowed for thoughtful interpretations.
Quantitizing the data, systematically counting patterns in the data as well as instances of certain
words or statements, also helped strengthen the study. For example, I counted the number of
recurrences of certain words and phrases prior to categorizing them and identifying themes.
A limitation of this study was the necessity to conduct the interviews by phone since the
study participants were located all across the United States. I was unable to observe the
participants’ body language or facial expressions because the interviews were by phone. I had
20 responses to my initial email request for participation. I was only able to interview nine
individuals for this study but I hope to be able to interview the other email respondents at a
future date.

103

Recommendations for Future Research
Five themes emerged from the data in this study which can guide future research in this
area. The themes of service and activism, mentoring and networking, and the natural-born
librarian could guide research on effective recruitment and retention of minorities to the
profession as well as productive mentoring programs. Though the profession has been
addressing recruitment, retention, and mentoring, there remains a small number of academic
librarians of color. A future study could assess the types of mentoring activities that are
particularly beneficial to current minority librarians.
The theme of microaggressions could guide research on microaggressions in the
academic library as well as research on effective training programs about microaggressions and
racism. Though there is training available that address these issues, it would be helpful to study
what types of training are available, what types of training have been effective and what types of
activities could be developed to address the issues of microaggressions and racism in the
academic workplace. For example, researchers could conduct a qualitative study following
participants through a training program to identify participant perceptions of the training
program.
The theme of campus diversity could guide research on minorities in academic libraries
and research on minority librarians in academic libraries. The respondents in this study indicated
that the racial makeup of the colleges they attended as well as the institutions where they worked
was an important factor in their choice of college, their choice of workplace, and their own
comfort level. Several interviewees indicated they were uncomfortable as minorities in a
predominantly white institution (PWI) while others indicated they felt secure and relaxed as
African Americans at an HBCU or as a Native American at a TCU. Examining race and racial
104

attitudes on campus and in the academic library, including the comfort levels of minorities in the
organization, could be beneficial to administrators in identifying problem areas in their
organizations. Research has been conducted examining the positive relationships between samerace teacher and student but little effort has been put towards study of the effects of same-race
librarian and student. This area of inquiry would be beneficial to explore and could assist
libraries in pursuing a more diverse workforce.
Final Reflection
The findings in this study add to the limited body of empirical research on the topic of
librarians of color in academe. This study also expands on the numerous biographical and
anecdotal stories that have been shared by librarians of color in that it offers qualitative data to
reinforce the study findings. The nine folks interviewed shared the stories of their experiences
and perceptions of becoming and being academic librarians, providing insight into the question
of why there is such a small number of minorities in librarianship in higher education. The data
show that academic librarians of color have experienced positives and negatives in their journeys
to academic librarianship.
All of the respondents were very generous with their time and thoughts. I have followed
up with each of them and hope to add to this study with additional follow up interviews. I also
hope to interview more librarians of color in academe to continue to delve into the question of
why there are so few of us. I have presented some initial findings of this study but I hope to
continue to do so in order to ensure that the profession continues to address the issue of the low
numbers of librarians of color in higher education.
