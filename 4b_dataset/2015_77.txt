RECORDS AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER: UNDERSTANDING THE RECORDS
CONTINUUM AS A FRAMEWORK FOR EXAMINING THE ROLE OF RECORDS
IN A COMMUNITY

Heather A. Soyka, Ph.D

University of Pittsburgh, 2015

The central purpose of this dissertation is to examine an archival theory, the records continuum,
to understand how the continuum highlights, reveals, or obscures qualities relevant to
understanding community co-created records. Previous research related to the records continuum
has been largely concerned with understanding the theory and with how records are created,
captured, and organized using the continuum.
Relatively few studies have looked at how community records can be understood using
the records continuum, or how those records can be read through the dimension of pluralization,
when they are shared with a broader societal audience. To address this concern, this research
looked at the active behavior of the administrative team for an online forum of active duty
military officers in shaping and re-presenting the community using records created and built on
the forum. Taking an exploratory case study approach, this research draws connections between
thematic threads and forum posts written by members of the community, and later reuse and
reactivation of those writings for a different, broader audience. A key finding is that values
embedded and inherent in the community records creation process are hidden, or not explicitly
measured or made visible by using a continuum approach. This is significant because it could
pose a problem for future understanding of the situated context of the records that have been
infused with values and shaped by their communities of creation.

This dissertation could not have been completed without the support of colleagues, friends and
family. This work reflects the inspiration, mentorship, guidance and kindness that so many
people have given me over the years. You are my force multipliers.
In part, my dissertation topic emerged from many discussions with my chair, Dr. Richard
J. Cox. I sincerely appreciate his guidance during this process, and I admire his ability to see
everything through a recordkeeping lens. I am also grateful to my committee members, Dr.
Jeannette Bastian, Dr. Brian Beaton, and Dr. Alison Langmead, for giving of their time and
energy to this project. Thank you for the many great ideas and suggestions that shaped this
project from start to finish.
I owe a special debt to the amazing team at CALDOL. I am firmly convinced that there is
no other group in the world that could be so enthusiastic and supportive as this one. Many, many
thanks to MAJ Jonathan Silk, COL Peter Kilner, COL Nate Allen, COL Tony Burgess, and Tom
Morel, as well as the entire CC community. Thank you for being so FIRED UP about your work
and mine.
My colleagues in Australia provided much in the way of support, companionship, and
conversation, particularly on my visit to Monash University. I am indebted to the Records
Continuum Research Group: especially Joanne Evans, whose good humor and determination was

INTRODUCTION

In military parlance, a force multiplier is a factor or combination of factors that significantly
increase the effectiveness of groups, instruments, or tactics. Used as a tool for learning, identity
building, connecting, and knowledge transfer, the records of a community and its work can act as
a force multiplier. Seeing community recordkeeping as a force multiplier emphasizes the
contextual nature of records as they play a critical role in the strength, effectiveness, and
longevity of a community. Records and recordkeeping can be viewed as factors that facilitate
shared memory and cohesion and enable members to share experiences and learn how to situate
themselves in their community.
One such group where records-making and recordkeeping activities are a core element of
the community’s shared memory, cohesion, and purpose, is CompanyCommand, an online
community of US Army officers who are past, present, or future commanders of company units.
A company (sometimes also battery, troop, or detachment) is a basic unit of organization within
the US Army. Comprised of 120 or more soldiers and typically led by a captain, “a company is a
cohesive tactical sized unit that can perform a battlefield function on its own.” 1 A captain with
approximately five to eight years of Army service leads this organizational unit for an average of
eighteen months as the company commander. This is the first rung of leadership on the US Army

command ladder to be granted full command authority, including the responsibility for
administering the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Due to the evolving nature of the
current operating environment, more responsibility and power continue to be increasingly
delegated down the chain of command to the company level.
Believing that the Army’s formal education and training program did not sufficiently
prepare officers for the challenges that come with commanding an Army company, then-MAJ
Tony Burgess and then-MAJ Nate Allen2 conceptualized, developed, and implemented
CompanyCommand in the early 2000s with a group of like minded colleagues as an online
forum for officers to discuss with and learn from each other about leading US Army companies.
Now in existence for close to 15 years, the CompanyCommand forum serves as an online
community that focuses on creating written accounts, narratives, and discussion to support
learning and knowledge exchange.
This dissertation explores the ability of the records continuum to serve as a theoretical
lens to analyze the roles that records play in records-intensive communities, such as
CompanyCommand. The records continuum, first articulated by Australian archival scholar
Frank Upward in the mid-1990s, provides a theory of records and recordkeeping that considers
the place of records over space and time, and in multiple, shifting, evolving contexts. 3 The
records continuum provides a way to make sense of the complexities of recordkeeping,
particularly in a digital environment.

This dissertation carries out an examination of the records continuum by using the theory
as the main analytic framework to describe the role of records and recordkeeping in one case,
CompanyCommand. Next, I examine the use of the records continuum as a theoretical
framework for this case study. Thus, while CompanyCommand is the object of study in this
dissertation’s case study, the case study serves as a vehicle to examine the records continuum,
which is the core focus of this dissertation. In this research project, the records continuum is used
in a case study as an analytic tool for describing and exploring United States Army officers’ use
of CompanyCommand, an online professional forum and community of practice, to share their
experiences within a closed, professional community. In turn, this dissertation examines the
capabilities and limits of the records continuum to explore and understand the role of records in a
community. The results of the case study are primarily presented in Chapter 5 (Results) while my
discussion about the records continuum as a theoretical frame for examining community records
is primarily discussed in Chapter 6 (Discussion).
There are relatively few case studies in the archival literature that use the records
continuum as a framework for understanding records generated by communities and that
specifically frame the issue of layered records that have multiple creators over time and space
that serve to actively create, shape, and sustain the community. The records continuum provides
an analytic structure to tease out the relationships between these records and their evolving and
dynamic contexts, creation, management and use. These layered records are always in a state of
becoming4 as they continue to accrue additional layers of meaning and contextual metadata over
time. This study seeks to add to the developing recordkeeping literature related to continuum

thinking, information culture, and community records that is beginning to coalesce as the next
generation of recordkeeping and continuum scholarship.5 In doing this, I hope to extend
discussions about future directions and possibilities for the records continuum.

1.1

THE PROBLEM

The purpose of this research is to examine and analyze the use of the records continuum model
as an approach for broadly understanding the complex records of communities. Almost two
decades after the publication of the first fully realized conceptual model by Australian
recordkeeping scholar Frank Upward, the records continuum remains an important theoretical
construct in the international archival studies canon.6 While at least one recent study has applied
the records continuum (and continuum thinking) to community archives and others have
mentioned its possible utility,7 additional work is necessary for understanding how the records
continuum may serve as a theoretical lens for examining community records.

5

This emerging set of conversations, loosely known as the third generation of continuum
scholarship, is further discussed in Chapter 2. This designation as the third generation relates to
observations that the evolving discussion is moving from establishing the continuum as a
framework, to further understanding its implications as a construct. The work of Gillian Oliver
and Fiorella Foscarini related to information cultures, the research of Joanne Evans on metadata
and sustainable archival systems designed with continuum thinking, the work of Frank Upward,
Barbara Reed and Joanne Evans on recordkeeping informatics and the research of Leisa Gibbons
on the cultural heritage continuum are several examples that fit with this discussion.

Others have noted recently that the continuum might provide a useful framework for examining
community archives, such as Stacy Wood et al., “Mobilizing Records: Re-Framing Archival

This dissertation has employed the records continuum model as a framework for
exploring a set of community records constructed and shaped by multiple creators, and
administered and actively moderated by a team of officers within the US Army. For this
research, I have used the CompanyCommand case study to critically examine the records
continuum model as a framework for understanding the multiple and complex roles of records in
community formation. Two definitions from archival scholarship serve to situate this
exploration. British archival scholar Andrew Flinn’s definition of community delineates “groups
who define themselves on the basis of locality, culture, faith, background, or other shared
identity or interest.”8 Canadian archival scholar Terry Cook noted that people and groups with
shared interests are coming together and “creating records [that] bind their communities together,
foster their group identities, and carry out their business.”9 While both Flinn and Cook were
describing the construction of memory, or of historical records with community archives as the
outcome, their definitions are also flexible enough to describe active community recordkeeping
systems such as CompanyCommand.
Used in many fields, case studies are a tool of inquiry in which the researcher develops
an in-depth analysis of a case, event, activity, process, or one or more individuals. 10 Cases are
bound by time and activity, and researchers collect detailed information using a variety of data
collection procedures over a period of time. A single case is appropriate when it is critical,

unique, or revelatory.11 A study of a single case enables the researcher to investigate a
phenomenon in-depth, enabling a rich description and revealing its deep structure.12 This case
study is a useful prism for examining how layered records and information move through space
and time within and outside of a geographically and temporally distributed community and
across a complex organization between peers; and how knowledge-generating practices may be
shaped and reshaped by the actors, the information infrastructure, and the act of co-creating
shared, multilayered records. This community recordkeeping system is useful as a case study
because the records are active and the core work of the community is centered on the records.
This does limit the direct applicability of this research to how the records continuum serves as a
theoretical frame for examining the nature of records in communities where recordkeeping
activities, the sharing of knowledge, and the exchange of written texts are at the core of their
existence. Many online communities and communities focused on learning, such as
CompanyCommand, have these records- and data-intensive characteristics. The central role of
records in CompanyCommand provides a fertile ground for exploring the complexity of records
and their roles within a community. The findings of this research will contribute to an
understanding of the records continuum that can be extended in subsequent research to examine
how this theory can be used to investigate the nature and role of records in a broader set of less
records-intensive communities where records are only a by-product of other activities.
Using the CompanyCommand forum as a case study, this dissertation explores what the
records continuum model exposes about the structure, topography, infrastructure, decision-

making, assumptions, and ecology of a community. This has allowed me to examine the
relationship between the community records creation context and the shaping, use, and representation of those records as they move through time and space. Using this case has allowed
for extended exploration and critical analysis of the records continuum model through all four of
its dimensions (create-capture-organize-pluralize), which are discussed in greater detail in
Chapter 2. Themes that involve community building, leadership, social learning, organizational
learning, and professional communities of practice will be discussed as factors that contribute to
records creation within a community. By using the lens of continuum thinking to examine this
case, I aim to unpack these multi-layered and complex narrative records that have different and
evolving uses both simultaneously and over time and space.
Understanding the evolving nature of records created in virtual spaces that are not
bounded by traditional notions of fixity, physicality, or temporality is essential for archivists,
recordkeepers, and other memory workers that are grappling with contemporary digital records.
Online community forums provide the place and space for these conversations, and can also be
an avenue for examining the nature and visibility of community interaction in the virtual sphere.
While the records continuum model is often raised as a possible tool for conceptualizing digital
problems, more research is necessary to reveal challenges, opportunities, and issues about the
continuum as a theoretical approach for examining community records and recordkeeping
systems.
This study has also provided an opportunity to discuss not just knowledge sharing, but
also the construction of personal, professional, and collective memory by and about experiences
of war from the individual to the societal level. Additionally, the records continuum as a critical
lens for examining this case has enabled the exploration of three linked issues contributing to the

7

construction of the community records: the individual accounts of deployment and activities in
Iraq and Afghanistan that become linked through active participation in the forum space; the
structure and community of CompanyCommand and how that has developed a culture of active
records creation as a community building block; and the process of peer learning, teaching, and
support through the acts of records creation, use, reactivation, and dissemination.

1.2

RESEARCH QUESTION

The central question framing this study is:

What can applying the records continuum to the Company Command case study
reveal about the nature of the framework as a theory for understanding the role of records
in a community?

1.3

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY

This dissertation outlines a project of study that is, at its core, centered on examining the records
continuum as a framework for documenting and understanding records generated by a specific
community. The results of this study focus on analysis of the records continuum and discussion
of its use for describing complex records created by a multifaceted community. This dissertation
examines three central findings raised by using the CompanyCommand case study to examine
the records continuum, namely: that the origins and heritage of continuum thinking shape its use
and are important to understand; that the complexities of the records continuum model and
8

continuum theory form a useful starting point for examining community co-created records but
merit further research; and that additional work and discussion of the records continuum as a
theory for exploring records at a community and societal level forms the next challenge for
continuum research.13
By using an instrumental case study as a vehicle to examine what is highlighted and what
is hidden by the records continuum approach, this dissertation provides a set of viewpoints that
evaluate and explore the application of continuum thinking to complex co-created community
records.14 Because the records continuum continues to be an important contribution to the
recordkeeping and archival science literature, and particularly because of the possibilities that the
theory holds for addressing complex records, organizations, and communities, it deserves
additional discussion and much more analysis.
Examination of the structure, work, and records created by the CompanyCommand
administrators and members could hold broader implications for many other community-created
records, not just those related to the military and armed conflicts. The records and recordkeeping
system are central to the ongoing work of the community, and could be described in complex,
layered ways using a continuum approach, rather than a records life cycle approach to thinking
about community recordkeeping.15 Because the work of the CompanyCommand community is

Discussion about records at the societal level is known as “pluralization.” The records
continuum and pluralization will be discussed with much more depth in Chapter 2.

centered in the active records and recordkeeping system, essentially the records form the ongoing
core of the community, not documentation of the community after the fact. This case study
facilitates the opportunity to examine how the records continuum can provide a theoretical
framework for examining the role of records in a records-intensive community where its records
are in a repeating state of creation, use, and recreation. Most importantly, this study seeks to
understand and critically analyze the application of the records continuum model as a useful
theoretical approach for understanding sites of layered records that have resulted from
collaborative, community work, and that have a variety of overlapping uses, interpretations,
creators, and roles.

1.4

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Within the context of the dissertation’s case study about records and recordkeeping in
CompanyCommand, the records continuum is used as the main theoretical frame for analyzing
and understanding the case. This analysis is supported by the concept of semantic genealogy,
which provides an additional intellectual grounding for understanding the use and reuse of

his 1998 Archival Issues article, which states: “The life cycle model for managing records, as
articulated by Theodore Schellenberg and others, has been the prominent model for North
American archivists and records managers since at least the 1960s. . . . This model portrays the
life of a record as going through various stages or periods, much like a living organism.” Bantin
further notes in his article that because the life cycle model tightly defines not just what happens
to a record at each stage, but also who holds responsibility for managing the record, this
depiction has contributed (particularly in North America) to the strict demarcation of
responsibilities between the archives and records management professions.

records across time and space, and the concepts of communities of practice and the social theory
of learning, which provide a way to understand CompanyCommand. I recognize that these
theories, like all theories, are contested concepts with strengths, weaknesses, permutations, and
multiple interpretations. All theories merit examination and questioning. I use the records
continuum as a theoretical lens to examine community records and recordkeeping within the
CompanyCommand case study. I then examine and question the performance of the records
continuum as a theory for understanding community records and recordkeeping. This kind of
examination and questioning of semantic genealogy and communities and practice and the social
theory of learning is beyond the scope of this dissertation. These theories are used cautiously to
help inform and frame the analysis of the CompanyCommand case study.

1.4.1 Situating Theory

Theory defines us. Theory motivates us. Theory explains us. Theory makes for better archives
and archivists. But theory is not a monolithic series of “scientific” laws objectively true in all
times and places, but rather an on-going, open-ended quest for meaning about our documentary
heritage that itself is ever evolving.16
Professionals and scholars look to theoretical frameworks to help them to make sense of
complicated experiences, and to make complex situations manageable, understandable,
consistent, and meaningful. Theories, models, and perspectives emerge and evolve from human
experiences. A core aspect of the archival profession is to understand, describe, preserve, and
provide access to the records of groups, individuals, and institutions in order to contribute to the

of Archival Theory (Duluth, Minnesota: Litwin Books, 2008), xix.

11

documentary record of our society.17 One important tool for framing this work is the use of
theory.
Theory can be described as a tool that provides a structure for understanding complex
situations by connecting elements that appear to be random, and organizing elements that are
otherwise chaotic. Theory can be used to describe human behavior—to explain, to predict, and to
generate new knowledge and research. In one broadly used metaphor, Paul Leedy compares the
use of a theoretical framework to drawing and designing an architectural structure as a
foundation prior to the construction of new knowledge.18
Theory should help scholars and professionals to develop a more comprehensive and
precise understanding of institutions and related processes and dynamics in order to inform and
transform practice.19 Models and theories are presented through literature, and informed by both
practice and scholarly discourse. While theories and models are sometimes conflated in
discussion and practice, models differ from theory in that they are designed to support practical
application, discussion, and pedagogy. To extend Leedy’s metaphor in the previous paragraph,
models often form a practical structure for understanding theory, and in architectural work,
sometimes a small-scale physical model is even built to reflect theoretical ideas in an accessible
format.

17

Conversations regarding the development of archival identity, including those that discuss
developing institutional practices that demonstrate a commitment to the archival mission
(archives in response to administrative needs) or to the historical mission (archives as a response
to researcher and historian needs) or to both, generally agree on these core aspects of archival
work. For one example, Luke J. Gilliland-Swetland, “The Provenance of a Profession: The
Permanence of the Public Archives and Historical Manuscripts Traditions in American Archival
History,” American Archivist 54, no 1 (Spring 1991), 134-135.

12

Theory development also occurs because of shifts in understanding. In essence, theory
can be a description of the intersections and relationships between concepts and constructs.
Formal criteria exist in other fields for critically evaluating theory. One initial approach used by
many fields including psychology, education, and sociology includes education scholar Cecil
Patterson’s eight criteria for evaluating a theory: 1) that it should be important, not trivial; 2)
precise and understandable; 3) comprehensive; 4) simple and parsimonious but still
comprehensive; 5) able to be operationalized; 6) empirically valid or verifiable; 7) able to
generate new research, new knowledge, and new thinking and ideas; and 8) useful to
practitioners. However, it is likely that many theories will not meet all eight of the criteria. 20 The
use of theory as a tool may also be reflexive. One way of using and understanding a theory is by
evaluating it, both in relationship to new literature and research, and within professional practice,
in order to stretch and refine both model and theory over time.21

1.4.2 The Records Continuum

This dissertation centers on the records continuum model developed by Australian recordkeeping
scholar Frank Upward, an archival practitioner and later an academic who has played a leading
role in shaping Australian archival theory in the late-twentieth and early-twentieth centuries and
was one of the founders of the critically important Records Continuum Research Group at
Monash University. The records continuum model aims to be an all-encompassing framework

that casts the organizational recordkeeping process in four dimensions—create, capture,
organize, and pluralize—and four axes—evidentiality, transactionality, recordkeeping, and
identity. Upward’s articulation builds upon the work of Anthony Giddens, a twentieth-century
British sociologist who has written influential works on the nature of sociology and frames for
studying and understanding societies. Upward’s development of the records continuum was, in
particular, influenced by Giddens’ structuration theory, which is a framework for considering the
relationship between systems and individual actors and that recognizes that human activity is
mediated by communication and organizational contexts.22 The essence of structuration theory in
relationship to continuum thinking, as described by Gillian Oliver and Fiorella Foscarini, is the
recognition of duality of agency and structure as constantly affecting and changing each other,
which creates a theoretical foundation that recognizes the fluid and changing nature of
information.23 The records continuum suggests a set of concentric circles through which
archivists can discuss the ongoing relationship between recordkeeping and the identities of actors
involved with records creation, ranging from individuals to societies.24
The case study within this dissertation is framed using the four dimensions of the records
continuum (Create, Capture, Organize, Pluralize) as the lens through with to examine the case’s
object of study (CompanyCommand). Through this framing, the CompanyCommand forum can
be viewed as a recordkeeping system at the micro (documents and acts) level but also seen as

extending all the way up to the macro, or societal memory level. Using the create-captureorganize-pluralize pattern, the records continuum model can serve as a framework for
approaching what Upward and McKemmish describe as “…issues relating to the postmodern
condition—a professional landscape filled with people operating in different spacetime universes
but drawing on a common professional knowledge base and similar skill sets.” 25 By using the
records continuum as a theoretical frame to analyze the case study, the forum may be understood
not just as an information system that supports the community of Army officers that use
CompanyCommand, but also as a system of records that documents this community of Army
officers. Using the records continuum as the theoretical tool for this case study provides the
opportunity to examine what the records continuum can say and illuminate about community
records, particularly those in records-intensive communities.

1.4.3 Semantic Genealogy

While not a core theoretical framework for this research, this study draws inspiration from other
archival scholarship, including Eric Ketelaar’s notion of semantic geneaology.26 Ketelaar argues
that “each activation leaves fingerprints that are attributes to the archive’s infinite meaning. The
archive is therefore not static, but a dynamic, open-ended process. All these activations are acts
of cultivation determining the record’s meaning… Each activation is also a (symbolic)

appropriation: using the records for one’s own purposes and finding one’s own meaning in it.”27
By considering instances of records creation and context within the CompanyCommand forum
and using the records continuum to trace the activations and reuse of these records within a case
study about community records, we can think more fully about records that hold multiple
purposes and meanings over space and time. This aligns with the fundamental insight (and
nascent origins of the records continuum) of Peter Scott, an influential archivist at the Australian
Commonwealth Archives, who, in 1966 argued for the consideration and description of multirelational contexts as an intellectual container.28 Scott’s recognition of the importance of context
and the interrelated nature of records contributed to the creation of the series as a basic building
block of the Commonwealth Archives Office. Through the efforts of Scott and Commonwealth
Chief Archives Officer Ian Maclean, the Commonwealth Records Series system (CRS) was
implemented in Canberra in 1966, forming the basis for an Australian archival school of thought
regarding the management and intellectual control of current records.29 This contextual approach
also aligns with archival thinkers such as Terry Cook who use a postmodern perspective to
explore the authorial intent and functional context that lies behind the record. 30 These archival
ideas are useful for considering the recordkeeping implications of systems that structure the

of narratives, records, and knowledge shared as part of the information system.

1.4.4 Communities of Practice and the Social Theory of Learning

The design of this study has also been supported and supplemented by the use of theoretical
frameworks from education, professional military literature, and sociology to understand the
context of the CompanyComand community. Learning as a participatory social practice is the
focus of communities of practice, which form the site(s) where collective learning is
accumulated. Communities of practice theory was a central part of educational anthropologist
Jean Lave and sociologist Etienne Wenger’s work, Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral
Participation, where they identified “legitimate peripheral participation” as the way that
newcomers learn new practices from other members and are in turn shaped by those practices
they have learned.31
Wenger went on to expand his theories of social learning in later work. The communities
of practice (CoP) concept as stated by Wenger is defined as “groups of people who share a
concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and
expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis.” 32 Wenger and Lave theorized
communities of practice through ethnographic research that included participant observation and

interviews. In the course of their field research they identified multiple viewpoints within CoPs,
which provided the basis for their claim that CoPs are complex and multilayered.33
The CompanyCommand founders and administrators use the community of practice
concept articulated by Wenger and Lave as a way to conceptualize and explain their work.
Wegner and Lave provide the framework by which the administrators understand
CompanyCommand as a place for peer-led learning and leadership forms. In fact, the forum’s
founders and administrators have met and collaborated with Wegner on their community of
practice work.34 Seeing CompanyCommand as a community of practice is central to the forum’s
founders and administrators’ understanding of the work that they do. While the concept of
communities of practice is used and examined in many fields (including education,
library/information science, and archival scholarship), the purpose of this dissertation is not to
interrogate or uncover new ground related to the communities of practice theory.35 Because of its
use by the CompanyCommand administrators, it is described in this dissertation as a framework
valued by the forum’s founders and administrators. Having the grounding of communities of
practice theory as framed by Wegner and Lave helps with understanding the conceptualization,
founding, and organization of CompanyCommand.
Related to the purpose of knowledge sharing within a community, Wenger’s social theory
of learning places social participation as an important process in learning and knowing, and

frames this thinking around four linked concepts: 1) meaning, or learning as experience; 2)
practice, or learning as doing; 3) community, or learning as belonging, and 4) identity, or
learning as becoming.36 Both social learning theory and the communities of practice concepts are
used here as secondary, descriptive frameworks that help to explain the intent and structure of
CompanyCommand, and in order to shed light on the utility of the records continuum model for
explaining the forum.
This connects with the community-based work of British archival scholar Andrew Flinn,
who underscores the importance of agency and self-identification when working with the records
of a community.37 This also resonates with what Canadian archival scholar Terry Cook outlined
in calling “community” the fourth archival mindset or paradigm, which takes as a focus “activist
archivists” who foster “participatory archiving, collaborative evidence, and memory making.”38
Cook’s commentary suggests that one increasingly important role for archivists may be as
facilitators of community recordkeeping. The decision to use these descriptive frameworks for
bounding this research is firmly based in an understanding of the nature and structure of the

1.5

CASE STUDY: COMPANY COMMAND

While the military has specific professional programs and structures to train officers, the
establishment and continued growth of the CompanyCommand forum suggests a gap in the
leadership and professional training of military officers that was perceived by many junior- and
company-grade officers in the 1990s and 2000s. This view that a gap existed in knowledge
transfer among officers was tacitly acknowledged by the Army when it officially began to
sponsor CompanyCommand in 2003. By voluntary participation (active or peripheral) in this
information system and community of practice, junior officers are demonstrating and filling a
need for active, ongoing peer discussion that engages with issues that are commonly encountered
in their professional lives. These records represent post-action learning and reflection on the part
of officers that are responsible for sending men and women into battle.39 The community of
practice, as defined for this dissertation, as company-grade officers and commanders informally
talking about their profession, existed prior to this space; however, the use of the forum has
extended and expanded both the conversations and the ability to continue building and drawing
upon the shared knowledge within the community.

39

Post-action learning, exemplified in After Action Review (AAR) is a formalized and common
process of post-battle discussion that is generally used in a “lessons learned” capacity for soldier
education. The use of the forum for similar, informal conversations suggests that the process of
reviewing decisions with peers is a generally helpful exercise and represents a type of learning
that is already familiar to members.
20

The specific use of the community of practice (CoP) concept by forum administrators as
a descriptive framework for explaining the work of the site also demonstrates their awareness of
knowledge management and other community practices across disciplinary boundaries.
Familiarity with the framework that the forum leaders use to describe and support the community
is useful for understanding the identity, values, and practices that appear in the records. Careful
consideration of the layered purposes of this community is merited for understanding the ways
that the co-created content will be used and understood.
Situated within a dynamic and rapidly changing environment, the location of knowledge
in the military has, at least partially, evolved from a top-down model to one that learns from the
edges of the organization.40 Examining the roots, establishment, and continued growth of the
CompanyCommand professional forum and the dissemination of the community of practice and
knowledge management concepts within the US Army may reveal new directions about
organizational shifts that impact knowledge sharing, learning, and the creation of records.
Most importantly, the CompanyCommand case study is useful from a recordkeeping
perspective because records are central to the work of this online community. The active records
and recordkeeping system form the core of the community’s work, and the records are
reactivated and multilayered over time and space. This affords an examination of the records
continuum as a useful framework for understanding active community recordkeeping systems—

40

This set of conversations is reemerging again as the Army again seeks to learn (and relearn)
lessons from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. One recent look at this is Chad C. Serena, It
Takes More than a Network: The Iraqi Insurgency and Organizational Adaptation (Stanford,
California: Stanford University Press, 2014). The entire book is useful as a starting point, but
particularly Chapter 3, “The Iraqi Insurgency—Organizational Outputs, Learning, and the
Adaptive Cycle,” pages 71-96.
21

particularly records-intensive communities—and not only community archives that are created
for memory or other purposes secondary to the goals of the community.

1.5.1 Background of CompanyCommand

It all started over a beer on the front porch.
Accounts of the beginning of the CompanyCommand begin almost invariably with
recollections of informal, front porch conversations after work that included then-MAJ Tony
Burgess and then-MAJ Nate Allen.41 Former West Point classmates stationed in Hawaii from
1998 through 2000 and leading separate US Army units, they spent a lot of time discussing
leadership, lessons learned, and new approaches to the professional challenges that they were
encountering as company commanders. A large part of these conversations centered on the
practice of mentoring the junior officers that they were responsible for nurturing. By 2000 they
realized that their conversations had essentially functioned as peer-to-peer informal training:
helping each other to become better leaders, mentors, and commanders. Even as their time as
company commanders drew to an end, Burgess and Allen continued to think about a core
question, “What is the resource we wished that we had when we were learning to be in
command?”42 The desire to connect with others in the profession that shared a common ethos

41

The foundations of the forum are recounted by several authors, including: Nancy Dixon et al.
Company Command: Unleashing the Power of the Army Profession (West Point, NY: Center for
the Advancement of Leader Development & Organizational Learning, 2005); Roland Deiser,
Designing the Smart Organization: How Breakthrough Corporate Initiatives Drive Strategic

and a passion for supporting and mentoring soldiers was the driving force behind the creation of
their first book in 2001, Taking the Guidon: Exceptional Leadership at the Company Level,
which was Burgess and Allen’s attempt to document and share the knowledge that they had built
through informal conversations with many others during their tenure as commanders.43
The virtual front porch endures as a metaphor that is still used on the CompanyCommand
site. What has traditionally been a set of informal conversations that happen offline in backyards
and at the officer’s club about negotiating and navigating professional challenges was suddenly
able to continue and grow in a new online space through the actions of a few interested and
dedicated officers. Conversations that were largely limited between officers who were deployed
together on the same base at the same time now longer had the same temporal and geographical
constraints. The experiences of Burgess and Allen in connecting informally with past, present,
and future company commanders to share knowledge and guide the next generation of officers
was the basis for the mindful design of the original forum, which focused on the principle that
while the site is important, the “conversation is the core technology.”44 The extension of the
conversation and community over time and space is at the center of CompanyCommand.
The definition of community that is used by the officers and forum administrators for the
site is one that encompasses the voluntary congregation of enthusiastic officers in a particular
space to participate and learn from each other in an active, engaged, intentional way. Starting in
2003, as the administrative team continued to refine their ideas about CompanyCommand, they
reached out to others in the business, educational, and scholarly communities for discussion. 45

The deliberate adoption of the community of practice (CoP) concept from academic, education,
and business literature by forum leaders as both explanation and guiding path is an entry point
for understanding the intentions of the users, creators, and supporters of the forum.
Launched in March 2000, the CompanyCommand professional online forum was
supported by a group of 12 officers, volunteering to run the site on nights and weekends. In the
first month, the site received 427 unique visits. Initially, the site started with a flat model of
dissemination—members would submit contributions once per month, and the webmaster would
upload them. This reflected previous practices of one-way knowledge sharing common within
army professional circles, such as the longtime Army newsletter The Mailing List (now Infantry
magazine). As word of the site spread, the number of hits soared. In January 2001, the site
received 12,000 unique visitors; 24,000 in January 2002, and one year later, 46,000 unique
visitors.46 The later addition of threaded forums to the site to permit two-way conversation was
an extension of the vision statement for Company Command, which is “Every company
commander worldwide connected in a vibrant conversation about growing and leading combatready units.”47
Peer-to-peer informal learning between junior officers, occurring horizontally across the
organization was a counter-cultural idea for the Army. While senior leaders above the site

identities of participation and willingness to contribute in distributed communities of practice.”
(PhD. diss, The Pennsylvania State University, 2006.)
47
The site, including threaded forums, was modeled after a hunting and outdoors site that
included the lively and conversational exchange of expertise and practice. Because commercial
threaded forum software was not available as an easily integrated product in 2000 and not viable
for a small personal webhost, forums were not a site component until Company Command was
moved to servers at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. At that time,
forum leaders researched and formed a partnership with one of the leading companies in online
community software.
46

24

administrators were aware that the site existed as an informal learning space, the hierarchical
practices of doctrine creation and training programs have not been predominately open to
incorporating learning and feedback from below. As CompanyCommand matured and grew, the
volunteer site administrators continued to make a passionate case to their superior officers for
what they were doing, and how the site contributed to their professional work as officers and
leaders in the US Army. Demonstrating their good intentions and keeping the site sharply
focused on professional issues helped them to build a foundation of trust between not just site
members, but also between the site and the organizational leaders within the Army, which
recognized the benefits of this effort.
The formal custodial transfer of the site to the Army, the move of the CompanyCommand
forums in 2002 to a .mil address behind the Army firewall, and the later establishment of the
Center for Advancement and Leader Development and Organizational Learning (CALDOL) at
the United States Military Academy in 2005 as a “support cell” for the forum, demonstrated that
the value of this online community of practice had been recognized by Army leadership.
According to CompanyCommand forum leaders, this move from unofficial website to official
sponsorship reflects growth and understanding of the value that this peer leadership and
education initiative brought to officers.48 CompanyCommand and a sister site, PlatoonLeader,
have continued to support the advancement of junior officers as a part of the Army training and
leadership development infrastructure.
Based on the successful growth and early development of Company Command, other
professional military forums quickly emerged. Other official forums, such as NCO-net and S3XO Net, are part of the Army’s Battle Command Knowledge System (BKCS) initiative, which

48

COL Nate Allen, conversation with author, February 26, 2013.
25

exists under the umbrella of the Army Operational Knowledge Management program,
established in 2004. The use of online professional forums as knowledge management tools to
support peer-to-peer learning and the transfer of tacit knowledge has been an emerging topic of
discussion over the past decade in the related professional military literature.49

1.5.2 The Career of a Junior Army Officer

The complex and rapidly shifting ground of the modern battlefield means that company
commanders must stay abreast of many changes all at once. Company commanders have the
tasks of enacting policy, carrying out tactical implementation, and putting strategy into
immediate practice. They are the interface between strategic intent and operational execution.
Within the US Army, the company forms the basic unit of organization. Every soldier is assigned
to a company, and the company commander holds responsibility for the training and welfare of
those soldiers. Company commanders are usually captains, with about 4 to 8 years of experience
and are typically responsible for 100 to 200 soldiers. A company is a cohesive tactical unit
comprised of three to five platoons, and is capable of performing standalone battlefield
operations.50 Within the US Army’s force of approximately 500,000 soldiers, there are about

5,600 current company commanders.51 Their performance can be the determining factor in any
military campaign, and the success of any operation depends on their judgment. While generals
might craft a brilliant overarching strategy, it will fail if company commanders and their teams
are not able to execute effectively. Success as a company commander is essential to a continued
Army career, and most commissioned officers spend one to two years in the position, before
rotating on to another assignment.
Strategies for operating in a volatile environment are rarely perfect. This unpredictability
can be an opportunity for company commanders and their teams on the ground to figure out a
better plan and to share the results with other commanders relatively quickly. The creation and
sharing of solutions “on the fly” and rapid movement of information can inform and affect
overall strategies that rely on intelligence from the ground. The traditional “schoolhouse” model
of sending officers through rounds of various training courses for ongoing leadership
development may not adequately meet their educational needs in a dynamic combat
environment. One recent report, surveying over 450 officers, found that leader development
tends to be informal, personality-driven, and dependent on the abilities, experience, and
inclinations of the unit commander, and recommended shared leader development tools over
traditional models of hierarchical, top-down education.52 Another study, focused on evolving
operational demands and structural transformation within the Army, and the effects of those
changes on leader development, noted that considerably more should be done to prepare officers

for a dynamic and challenging operational environment.53 Peer-to-peer leadership development
poses a challenge to traditional learning models, but also presents solutions to maintaining
relevance in a rapidly changing environment.
American military operations have shifted dramatically over the past decade during the
two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The challenges posed by engagements in Operation Iraqi
Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) have forced officers to learn and adapt
to using counterinsurgency strategies to defeat highly adaptive foes in extremely complex and
ambiguous environments.54 The Army’s intended transition from a Cold War total force to an
organization equipped for nimble warfare as well as operations other than war (OOTW) has not
been an easy or smooth one.55 However, efforts like CompanyCommand are illustrative of the
creative efforts that some members of the Army are using to transform the organization for new
information challenges, perhaps foreshadowed in 1995 by what GEN Sullivan (Ret) referred to
as a need for “progressive growth.”56

Grappling with counterinsurgencies has been a continuing challenge for the US military
throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. After engaging in counterinsurgency warfare
in the Vietnam War, many elements of the US military wanted to avoid such engagements and
focus on total force warfare. Thus the US military had to “relearn” counterinsurgency lessons
during OIF and OEF. See, for example: David Fitzgerald, Learning to Forget: US Army
counterinsurgency doctrine and practice from Vietnam to Iraq (Stanford, CA: Stanford
University Press, 2013) and Thomas X. Hammes, The Sling and the Stone: On War in the 21st
Century (St. Paul, MN: Zenith Press, 2004).
55
For an account of the tension within the US Army of senior leaders conceiving of the service
as primarily a Cold War force geared to fight communist armies in Europe and orienting itself to
fight a counterinsurgency in Vietnam, see Andrew Krepinevich, The Army and Vietnam
(Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986).
56
In 1995, GEN Sullivan (Ret.) discussed the need for transformative changes in the face of the
information age. Since then, the Army has undergone even more seismic shifts as it has learned
to fight different kinds of war. See Gordon R. Sullivan and James M Dubik, Envisioning Future
28

During this time, and driven by the needs of soldiers and leaders, the US Army
experienced profound organizational shifts that led to changes in how operations were supported
and conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan. In counterinsurgency (COIN) operations, the tactical
planning paradigm is upended, meaning that lower-ranking officers on the ground are planning
operations and interacting with the local population. This is in contrast with conventional
operations traditionally led and directed by senior leaders with years of knowledge and tactical
experience. How do junior officers in a complex environment learn to successfully navigate and
execute the kinds of decisions that were previously made by senior leadership? Adapting to new
operational realities that draw on instant communication and dynamic decision making, the use
of peer learning across the organization and professional forums by officers as information
systems to navigate and negotiate new landscapes is both catalyst and emblematic of the shifting
needs and responses within the organization. Using this informal community forum, the
CompanyCommand leaders have attempted to establish structure and discipline within the
process of informal knowledge transfer between junior officers. How the officers and the
organization have used the community as a tool to adapt and learn from the narratives of others,
the understanding of the participants about the community and space that drives the creation and
reuse of records, and the role these co-created, co-constructed, multi-layered narrative records
play is another key piece of this case study.

DESIGN OF THE STUDY

This dissertation critically examines the records continuum as a theory, exploring how it
performs as a theoretical framework in a community records case study. This study uses a
qualitative single-case study approach with embedded units of analysis, which is discussed in
greater detail as part of the methodology chapter. The design of this study is primarily guided by
the methodological approaches described in social scientist Robert K. Yin’s Case Study
Research: Design and Methods, and in educational scholar John W. Creswell’s Research
Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches.57 The decision to use a
qualitative approach for this work is driven by the nature of the research question, which
concentrates on using the case study and data sources as a way to critically examine the records
continuum as a theory.
As described by educational scholar John W. Creswell, qualitative research is an
approach for understanding the meaning that “individuals or groups ascribe to a social or human
problem.”58 The research process involves emerging, iterative questions and procedures, data
collected in the participant setting, analysis of the data that inductively builds from the particular
instance to general themes, and the researcher making interpretations based on the data.59

Researchers selecting this approach have decided to focus on individual meaning, an inductive
style, and the importance of carefully rendering the complexity of a situation.60
A qualitative methods approach is appropriate for this study, which focuses on
understanding how members of a specific community record, share, and reuse their experiences,
and what those acts of records creation and use highlight and/or reveal about the application of
the records continuum model.
To examine this case study from a different angle, a quantitative approach could have
revealed different insights about the decisions and practices of forum users. For example,
previous action research using the CompanyCommand forums has quantitatively measured
viewer activity related to naming and use of “Leader Cast” videos, suggesting the value of active
moderation and curation of content within the forum sphere.61 However, a quantitative approach
does not fully address the choices related to understanding community participation and records
creation that are significant to knowledge transfer. Therefore, while a quantitative approach to
this case study could possibly highlight different factors that are important to studying this
forum, the qualitative approach outlined in the study design has been chosen in order to address
the research questions in a rich and descriptive manner.
The case study includes four embedded units of analysis. The first unit of analysis is the
CompanyCommand forum as a holistic complex system consisting of the underlying technology
tool, forum posts, sets of posts that collectively compose forum threads, the rules and processes

study examined the naming and metadata (mostly titles) created by site administrators and team
leaders for leadership videos and interviews, finding that better (and more accurately, creatively
named) titles tended to encourage viewing, participation and feedback among members.

that govern the administration and use of the forum, and the users and administrators of the
forum. The second embedded unit of analysis is the set of 97 articles in ARMY Magazine based
on CompanyCommand forum threads that ran from March 2005 through December 2013. The
forum administrators constructed these articles from a range of forum discussions centered on
particular themes. The third unit of analysis is a set of four purposively sampled forum threads
that are traced backwards from the ARMY Magazine articles. The fourth unit of analysis is a set
of semi-structure interviews of five forum founders and administrators.
This dissertation focuses on the active record. This is not necessarily a study of memory,
but one of relationships. It is not necessarily about history, but about active recordkeeping
structures and practices, and the why and how of co-recorded human records within community
spaces. That said, it does not mean that history or memory are not present in the
CompanyCommand community. This dissertation looks at people through active records, and in
finding their stories, identities, and experiences as they are folded within shared systems,
decisions, and values, we can learn more about how they use records and how active
recordkeeping supports their goals. This dissertation is about communities, but the community’s
purpose is not to create an archive, or even necessarily a record. It is to continue to use the power
of relationships and the power of the record as force multipliers to accomplish their professional
goals.

1.7

STUDY LIMITATIONS

This dissertation will focus on several specific sets of interrelated records created by and about
members and administrators of CompanyCommand in their capacity as American professional
32

military officers and past, present, and future company commanders. This focus excludes other
bodies of records, such as those created in similar Army or other military forums (such as NCOnet or S3-XO Net), other forms of related community recordkeeping, and other accounts of war
experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The focus of this study is centered firmly on examining the records continuum as a
theoretical frame for understanding the interactions between people and records, and the ways
that these interactions shape both people and records. The forum members are using this site
during a particular phase in their professional life and interactions with these records is only one
small part of the experiences and education shaping their identity as a junior officer. Keeping this
transitory nature of the community’s membership in mind, as part of discussing the ways that the
records shape the administrators and creators, which may limit insights related to individual
records and narratives of members.
This dissertation is necessarily based on a limited selection of records due to the
constraints of travel, time, and access. For example, I only had full access to the forum while
visiting the US Military Academy in West Point, New York for the purposes of data gathering;
however, I have included a detailed description and analysis of the site and forum as part of the
dissertation in order to situate the reader. The selection of a limited sample of interactions may
restrict the potential understanding that could come from a more in-depth observation of
participants’ record creating behavior within the forum.62 Further, the use of selected posts that
have been chosen, collected, and published by CALDOL staff members has the function of
privileging those accounts over others that were not selected for publication. Due to the

62

This is also limited by the constraints of what members decided to post on the site for viewing
and as a construction of how they wish to be identified in that space.
33

contextual nature of the forum as an informal space by and for junior US Army officers at a
particular stage in their careers, this study may uncover different results than if examining posts
from senior officers in the Air Force, or midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy. Because this is
an in-depth case study of a single site, the findings are not generalizable to the broader
population of online forums, including some military officer sites as NCO.net, or S3-XO.net.
This is congruent with qualitative research, in which the goal is usually to allow for the
transferability of some findings to other situations.63 Some findings may be transferrable.
However, this dissertation uses a case study to make a claim about a theory (the record
continuum) and not a population (online communities). A study of this case may highlight and
obscure different facets and capabilities of the records continuum model than studies of different
possible cases. However, I believe that the characteristics, genesis, evolution, layers, and
multiple ways of reading this case outweigh the limitations when considering this case study as a
lens for examining the records continuum model.

DEFINITIONS

These definitions are included to serve as a starting point for discussion throughout the
dissertation.
Recordkeeping system: ISO 15489, the international standard on records management,
defines a recordkeeping system as “an information system, which captures, manages, and

63

Alison Jane Pickard, Research Methods in Information, 2nd ed. (Chicago: Neal-Schuman,
2014), 21.
34

provides access to records through time.”64 This definition, while broad, serves as a useful
starting point for discussing community-based recordkeeping.
Information system: The glossary published by the Society of American Archivists
defines this as “an organized set of procedures and techniques designed to store, retrieve,
manipulate, analyze, and display information.”65
Record: For the purposes of this dissertation, I am using Sue McKemmish’s definition of
records:
“Recordkeeping and archiving processes fix documents which are created in the context of social
and organizational activity, i.e. human interaction of all kinds, and preserve them as evidence of
that activity by disembedding them from their immediate context of creation, and providing them
with ever broadening layers of contextual metadata. In this way they help to assure the
accessibility of meaningful records for as long as they are of value to people, organisations, and
societies—whether that be for a nanosecond or millennia.”66
Recognizing that there are many definitions of records in the archival literature and that this is a
contested concept in the field, I am employing McKemmish’s definition because it is relevant to
continuum thinking. In this understanding, records are fixed in the creation moment, but continue
to evolve over time and space. When discussing the case study, I am using this definition
because it works to describe the complexities of the case. However, in later discussion about the
qualities of the continuum as an analytic framework, I will also explore and interrogate the
underlying assumptions of this definition.
My use of this definition of records is informed by Terry Cook’s approach for
considering the context of records creation as “focusing on the context behind the content; on the

power relationships that shape the documentary heritage; and on the document structure, its
resident and subsequent information systems, and its narrative and business-process conventions
as being more important than its informational content.”67Cook attempts to consider both the
evolving and accruing record and its situating contexts and relationships. Situating the record
creation in relationship to its organizational context, its structure, and the systems and
infrastructures that shape, store and provide access to the record is important for understanding
the record and understanding the record in the context of communities like CompanyCommand.
Records continuum: Records continuum theory as conceived by Australian archival
scholar Frank Upward provides a framework for making sense of complex recordkeeping
concerns in relationship to societal structures. Upward’s depiction of the records continuum as a
model has four dimensions (create, capture, pluralize, and organize) and four axes
(recordkeeping, evidential, transactional, identity) that serve as tools for identifying various
states, stages, and uses of recordkeeping and the development of the organizations where the
records originate and reside. While records continuum theory is often described using a version
of the flat Upward paper-based, two-dimensional model, theory and model are not
interchangeable terms. This dissertation will discuss both the theory and the depiction of the
theory using the Upward visual model. Continuum thinking places emphasis on records as

Terry Cook, “Fashionable Nonsense or Professional Rebirth: Postmodernism and the Practice
of Archives,” Archivaria 51 (Spring 2001): 25. This is also relevant to thinking about evolving
practices for following connections in evolving records and documentation. One example of this
is the use of trace ethnography for revealing “invisible” infrastructures for online interactions at
the network level. This method has been used and discussed by researchers seeking to
understand the interactions of online vandals in distributed online sociotechnical systems through
their documentary traces. For an introduction to trace ethnography, see R. Stuart Geiger and
David Ribes, “Trace Ethnography: Following coordination through documentary practices.”

36

continually accruing additional layers of “ever-broadening metadata,” which resonates with the
nature of multilayered contextual records through time and space. 68 Records do not move
through the continuum in a linear fashion, but can (and do) coexist at multiple dimensions and
axes through space and time.
Visualization: a visual representation created to describe or depict conceptual or other
elements in order to allow users to explore and understand complex structures. This definition
has been formed here to incorporate concepts from the fields of information science, sociology
and human-computer interaction. American philosophy professor Laura Perini, whose research
focuses on the uses of representations by scientists to communicate concepts, notes that visual
representations, like written or spoken sentences and numerical formulas, are “external objects
that function as symbols.”69 Human-computer interaction (HCI) researcher Bernice Rogowitz
stated as part of a 2010 IEEE Visualization Week panel that “In visualization, we map data onto
visual elements in a way that we hope will help the user to perceive and reason about the
structure in the data. We also develop interactive methodologies that we hope will allow the user
to explore the data in a way that will help reveal structures that were previously hidden.”70
Sociologist and ethnographer Kathryn Henderson, whose early research focused on rich
description of art historians and their work practices, placed the mediation space between visual

representation and cognitive work as an important information practice.71 These definitions
characterize visualization as a method for rendering complex ideas, data, and concepts as a visual
object for the purposes of interpretation and discussion. Throughout this dissertation the term
“visualization” will be used to describe various graphical depictions of the records continuum.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: THE RECORDS CONTINUUM

This chapter discusses the use of the records continuum as a framework for understanding
complex recordkeeping and systems. It provides an overview of the development and growth of
the records continuum as a theoretical model and places this discussion and dissertation in the
context of evolving generations of continuum scholarship, suggesting new avenues for
exploration.

2.1

INTRODUCTION TO THE RECORDS CONTINUUM

The records continuum model as first articulated by Frank Upward in 1996 and 1997 may be
understood as a unifying framework for recordkeeping that brings together the work of archivists
and records managers, provides a lens for post-custodial discussion, and challenges the life cycle
model that still frames much of North American archival and records management practice.72

72

The model continued to evolve after its introduction in 1996-1996, including changes to the
shading and to the rings that represent the dimensions. For the initial articulation, see Frank
Upward, “Structuring the records continuum. Part one: Postcustodial principles and properties,”
Archives and Manuscripts 24, no.2 (1996), 268-285; Frank Upward, “Structuring the Records
Continuum, Part Two: Structuration Theory and Recordkeeping,” Archives and Manuscripts 25,
no. 1 (1997), 11-35.
Discussion in the literature of the problems with the life cycle model and realigning the separate
roles of archivist and records manager, particularly in respect to custody and electronic records,
framed much of the discourse in the early 1990s that provided context for the records continuum
40

The records continuum is comprised of four dimensions. The create, or act level, is in the
center of the diagram, representing the beginning of a record and situating it within its particular
context. In the second dimension, “Capture,” the record created in the first dimension is placed
into an “organizational unit” or broader group context. The third dimension, “Organize,” brings
records created and captured in the first two dimensions together into the same place and,
according to Upward, requires “common navigable structures and understandings” for the
organization to organize memory.73 The fourth dimension, “Pluralize,” is situated furthest from
the act of records creation. “Pluralize” includes the reuse and re-presentation of the record for
new and possibly multiple audiences and meanings.74 There are four axes that work closely
together; those are evidence, recordkeeping, transactionality, and identity.

model. See, for example, Acland’s work from that period, which references the ideas of David
Bearman and Jay Atherton; Glenda Acland, “Archivist: keeper, undertaker, or auditor,” Debates
and Discourses: Selected Australian Writings on Archival Theory, 1951-1990, Peter Biskup, ed.
(Canberra: Australian Society of Archivists, 1995): 219-220.
The life cycle model argues that clearly defined stages exist in recordkeeping, from creation to
final disposition and that records pass through these stages and are managed in distinct ways in
each stage until they are either selected for inclusion in archives or until their destruction.

Figure 1: Records Continuum (Frank Upward)

The records continuum model has been called a paradigm shift, and hailed as providing
“probably the best extant example of contemporary theory-building” in the field of archival
studies.75 Other archival scholars such as Brien Brothman, Eric Ketelaar, and Verne Harris have
publicly applauded the originality and influential contribution of the records continuum to the
international archival discourse. Canadian archival scholar Terry Cook called it “the world’s

most inclusive model for archives,” but one that is also “misinterpreted by some of its advocates
and more of its critics.”76
Since the publication of Upward’s first continuum article in November 1996, the records
continuum model has provided fertile ground for spirited discussion and debate.77 Dynamic
discussions wrestling with the records continuum as a conceptual framework have regularly
appeared in the literature, including conversation between Verne Harris, Sue McKemmish, and
Frank Upward.78 As a response to constantly evolving and complex questions of recordkeeping,
this reading suggests that considering the origins and development of the records continuum will
inform the use and extension of continuum thinking to current and emerging questions in the
field.
Some previous continuum thinkers have aimed to position and extend this model as being
applicable to supporting a broader view of societal recordkeeping, rather than using it to frame
the reading of records within the creating organizational or institutional context.79 In particular,
this places emphasis on the pluralization function of the fourth dimension, which extends the

record from “record keeping” at a local level to a broader audience with multiple uses at a
societal level. The concentric rings of the continuum model are also carefully described by
continuum thinkers as being permeable dimensions that are dynamic and shifting as “everbroadening” layers of contextual metadata are added to surround the record. In this reading,
records are always in a state of becoming, and the relationships between records and their
contexts of creation, management, and use are multiple and dynamic.80

2.2

TRACING THE HERITAGE OF THE RECORDS CONTINUUM

This section traces the origins, development, and growth of the records continuum as an
articulated theoretical model and highlights areas related to locating and situating people and
communities within the record.

2.2.1 Origins of Continuum Thinking

The origins of continuum thinking in Australian recordkeeping discourse are generally traced
back to the work of government archivist Ian Maclean in the 1950s and later, to the development
of the Australian ‘series’ system (also called the context relationships system)81 by Peter J. Scott

Sue McKemmish, “Traces: document, record, archive, archives,” in Archives: Recordkeeping
in Society, ed. Sue McKemmish et al. (Wagga Wagga, NSW: Centre for Information Studies,

Years (Canberra, Australia: Ancora Press, 1994), 150-172.

in the 1960s.82 The development of the CRS was mainly concerned with the imperative to
describe a dynamic environment of modern records, one in which the majority of the records
existed outside of the formal custodial bounds of the Commonwealth Archives Office control.
Barbara Reed notes that, from its inception, the CRS system included the “strongly Jenkinsonian
derived emphasis of Maclean on managing the whole—records across the false divide between
current records, non- current, and archival records.”83 The postcustodial framework for the CRS
was focused on maintaining relationships between records, disregarding their storage location.84
The terminology used for this has been somewhat contentious. In general, the
Commonwealth Record Series system developed by Peter Scott and implemented at the
Australian Commonwealth Archives Office (CAO), was referred to as the CRS. As the concepts
behind the system design were disseminated and adopted by others, the preferred term became
the ‘series system’ and appears thusly in much of the descriptive literature. Chris Hurley argues
that this is a misnomer because the conceptual design is broader and does not dictate control at
the series level, and thus calls this the ‘Australian system.” However, Wendy Duff and Verne
Harris argue that this naming is inaccurate because (as Hurley noted) it embraces “far more than

Australia.85 Barbara Reed notes these disagreements and has advanced the idea of a new term,
the “context relationships” system.86
The release of Frank Upward’s conceptual model of the records continuum in 1996-1997
provoked international interest and discussion. It has been said that the foundational article for
continuum thinking was likely written in 1959 by Australian archivist Ian Maclean, though it
may also been argued that Maclean was using an approach described by archivists Margaret
Cross Norton and Philip Brooks in the United States.87 Others, such as archivist Jay Atherton in
the 1980s had previously discussed the idea of a continuum related to recordkeeping. 88 However,
the publication of Frank Upward’s articulated model and conceptual framework generated a
significant wave of discussions and reactions.89 This interest in continuum thinking was largely
driven by the Records Continuum Research Group,90 based at Monash University in Melbourne,
which Adrian Cunningham has described as the “spiritual home of records continuum theory.”91

Jay Atherton’s usage of the continuum idea centered on the view of archivists and records
managers sharing the same work and not two separate domains.

The intellectual challenges presented by the continuum model encouraged spirited
dialogue that included archival scholars such as David Bearman, Terry Cook, Verne Harris,
Richard J. Cox, and Margaret Hedstrom.92 The practice of bringing archival thinkers to Australia
to discuss appraisal and continuum thinking sparked further international conversation and
engagement in this area.93 Additionally, the development of national and international
recordkeeping standards (AS 4390 and ISO 15489) may be clearly linked to conversations
surrounding continuum thinking.94 In the North American archival context, interest in this
holistic model of recordkeeping could also be understood as a reaction to the more
compartmentalized and concrete functions of the life-cycle model, and is often raised in
conjunction with conversations about digital records.

to the further articulation of continuum concepts. One of those sparks, a lecture by Terry Cook

2.2.2 Anthony Giddens and Structuration Theory in the Continuum

As conceptualized by Frank Upward, the records continuum model is heavily influenced by
sociologist Anthony Giddens’ structuration theory, which centers on societal constructs that
support and describe human activity.95 Upward states that the structure of the continuum (the
dimensions and elements) were derived from his reading of Giddens’ work, which attempts to
identify and impose structure on societal processes and elements.96 Upward describes three
intertwined domain areas from Giddens (signification, domination, and legitimation) that outline
the ways that societies articulate institutions, making apparent how social systems stretch across
time and underscoring the institutional underpinnings of both society and continuum thinking.97
Giddens also describes these structures as a mode of transmission for memory across time and
space.
Memory (or recall) is to be understood not only in relation to the psychological qualities
of individual agents but also as inhering in the recursiveness of institutional reproduction.
Storage here already presumes modes of time-space control, as well as a phenomenal experience
of ‘lived time’ and the container that stores the authoritative resource is the community itself.
The storage of authoritative and allocative resources may be understood as involving the
retention and control of information or knowledge whereby social relations are perpetuated

across time-space. Storage presumes media of information representation, modes of information
retrieval or recall and, as with all power resources, modes of its dissemination.
According to Upward’s reading of Giddens, structures perpetuate relationships in a
society through the residue of memory, or as Upward puts it, “the community is the container
that stores the authoritative resource.”98 In society, the container is composed of people, groups,
and organizations. Significantly, Upward later notes that as part of a post-custodial mindset, it is
incumbent upon archivists to be concerned with all four dimensions of the continuum, including
societal interests in the fourth dimension.99 Consideration of these relationships is embedded
within continuum thinking, and dates back to Peter J. Scott’s early fundamental work with
multiple contexts of records and relationships as part of the Australian series model.100
Giddens contrasts what he describes as the “disembeddedness” of modern human
interaction and culture as a characteristic that has shifted from a tighter integration of space and
time in traditional societies. By this, he observes that in premodern societies, “space and place
largely coincide, since the spatial dimensions of social life are, for most of the population, and in
most respects, dominated by ‘presence’—by localized activities. The advent of modernity
increasingly tears space away from place by fostering relations by ‘absent’ others, locationally
distant from any situation of face-to-face interaction.”101

Giddens’ description of disembedding as “the ‘lifting out’ of social relations from local
contexts of interaction and their restructuring across indefinite spans of space-time”102 takes a
wary perspective of technological change as a risk to social practices and human connections.
One mechanism that Giddens describes as facilitating disembeddedness in society is the
“expert system,” which he describes as “systems of technical accomplishment or professional
expertise that organize large areas of the material and social environments in which we live
today.”103 He notes further that systems “remove social relations from the immediacy of
context…by providing ‘guarantees’ across distanciated time-space.”104 Giddens suggests that the
tension between expert systems and the growth of local interactions is a societal loss. However,
Giddens’ work implies that he is referencing uni-directional expert systems that deliver
knowledge. This does not fully acknowledge the place and space of systems formed by
intentional, interactive online community as a beneficial area for further reflexive practice.
The structures that Upward (via Giddens) identifies, adapts, and uses for the records
continuum have limitations, and it is important to understand their origins and boundaries, as
well as their affordances for reading and understanding records as traces of community and
society. The continued development of the records continuum as a framework for understanding
reflexive records and community dialogue, while clearly influenced and bounded by structural
relationships to Giddens’ work, is also used in flexible ways to support multiple readings that go
beyond some of these limitations. Understanding that within structuration theory, Giddens seeks

between actions and institutions”105 provides a basis for further exploring what the records
continuum highlights and conceals about community recordkeeping.

2.2.3 Generations of Continuum Scholarship

This section considers the evolving continuum discourse and situates what can be referenced as
three overlapping generations of records continuum scholarship. The first generation of
continuum scholarship could be described as foundational. Largely focused on explaining and
elucidating the origins and possible uses of the records continuum, this category includes early
articles by Australian archival scholars Frank Upward and Sue McKemmish, and their
colleagues from Monash University and the Records Continuum Research Group. 106 This
foundational generation includes scholarship seeking to place and explain continuum concepts
for use in teaching and scholarship.107

Important literature that explains and expands continuum thinking includes: Sue
McKemmish, “Placing Records Continuum Theory and Practice,” Archival Science 1, no. 4
105

51

Second generation continuum scholarship may be described as focusing on the use of the
continuum relative to functional and evidential description, and was/is largely concerned with
dimensions one, two and three (create-capture-organize). This generation includes Livia
Iacovino’s research at the nexus of recordkeeping, evidence, ethics, and legal work, 108 Geoffrey
Yeo’s concepts of the record,109 and the development of the Australian Recordkeeping Standard
(and then the ISO standard based on the Australian standard).
The third generation of continuum scholarship has continued to evolve with regards to
community records and parallel provenance. Terry Cook’s call for more work in the fourth
dimension at the 2004 conference (Archives and Collective Memory: Challenges and Issues in a
Pluralised Archival Role) at Monash University, and the related November 2005 special issue of
Archives and Manuscripts served as encouraging signs of engagement with this dimension,
which connects with concepts in community archives, the records multiverse, and discussions of
pluralizing the archival record. Also situated here are additional continuum models that are
layered atop the original information processing grain, such as the Cultural Heritage

Council, with the aim of directly involving indigenous Australian communities in the formation
of collections and to enable shared community control and agency in the record.111 Other
examples of third generation conversation include Australian archival scholar Leisa Gibbons’
work with YouTube and the Cultural Heritage Continuum and American Andrew Lau’s
dissertation in archival studies at UCLA, which used continuum thinking to consider art-based
community projects in Los Angeles.

While the cases and community structures and missions may vary, at the center of
discussions about community recordkeeping is a core of understanding the values and structures
that shape the records that are generated and form the community space and identity. This
dissertation adds to ongoing conversations and fits with the third generation of continuum
scholarship.

LITERATURE REVIEW

This review of the existing literature examines several overlapping conceptual areas
related to the dissertation. First this review uses the nature of recordkeeping and shared war
narratives to frame a thematic introduction of the archival and recordkeeping literature related to
community and memory. Next, this review examines online communities and cooperative work
related to motivations for knowledge exchange, leadership, and building trust among members.
Finally, this review examines literature from knowledge management related to the construction,
culture, and learning of communities.

3.1

WAR, RECORDS, COMMUNITIES, & NEW WAYS OF DOCUMENTING

Archives and conflict have long been intertwined. While war can sometimes be a cause of
records destruction, it also can be the catalyst for the creation of new records. In many countries,
including the United States, Canada, and Australia, concerns about caring for documents created
as a result of war served as one justification for establishing national archives.
Delivering his address in October 1941 to the Society of American Archivists, president
Waldo Gifford Leland recounted this quote:
In the Conference of State War History Organizations of December 1919, Arthur Kyle
Davis, of the Virginia War History Commission, described the situation with his accustomed
eloquence. “There is,” he declared, “a new world of history, in which we have no guide, no
55

blazed trail, no chart, and no compass. It is a new world of history because it is the history of a
world in a new kind of war—a war of embittered nations with every nerve and fibre of the
national life, even every filament of civilian life, alive and tingling with the vital currents of war
activity.”112

Leland used this opening to laud what he called the pioneering work of archivists and
historians as they figured out how to document the work of the country during the Great War.
The collection and organization of war records was a vast set of operations at the national, state,
and local levels; and the accumulation of records, surveys and practices as well as the
associations helped to set the stage for historical work in this country.113 Leland notes, however,
that perhaps more important than improvements “of a material nature” are “the changes that
happened to ourselves.”114 While the improvements in physical archival work are important to
note, the intellectual challenges have far more implications for the forward movement of the
archival field.
Recordkeeping is an essential activity for any institution and its people. These activities
range from the creation and use of records, the organization of records and systems to capture
them, and the disposition of records. Within institutions, records explicitly and implicitly support
the decisions and behaviors of records creators. Outside of official boundaries, records can also
bear witness to actions and intent. Recordkeeping is an activity that can sustain, nurture, and
foster growth for institutions, people, and communities. Sometimes recordkeeping infrastructures
and systems do not meet the needs of dynamic and constantly changing demands. What happens

when community members perceive that a need is not being met by the institution’s normal
processes? Calls have emerged in the literature by Canadian archival scholar Tom Nesmith,
British archival scholar Andrew Flinn, and others, for archivists to emerge as “agents of change,”
actively facilitating the creation and new uses of records.115 The flattening of organizational
hierarchies and shift away from downward communication is one reason to reexamine archival
approaches to documentation of complex environments.116 The evidence of this shift exists
already as organizations such as the US Army increasingly find old paradigms unsuitable for
contemporary work.
Records serve multiple purposes for society, individuals, and organizations. They can be
facilitators of communication, a means of conversation and interaction, vehicles for decisionmaking, a receptacle for memory and experiences, evidence of rights and obligations, active
building blocks of identity, and more. As Sue McKemmish argues, recordkeeping bears witness
to our lives by “evidencing, accounting for, and memorializing our interactions and relationships,
thus ‘placing’ us in this world.”117 The dynamic structures of communities and the complex

nature of participation and expression also serve to challenge us to embrace new ways of seeing
and understanding records.118
Historian Wulf Kansteiner argues that “collective memories originate from shared
communications about the meaning of the past that are anchored in the life-worlds of individuals
who partake in the communal life of the respective collective.”119 Participants in a shared
community may be participating in acts of collective memory, or perhaps this is a form of
“collected memory,” as French historian Marc Bloch notes that we cannot automatically
subsume all of the realities that we label “individual memory” under the name of “collective
memory.”120 Bloch questions how individuals and groups retain or recover their memories, and
notes that within a multi-layered, co-created record, even if the individual stories and memories
are retained, the context may affect the content.
Within the archival literature that surrounds examination of independent community
archives, there exists an acknowledged lack of consensus about a firm, single definition of
community.121 However, the variety of definitions that have been used in the archival literature
may be seen as a strength, and not a weakness. Bridging many different and wide-ranging

perspectives, the concept of community records in a diverse, dynamic, and global society may
encompass many shifting things.
In a culture that is constantly changing, archival and recordkeeping scholars may sit on
the shifting boundaries as the intermediaries between communities and archives. By expanding
our understanding of what archives are, we may also discover that we can build a richer
contextual meaning and connection to the traces and voices of people and their experiences. New
frameworks that can address the interplay of multiple inputs, influences, spaces, and temporal
realities that build on past work are necessary for growth and innovation in the archival field.
Trust by members is a central factor in community participation and knowledge sharing,
as explored later in this literature review. While we are familiar as archivists with maintaining
trustworthy records that are what they purport to be, can the construction of community trust be
further explored by archivists as a motivation for records creation by community members?
Returning to Leland’s presidential address, he states that “Our horizon is no longer bounded by
two oceans and the Panama Canal. We look out upon a world that at last we realize is spherical,
and while this enlargement of vision had its beginnings long before the World War, the
broadening process was tremendously accelerated by our experiences of those years.”122
Similarly, our horizons as archivists can and should expand further, drawing from
previous work and seeking to expand upon the foundation of frameworks that can help us to
grapple with a dynamic, changing world. Using and repurposing conceptual ideas from other
disciplines may help us to achieve this goal.123

ONLINE COMMUNITIES AND COOPERATIVE WORK

This section of the review examines literature related to the development and growth of online
communities, and specifically examines key issues related to motivations for knowledge
exchange, leadership, and trust building. First, this section will explore literature related to
defining communities of practice. Next, a selection of studies that thematically relate to key areas
of community infrastructure will be systematically examined to provide structure for
understanding how and why online professional communities of practice work and develop.
This review draws specifically from education, business and library, and information
science literature related to communities for several reasons. Because professional communities
of practice (such as the one being studied for this case) are rooted in a common desire to actively
deepen their expertise and knowledge in a particular subject through interaction, literature related
to learning and social participation is well connected to this inquiry. Examining literature about
knowledge management, transfer, and trust is related to the use of communities of practice for
knowledge sharing. By surveying literature related to the construction of communities from other
disciplines, this review draws together insights about the layers of trust, understanding, and use
of these spaces by members and creators in order to gain a foundation for further exploration.

3.2.1 Building an Online Community of Practice

Studies discussed in this section of the review are drawn primarily from literature in information
science and education, and are narrowly focused on professional communities of practice with
voluntary participation by member groups. While the purposes of both the communities and the
studies vary, most of the research seeks to understand the factors that contribute to successful
knowledge exchange and transfer. Key themes that emerged in this review of the literature
included motivations for online sharing, trust factors, barriers to participation, the function of
moderation, and support of online participants.

3.2.2 Individual Motivations for Knowledge Sharing

What motivates members of an online community to share (or not) with other members? The
motivation to share is at the core of knowledge sharing. Drawing from the work of Batson,
Ahmad, and Tang,124 Hew and Hara125 identified four broad classes of motives for community
involvement. This may help to explain why individuals are motivated to share within an online
community: 1) egoism (increase personal benefit), 2) altruism (increase welfare of others), 3)
collectivism (increase the welfare of the community) and 4) principlism (to uphold a moral
principle, such as reciprocity or honor). These four classes of community motivations provide a

guideline for exploring the results from studies on knowledge sharing motivations within online
communities.
Egoistic motives have emerged from the research as a primary reason for sharing by
members of online communities. Duncan-Howell126 and Gray127 found that members were, at
least initially, motivated to participate in an online community of learning as a way to reduce
feelings of isolation and disconnection within the work environment. Study participants also
noted the immediacy of learning online in an environment that fostered feedback and response
was a factor in motivation for participation. Hew and Hara128 and Hur and Brush129 used
interviews and analysis of teachers’ online posts to understand the motivations of teachers to
participate in knowledge sharing in online learning forums. The findings were consistent with
previously mentioned studies in that the exchange of knowledge was provoked by several
egoistic motives, such as the need for advice or support from other teachers, the need to share
positive and negative feelings, a desire to locate and explore new ideas, and the need for contact
to combat isolation in the workplace.
The desire to promote and enhance one’s professional reputation can also be included as
an egoistic motivating factor, as noted by Ardichvili et al and Wasko and Faraj. 130 Wasko and

Faraj used content analysis and survey data to understand why individual contributors in a closed
online legal forum would choose to help strangers through knowledge exchange even when the
contributor received no direct benefit. They found that the primary perception by contributors
that participation would enhance their professional standing was one motivation for sharing. The
qualitative study of motivation and barriers to employee participation in online communities by
Ardichvili et al found similar results. Self-identified reasons for contributing to the community
revealed that contributors felt that they needed to raise their professional status by gaining
recognition through posting.131
Altruistic motives for sharing knowledge in online communities include feelings of
empathy. In studies of online learning communities of teachers by Hew and Hara, 132 as well as
Gray,133 results showed that members were empathetic to their less-experienced peer teachers,
and viewed their own knowledge sharing and support as altruistic methods for giving back to the
community. Studying the motives behind sharing within a corporate online community, Chiu,
Hsu, and Wang134 found that community-related expectations of outcome were important to
supporting knowledge sharing, while expectations of personal outcomes had an insignificant

effect. The application of community-related outcomes relates to the contributor’s understanding
or judgment of the likely result of their own knowledge sharing as helping to provide value for
other members. This approach suggests both altruistic and collective motivations at work.
Collective motives appearing among teachers participating in an online community of
practice can also be found in the studies of Gray and Hew and Hara. 135 Gray notes that through
the telling and retelling of stories, members of the community negotiated meaning in their work,
developed a collective knowledge, and formed a group identity1.

In their study, Hew and Hara

found that the primary motivator for teachers to contribute and participate was a sense of
collectivism within the online learning community. The participants were motivated by the
desire to contribute to the field. Evidence of collectivism as a motivating factor for online
community participation is also found in the corporate online community as related by Ardichvili
et al, whose study revealed that the members viewed their knowledge exchange as being for the
public good.136 Participants were more likely to exchange knowledge based on their interest in
the community rather than in their own self-interest. The research of Yu et al., notes that the
presence of a strong culture of knowledge sharing can prompt individuals to contribute to
collective knowledge.137

Motives for knowledge sharing that relate to upholding moral principles within online
communities can be found in more than a few studies.138 Often the motive for upholding morals
can be revealed through the norm of reciprocity. This refers to the social custom related to a
transaction in which one individual’s extension of a resource is a later obligation to return that
favor. Reciprocal relationships can affect related knowledge sharing attitudes as well as the
intention to share knowledge.139 In this vein, members of a community can be motivated to
contribute due to feeling a professional obligation towards other members of the community,140
or to feeling that they should give back because they have previously received knowledge from
the community. Many participants believe that helping others is a fair reward for assistance that
they have received from the community. However, while the previous studies found reciprocity
to be a strong driver for knowledge sharing, two other studies demonstrated that knowledge
sharing was not significantly influenced by the norm of reciprocity. Lin et al examined the ways
that reciprocity affects members’ decisions to share knowledge, and found that the norm of
reciprocity was insignificant.141 One possible explanation may be that knowledge contributions
may be reciprocated in a generalized way (to the community) rather than to an individual. Wasko

and Faraj found that members of a closed community of legal professionals were motivated to
share knowledge with other members, even though they expected that their help would not be
reciprocated.142 Generalized reciprocity is defined by the act of giving by a third party within the
community rather than the original recipient returning the favor.
Members of an online community often want to help others by sharing and experiences,
and may have the goal of advancing professional knowledge. This is congruent with Lave and
Wenger’s community of practices framework and social learning theory. Themes related to four
individual motivations discussed (egoism, altruism, collectivism, and principalism) suggest that
engagement with online communities can be a highly social learning method that is driven, in
part, by the norm of reciprocity. Additional research is needed in this area to examine practices
that increase members’ individual motivations and reasons for knowledge sharing.

3.2.3 Supporting Knowledge Exchange

Working in concert with motivations for sharing knowledge, researchers from education
and library and information science in the area of online communities have identified concepts
that support the exchange of knowledge. Themes that emerged from reviewing the related
literature included the following factors related to this study: leadership and moderation, trust,
shared identity, and the ability to lurk and listen in on the conversation.
Effective leadership and moderation is a key factor in sustaining active online
communities and creating opportunities for knowledge sharing. As defined by Gairín- Sallán et

Molly McLure-Wasko and Samer Faraj. “Why Should I Share? Examining Social Capital
and Knowledge Contribution in Electronic Networks of Practice.” Management Information
Systems Quarterly 29, no.1 (2005), 35-57.
142

66

al.,143 there are four specific, core functions usually carried out by moderators: 1) organizational
function: organizing and coordinating the work of the community or group; 2) social function:
creating a social and friendly atmosphere that is conducive to member exchange and continued
involvement; 3) intellectual function: guiding and monitoring the quality of contributions as well
as synthesizing and distilling contributions into usable summaries; and 4) technological function:
providing support for technology and tools that allow members to effectively use the software
platform.
Related to this work, Gray discusses the importance of having moderators that are aware
of social, cultural, and other factors that allow the community to grow and change over time. 144
A study by Bourhis et al. examined the ways that actions by leaders of online communities
influenced the success of the community, which suggested that a central factor of successful
communities was very involved leaders who marshaled the ability to build alliances, foster trust,
and find creative avenues to encourage member participation.145 Having moderators that share
the vision of the site, increase visibility, and raise trust is at the core of enabling knowledge
sharing to occur within a specific online community.146

143

67

The Bourhis et al. study also suggested that selecting a leader based on personality,
enthusiasm, and skills was important for the success of the community. Key characteristics of
effective moderators that emerge from several studies include having sufficient knowledge of the
practice to demonstrate credibility, technical competence and the ability to teach members how
to effectively use the technology; an understanding of how to foster community and develop
social connections, creativity, an orientation toward life-long learning and the ability to build
trust and to find innovative ways to encourage participation.147 Overall, research findings support
active moderators as being essential for successful knowledge sharing practices within online
communities. However, while the selection of a good moderator emerged as a point of
consensus, there is little discussion in the literature on how to train and sustain good moderators,
nor on ways that the role of the moderator changes over time in communities that evolve and
grow.
Trust emerges repeatedly as a central factor in promoting vibrant online communities and
fostering knowledge sharing activities. Related to the community aspect of the communities of
practice concept and the application of social learning theory to online communities, Wenger et
al. argue that “learning together depends on the quality of relationships of trust and mutual
engagement that members develop with each other.”148 Research findings from studies of online
communities have supported the claim that trust and knowledge sharing are reciprocal

relationships that are influenced by the amount and quality of information shared.149 Usoro et al
found three trust factors that were significant in knowledge sharing within a corporate online
community: competence, integrity, and benevolence.150 This connects with findings from another
study, Ridings et al, which found that members’ trust in the competence, integrity, and
benevolence of other members was significantly predicted by responsiveness and confiding
behavior. Higher levels of trust within the community are formed when members respond to
messages quickly and often.151
Having a shared vision and identity that embodies goals and a clear purpose is essential
for community growth and sustainability. A shared vision supports meaningful, expert
conversation and thoughtful responses that are useful to members.152 One theme emerging from
the literature is that a collective identity and shared vision are central to successful sharing of
knowledge within a community.153 Selective recruitment and bounded communities based on a

shared practice may assist in the development of collective vision.154 Gray found that the
ongoing participation and sharing of experiences helped to forge collective identity and increased
willingness of members to participate and share knowledge.155
Using a community of practice lens, Lave and Wenger argue that lurking is a form of
“legitimate peripheral participation” and a crucial process by which a community can offer
opportunities for engagement and learning.156 Bishop found that one way of encouraging lurkers
to participate more in the community is for “regulars, leaders, and elders” to openly nurture
newcomers. This facilitates comfort, demonstrating that those who are new to a community are
treated well.157 Preece et al argue that lurking may be a problem if a community is less active.158
On the other hand, in vibrant, active communities, Preece et al suggest that lurking is not a
problem and should not be considered deviant behavior. Within the literature, the conversation
about whether lurking is a barrier or a support to knowledge sharing is an open question.
The literature related to online communities has identified mechanisms for supporting
knowledge sharing, as well as motivations related to knowledge sharing. Literature in this area
has also explored the importance of trust, leadership, and other support factors for facilitating

combined to shape the layers, content and context of the work inside of these communities is less
explored. This literature review uses these previous studies to extend this as an area for further
exploration.

3.2.4 Evolving conversations about online communities

Explorations of online community have continued to evolve in scholarly conversations across
and overlapping many fields, including media studies, science and technology studies, sociology,
and information sciences. Coalescing with conversations about community and social
informatics, strands of discussion range from crowdsourcing and microblogging to imagined
communities, identities, public expression and knowledge sharing.
Community informatics is described and defined by library and information science
researchers Williams et al. as “one field that has specifically attended to local community in the
digital age, as it adopts information technology or adapts to a technologically transformed
society.”159 This resonates with research concerned with the development of virtual communities
and the shaping of identity as described by scholars such as MIT media studies professor Nancy
Baym,

those established through microblogging conversations between performers and amongst online
fan communities.160 Research about the nature of public and how social media has reconfigured
and blurred lines of ‘publicness’ is an overlapping thread identified by Baym and boyd that spans
examinations of identity, relationships, and connections.161 Virtual community scholarship has
also evolved by considering the relationships between what could be described as mediation and
the material structure that supports conversation. Dialogue examining the interplay between
infrastructures and message brings many scholars into conversation from the fields of
communication, media studies, information sciences, anthropology, and more.162

work, this review of the related literature sets out some of the concepts and issues related to that
use.

3.3.1 Competing ideas related to knowledge and management

There are competing definitions and strands of knowledge management that are pragmatically
opposed. By examining and using knowledge management as it stands in popular and business
literature as a guiding concept, one must quickly accept that it is related to a mission-driven,
business agenda and practice. The term “corporatist,” suggested by Keen and Tan, carefully
captures the view of knowledge as organizational asset, the aggressive goals of innovation, and
the purposive intention of generating a high return on investment.163
An ongoing tension in the area of knowledge management is the difference between
information and knowledge. One major limitation to the use of knowledge management as a
concept is the view of “knowledge” being separated from the individual, or knowledge as a
corporate asset. This points to a separation recognized by Qureshi and Keen (and later, Keen) as
key differences between knowledge management and knowledge mobilization.164 In this view,
knowledge management relates to the supply side of information organization, the creation of
collaborative environments to leverage intellectual capital, and incentives for shifts in work
practices that provide incentives for knowledge sharing that is largely separated from the

individual context.165 Accepting this largely corporatist view of knowledge management
generates conflict between thinkers in this area, including Ekbia and Hara, Wilson, and Fuller,
who do not agree that knowledge should be mainly valued for organizational payoff.166
Qureshi and Keen note that knowledge mobilization reflects the demand side of
information organization, or that knowledge is dominated by the identity and situational context
of the individual, and relates to the personal choice of “whether, when, why and with whom” to
share knowledge and expertise.167 This theme and ongoing tension between separating out
knowledge as corporate asset, and knowledge as intellectual capital and personal decision, begins
to get at the competing definitions and goals in the area of knowledge management.
Keen and Tan point to the need for a shaping framework that encourages a balance
between what they term “thought leadership priorities” (often consultant firms and charismatic
business leaders) and research and scholarship that derives from intellectuals and academic
disciplines. Their proposal to use a framework of knowledge fusion to partition the field of
knowledge into four arenas of distinct but overlapping areas: 1) knowledge management (the
goal); 2) knowledge mobilization (the enabler); 3) knowledge embodiment (the study of what it
means “to know”); and 4) knowledge regimes (the organizational, political, and sociological

These scholars take a skeptical view towards some areas of knowledge management. See

factors that shape how knowledge is focused, authenticated, and legitimized, and validated in the
organizational and professional context.168 This proposal is linked to the need for moving beyond
the assertion of a single definition of knowledge that works for all communities. In this vein,
they argue that current trends of “thought leadership” that are detached from the scholarly and
research communities lack staying power and exist more as “claims leadership” than thought
leadership.169
As a conceptual thread, the idea of ‘tacit knowledge’ emerges as a constant strand of
discussion in most explorations of knowledge management, and as a central concept for the
study of communities of practice. The idea that tacit knowledge exists in the minds of people and
is thus distinguished from knowledge that is not formally recorded is an understanding that
persists in some areas of the field, and particularly in the work of “thought leaders.” However, as
noted by Day, this is a ‘folk-psychology notion’ that leads to the deduction and expectation that
tacit knowledge can easily be transferred by simply having the knowledge holder reflect on and
articulate the knowledge.170 There are competing conversations in the learning and management
literature about defining tacit and explicit knowledge, and understanding how and whether tacit

knowledge can, in fact, be captured or articulated.171 The key concern related to tacit knowledge
is centered around whether to attempt to capture it, for example as a best practice or “lessons
learned” exercise, or whether it is better to foster an informal environment where it may be
shared. Literature on management systems addresses the movement of explicit, codified
knowledge. However, much tacit knowledge is likely to be difficult to codify in ways that can be
transferred by management systems. This discussion is a familiar one to archivists and records
professionals. As argued by Malhotra et al, focusing on systems that facilitate collaborative work
between knowledge holders and those who need knowledge may be a better avenue for
exploration than trying to codify tacit knowledge.172 In this sense, the community of practice
concept is one that naturally fits within this conversation to connect people informally for
knowledge exchange.
It should be recognized with any use of the term knowledge management that there is an
explicit intent for “knowledge” to be the target of “management.” In that sense, there are real
limitations to the use of knowledge management as a term that encompasses anything but
understanding it as a field and not a topic. Knowledge management principles and practices are a
set of processes and practices that come from other disciplines, including information and library
science, business, management, and technology.173 Thematically, knowledge management as

used in the literature is a management term that is about meeting organizational needs for
effective action. Overlapping with organizational learning, the area of knowledge management
has a stronger focus on managing knowledge as a corporate asset. It is not about knowledge as an
intellectual position in the sense of Foucault, but about actions and corporate, organizationally
driven management goals.

CONCLUSION

This literature review is primarily concerned with the contexts and complexities of peer learning
communities and their creation of active records. In order to support that aim, this review opens
with a thematic look at collective memory conversations. It next moves to examining literature
from library and information science, education, and business regarding cooperative online
communities and learning practices. Research that examines the motivations for community
members to participate in knowledge exchange, to engage in leadership practices, and that foster
a foundation of shared trust in online communities was discussed in this section. These
contributions are useful to support inquiry that seeks to further understand the role of records
within an online community that is structured around shared learning. Finally, this review
examined the use of community knowledge in an organizational context, as a tool for knowledge
management. This points to ongoing tensions between knowledge as a corporate asset, and an
understanding of knowledge as intellectual capital and sharing as a personal decision. The
literature discussed in this review supports a deeper look at communities where active
recordmaking is a core piece of self-definition and peer learning. Centrally, it also reveals points
of tension and areas for exploration using the continuum as a frame for this case study.

METHODOLOGY

4.1

OVERVIEW

In this chapter, I describe my methodological approach, research framework, data sources, and
methods of data analysis. This study has been designed using a richly layered case study to bring
together data and perspectives that allow for exploration of the complex topography of the
records continuum model as a framework for understanding the roles and functions of records in
a community.
By employing the research strategies discussed in this chapter, the case is then used to
address the central research question:
What can applying the records continuum to the CompanyCommand case study
reveal about the nature of the framework as a theory for understanding the role of records
in a community?

4.2

CASE STUDY AS A RESEARCH FRAMEWORK

The design of a research approach is a decision that is intimately related to the characteristics of
the research inquiry and situation. Choosing a qualitative case study approach came directly from
considering the relationships and human decisions behind the construction of community. This
78

approach also made sense for examining the use of the records continuum as an analytic tool for
understanding community records creation as a human endeavor.
The core data for this dissertation comes from an instrumental case study, which involves
the deep examination of a specific case in order to provide insight into a broader issue or
theory.174 Within this research methodology, the selected case is examined in depth and applied
as a secondary tool to facilitate and advance understanding of another phenomenon, issue, or
theory. Robert K. Yin notes that the rationale for a single instrumental case study makes sense
when the research is designed to “confirm, challenge, or extend the theory.” 175 While one
critique of the single case study model could be a limited ability for generalization, Yin notes
that it is important to be clear that the intent of the research is to explore and generate theory, or
“analytical generalization,” which upholds the scope of the case as an exploratory tool.176 In this
study the case study is used to make claims about a theory and model (records continuum) rather
than a population (military online communities).177
For this dissertation, CompanyCommand serves as the case study’s object of study,
which in turn provides a setting to explore the records continuum. This research uses the single
case study approach with embedded units of analysis.178 Within the case study framework, I have
examined and will discuss four topical forum threads, themes emerging from ARMY Magazine

articles that were generated from forum posts, and five interviews from forum administrators. I
have used close reading and open coding as the methods to extract and analyze the data from the
threads and articles. In addition, I have used the interviews to provide a contextual setting for this
data. The records continuum serves as the central framework for analyzing the data of the
CompanyCommand case study. This has allowed me to discuss how the continuum may serve as
a model for exploring and understanding the role of records in a community.
One of the strategies that organization studies scholar Kathleen Eisenhardt lists for
analyzing case study data is developing detailed descriptions for the objects of study, explaining
that this can be essential for researchers to cope with a large amount of information.179 I have
used this descriptive approach by bringing the sources of data together to create a narrative that
is used for contextualizing the analysis of the records continuum.
When selecting a case study for research, there should be a rationale for the choice of the
object of study. For the purposes of this dissertation, CompanyCommand is a layered corpus of
records that affords a deep examination and discussion of the complex contours of the records
continuum as a theory and as a model. An exploration of the work of the CompanyCommand
forum using multiple methods of data collection has yielded a rich set of data. The triangulation
of various data points, defined by Robert Stake as “a process of using multiple perceptions to
clarify meaning,” provides data to support an in-depth investigation of the central research
question.180 By examining the forum structure and system, the forum posts individually and
collectively as threads, and published articles, as well as interviewing forum creators and

administrators, data and discussion emerging from this study explores the interactions of the
system, records, and actors related to this professional community of practice. By employing
case study methods for this research study, collected data was analyzed and triangulated to bring
together insights, differences, and common themes from a range of data points to suggest, raise,
and provoke areas of discussion related to the central research question.
Careful reading of events, systems, processes and the work of communities, institutions,
and people is important for understanding records and recordkeeping. Recent work and
discussion of continuum approaches, such as a dissertation by Andrew Lau and an article by
Leisa Gibbons, use case studies as a framework for discussing points of tension and debate that
surround this theoretical frame. While Lau uses ethnography as a means to illuminate the
documentation practices of a particular art community, the data generated from his case study of
the Los Angeles-based Machine Project informs his critical analysis of the records continuum
and of discussions in the literature related to community archives.181 Gibbons uses three cases to
discuss the cultural heritage continuum model (CHCm) and the role of YouTube in the formation
of culture, as well as employing the continuum approach as a conceptual lens for exploring
assumptions and limitations of Australian cultural heritage institutions that collect YouTube
videos as cultural heritage.182 Both of these recent research projects demonstrate that the case

continuum approaches.

4.3

OBJECT OF STUDY

Data collection for this study involved exploring, describing, and understanding patterns and
themes emerging from my examination of the CompanyCommand forum. The examination and
description of the forum and the work of the administrative team is a central source of contextual
information for this work. To accomplish this exploration, this dissertation uses existing data
consisting of forum threads, published member posts and other documents created and used
inside and outside of the CompanyCommand forums, as well as primary and secondary sources
about the forum’s creation, evolution, and impact. Data has also been created as part of the
process of interviewing forum creators and administrators about their work with the site. This
includes two site visits to CALDOL at West Point, and interviews with site administrators via
phone, Skype, and in person.
The CompanyCommand forums comprise a virtual community of practice that has been
explicitly designed for the professional development of junior officers (lieutenants and captains)
in the United States Army. The CompanyCommand forums reside within the larger MILSPACE
community of practice, which also has other restricted access forums for the development of
company-grade officers as well as West Point cadets, Reserve Officer Training Corps cadets, and
Officer Candidates. These forums are supported by a professional team located in the Center for
Advancement of Leadership and Development of Organizational Learning (CALDOL) at the
United States Military Academy. This instrumental case study is specifically focused on the
82

CompanyCommand forum and administrators/creators and does not extend to the full
MILSPACE community. Many forum users and site administrators are currently, or have been
recently deployed as part of combat operations in Afghanistan or Iraq, or on other military
installations around the world.183 This online forum community for CompanyCommand sits
within an overlapping circle of other communities, including the larger community of company
commanders, and the Army as an institution.

4.3.1 Embedded Units of Analysis

The four embedded units of analysis within the CompanyCommand case study are:
A) The CompanyCommand Forum as a system
B) Published articles in ARMY Magazine derived from forum threads
C) Topical forum threads
D) Interviews of forum administrators

4.3.1.1 Embedded Unit A: The CompanyCommand Forum as a System
The first embedded unit of analysis of this case study is the CompanyCommand forum as holistic
complex system involving an underlying technology tool; forum posts, which can be seen as
records and documentary acts; sets of posts that collectively compose forum threads; the rules
and processes that govern the administration and use of the forum; and the users and
administrators of the forum. Examining CompanyCommand as a system provides a frame for

183

Official withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq occurred in December 2011, though
additional troops remain on the ground for non-combat operations. Many of the posts and
interviews will be related to the experiences of officers as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, 20032010, or Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan (2001-ongoing).
83

understanding the work and interactions of the community members, including users and
administrators, through a rich description and coding of selected forum posts, themes, and topics
forms. This systems framing also enables the examination and description of the forum and
illustrative posts and threads to support analysis of community interactions and how they shape
both people and records. It also enables a forum post to be a documentary act that forms the basis
for other activities, such as building the community and transferring knowledge.

4.3.1.2 Embedded Unit B: ARMY Magazine Articles
The second embedded unit of analysis is the corpus of 97 articles in ARMY Magazine based on
CompanyCommand forum threads that ran from March 2005 through December 2013. It is
important to note that these 97 articles comprise a snapshot of what the CALDOL administrative
team found to be the most important or representative topic to highlight in a given month. This is
the full run of CompanyCommand-based articles from the start of the monthly series through my
research visit to West Point in early January 2014. The ARMY Magazine articles were
thematically constructed from a range of selected forum discussions that the administrative team
at CALDOL chose to highlight on a monthly basis. Looking at this full set of published posts
provides insight not only into the forums and narratives written by members, but also a window
into the process of mediation and selection by the administrative team as they disseminated
information across the Army and the broader military about the conversations on the site.
These ARMY Magazine articles have been chosen and organized topically by the
administrative team at CALDOL. The articles represent what CALDOL has judged to be the
“best” content from that month related to a topic chosen by the CALDOL staff. Each monthly
article contains about 15 to 20 sample forum posts compiled from a range of contributions from
company commanders. For example, the July 2005 article, “Prepare for Command,” asks for
84

responses to the question “What was the MOST important thing you did in your preparation for
command?” The article contains eighteen replies from company commanders that are grouped by
themes such as “Prepare Mentally,” “Know Your Soldiers and the Unit,” “Develop a Command
Vision and Philosophy,” and “Prepare Your Family.” Many of the articles have a similar
structure and arrangement. Looking at this set of published posts provided insight not only into
the forums and narratives written by members, but also a window into the process of mediation
and selection by the administrative team as they disseminated information across the Army about
the conversations on the site.

4.3.1.3 Embedded Unit C: Topical Forum Post Threads
For this study I have selected four representative topical thread clusters from the
CompanyCommand forum. The four threads were chosen as a point of analysis because they
represent the reactions and comments made by site members prior to their incorporation and representation as part of the published articles. Reading the forum threads in their original state at
the site of creation was a purposeful choice to understand how the records change, overlap, and
reference each other within the context of the forum.

4.3.1.4 Embedded Unit D: Interviews
I have used purposeful sampling to select a set of five past and current administrators and forum
creators for in-depth interviews about the forum.184 The leaders selected for interviews served as
key informants for this study. The current administrative staffing framework for the site includes
a colonel in charge, at least one major actively curating the forums, a technical manager (civilian,

184

(Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2007),189.
85

retired Army), and an administrative assistant (civilian). Because of the nature of this
assignment, majors cycle in and out to serve in active support roles, usually on a yearly or biyearly basis that usually follows the normal change of duty station timelines for the Army.
For this case study it was important to interview the forum administrators because they
are part of a small, selected group of experts that shape the community and hold knowledge
about the conception and evolution of the forum over time. Forum founders and administrators
that have been critical to the success of the site were identified through initial discussions with
the CompanyCommand team.
The interview sample includes current and former site administrators. The interviewees
include site creators as well as current administrators who were asked to participate based on
their extensive knowledge about the history, culture and evolution of the site. Personally
identifiable information (primarily names) have been anonymized in the Findings chapter for the
privacy of the respondents. For several respondents, a second interview (for clarification
purposes) was necessary.
Research interviews for this study were conducted using a qualitative, semi-structured
method. The interviews were used as supporting data for the description of the case study.
Interviewing members of the core administrative team presented me with access to the context
and mechanics of their decisions about structure and format, and allowed me to gain new
understanding into their purpose and intent as active creators and shapers of the community. The
intent of the interviews was to gain further understanding about the decisions of the forum
administrators and founders. This provided a layer of contextual information about the other data
as well as about design and culture of the forum.

86

4.3.2 Additional Resources

Additional resources, including articles and other publications written by administrators about
the development of the forum have been identified as sources for this research. Because much of
the information about the creation and evolution of the forum is informal or undocumented, these
secondary sources were very helpful in creating a broader contextual picture of the work of the
forum. In the course of the interviews and the data collection process, additional sources
emerged and were identified by participants and contacts associated with CompanyCommand.
This includes reports, PowerPoint slides from presentations about the site, and several articles
and dissertations. A full list of additional publications, references and resources may be found in
Appendix A.

4.4

DATA SELECTION, COLLECTION, AND CREATION METHODS

Purposeful sampling is based on the premise that the researcher wants to gain understanding and
deeper insight about a particular phenomenon. The goal of this process is to create an illustrative
sample.185 The selection of embedded units of analysis, and data within those units, were
carefully chosen to understand and illustrate the work of the CompanyCommand forum, the
object of study for this this case study. This section describes how I selected, collected, and
generated data from the four embedded units of analysis that constitute my case study.

87

4.4.1 The CompanyCommand Forum as a System

Discussion of the evolution and changes in the forum over time emerged in the administrator
interviews, and is also described as part of the site background. I had full access to this restricted
forum for the purpose of this study while I was onsite at the United States Military Academy in
January 2014. An extended description of the forum is a central piece of the data created and
gathered.

4.4.2 ARMY Magazine Articles

The full set of 97 published ARMY Magazine articles described in section 4.3.1.2 were gathered
from the online magazine website at http://www.ausa.org/publications/armymagazine. The
articles were reviewed using open coding, which identified themes arising across the articles.
Articles were coded for themes and topics using content analysis. The coding served as my data
from this embedded unit of analysis (Unit B). This study examined the full set of 97 monthly
articles published from March 2005 through December 2013. As an important part of the
research process, these emergent themes also later influenced my reading of the records
continuum model. Themes emerging from this coding process were used to inform the selection
of the four topical post clusters (Embedded Unit of Analysis C, see section 4.3.1.3) during my
research visit in January 2014 that were used to describe, trace, and analyze through the records
continuum model.

88

4.4.3 Topical Forum Post Threads

As mentioned above, topical thread clusters were drawn from a review of the
CompanyCommand forum and themes arising from ARMY Magazine articles. Initial selection
criteria for a topical thread cluster required that the thread contained enough substantive
discussion and diversity of opinions over time to support close reading. The criterion required
that threads became part of at least one published article in ARMY Magazine and have at least 15
replies, signifying member interest, density, and richness of discussion. The thread reply count
was used as a selection factor because it was important to select threads that are substantive
enough to support close reading. These threads represent thematic and temporal diversity that
allows for critical reading and content analysis, and the topical threads have been mapped and
described through the lens of the records continuum. This process allowed for discussion of
selection, community editing and co-creation, and other themes that emerged from a reading of
the data.
During my January 2014 site visit, I reviewed an eligible list of related published articles
with the CompanyCommand administrative team. Based on their knowledge of the forum
threads that met my initial criteria, we arrived collaboratively at a set of threads that would
provide rich examples for examination and discussion. This process constituted a purposive
selection within the eligibility criteria that I had previously established. On the basis of my initial
criteria and my work with the forum administrators, I selected the sample of four threads, as
described in section 4.3.1.3, to code and describe more closely for the purpose of further analysis
and discussion. A sample of the coding may be found in chapter 5. These four threads could be
deeply described and traced backwards from their selection by CALDOL staff for compilation

89

and publication, through their genesis, use, and discussion on the forum. The coding of these
threads became the data for this embedded unit of analysis.

4.4.4 Interviews

Participants in the semi-structured interviews were purposely selected because they are a subset
of forum creators and administrators with expert knowledge of the site and of the culture of the
community. All interview subjects agreed to participate in semi-structured interviews for this
study in consultation with the current staff members at CALDOL.
Interviews with administrators and founders were conducted onsite at the United States
Military Academy, as well as by telephone and in other locations agreed upon by participant and
researcher between December 2013 and June 2014. Due to the possible constraints of
telephone/Skype interviews, this study was granted an exemption waiver for participant
signatures from the University of Pittsburgh IRB. All of the interviews were captured on a digital
recorder and transcripts were generated, as well as notes and memos during and after the
completion of the interviews.

4.4.5 Ethical Considerations and Institutional Review

The data collection process for this study involved interviewing human subjects, which carries an
obligation to respect the rights, values, and needs of the participants.
For this study, approval was required from the University of Pittsburgh Institutional
Review Board. Under the guidelines for research involving human subjects at the University of
Pittsburgh, this study falls under the “expedited” category. Approval was granted in February
90

2013, and renewed in February 2014. The University of Pittsburgh IRB has designated the risk
level of this study as minimal. While initially it was thought that two IRB reviews (from the
University of Pittsburgh and the United States Military Academy) would be required for the
project, the review board officer at the United States Military Academy stated that it would not
be necessary for this project. The IRB paperwork can be found in Appendix C.

4.4.6 Protection of Data

In accordance with the guidelines of the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board for
expedited studies, a Data Safety Management Plan for protecting the privacy of human subjects
was created for this study and has been filed as part of the application in compliance with related
university guidelines for the retention of research data.186
A waiver of written consent for this research study was granted by the University of
Pittsburgh IRB. Participants still verbally consented to participation prior to interview. Through
informed consent, the interview participants were made aware (1) that participation is voluntary,
(2) of any aspects of the research that may affect their well-being, and (3) that they were free to
stop participation at any point in the study.

DATA ANALYSIS

This dissertation uses two methods of analysis. The first, qualitative content analysis, is an
inductive process of creating analytic categories (coding) that arise from reading and reflect the
significance of events and experiences to those in the setting.187 The second method takes the
records continuum as an analytic frame to read the case study, using the generated codes and
selected threads developed in the earlier analysis. This framework is then flipped to use the case
and findings to examine the records continuum to better understand the framework using the lens
of what the tool produces, highlights, and conceals.

4.5.1 Qualitative Content Analysis

Qualitative content analysis is one of many research methods that may be used to analyze textual
data. An unobtrusive technique used widely in the humanities and social sciences, content
analysis allows researchers to probe the meanings, symbolic qualities, and expressive contents of
data and to consider more closely the communicative roles that these meanings play in the lives
of the data creators.188 Research that uses qualitative content analysis is focused on the
characteristics that emerge from communication and language. The design of this study was
structured to allow categories and themes to emerge from the data using inductive category

development.189 Using themes and categories that flowed from reading the data helped to
contextualize the research and ground the coding within the collection process.
In qualitative research, coding is the assignment of abbreviations, schemes and categories
for the purpose of seeing patterns in the collected data. This process allows for the identification
of information about the data, and for understanding and interpretation relevant to the data
analysis. Themes emerging from the data served as the primary codes.
The secondary literature published about military forums, and specifically about
CompanyCommand, also served to support codes that emerged from the data gathered through
examination of the forum, posts, and published posts. Zhang and Wildemuth note that defining
the textual unit of analysis and developing the categories and coding schemes is a process that
should occur early in the data collection phase.190 Preliminary analysis during the proposal stage
indicated the need to distinguish between coding the narratives of the CompanyCommand forum
posts and the themes of the posts. For example, a post describing tactics for avoiding roadside
bombs in Iraq may be topically about roadside bombs but thematically about demonstrating
leadership in combat situations. My coding of published forum posts prior to the onsite data
gathering visits at West Point suggested additional topics and questions for the semi-structured
interviews and forum examination.

189

Using inductive category development has been described as being appropriate for a
qualitative approach to content analysis by Hsiu-Fang Hsieh and Sarah E. Shannon in “Three
Approaches to Qualitative Content Analysis.” in Qualitative Health Research 15, no. 9
(November 1, 2005): 1277–1288.

93

The open coding for this project was initially based on background knowledge, my
review of the literature, and my reading of secondary sources related to the military and to
CompanyCommand. Based on my central research question, I decided that the coding of the
articles would reflect themes about the community. This is a small, but critical point: reading the
themes of the community’s work through the lens of the records continuum allows for additional
findings, discussion and interpretation, as well as for the possibility of raising concerns that fall
outside of the records continuum model.

4.6

TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THE RESEARCH

Transferability, dependability, and confirmability are criteria developed by social scientists
Yvonna S. Lincoln and Egon G. Guba191 for understanding and measuring the trustworthiness of
qualitative research. Using these measures addresses concerns that the positivist criteria used for
assessing quantitative research (such as internal and external validity, reliability, and objectivity)
are not appropriate measures for qualitative research approaches.
Transferability relates to the possibility that the findings of the researcher will be useful
to others with similar situations or research questions. Catherine Marshall and Gretchen
Rossman note that the “burden of demonstrating applicability of one set of findings to another
context rests more with the researcher who would make that transfer than the original
researcher.”192 However, rich contextual description and detail about the process and case afford

94

future researchers the ability to make that determination of transferability. I have worked to
address this by including rich description and background discussion of the forum, the founders,
and the circumstances of the work that serves as the case study as well as situating the central
theoretical framework. Dependability as a measurement criteria is demonstrated when others can
review the process and understand the procedures, research, and conclusions flowing from the
data. Framing qualitative research as socially constructed knowledge193 where discourse is
interpreted by the researcher allows for understanding that this researcher is the instrument, and
that the research process may itself cause change in both the researcher and participants. While
qualitative research is not repeatable in the same way as quantitative research, dependability can
be the result of a transparent and well-described process. Attempting to construct a process that
can be clearly understood and reviewed by others is one way in which I have tried to meet this
measurement.
Confirmability, as Lincoln and Guba note, is the extent to which the “data and
interpretations of the study are grounded in events other than the inquirer’s personal
constructions.”194 Qualitative research meets this measurement when findings are clearly
grounded in the data and conclusions flow logically from the process. I have worked to address
the challenge of confirmability by clearly describing and situating the case study and frameworks
within multiple, related contexts that are separated from my personal observations.

POSITIONING/PERSPECTIVE

This study is influenced by my own position and perspective as a scholar in the area of
recordkeeping. In October 2012, I met with several members of the CALDOL administrative
team, and expressed my interest in writing and talking further with them about their work.
I am an outsider writing about the CompanyCommand community through a
recordkeeping lens, and based on the interviews, forums, conversations, and background data
about the community. I am also trying to write in a way that members and the administrative
team would recognize and identify as how they use and engage with CompanyCommand. This
study uses both emic and etic approaches to understanding the cultural context of the community
and its records creation by combining observation and interviews with an exploration of records
generated by and shaped within that culture.
Understanding how participants describe and use their own community is important to
gaining insights about the structure, function and evolution of the forum and posts over time. The
action of including thick description of the forum, the background, and the interactions affords
the opportunity to bring in the voices of the CompanyCommand team and community. Deeply
describing the particulars of the case and the context of the records creators and community
allows for the possibility of a richer analysis of the records continuum model and what it may
highlight or obscure.

CONCLUSION

This dissertation has been designed to use a complex, layered case of the CompanyCommand
forum as an object of study to bring together data and perspectives that allow for examining the
records continuum model as a framework for understanding the multiple roles and functions of
records in a community. For this dissertation, I have used an instrumental case study with
embedded units of analysis. Data from the case study is in the form of published articles, forum
posts, and contextual interviews with site administrators. The articles and posts were coded using
qualitative content analysis, as well as “read” through the four dimensions of the records
continuum. The findings of this dissertation focus on an examination of the records continuum
and what has been revealed about the model as it is applied to the case study.

FINDINGS FROM THE COMPANY COMMAND CASE STUDY

5.1

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

As described in Chapters 1 and 4, this dissertation uses two methods of analysis. Using the first
method, qualitative content analysis, I have generated codes and themes from close readings of
published articles and forum posts, and memos from the semi-structured interviews. This case
has four embedded units of analysis, which are: understanding the CompanyCommand forum as
a system, published articles from ARMY Magazine derived from forum threads, topical forum
threads, and interviews with forum administrators. The interviews serve as contextualizing
information to inform the other embedded units, and are not presented as a separate section.
Findings of this work have highlighted useful aspects of the records continuum as well as
revealing key concerns that are hidden or missing when reading through the records continuum
lens.
In this findings chapter, I discuss the situated context of CompanyCommand, and
describe the forum as a system. Then I discuss the published articles, and their codes and themes.
Next, I explore the topical forum threads. Finally, I discuss a reading of these threads and themes
through the lens of the records continuum. Additional exploration of the records continuum will
occur in Chapter 6.

This section describes CompanyCommand as a system. It looks at the CompanyCommand forum
as a recordkeeping system. Then it addresses the history of the administrative team and changes
to the technical platform between 2001-2013.

5.2.1 Describing CompanyCommand as a Recordkeeping System

Describing CompanyCommand as a recordkeeping system requires first starting with a basic
definition of a recordkeeping system. The definition initially raised in the first chapter of this
dissertation is from ISO 15489, which defines a recordkeeping system as “an information
system, which captures, manages, and provides access to records through time.”195 As noted, this
definition is broad but serves as a useful starting point for discussing informal community-based
recordkeeping. Some similar definitions, such as from InterPARES and SAA, are rules-based
and institution-centric, reflecting concerns about evidence and business purposes that do not
fully fit informal community records.
Using the ISO definition also makes sense when considering its lineage and perspective.
ISO 15489 draws upon AS 4390-1996, the Australian records management standard, which is
based on continuum thinking. This is visible even in the definitional ISO language of “captures,
manages, and provides access” which closely works with the three outermost continuum
dimensions of “capture, organize, pluralize.” Perhaps as the emerging archives scholarship has
signaled shifts in the authority and purposes of archivists, this set of overlapping conversations

may lead to the emergence of changing, and perhaps more inclusive definitions and
understandings of what comprises a recordkeeping system, and who and what they serve.
Within this distributed online community, members are able to create forum posts, which
can be read as records. By establishing that CompanyCommand is a recordkeeping system, this
means understanding that the content (posts and other documents) generated and captured there
are records. The records accumulate layers of context, in a process of ‘becoming.’ 196 These
records, created as part of the community, contain content, and have context and a particular
structure.197 These records are captured by the CompanyCommand forum acting as a
recordkeeping system, and other members can contribute to the records, adding layers of
information. CompanyCommand situates the records and interactions within a structure that
provides organization and management, and provides access over time and space.

5.2.2 History of the technical platform

To describe the structures that support the CompanyCommand forums, it is useful to think about
layers. One foundational layer that is important for understanding the community is the changing
and iterative nature of the supporting technologies over time. The forum’s technological past has
shaped the site and the community, and changes in technology have an effect on the members,
particularly at the moment of moves to different platforms and software versions. This

As defined by Australian archival scholar Sue McKemmish, records are always in a state of
‘becoming.’ See Sue McKemmish, “Are Records Ever Actual,” in Sue McKemmish and Michael
Piggott (eds.), The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives First Fifty Years
(Clayton: Ancora Press, 1994), 200.

This connects with US archivist Richard Pearce Moses’ definition of records in the SAA
glossary as having fixity, containing content, having context, and maintaining structure.

and unpublished sources about and related to the forums.
The timeline of the CompanyCommand forum presented in Table 2 is used to situate the
description of the forum as a technology.

In 2000, the first instance of the site was hand-coded in HTML, as a set of static pages
(with manual updates that a member of the team was initially running out of his home), and
hosted on a commercial server.
101

INTERVIEWEE 1:
“It was totally flat. It all went through us. It was just stories, one after the other, on a
page. We did monthly updates through our web guy, and some months when he was busy, it
would take a few extra days. We were all doing this on the side, when we had time. It didn’t
scale well, and it was a psychological block, that their [members] messages had to be approved
before posting.”
INTERVIEWEE 2:
“Getting content sent in, at first, we were pulling from our own existing relationships
across the Army. We worked on building trust. Initially, we had trust because we all knew each
other, and had a common ethos, a passion about our profession.”

The grassroots site continued to build momentum among junior officers. In 2002, the
administrative team decided to make the move to a hosted solution that would allow for bulletin
boards, mainly in order to facilitate and encourage member conversation and a sense of
stewardship about the site.

INTERVIEWEE 2:
“In 2001-2002 we did get some significant pushback, along the lines of ‘What are you
doing and how does it connect with your job?’ I remember a senior leader up the command chain
directly asking me, “How do you know if you are adding any value?” While it is clear now that
the forums were creating value, back then it was a big cultural shift.”
INTERVIEWEE 1:
“The Cluetrain Manifesto was a huge influence… we wanted to make room for the best
conversation in a bar you’ve ever had. We wanted members to talk about their experiences, the
things you discuss in your backyard over a beer, or across the Humvee hood. We wanted to
guide that, make that conversation happen. That was a challenge, that central voice for members
to check in with each other.”

Initially, the move from the HTML, static site to the Tomoye Simplify platform in 2003
did not provide a central meeting point, the “front porch” that the administrative team had
envisioned. Their impetus behind creating a central place was to set the conversational tone, and
to allow members to have a chance to see/speak to the most relevant things going on.

102

INTERVIEWEE 1:
“We quickly hacked out a front porch, a place for the member voices to shine through.
We always want to have that, to design in our guiding goal of ‘for them/by them.’ It was a
challenge to get that in there. We ended up adding a local hack on our server with some
homegrown code in order to make it work.”
INTERVIEWEE 2:
“We talked about the concept of the ‘point man,’ and mindful design to help people
decide to take the risk of jumping in.198 The DNA of the site is professional conversation. How
do we make that conversation happen?”
INTERVIEWEE 3:
“One example of using our own local hack to the source code was the status update, the
SITREP. We added a ‘like’ button, and eventually a dropdown feature so that community
members could give more input. When someone says “I broke my ankle,” you don’t want to hit
‘like.’ We wanted to be able to say, “Hey man, I feel your pain.””

The Tomoye Simplify platform was a commercial software architecture that was
marketed for the purposes of facilitating organizational knowledge transfer between employees.
In 2002, Tomoye counted the Smithsonian Institution and the World Bank as customers of their
community discussion board software architecture and products.199 After the successful
migration of CompanyCommand to the Tomoye platform in 2003, other Department of Defense
communities were created on the platform, including an online community of practice set up by
the US Navy to share knowledge between senior acquisitions managers and their junior
colleagues.200 More significantly for the CompanyCommand community, the move to Tomoye
Simplify was part of a larger shift: the founders transferred ownership of the site to the United

To be a “point man” or to “take point,” is a military term that describes taking the most
exposed forward position in a combat advance, leading a group into hostile territory. The person
“walking point” is the most likely to encounter the enemy first. This term has been adopted into
some business cultures to simply mean leading, or being at the forefront of a new challenge.

States Military Academy. This meant the establishment of an official office space at West Point,
and more legitimacy, both officially and with the members of the community.

INTERVIEWEE 3:
“I’m not sure that we were rogue, but people saw our good intentions. The command
structure was aware of our site. The team members were already established as a trusted part of
the organization. But the idea of peers learning from each other was counter-cultural at the time.
The initial response from leadership was, leave it alone. Don’t mess it up if it’s good, if it’s bad,
it will die.”

Moving to Tomoye and to West Point in 2003 helped to usher in an era of growth for the
CompanyCommand forums, and for the overall umbrella/administrative team at CALDOL. 201
Having local control over the site meant that the administrative team could be nimble and
responsive to the needs of members.

INTERVIEWEE 3:
“The model evolved to full time staff, with the role of supporting the real heroes. The
topic leads, that was the secret sauce. The core team was essential to keeping the processes
moving. Each generation needed to step up and take ownership of the space.”
INTERVIEWEE 1:
“Perceptions. In the early days, it was about trust. Moving behind the Army firewall was
good for that. Knowing who was there was important. A challenge, as you grow to ten thousand
members, the body of work starts to have sensitivity.”
INTERVIEWEE 3:
“The [member] dog tag during this [Tomoye] period was so important. It featured a
mandatory question for every member, “What do you love about leading soldiers?” When you
scrolled over a thread or a knowledge object, the dog tag popped up. You could get to know
people and their background.”

201

CALDOL, the Center for the Advancement of Leader Development and Organizational
Learning at the United States Military Academy, grew out of the CompanyCommand project and
was established in 2005. Besides CompanyCommand, CALDOL is responsible for the
PlatoonLeader forums, as well as other leader development and organizational learning
programs.
104

The dog tag included user-created information about the member’s name, current duty,
past experience, and professional interests. Building this and other locally controlled code into
the system helped the CALDOL team to be connected with what their members wanted and
needed from the community. The administrative team believes that responsive nature of the
forums and leadership reinforced its reputation as a place to go for professional peer learning.

INTERVIEWEE 2:
“The boundaries reinforce the values of the community itself. You are not going to be
called stupid for asking a question. But you also have the ability to trust that you are speaking to
someone who has been there in those shoes. You can have confidence in their response.”
INTERVIEWEE 2:
“Building in the dog tags was a huge trust building piece. It removed rank from the
conversation. The intent was to promote the sense that “we are here to collaborate” and exude
that persona in the forums. Rank can be a hindrance to learning, and removing it also removes
concern about how to answer versus what to answer. We’re all here to learn.”
INTERVIEWEE 4:
“Other Army sites don’t have the same level of response [that we do]. They may have
contractors who are in charge of moving knowledge objects around. But they don’t have the
same kind of caring and relationship building. And personal relationships have gotten people to
contribute. The face to face meetings have also helped to build relationships, pushed people to
see the potential in the forums.”

The migration within the Tomoye architecture from the Simplify platform to Ecco also
happened at a time when CompanyCommand was rapidly rising in awareness and membership.
Meanwhile, the CALDOL team was also engaged with several face-to-face initiatives that were
related to their mission of peer leadership and teaching. This included workshops and leadership
exercises using topics that had been raised and refined in the forums. One such exercise, a set of
workshops conducted in August 2003 that included around 70 company-level leaders preparing

105

to deploy to Iraq, helped the administrative team to think even further about the structure and
delivery that would help them to facilitate conversation.202

INTERVIEWEE 1:
“Doing this stuff helped us to zero in on ownership. When we asked participants to
engage with each other and talk about what they had learned, or an experience they had,
conversations happened. Our focus as a team went from the role of expert to being facilitators,
participants, co-learners. I’m not sure whether they [the participants] got more out of it or if we
did.”
From September 2008 until February 2013, the “MilSpace Era” is the period that the
administrative team recalled most fondly when interviewed.203 During this time, the forums
reached peak membership levels (21,000 members), and more importantly, increased traffic and
participation. They had a much larger administrative team and staff (9 people in 2012) to handle
the traffic. The administrative team had local ownership and technical privileges to update and
customize the site. Members could access the community forums from home, from their
smartphones, and from all over the world.
However, according to the CALDOL team, assistance and new features were becoming
more difficult to get from Tomoye in 2011-2013.

202

This set of small-group workshops took place at the US Army Europe Land Combat Expo in
Germany in August 2003. It was led by members of the CALDOL administrative team, along
with a current CPT that came to the workshops directly from the fighting at “Thunder Run” in
Fallujah while he was on block leave, just days after his tour ended. The lessons learned from
this set of training workshops were eventually distilled into the Land Combat workbook, and
parts of this are still used for training exercises.
203
One note about two confusing names. “MilSpace” was the name for the umbrella of locally
controlled CALDOL forums on the Tomoye Ecco platform from 2008-2013. “milSuite” is the
umbrella (styled deliberately by the Army with a lowercase m and uppercase S) for the suite of
social media products behind the Army firewall and administered by BCKS. This is described
later in this chapter in more detail.
106

INTERVIEWEE 3:
“Tomoye was just dead in the water. All of the feature requests were coming from us. We
were coming up with all of the ideas. We were their dev [development]. They were bought out,
and we needed to move on.”
INTERVIEWEE 1:
“Big Army said ‘we need a bigger scale platform.’ What happened was that DoD stopped
paying for the license because they wanted to consolidate everyone on BCKS [Battle Command
Knowledge System].”204

Because of how CALDOL is structured and administratively located, which is outside of
the traditional command structure and not attached to an academic department, they are their
own self-contained unit within the US Military Academy. Team members describe this as “a
weird little private company” because, as active duty military members, they are not permitted to
solicit funds or grants. When the larger Army organization decided that they were moving to
BCKS, the other options were limited.

INTERVIEWEE 3:
“We hold bake sales and stuff. If we became part of a department, we become beholden
to them. We want to serve our members. So we pay the bills in the summer by holding
workshops.”
INTERVIEWEE 1:
“We tried to see the silver lining, that we could share and help learning across the Army
organization. We were doing a lot of local, nimble stuff and BCKS could see it but not do it. We
thought that we could help. Unfortunately we don’t have server access. But we’re just another
untrusted customer to BCKS.”

Since the official migration in 2013, CompanyCommand has been part of milSuite.
(which falls under the BCKS umbrella and is described in more detail below). The move meant
being, for the first time in CompanyCommand history, unable to control the website or make

local changes. The milSuite system sits behind the Army firewall, only accessible from CAC
(Command and Access Control) card machines, usually at work.

INTERVIEWEE 4:
“People are afraid because milSuite is Army green205. Rank gets in the way of
conversation, and people are afraid to get caught playing at their desks, similar to Facebook.”
INTERVIEWEE 1:
“The move [to milSuite] cut off our conversation with future leaders. It cut off 90% of
ROTC and reserve participation, because they don’t have access.”

Figure 2: Partial depiction of milSuite infrastructure

This suggestion of being “Army green” reflects the idea and tension that when the site is
perceived to be official by members, members may not feel as though they can ask difficult
questions or be so open on the boards.
205

The image above depicts the situation for the past two moves. Sketched by a member of
the CALDOL administrative team, the drawing on the left shows the 2008 to early 2013
MilSpace structure while CompanyCommand was still using Tomoye Ecco. The MilSpace
umbrella held CompanyCommand, as well as sister sites PlatoonLeader and FRGLeader. Other
locally controlled initiatives included LeaderCast, Leader Challenge, and Pro Reading. On the
left is the milSuite structure, and CompanyCommand’s place in that space.
As described above, CompanyCommand has gone through a number of moves and
organizational changes. Updates to the front end user interface and back end platform have
resulted in changes to the site and how it functions, while the core goals of CompanyCommand
have remained the same over the lifetime of the forum. However, some shifts at the institutional
level of the Army have altered the ways that members locate, enter, and use the forums. When
the CompanyCommand team moved from their locally hosted site (at CALDOL) to milSuite,
hosted under the auspices of BCKS, they were forced to change platforms, and their locally
grown and developed structure was transitioned to milSuite, the military version of Facebook.206
The CALDOL team lost much of their flexibility and autonomy when they moved from local
hosting to offsite remote hosting that was part of a much larger (and less responsive to technical
issues) administrative structure. But, perhaps even more importantly, the administrative, intra-

Army move to consolidate social media using an enterprise-wide system hosted at BCKS in 2013
also placed the forums behind the Department of Defense (DoD) firewall. This had a range of
effects, but one crucial factor was that members now had to log in from a CAC-enabled
(Common Access Card) machine. Instead of being able to log in and participate from a personal
computer, tablet or smartphone after hours, all forum access was now only available through
Army-owned or approved equipment. This also meant that a stern DoD warning appeared now at
each login:








YOU ARE ACCESSING A U.S. GOVERNMENT (USG) INFORMATION SYSTEM (IS)
THAT IS PROVIDED FOR USG-AUTHORIZED USE ONLY.207
By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following
conditions:
The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including,
but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense,
personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.
At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.
Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine
monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized
purpose.
This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG
interests—not for your personal benefit or privacy.

Another effect of moving the forums inside of the milSuite area was the persistent official
identifier/login. Member account information was now attached to their official Army/DoD login
name and rank, whereas previously members had a “dog tag” that allowed them to personalize
their own profile and story in a way that matched the site and its culture. The shift to using
official identifiers on milSuite also placed additional, visual emphasis on rank and title, which
had been purposely deemphasized on the forums to allow for a peer-to-peer feeling of informal
discussion and exchange. Even though the CompanyCommand forums remained a closed,

207

110

purposeful area for company commanders, the location/platform change meant that members
now traveled through the official DoD gateway to access the site, and the feeling of a trusted,
private community outside of official Army reach was challenged.
While the site changes over time are not the main focus of this dissertation, these shifts
have cast a chill on the previously more grassroots, community learning culture of the site. As
demonstrated by comments in the interviews, the CALDOL administrative team certainly feels
that the MilSpace/Tomoye setup was better in a number of ways. Clearly the administrative team
holds the perspective that their community was better served when the CALDOL team had more
autonomy to make responsive and nimble changes. This is a tension that is likely also reflective
of the somewhat uncertain space that the CALDOL unit holds within their hierarchical
organization.
The numbers appear to support concerns about drops in forum membership, with
approximately 21,000 members in 2012 on MilSpace, which dropped to 6,633 members in
January 2014 after the move to the BCKS-hosted milSuite.208 These interrelated changes may
have also altered the likelihood of members trusting that the forum was a safe place to ask
questions, deciding to create new records about their personal experiences or to even participate
in the forum community. This provokes questions about how records are situated and can be
understood and read through different contexts over time, and will be discussed further in
chapter six.
The volume of new posts and responses was visibly smaller and slower after the forum
move. Because so much of the work of this community of practice relies on the dynamic
participation and personal storytelling of members through the creation of posts, the combined

208

111

effects of these seemingly small changes to the infrastructure had a substantial impact. The
CALDOL team that manages CompanyCommand is in the process now (in 2014) of trying to
transition the forums back to a locally hosted, non-CAC server, hoping to regain autonomy and
reinvigorate conversation and community.

5.2.3 Growing pearls of co-created wisdom

Replying to a forum post can bring more answers, questions and knowledge into the thread. This
constitutes a reactivation of the record and, much like an oyster with a pearl, the responses add
an additional layer of co-created information, complexity, value, and context to the record. The
continued activity between the original record and the responses means that the ‘pearls’ continue
to accrue knowledge and value as members use and contribute to the record.
To extend the metaphor even further, these ‘pearls’ can also be recombined and used in
different ways. By compiling a targeted, themed article each month from forum posts, the
administrative team is not only reactivating the records but adding different dimensions and
highlighting other uses for these gems, and doing so with a different, more public audience in
mind. The ARMY Magazine articles published by the administrative team and using forum
content are a purposeful retelling of the work of the site. By thematically organizing, situating,
and editing posts around a coherent narrative, the administrative team is not just reactivating the
record, but also creating an entirely new record for a different audience and different purpose.
Part of the forum development and construction relates to placing content and lessons
learned within contextual layers: essentially the concept of storytelling. By embedding
knowledge within rich, detailed description and personal stories, the contextual elements such as
an interesting story, outcome, timeline, and location serve to make the forum posts more
112

relevant, timely, memorable and useful to others. Viewed through a lens of social learning
theory, these evocative and personal descriptive posts situate the context of the knowledge, but
also enable other members to evaluate the content and perhaps modify and reuse the lesson in
their own current and future professional practice.
The development of multi-layered, co-created threads (stories) to situate learning and
sharing is explicitly facilitated by the structure of the forums as a shared, active recordkeeping
system. Not only does the site provide a space to tell stories, but it actively allows for the
creation, capture, organization, and sharing (pluralization) of those stories. Told over time, and
by many authors/records creators/members, these stories form the heart of the site and are the
vibrant manifestation of the original founders’ mission for this professional community of
practice. Indeed, the use of forum members’ stories every month as building blocks for the
ARMY Magazine articles demonstrates that the shared, co-created records about personal
experiences take pride of place for this community. Learning, leadership, training: all of these
relate to the center of the community mission, which is formed by trust and relationships
between people who have the best interests of the community and their profession in mind.

113

a welcome center which contains a greeting, a link to the latest newsletter, announcements about
command changes, and notes from the CC Support Team, as well as a photo and link to a
rotating set of featured member interviews. The remainder of the center column displays recent
content posted on the forums. The right column has an action area and a cloud of popular tags for
content on the site.

114

The organizational structure of the site has changed over the years, showing changes in
technology (as described earlier in this chapter) as well as growing understanding by the
administrative team of how the site is used by members. Because the navigation and organization
of the site directly influences the experiences of the forum user, the administrative team used
feedback and responses from members to better understand and form a concrete list of the site
priorities that aligned with the community goals. Asking the question “What does a companylevel unit need to be able to do in order to be effective?” guided the team in determining main
topic categories for the forums that they aimed to make intuitive and mesh with the mission of
the community of practice.209
Developing a simple taxonomy (top level categories) for the site allows members to
quickly move through the forum and identify the area and relevant information that they need.
By breaking the forums into main topic areas, this organizational structure also allowed the
CompanyCommand administrative team to assign topic leaders to each section. The
administrative team chooses engaged and energetic members to become topic leaders based on
their contributions, expertise, experience and participation. Having members move into topic
leader roles extends the engagement of the administrative team with members, and allows for
more responsive and in-depth conversation. The careful deployment of topic leaders is an effort
to make conversations more productive, engaged, and dynamic.
The use of topic leaders for facilitating conversation on the forums is also strategic.
While many threads and questions originate from the CompanyCommand membership, topic
leads are informal peer guides that play a role in keeping the conversation on track by clarifying

209

The CompanyCommand administrative team solicited feedback from company commanders
(members and non-members) about this question, and used the compiled feedback to make these
decisions. This was raised in conversation with the author in January 2014.
115

and asking questions, as well as responding when they have relevant expertise. Recognizing the
importance of this role, the forum team created several documents to guide new topic leaders,
including the “Topic Lead Rucksack” and the “Online Facilitation Handbook” to build upon the
shared community knowledge about online teaching and learning. These handbooks begin with
the underlying premise that questions are the catalyst for dynamic conversation, and provide a
simple set of guidelines, tips, and suggestions for effective, productive engagement. The
guidelines are similar in tone and practice to military assessment strategies that are already
familiar to members. In a general sense, any assessment will address areas of concern: current
situation and operational environment (where we are), the meaning and significance of data (so
what and why), and next steps (what’s next).210 Effective assessment practices should consider
answers to the first two concerns in order to develop an answer to the third.
The CompanyCommand leader documents echo the general assessment guidelines in a
way that is modified to reflect the intent, values and goals of this particular online professional
community. For example, the first area in the “Online Facilitation Handbook,” Initial
Assessment, asks: “Is the question aligned with what CC is about, is it clearly stated with enough
detail, and is it urgent?” Being clear about whether the question fits with the purpose of
CompanyCommand is at the top of the assessment, signaling the importance of maintaining
focus on the mission and culture of the site. Assessing whether the question has been effectively
communicated gives the topic lead some responsibility for clarifying or rephrasing so that
responses meet the needs of the member. The third aspect of the initial assessment is related to
understanding how significant and immediate the member’s need may be. This allows team

116

members to decode the impact of the question, and to flag urgent questions that merit a quick,
detailed response.
Thinking about these intertwined processes and patterns suggests the unlikely possibility
that this forum could fully exist outside of the cultural reach of the Army. Values from related,
overlapping communities are embedded within the culture of the CompanyCommand forum and
within the records and relationships fostered there. So then if the values are tightly woven into
the fabric of the Army community and the records, can these values be fully unpacked,
described, and understood using the records continuum?

5.2.4 Administrative Structure

The structure of the forum as a recordkeeping and information system is important to the overall
outcomes. Having the framework of the recordkeeping structure in place has allowed the
conversations to continue and the records to be co-created and evolve over time and space. The
structure of the informal discussion threads allows officers to ask questions in a professional,
supportive environment. The informal zone gives them the ability to talk about their knowledge
and interpretations of events and situations as individual and community actors in ways that
allowed their personal experiences to maintain context and relevance over time for both
themselves and for a wider audience.
In this case, the records and the action of co-creating the records also work to help the
members and administrators think about how to understand, view, and reuse these experiences
for shared and personal learning, growth, and leadership development. In turn, viewing and
building these conversations and sharing this knowledge contributes to shaping the community
and individual experiential memories together, as well as separately. The documentary act in this

case is not only writing down one’s own experiences, but in reacting to the initial posts with
further explanation and stories, and then, additionally shaping the published work to reflect the
multi-layered, co-created narrative that could not have been fully realized without the assistance
of many voices. The records of this community continue to evolve, with the published articles
reflecting a snapshot of various iterations over time and space.
A key role in providing, prescribing, and maintaining the community structure is the
major support provided by the administrators at CALDOL and the team leads. Often encouraging
members to respond, both in the forums and by private message, the administrative team forms
the backbone of positive, supportive fellowship for this community. In a sense, the community is
both peer-driven and clearly mediated by the CALDOL team, which lends both positive energy
and a cohesive, streamlined strategy for eliciting relevant responses from members.211 This
mediation, while deliberately working to avoid breaches of operational security (OPSEC) or
disclosure that could harm a member, also may serve to shape the contributions and member
decisions about participation and records creation.

5.2.5 Trust, cohesion, and community as important factors for records co-creation

The presence of a collaborative tool does not guarantee communication, collaboration, or
community use. While trust in an evidential sense and the creation/maintenance/use of trusted

211

Other research that has centered around co-productive labor for online communities, such as
the work of media studies scholar Hector Postigo on AOL, is relevant and related in a broad
sense, but doesn’t fully address the addition of a dedicated leadership team or structures for
disseminating co-produced work that emanates from the community.
Peer-driven communities are not unique to this particular case. However consideration of the
combination of a paid leadership team with control over the design and dedicated to the site,
which resides both inside and outside of professional work, is relevant for thinking about the
ways that the community input and published output is mediated and understood.
118

records are discussed frequently in archival discourse, one key theme that arose from this case
was the importance of trust between people as the underlying impetus to create and co-create
records. Embedded within the ethos, the structure, and the culture of CompanyCommand is the
idea of trusting each other and sharing knowledge and information with the intention of helping
another person reach his or her goals. Whether that goal is learning how to counsel and guide
units that have suffered casualties in the field, working with your first sergeant (1SG), or
designing a physical training (PT) program, the central concept behind CompanyCommand is to
share hard-earned knowledge with a trusted community. Posts contain stories and anecdotes that
are usually personal in nature, can be revealing, and are tailored in message and pitched for this
specific professional community of practice.
Trusting the other members of your group is critical for success and survival in the battle
space, and it is important for cohesion and community. As part of the forum experience, trusting
each other is an integral part of the records creation act, and the re- activation and use of that
record, both inside and outside of the community. Members create records and share them
because they trust other members, and because they want to participate in that community
building and knowledge sharing. Without the basis of trust in the other members of the
community, these records would likely be different, and some might not be created at all. Even a
quick look at other military forums that were established formally by the organization of the
Army for the purpose of knowledge management shows that few of these have enjoyed the
collaborative community sense or success of CompanyCommand. Created under the umbrella of
Battle Command Knowledge Systems (BCKS), the other professional forums (such as NCO.net)
were built after the successful adoption in 2002 of CompanyCommand and PlatoonLeader by the
Army, but without a central community-based administrative team to foster trust, discussion, and

119

a sense of ownership within the membership. These and other Army-owned forums, such as the
Brigade Combat Team Warfighters Forum (BCT WfF) are described as “command directed,
high-priority tools that provide knowledge management capabilities to deployed and deploying
soldiers to ensure they have access to all the knowledge and information necessary to complete
their wartime mission.”212 However, these forums did not build a sense of trusted community or
strongly shared purpose. As of December 2013, several of these official forums were under
review and on the verge of being shut down due to lack of traffic or use by members.
Trust between members is a vital component of the decision to create and re-activate
records within this community. Cultivating a community of respect and fostering desire to share
hard-won knowledge with trusted others are central ingredients in the success of this community
and perhaps in other community recordkeeping. Understanding how this component of trust can
be understood and visible through the lens of the continuum became an emerging question as
part of this dissertation. How are values expressed in the continuum, and how does knowledge of
community values support an understanding of the record and recordkeeping system? 213 These
questions continue to reemerge throughout this chapter and the next.

In this dissertation, I am using “values” in the sense of concepts that are important to the
community, CompanyCommand, that is being examined in this case study.
These values include notions of trust, morality, and others that will be further described later in
this document.
I am aware that there are many related fields that are examining value-sensitive design (VSD)
and connected issues of morality and ethics in technology. This includes the National Science
Foundation funded Future Internet Architectures project (2010-2014) and Values in Design
council, as well as related scholarship by researchers such as Helen Nissenbaum, Geoffrey
Bowker, Cory Knobel and others. There are certainly connections between the values explored in
the case study and this related scholarship that could be explored in future work.

EMBEDDED UNIT B: PUBLISHED ARTICLES

This section describes the process of open and axial coding, and emergent themes that came from
the categories.

5.3.1 Coding the ARMY Magazine Articles

During my initial reading of the 97 published articles, I used open coding to assist my sorting
and understanding. Open coding allowed me to begin to identify categories from the data. This
has been defined by sociologists Strauss and Corbin as a key analytic process that allows
concepts to be identified, and their properties and dimensions to be uncovered in the data. 214 The
open coding took place in the online qualitative software platform Dedoose, and was in the form
of memos, notes and the assignment of thematic codes that attempted to capture what was being
discussed throughout each article.

121

The initial codes came from a line-by-line reading of the 97 ARMY Magazine articles
from 2003-2013. The codes that emerged from the initial round of reading informed some of the
questions for the semi-structured interviews. The main purpose of the open coding was to
establish and consider themes that would lead to the selection of the four forum threads for
deeper discussion and reading. The 97 articles were broken down into 1,082 excerpts using 45
initial codes from reading the data. This involved 3, 884 codes applied to the 97 articles,
meaning that each article was assigned an average of approximately 40 codes each. Intracoder
reliability testing, evaluated by checking consistency in the application of open coding and
categories over time, was performed three months apart.215
After the initial reading and coding, I returned to the literature review and the secondary
literature about CompanyCommand to better understand some of the underlying discussions.
This allowed me to also iteratively update and revise the questions for the semi-structured
interviews, and to think about the forums and threads before my research visit to USMA.
One useful capability of using Dedoose for the qualitative coding process was the ability
to generate a report of co-occurring codes. This provided a visual guide not only to which codes
were used most often, but also to which codes tended to overlap with other, perhaps related
codes. This was very useful as I moved to the next stage of analysis, axial coding.

215

Described as a method for establishing reliability in qualitative content analysis, I coded one
set of data twice. I used the unit of one calendar year, and recoded the data for for 2010 (11
articles), first in December 2013 and then again in March 2014. For further information about
this method of establishing reliability, see Kirsty Williamson, Lisa M. Given, and Paul Scifleet,
“Qualitative Data Analysis,” in Research Methods: Information, Systems, and Contexts, ed.
Kirsty Williamson and Graeme Johnson (Prahran: Tilde Publishing, 2014), 429.
122

Figure 4: Screenshot of co-occurring codes in Dedoose

Axial coding occurs around the process of relating categories and subcategories,
described by Strauss and Corbin as ‘linking categories to their dimensions.’216 During this stage
of analysis, patterns and themes started to emerge from the data. This helped with thinking
further about how some categories, which were overlapping, would be best represented. The
linkages suggested relationships for further exploration. This led to reassessing and further
combining some of the initial codes into central categories.
After the first round of axial coding and combining open codes into central categories, 22
categories remained. After further thought about the co-occurring codes, and after doing another
round of axial coding to retest the categories, I narrowed these categories down to the top 12.

This was interesting because while it did collapse some categories, it also revealed some
new patterns. One of those was related to leadership and leader development.217 While these
terms could be more granularly described here, ultimately both terms were drowned out by other
patterns in the data. It made sense to combine them both under leadership, with the
understanding that they might still be pulled apart for further analysis if a closer examination of
leadership themes was warranted.

217

There is a granular distinction within Army practice regarding the use of the terms leader
development and leadership development. Leader development refers to the development of
individuals and their capabilities. Leadership development refers to the development of
organizational leadership. Both terms appear repeatedly in the data, but they are not necessarily
interchangeable terms for members of this community.
124

For a closer look at the open coding, here are themes that emerged from the four threads:

Table 5: Themes from Thread Coding

Article One: Do you follow a stupid order?
Themes: leadership, memory, morality, training, trust
Article Two: Soldiers Making Sense of Killing
Themes: discipline, leadership, morality, training, trust
Article Three: How do you train for Mission Command?
Themes: advice, communication, community, training, transfer of knowledge
Article Four: Designing your World-Class Physical Fitness Program
Themes: discipline, leadership, learning, training

Perhaps unsurprisingly, I found that the themes that I was seeing in the data also emerged
within the conversations and interviews during my research visit. The themes described here
roughly correspond with many of the core interests and goals of the larger Army community, as
well as the mission and purpose of the smaller CompanyCommand community of practice. After
all of the data was gathered, I continued to reread and refine the coding to reflect initial, ongoing,
and deeper analysis and understanding of the community and the process of records creation, cocreation, use, and reuse.

125

5.3.2 Locating the ‘contextual ambiance’

Considering and using the key themes emerging from coding to support a critical reading of the
case was helpful in thinking conceptually about the records continuum as an analytical
framework. As key themes emerged during the iterative data collection and analysis phases of
this project, it became clear that particular values exist as part of and are embedded in the
CompanyCommand system. Because some of these values may be understood as core concepts
to the community, this exercise raises the question of how community values that serve to shape
the record and its use can be revealed or hidden by continuum thinking. Because each reading is
framed by the perspective used by the reader, it is important to situate the lens through which
interpretation is made. This is a process that Australian archival scholar Chris Hurley refers to as
locating the contextual “ambiance” surrounding the record.218
The themes represent values that are woven throughout the records and deeply held by
the community, and a reading of the records is in some ways, incomplete without considering the
core community values. However, the records continuum model does not explicitly provoke or
promote a reading or conscious retelling of community values as an essential part of describing
the records, though the values certainly shape community records and memory. Thinking about
communities, and particularly Eric Ketelaar’s comments on the memory function of a
community highlights a need for further understanding in the area of community recordkeeping
concerns.
Collective identity is based on the elective processes of memory, so that a given group
recognizes itself through its memory of a common past. A community is a ‘community of
memory’. That common past is not merely genealogical or traditional, something which one can

Manuscripts 33, no.1 (May 2005), 110-145.
218

126

take or leave. It is more: a moral imperative for one’s belonging to a community. The common
past, sustained through time into the present, is what gives continuity, cohesion, and coherence to
a community. To be a community, family, a religious community, a profession involves an
embeddedness in its past, and consequently, in the memory texts (in any form, written, oral, as
well as physical) through which that past is mediated.219

To this conversation of identity and mediating a common past, the need to incorporate
and understand the values and common mission of the community as an essential part of reading
the record is a way to bring additional awareness and clarity to reading community records.
Reading and describing the inherent intent and beliefs of the community as a core value of
records creation gives structure and nuance to complex and layered records over time and space.

EMBEDDED UNIT C: TOPICAL FORUM THREADS

This section describes the forum threads, their functions and their reading through the lens of the
records continuum.

5.4.1 Threads

On a practical note, threads generally always start with a question.220 Questions can be asked by
administrators or topic leads, although many threads are started by members. As described
earlier, a topic lead or administrative team member does often take an active role in guiding the

Eric Ketelaar, “Sharing: Collected Memories in Communities of Records,” Archives and
Manuscripts 33, no.1 (May 2005), 45.
220
There is no way to fully ascertain this other than looking at every thread since 2005. But
based on conversation with the administrative team during my research visit in January 2014,
they thought it was safe to say that all threads begin with a question or request.
219

127

thread, asking clarifying questions, raising awareness of related resources, and maintaining focus
on the topic at hand. This can include featuring a thread on the main page for more visibility, as
well as sending private messages to alert other members that might have expertise or
contributions to add to the conversation. Sometimes threads are accompanied by a yes/no poll,
when appropriate. There is no typical length for a thread, though all threads tend to have at least
several responses.221
The forum organizers work closely each month to pull together thematic topics and
threads from the forums and compile those into articles that are then published in ARMY
Magazine for a broader audience outside of the closed forum community. Editing and organizing
the posts thematically gives the comments a structure and flow that is generally easy to follow
and digest. In many later articles, each post or response is given a three to five word descriptive
subhead/title that provides a quick overview of the six to ten sentence edited paragraph that was
selected for the article. While the articles reflect some of the conversation that happens in the
closed forum, the editing process is completed collaboratively by the CALDOL team with the
permission of the member/author of each post. This is congruent with the ongoing sense of care
and trust building within the community, and reflects a collaborative process of sharing, reuse,
and learning by building upon previous records.

Thread/Article One: Do you follow a stupid order?
This thread, initiated by a CC Team Lead on December 8, 2009, leads off with a short
introduction that situates the question.

221

This is not entirely confirmable with a simple search of the site, but due to the construction of
the community, the administrators that I spoke with about this question thought that no thread on
the forum would go completely unanswered.
128

“Last month, I was sitting with a group of future platoon leaders, listening to a division
commander talk about leadership challenges in combat. At one point, he paused and said, ‘OK,
what about when you get a stupid order. What do you do? Do you follow a stupid order?’ Most
of us can probably think of a not-so-bright order that we’ve issued ourselves so this isn’t about
pointing the finger. But this is a legitimate question and one that we think would be valuable to
discuss as a profession. Have you been in a situation when an order didn’t seem to make sense?
What were your options? What was at stake? What did you do?”

Understanding that this could be a sensitive topic, the Team Lead also stated as an option
at the top of the thread: “If you prefer to post your comments anonymously, we can help you do
that. Just send me an email with “anonymous” in the subject line, and I’ll take care of the rest.”
The thread quickly gathered steam, with 53 posts in less than two months. Most member
responses were lengthy, using extensive personal stories to discuss not just orders that they had
received, but those that they had heard or given themselves, and weighing in with resources, as
well as insights gleaned from discussions in other settings that ranged from official classrooms to
in the field. The corresponding article in ARMY Magazine was published in March 2010, with
edited responses from 11 members, as well as a “tip of the hat” to comments about the topic
from Army Ranger COL Ralph Puckett (author of Words for Warriors)222 and selected
comments from GEN Matthew Ridgeway about orders for missions that he considered to be
suicidal as commander of the 82nd Airborne.

Thread/Article Two: Soldiers Making Sense of Killing
Posted by a CC Team Lead on August 16, 2005, this forum thread started with a single
question and yes/no quiz: “Do you have the responsibility to equip your Soldiers for making
sense of killing in combat?” Over the course of slightly more than a month, the thread received

Ralph Puckett, Words for Warriors: A Professional Soldier’s Notebook (Tucson, AZ:
Wheatmark, 2007).
222

129

16+ replies, and the poll received 126 yes responses, 9 responses of no. The associated article,
published in November 2005, sorted 15 member responses into three categories (derived from an
early post in the thread): making sense before, during, and after killing. The article included
resource information for deploying Combat Stress Teams and techniques for integrating the use
of Critical Event Debriefing (CED) within a unit, as well as related topical comments from LTC
(Ret) Dave Grossman, author of On Killing and On Combat.223

Thread/Article Three: How do you train for Mission Command?
Initiated by a CC Team Lead in September 2012, this thread began with a quote on
envisioning future combat from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff GEN Dempsey’s May
2012 white paper on Mission Command, and asked members to agree/disagree, then discuss
what they planned to do in their unit. In less than a month, the thread received 40+ responses
commenting on the white paper and the related Army doctrine (ADP 6-0). The associated article,
published in January 2013, contained 16 edited member responses, as well as quotes from GEN
Dempsey’s white paper and related points about skills from ADP 6-0.

Thread/Article Four: Designing Your World-Class Physical Fitness Program
This thread, started March 25, 2013 by a CC Team Lead, began as two brief sentences.
“This is a quick fire exercise. If you were starting from scratch, and you had total control with no
constraints, what would your world-class company PT [physical training] program look like?”
The thread received a rush of responses within the first week after the initial post, but continued

130

to accrue additional responses even six months later, garnering 80+ posts to the thread as of
January 2014. While some replies were short, others situated their responses with personal
stories, links to regulations and official programs, observations about building programs and
implementing them in and out of theatre, and personal and institutional philosophies about
training and fitness. The corresponding article, published in July 2013, incorporated 15 edited
responses from the forum, as well as excerpts and links to official Army resources such as Field
Manual 7-22, which describes Army Physical Readiness Training, and the Army’s seven core
principles of fitness.

5.4.2 Reading Forum Threads Through the Records Continuum

The most common depiction of the records continuum theory is a model that uses an axis and
concentric rings to represent complexities in the recordkeeping environment. In order to describe
the records continuum model, usually one either starts from the outer ring, or from the center
circle. Both of those approaches tend to suggest a linear reading of the continuum, although in
truth, one could start anywhere on the continuum. For this discussion, it seems most logical to
proceed either towards the center from the outer ring, exploring the circles as emanating inward
from the social and cultural dimensions of the outer circle, or from an action or instance at the
innermost ring, working outwards from creation in the first dimension. For my examination of
CompanyCommand forum threads, I have decided to begin from the outside and work inward.
At a broader level this decision is also reflected in the research design for this study, which
moves from the published articles inward towards examining forum posts and contextually
situating the documentary act.

131

In the fourth dimension, or outermost ring of the model, ‘Pluralize’ includes the reuse and
re-presentation of the record for new uses, audiences, and meanings. As part of the third
dimension, ‘Organize,’ records are brought together into the same place, and, according to Frank
Upward’s definition, then require “common navigable structures and understandings” for the
organization of memory. Within the second dimension, ‘Capture,’ a record is placed into a
broader group context or organizational unit. The innermost circle is the first dimension, ‘Create’
or ‘Act.’ At the center of the diagram, this represents the center of action and is where the
formation or document creation occurs. This includes records in the process of formation, as well
as representations of actions in documents, versions, and partial expressions. The axes of the
continuum (evidence, recordkeeping, transactionality, and identity) work together and have close
reciprocal relationships by design.
It is important to note that each of the dimensions and axes are dependent upon the
others. A record may exist at the same time in all dimensions, making it difficult to represent in
an essentially flat two-dimensional reading. However, records continuum theory is an expansive
starting point for expressing the concepts of constantly evolving records that exist through time
and space, which attempts to put to rest the idea of records moving in a linear way through
concrete stages in the life cycle.

5.4.3 Representing the Threads

These threads were selected as representatives of a wide range of topics, conversations, and
comments in the forums. A difficult choice in qualitative research is the reality that not all data
can be displayed in detail as part of the findings or discussion, and so these particular narrative
threads were chosen in accordance with the selection process detailed earlier in the methodology
132

chapter. However, it is also important to keep in mind that because of the nature of how the
continuum “reads” records such as these threads, even if many more were viewed through the
records continuum, the results of those readings would be roughly similar due to their same
process of create, capture, organize, and pluralize. One key finding that is highlighted here by
this reading of the threads is that the records continuum highlights the process and the capture
and the organization of records in ways that are useful for organizational understanding. This
can be less helpful when all of the records have come from similar processes, because the
distinguishing comments or traits may be concealed when reading a record through the
dimensions.
Similarities are clear across the four selected threads/articles. All four were started with
an initial question posted by CC Team Leads, and all of the threads (by design) received more
than 15 replies. In general, responses to the initial post tend to be between 250-500 words, and
engage directly with both the initial question and with other responses earlier in the thread. Of
interest is that threads approaching difficult or controversial topics, such as the first thread, “Do
you follow a stupid order?” appear to have more responses from members that self-identify as
usually not responding. In that thread, more than one member stated that they often lurk, but they
were drawn to reply in this instance by the quality and depth of the conversation, as well as its
relevance to their concerns. The four selected threads can only, of course, give a small window
into the community. However, the themes emerging from the articles can offer a broader view of
the culture and values through the records generated and constructed by, for, and about the
community.
Considering the threads and corresponding article through the records continuum model,
one approach is to understand this discussion’s movement through the dimensions (create-

133

capture-organize-pluralize). The four representative articles described earlier in this section were
shared with the broader Army community (fourth dimension, pluralize) but moved back and
forth through the spectrum of the other three dimensions. The same could be said of other
articles in the full corpus of writings that spans 2003-2013, the time since CompanyCommand
was moved into the Army sphere. Between creation and capture into the recordkeeping system,
then accruing additional posts as layers that added to the record, each article was constantly
moving between (or coexisting in the first three dimensions at once) as an evolving record.
Reading this record along the archival grain argues that it could appear in the evidential and
identity

axes

as

traces

of

institutional

or

organizational

action,

but

also

as

organizational/individual/collective memory and representational trace.
These axes also portray a distinctly archival mindset and rightly so, as they do form an
integral part of Upward’s “archival grain.” Reading against that archival grain in the records
continuum suggests, however, that the elements and axes do not help the reader to fully identify
or express, at least explicitly, important elements of active community recordkeeping. In this
example, members are creating records that tell their stories and assist their learning (and the
learning of others) as well as supporting goals of leadership and leader development. The values
inherent in the records creation process are, however, not explicitly measured here by the
categories or approach of continuum thinking, which is a loss to context and understanding the
situated nature of the records. The records could be described through the transactional axis,
which situates function, activity, and purpose; however, these elements do have a prescribed
institutional perspective that underpins and limits their descriptive reach.
Multiple stories that are framed by the threads serve to highlight the importance of the
perspective selected for the process of interpretation. Situating the case is a crucial first step

134

towards applying analysis. What is revealed by these stories (and others that could be told if the
perspective shifted) is the flexible, dynamic, non-linear nature of the traces and representations
present in these records. The records continuum is a framework for thinking about records that
suggests multiple, simultaneous interpretations and challenges the recordkeeping and archival
community to engage with the evolving record.

5.5

CHAPTER CONCLUSION

In this chapter, I have described findings from the CompanyCommand case study. Additional
discussion of the records continuum will continue in the next chapter. This chapter has outlined
the situated context of CompanyCommand, and discussed the forum as a recordkeeping system.
These results were triangulated from a range of sources that included published articles, forum
posts, descriptive memos about the forums and website, site visits, semi-structured interviews,
and other primary and secondary resources.
One key finding that emerged in this chapter is that the values from related, overlapping
communities are embedded within the culture of the CompanyCommand forum and within the
records and relationships fostered in the forum. If the values of Army and military culture are
tightly woven into the fabric of the records, can these values be fully unpacked, described, and
understood using the records continuum? When the records are abstracted by reading them
through the lens of the records continuum, they are disconnected from their cultural context.
While trust in an evidential sense and the creation/maintenance/use of trusted records are
discussed frequently in archival discourse, another central finding which suggests future work,
was that the continued mention of the importance of trust between people as the underlying
135

impetus to create and co-create records. Embedded within the ethos, the structure, and the culture
of CompanyCommand is the idea of trusting each other and sharing knowledge and information
with the intention of helping another person reach his or her goals.
These two observations highlight the overall findings of the CompanyCommand case
study. The values inherent in the records creation process are hidden, or not explicitly measured
by the categories or approach of continuum thinking, which is a loss to context and
understanding the situated nature of the records.

DISCUSSION

CONSIDERING THE CONTINUUM FOR READING THE COMMUNITY AND
ITS RECORDS

A central question raised by this case study is whether the records continuum is a useful frame
for understanding and reading community records, and particularly for reading active, multilayered, co-created records that are reused and re-presented over space and time.
Broadly speaking, there is a natural tendency to want to take theory and distill it into a set
of useful procedures instead of using it at a conceptual level. This urge is connected with the
desire to form new insights and approaches into tools for applied use. However, the records
continuum is a complex theory that facilitates and encourages the embrace of complexities and
multiplicity in records and recordkeeping. The theory provides a framework for recordkeepers to
think about records in different and concurrent spaces, uses, and times. Ultimately, the
complexities of this theory cannot be completely distilled into a single model or fully explained
as an applied tool. This is not a shortcoming of the theory, indeed, this is the source of its
richness and strength. This does point, however, to the need to carefully understand the model,
appreciate what it can and what it cannot do, and understand the complexity of using the theory
for applied ends.

137

There are benefits, challenges, and some drawbacks to using the records continuum
theory as a lens for understanding records created within communities. First, here are some of
the benefits. The structure of the model—the graphical representation of the theory shown in
Chapter 2, with concentric rings emanating from an X-Y axis—provides not only a spectrum of
stages for records in different (and possibly concurrent) dimensions, but also encompasses a
range of records-focused concerns along the archival grain. By introducing not just the
dimensions (or, as variously described, the information processing rhythm), the viewer or
archivist also is provoked to think about the records-related concerns that overlap on the four XY axes (broadly grouped under identity, recordkeeping, transactional, and evidential). Because of
the construction of the model, it is easy to see and describe (even on paper) that records exist not
just in their dimensional state, but also on the X and Y axes. Teaching students about records as
holding various properties at, or concurrent, with different places on the dimensional spectrum,
makes more sense when using the model as a framework for description. Infusing discussion
with the sense that recordkeepers must understand the various values held by records and the
fluidity and nuance associated with their movement or concurrent placement is made visually
easier to comprehend with the records continuum diagram. Understanding that the dimensions
and axes are related to, and depend on each other, and that a record exists in all dimensions and
axes at the same time, is made clear by having the model as a reference.
However, the diagram/model as it currently exists may also be challenging to use and
teach to archival graduate students, particularly in a short lesson. This may also not be entirely
the fault of the model, which is just a representation, but the challenge is perhaps made more
visible by its complexities. Understanding the relationships between the axes (identity,
transactionality, recordkeeping, and evidence) and recalling that these, too, work in concert with

138

each other, as well as with the records creation process and properties, may not always be
emphasized when discussing records. The removal of solid lines representing the axes was a first
step towards expressing the fluid nature of these boundaries, and other visual expressions (grey?
dotted lines?) could perhaps serve the same purpose for demonstrating those porous properties
for the dimensions as well.224 Certainly any model will have some limitations, as it serves as
shorthand for expressing and facilitating the questions and conversations that surround more
complex theory.
Despite the flexibility of the records continuum, some layers of ambiguity were raised
while trying to read complex community records through its lens for the CompanyCommand
case study. First of all, the records continuum, as described earlier in this chapter, has an
institutional heritage born of its lineage as an approach for government and institutional
recordkeeping (Peter Scott), then as a tool for understanding the relationships between records
(Upward, initially), and then next for exploring concerns of evidence. Only relatively recently
has the conversation turned to the fourth dimension, which encompasses society and
pluralization.
Second of all, the records continuum disembeds the record from its situated context in
order to understand its position within time and space. However, these co-created, multi-layered
records form the building blocks of the community together. They are infused with the values,
and shaped by the infrastructure. Disembedding the record from these other considerations is a

“Reading the Records Continuum: Interpretations and Explorations,” Archives & Manuscripts
33, no. 1 (May 2005), 22.

139

significant loss to contextual understanding. But understanding this complexity is also a great
boon to conversation about complex records—using the CompanyCommand case study to
examine the records continuum demonstrates the value of making these tangled and often silent
structures, contexts, and infrastructures visible. Looking at the records continuum can underscore
the need to express and document not just the records, but that identifying the other scaffolding
that shapes and buttresses and is woven throughout the records themselves is an important step
towards recognizing the nature of the layered co-documentary act that builds and rebuilds both
record and community in concert.

6.2

A READING OF THE DIMENSIONS USING THE CASE AS AN EXAMPLE

Understanding the case study through the continuum model suggests the need for an examination
of each of the four dimensions, beginning with the inner-most dimension on the diagram first. In
this first dimension, “create,” otherwise known as the “act” dimension, is in the center of the
diagram, representing the beginning of a record and situating it within its particular context of
creation. Using the case study as an example, the dimension of “create” includes discussion of
the infrastructure and culture of CompanyCommand that encourages and causes creation, along
with the collaborative nature of the action.
In the second dimension, “capture,” the record created in the first dimension is placed
into an “organizational unit” or broader group context. This continues discussion about the
nature of the community, the purpose of the formalized administrative work that is performed by
the administrative team, and the intent and stated work of the community of practice. “Capture”
assumes a particular institutional and organizational structure that may exist culturally and as a
140

byproduct of the community association with the Army and the military as a whole, but may not
be representative of the community in its entirety. Describing this dimension involved unpacking
the nature of the community record and trying to discern the boundaries and connections
between the organization and the community.
The third dimension, “organize,” brings records created and captured in the first two
dimensions together into the same place and, according to Upward, requires “common navigable
structures and understandings within systems” for the organization to organize memory.225 This
is facilitated in part by the fact that CompanyCommand is an information system and the records
created as part of participation in that forum are already situated in that context. However, it does
not address the shifting underpinnings of the community itself, including changes in leadership
or purpose, which can be challenging to discern outside of a formal organization or bureaucracy.
The fourth dimension, “Pluralize,” is situated furthest from the act of records creation.
“Pluralize” includes the reuse and re-presentation of the record for new and possibly multiple
audiences and meanings.226 Discussion of the pluralize function is related to the ARMY Magazine
published versions of the forum posts. This includes the reading of forum posts as several kinds
of records with multiple purposes, at multiple levels of society to understand how they perform
as pluralized records.

COMPLEXITIES, PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICE, AND THE MODEL

Continuum thinking is often raised by archival scholars as being useful for situating complex
conversations about recordkeeping and archival activities. However, the center of gravity for
publications that directly engage with continuum thinking has also been largely located only in
Australia, at least over the first two generations of scholarship. But recent publications indicate
that this area of inquiry appears to be spreading and growing, and researchers outside of
Australia are engaging with this theory in the literature, including this dissertation.227 These are
encouraging signs for the continued growth and future of continuum scholarship, and for
recordkeeping scholarship.
Unfortunately, there seems to also be a continued lack of engagement with continuum
concepts in the literature by many practitioners in the recordkeeping and archival fields. Despite
the flexibility and broad grain of this conceptual framework for understanding complex records
through time and space, the records continuum is often discussed as a possible approach, but
relatively unused (or at least undocumented in the literature or conference proceedings) as a
working solution by practitioners in North America.
A limitation of the records continuum as it currently exists is the model that is most often
used to aid explanation and teaching. The paper-based, two-dimensional model has limitations
that have been discussed and described by other scholars, including Barbara Reed and Michael
Piggott.228 The model is, as McKemmish, Upward, and Reed noted in 2010, “representative of a

and Tom Nesmith, South African archivist Verne Harris, Dutch archival scholar Eric Ketelaar,
and Brien Brothman and Andrew Lau in the United States.

more complex body of thought which came before it and has continued to develop since its
publication.”229 While the renderings have changed somewhat over time since Upward’s first
depiction, grasping the complexities and mapping records through the records continuum model
is not necessarily an intuitive endeavor, nor a particularly practice-based solution.230 The nuance
and complexity afforded by using continuum thinking may also be its downfall when related to
adoption and use. Untangling the underlying theory from the now-familiar Upward depiction is
difficult to do, but the development of additional or complementary visual models that use the
same underlying scaffolding and theoretical frame could be one way to reintroduce or invigorate
interest in the records continuum.

6.3.1 Challenges of a paper-based graphical model

The limitations and frustrations of trying to depict the records continuum as a visual model in a
two-dimensional space (traditional paper literature) have often been discussed by many
continuum thinkers, and in almost every continuum-centered publication.231
Barbara Reed describes one intriguing approach that she says particularly represents the
notion of reciprocity—a children’s fortune-telling game that involves folded paper flaps that can
touch in different places and patterns. By moving the paper into various configurations, different

Michael Piggott notes that, similar to the evolving textual explanations for the continuum, the
graphical model has also changed. See Michael Piggott, Archives and Societal Provenance:

areas of the page are brought together or move apart. Reed describes this as a dynamic approach
that enables the revelation of different viewpoints and opportunities at particular points in time
and space.232 Terry Cook referred to the continuum topologically, as a plastic sheet through
which one can think across the dimensions of space and time, as well as across the axes. 233 The
general consensus is that the complexities of continuum thinking cannot be fully addressed by a
two-dimensional model, but that the visual model affords more flexibility for discussion than a
written explanation can easily or readily provide.
A strength of the continuum model as an aid for teaching and learning is what it offers
when reinforcing and illuminating the complexities inherent in records and recordkeeping.
Coming to grips with the reality of networked records using continuum thinking serves to push
memory workers to continue to state that these are complex representations—not the whole
record, but necessarily snapshots in time. Using the records continuum necessarily provokes
conversation about what is revealed and what is hidden through various readings of the same
records in the snapshots, through a particularly archival lens (Upward’s archival grain). The
continuum’s embrace of inclusivity and multiple interpretations makes it a useful step as part of
a longer process of describing and placing records on a spectrum of understanding. This raises
the possibility of future work that could develop another closely related grain that more fully
embraces community concepts and co-created records.

ALWAYS IN A STATE OF BECOMING: PLURALIZATION AND
COMMUNITY RECORDS

One continuum thinker, Terry Cook, commented in 2001 that the vast majority of the work in the
archival literature was concerned with the first and second dimensions of the model, and that the
fourth dimension, “concerning societal or collective memory, is almost absent in the
literature.”234 An editorial comment by Glenda Acland in a 2005 special issue of Archives and
Manuscripts that was devoted to papers on the fourth dimension (all delivered at the 2004
Monash University conference Archives and Collective Memory: Challenges and Issues in a
Pluralised Archival Role) noted the relative lack of engagement with continuum thinking in the
field. Tom Nesmith agreed, noting that the Monash conference and related proceedings were an
“exciting development in continuum thinking,”235 and Barbara Reed concurred, stating that
engaging with comparatively underdeveloped aspects of the continuum means that “we must
open our professional practice to challenge, questioning, and exploration.”236 Expanded
discussion of the fourth dimension, which is centered on societal pluralization beyond the
creating entity is particularly useful not just for this case study, but for framing and
understanding a range of developing concerns about plurality and multiple perspectives in
archival and recordkeeping scholarship.

Some recent additions to the archival and recordkeeping literature have started to consider
community work through continuum thinking. Leisa Gibbons, using three cases of communitycreated YouTube videos, has discussed social media as co-produced cultural heritage.237 Outside
of Australia, Andrew Lau uses continuum thinking as a framework for exploring the Los
Angeles-based community arts group Machine Project.238 While almost 15 years old, Cook’s
statement that there is a need to examine how the records continuum (and archival and
recordkeeping activity) describes and situates records in a variety of settings, including
communities, across all four of the model’s dimensions still resonates. This dissertation partially
fills that gap as a dynamic extension and exploration of what the records continuum reveals and
conceals about active communities and their complex and evolving records across the
continuum.

6.4.1 Participatory community editing, values, and pluralization of the record

The exploration of communities that are connecting, growing, and sustaining through a central
action of active recordkeeping is an area with many possible points of departure, and this work
has overlapping connections with community archives discourse. Understanding online
communities that are using social media as a central hub, to take one example, is a fruitful and
large area of research that intersects with other academic and professional avenues of
exploration. The key difference is that unlike community archives, in the case of
CompanyCommand community recordkeeping is not taking a retrospective look at documenting

past activities for historical purposes. Instead recordkeeping (and sometimes, yes, retrospection)
serves a central, active purpose in forming functional building blocks of an active community
with a forward-looking purpose. Understanding these contemporary, active communities through
studying their active records and recordkeeping decisions is of interest for a range of knowledge
workers as well as for business, organizational, and historical purposes.
However, this also introduces complexities. For example, in the CompanyCommand case
study, the community, or at least the administrative team, is actively aware of shaping their story
for the purposes of teaching and learning, not for the purposes of historical documentation. This
storytelling occurs with elements that occasionally borrow from techniques familiar to
knowledge and memory workers, such as participatory microhistory, oral histories, and
documentary editing. While these approaches may be familiar, the intent of the storyteller is
usually quite different from the goals and concerns of a project conceived with the intent of
historical description or archival deposit.
Situating the record within a temporal and geographic context, as well as grounding it
with information about the values and intent that structured its creation, enhances what is known
about the record. As discussed in the previous chapter, examining the CompanyCommand
records revealed strong themes and values that were woven throughout the records and the forum
space. However, the framework of continuum thinking does not frame or automatically spark
discussion about the values or the guidance, provocation, reasoning, or benefits of records
creation or co-creation within the boundaries of the community. These are essential elements that
do frame the experiences and decisions by members to participate by creating records, but they
are invisible when looking at a single record, disembedded from contextual understanding about
the community, its practices, and its framing. Because recordkeeping processes and culture are

147

so intimately intertwined, much can be gathered from how these processes, structures and values
shape the records using a flexible, conceptual base that allows these questions to emerge.
When records contain layered contextuality, the complexities can be overwhelming. The
complexities of the online community record are not necessarily or completely new, but they are
rendered (more) visible by the infrastructures and values that govern and shape the records
creation, use, and reactivation. Seeing records as vibrant community building blocks also gets
closer to considering how and why records can serve that active role within communities. The
usefulness of thinking about the records continuum through the CompanyCommand case is
revealed by being able to clearly uncover and discuss values and structures that shape and are
embedded within the records and their context of creation.
Another, related piece of this puzzle is the movement of records within the fourth
dimension, pluralization. In this case study, when records (threads from the forum) were represented as articles in ARMY Magazine, they went through a process of editing. Moving from a
single post, to a longer thread with at least fifteen responses, and then through a facilitated
editing and revision process by the CompanyCommand administrative team, these records, were
then, in the sense of continuum thinking, in the fourth dimension, pluralization. These threads
still exist (and continue to) in the other three dimensions on the forums. But following this
process, arguably, these published, pluralized records also became an entirely new record once
they were published. This suggests the possibility that other records that move into the fourth
dimension, once pluralized and republished for a new societal audience or community, also
become new records in their own right, albeit records that still hold and maintain a relationship
to the prior records. Revealed by this case study, understanding more clearly the links and

148

relationships between records in the first three dimensions, and the connection to pluralized
records in the fourth dimension, merits further discussion.
Understanding why continuum thinking can be a powerful and inclusive method is
important to helping archival and recordkeeping scholars interrogate it as a useful approach.
However, examining its limitations through the CompanyCommand case study reveals
limitations for the understanding of online, co-created community records and their situated
nature as shaped by key values, infrastructures, and actions.

6.5

SUMMARY

Returning to the concept introduced in the first paragraph of Chapter 1, in this case, records serve
as a force multiplier for the CompanyCommand community of practice. Records serve as
dynamic, evolving building blocks that help the community and administrators reach their goals.
Examining complex community records as a way to open up, examine, and extend theoretical
tools and descriptive models can also be a force multiplier for recordkeeping and archival
scholarship that continues to seek multiplicity and plurality in the record.
Exploring the records continuum in conjunction with this case study has highlighted
questions about active records, cultures, and communities that are worthy of further investigation
and discussion. Understanding the situation of the record, the circumstances and values of its
creation, and infrastructure and choices that shape its making—these are key concerns when
examining the records co-created by a community.
This chapter described the origins of the records continuum, which highlighted its
institutional and structural heritage. These structural underpinnings, in part, explain why the
149

records continuum does not fully address all aspects of community records. Next, this chapter
looked at the records continuum model as a pedagogical and learning tool that combines both
affordances and limitations for use in description and discussion. This raises questions for future
research and understanding of how and why theories and model travel and are disseminated,
adopted, and accepted within the overlapping archival communities.

Finally, this chapter

explored the fourth dimension of the continuum, and its evolving role related to community
records.
One benefit of using a discrete, complex case study to examine the records continuum as
a theory and model is the ability to reveal new approaches and ways of thinking. As a flexible
framework for complex records, the records continuum allows for readings of various
viewpoints, through a wide range of lenses, stories, and understandings. This makes the records
continuum a valuable tool for teaching, learning, and writing about communities, records and
their fluidity. While records continuum theory is able to act as a scaffolding for understanding
and reading the records, ultimately it cannot capture the totality of community memory through
any one lens. This case study demonstrates several challenges where, related to situating
community records, the continuum highlights and conceals (or fails to capture) important
information, and suggests that there are many potential avenues for future study.

FUTURE WORK

OVERLAPPING QUESTIONS IN A ‘STATE OF BECOMING’

During the course of this study, many overlapping questions emerged that were outside of the
boundaries of this dissertation. Of those, I have identified three future areas of research for
discussion here. The three areas are: gaining a deeper and broader understanding of the diffusion
of continuum scholarship, using social learning and trust to dig more deeply into social and
personal relationship reasons that provoke records creation by community members, and
extending the preservation of infrastructures and values using continuum thinking for situating
and reading the records of online communities. These three areas of inquiry further build upon
the flexibility of continuum thinking and the richness of related open questions about
recordkeeping at the heart of active communities.

7.2

UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFUSION OF CONTINUUM SCHOLARSHIP

Considering the generations of records continuum scholarship in this dissertation also suggests
the possibility of examining the spread of the theory over time and space. Additional in-depth
exploration of the dissemination of continuum thinking, and of recordkeeping concepts in

151

general, using a framework of Everett Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory could provide more
in-depth context for further scholarship.
Rogers’ theory argues that diffusion is a social process of transmitting a concept or
practice through particular channels to participants in a social group or system. Diffusion
researchers have identified four main elements for examination: innovation, communication
channels, time, and social systems. Exploring these elements in greater depth while considering
the spread of continuum thinking could yield new insights.
Having a greater understanding of the influences, decisions, and reasons that archival
educators, for example, might decide to teach the records continuum could then inform
discussions about different ways to update or describe the model for more clarity in pedagogy.
Studying mentions and uses of the records continuum in practice could inform efforts to develop
further working groups or discussion nodes. Having a clearer picture of how and why theoretical
concepts catch on and spread within archival and recordkeeping scholars and practitioners can
also help to build a broader infrastructural foundation and reasoning for education, discussion,
and practice.239
Addressing in further depth how, where, and why the records continuum theory, and
continuum thinking has been used or not used has implications not just for archivists and
recordkeepers, but for the broader library and information science field as well.

239

Recent examples of studies examining the diffusion of knowledge in the archival and digital
preservation fields include Christopher A. Lee, “Defining Digital Preservation Work: A Case
Study of the Development of the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System”
(PhD dissertation, University of Michigan, 2005) and Patricia Condon, “Digital Curation
Through the Lens of Disciplinarity: The development of an emerging field” (PhD dissertation,
Simmons College, 2014).
152

Telling this story by mapping the intellectual history and transfer can help to articulate
gaps and opportunities, as well as assisting in identifying new research directions.
Having a greater understanding of the conditions, reasoning, and attributes that lead to
the adoption and use of conceptual models in the field is useful for theory-building and future
innovative thinking in teaching and practice.

7.3

SCAFFOLDING, THE SOCIAL ROOTS OF RECORDS CREATION, AND
TRUST

The scaffolding of social learning theory, introduced earlier in this dissertation, could be used to
dig more deeply into understanding how and why community records are created and reused in
communities of practice. While this dissertation did not focus on learning aspects or motivations
for users to create records and participate in the community, social learning theory suggests
further discussion about underlying values for records creation. This establishes a foundation for
an examination of the role that trust plays in community recordkeeping.
The discussion on trust and records in recordkeeping and archival scholarship largely
relates to evidentiary and legal concerns. Making sure that a record is “what it purports to be”
plays a prominent role in the literature. But this dissertation raises questions of how we
understand the trust between people as an impetus and reason for initial and ongoing records
creation. How does having a trusted community or an environment of trust, lead to the creation
of records? What can we learn from the ways in which community members choose to actively
create and add to records in order to further the learning and active knowledge building of

153

others? Can this lead to further understanding of the conditions that foster an environment and
space where records will be created?

7.4

PRESERVATION OF COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURAL KNOWLEDGE
AND EXTENDING CONTINUUM THINKING AND SCHOLARSHIP

During the course of working on this dissertation, I have become increasingly convinced that
additional exploration of how to describe, situate, and make invisible knowledge available about
records co-creation and pluralization is necessary for the continuum to remain a flexible tool for
understanding, and particularly for understanding and incorporating active community records
and recordkeeping systems. Developing an overlapping grain that holds an awareness of
infrastructures and values, and builds on the intellectual work and underpinnings of the records
continuum and related work, such as the information continuum, would contribute to the
inclusive nature of continuum thinking.240 This dissertation has taken an initial step in this
direction by highlighting the problems, affordances, and ways that infrastructures and values
shape the records and experiences at different points in the active creation and life of the record.
However, much scope for imagination and future work remains in this exciting and fluid space.

The information continuum was developed originally at Monash University as a tool for
teaching by Donald Schauder, Barbara Reed, and Frank Upward. The information continuum
model articulates different purposes for which librarians and recordkeeping professionals
manage information. See Gillian Oliver and Fiorella Foscarini, Records Management and
