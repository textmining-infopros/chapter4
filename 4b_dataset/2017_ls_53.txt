COLLEGE STUDENT PERCEPTIONS OF THRESHOLD CONCEPTS
IN INFORMATION LITERACY

ABSTRACT
by
Jesús H. Campos

The theory and practice of information literacy instruction in higher education in the
United States has changed substantially with the adoption in 2015 of the Association of
College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (ACRL Framework). Many academic librarians are revising their approach to
library instruction to incorporate the ACRL Framework, which among other things, is
organized around student acquisition of threshold or transformative concepts in
information literacy. This qualitative study undertakes a phenomenographic approach to
understand the experiences and perceptions of threshold concepts in information literacy
among lower-level undergraduate students. Transformative developmental milestones in
information literacy as experienced by lower-level undergraduate students participating
in the study were aligned with some of the ACRL frames; some transformative
milestones were different from the ACRL frames; and some but not all of the ACRL
frames resonated mostly at a novice level with these students. Understanding student
perceptions of threshold concepts in information literacy can assist those teaching
information literacy to identify areas that may require special attention.
Keywords: information literacy, threshold concepts, phenomenography

Chapter I
Introduction to the Study
Information literacy, the ability to engage effectively with information, is a
critical skill set that schools, colleges, and employers expect students will learn and
cultivate throughout their educational journey (Wiebe, 2015). Research suggests that
college students often experience gaps in their ability to effectively engage with
information in order to solve problems and for purposes of lifelong learning (Head,
2013). The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Framework for
Information Literacy Instruction for Higher Education (ACRL Framework) adopted in
2015 is built around six threshold concepts identified by experts as gateway,
transformative milestones in learning information literacy (ACRL, 2015; Gibson &
Jacobson, 2014). Because the ACRL Framework is broad and library instruction
opportunities with students in associate degree programs are infrequent, this study
explores concepts that lower-level undergraduate students perceive as transformative
milestones in their development of information proficiency. This understanding in turn
can help to inform the integration of the ACRL Framework into college library
instruction and suggest ways to improve the library instruction curriculum.
Background of the Problem
The ability to engage effectively with information, by being able to recognize a
need for information, know where to look for it, find it, synthesize it, integrate it, and
know how to use it ethically in solving problems and making decisions is a lifelong
literacy important to the people of every country (UNESCO, 2013). Employers expect
this information literacy, but research suggests that even college graduates in the United

Campos 2

States often experience gaps in their ability to seek and use information effectively
(Head, 2012). The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) recently
revised guidelines for information literacy instruction in higher education with the
adoption of the ACRL Framework (ACRL, 2015). The ACRL Framework incorporates
six threshold concepts or frames that are considered central to the development of
information literacy in higher education (ACRL, 2015). The six frames, developed
through a process of extensive consultation with information literacy experts, include the
following concepts: authority is constructed and contextual, information creation as a
process, information has value, research as inquiry, scholarship as conversation, and
searching as strategic exploration (ACRL, 2015; Gibson & Jacobson, 2014).
A distinctive characteristic of threshold concepts is that these are key concepts
that are critical to developing expertise in a field and they must be understood if the
student is to internalize the distinctive ways in which experts view a field differently from
a novice learner (Meyer & Land, 2006). The stage between exposure to a threshold
concept and proper understanding of the concept, often referred to as the liminal space, is
a cognitive and affective stage where learners undergo a transformation in their grasp of
the concept and their way of thinking about the discipline (Mayer & Land, 2006; Rattray,
2016). The time a learner spends in this liminal space varies with each learner. During
this stage, the learner overcomes possible intimidation of the unknown, attempts to
understand the concept, and reconciles this new understanding with the learner’s existing
knowledge. Anything that can help a learner negotiate the liminal space toward grasping
a threshold concept speeds the learner’s journey toward developing proficiency in the
discipline (Mayer & Land, 2006; Rattray, 2016).

Campos 3

The members of the task force that drafted the ACRL Framework recognized that
the concepts identified in the document are more abstract and general than those of the
preceding ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (the
ACRL Standards), so it recommended that every institution tailor the ACRL Framework
to local needs (ACRL, 2015). Librarians at community colleges attempting to teach
information literacy using the ACRL Framework face several challenges including the
need to teach in one-shot sessions and limited opportunities to provide students with
information literacy instruction during the two-year course of study for an associate
degree (Reed, 2015). In order to understand how best to adapt the ACRL Framework to
the needs of community college students, it helps to understand student experiences and
understandings of threshold concepts in information literacy as these mark critical
junctures or milestones in developing information proficiency.
The ACRL Framework is intended to be adapted to a very wide population of
students (ACRL, 2015). In fall 2014, approximately 20,663,464 students were enrolled in
four-year (13,493,388 students) and two-year (6,845,040 students) postsecondary
institutions throughout the United States (U.S. Department of Education, 2015).
Understanding how students experience and perceive threshold concepts in information
literacy can help higher education institutions focus their information literacy training to
address those areas that students find most troublesome or challenging.
Problem Statement
The latest guidance on information literacy for higher education provided by the
ACRL Framework provides a relatively abstract and theoretical conception of
information literacy, which is removed from the day-to-day experience of library

Campos 4

instruction especially at the community college level (Reed, 2015). Community college
librarians normally have few opportunities to provide information literacy instruction to
students, so it is not practical, nor is it advisable, to attempt to cover all of the frames set
out in the ACRL Framework (ACRL, 2015). The ACRL Framework was intended to be
tailored to the needs of the institution (ACRL, 2015). Accordingly, gathering the
perceptions of college students of threshold concepts in information literacy can provide
a holistic picture of how students perceive these and how best to adapt information
literacy instruction and the ACRL Framework to the needs of students.
Theoretical Foundation
This study is informed by the social constructivist theory of learning and school
leadership described by Lynch (2012). According to this social constructivist view,
meaning is constructed socially by the interaction of the educator and the student as well
as by the interaction of the leader and stakeholders (Lynch, 2012). As a learning theory, a
constructivist approach usually involves the instructor assuming the role of guiding and
coaching students as they solve problems individually or collaboratively or otherwise
engage in discovery activities and self-directed learning (Allen, 2008). For example,
Allen (2008) proposed employing a constructivist approach to teach critical thinking
using online information literacy instruction.
This study is also informed by a relational perspective of sense-making, which
departs somewhat from the traditional constructivist view in that it neither focuses on the
learner nor on the learner’s environment but on the relationship between the two as the
source from which meaning is drawn by the learner (Bruce, 1997; Maybee, 2015). Rather
than attempting to identify any essential characteristics about the world, this study

Campos 5

adopted a second order perspective in that it focused on understanding the collective
experiences and conceptions formed by participants in the course of their experiences
with information literacy (Marton, 2015; Maybee, 2015). This relational approach to
understanding how a phenomenon is experienced and understood by a group forms the
basis of phenomenography as a research method (Cousin, 2009; Marton, 2015; Smith &
Hepworth, 2012).
By exploring student experiences and conceptions of information literacy at an
institution where the ACRL Framework is being adopted, librarians and administrators
can develop a curriculum and learning objectives that are suited to promoting the
development of information proficiency among students at that institution. By exploring
the variety of student experiences with the same phenomenon, phenomenographic inquiry
of student perceptions of threshold concepts can assist instructors in understanding the
touch points between the ACRL Framework and actual information literacy thresholds or
transformative milestones as perceived by students at a particular institution and at a
specific stage in their educational journey. While the results are not generalizable, they
can inform the development of teaching approaches that help students improve their
information proficiency by taking into consideration the experiences that other students
in the same institution have with information literacy thresholds.
Purpose Statement
The purpose of this phenomenographic study was to understand the perceptions
and experiences relating to information literacy threshold concepts of lower-level
undergraduate students enrolled in an associate degree program at a Texas college.
Information literacy threshold concepts are defined as gateway, transformative concepts

Campos 6

or milestones in the development of information literacy, including but not limited to
those concepts identified in the ACRL Framework (ACRL, 2015).
Research Questions
The overarching research question of this study is “How do lower-level
undergraduate students perceive threshold concepts or transformative milestone concepts
in their experience of learning information literacy?” Below are the six related research
questions explored in this study.
1. What do students consider as the transformative milestones in their experience of
learning information literacy?
2. What is the experience of students in understanding and internalizing these
transformative milestones?
3. What are student perceptions of what would have eased their internalization of the
transformative milestones they identified?
4. How do these transformative milestones compare to the threshold concepts
identified in the ACRL Framework?
5. What are student experiences and perceptions of engaging with information from
the perspective of the ACRL frames?
6. What are student perceptions of what would have eased their internalization of the
ACRL frames they have experienced?
Rationale and Significance of the Study
Since their adoption in 2000 by ACRL, the ACRL Standards have served as a
seminal guide for developing information literacy instruction in colleges and universities
throughout the United States (ACRL, 2015). As part of its periodic review of this

Campos 7

document, ACRL undertook an extensive update of its guidance on information literacy
(ACRL, 2015). The ACRL Framework was developed based on consultation with experts
in information literacy (Gibson & Jacobson, 2015). Accordingly, it provides a top-down
approach to information literacy instruction. While this is an important factor in
developing information literacy learning objectives, it provides a partial understanding of
the areas that need to be emphasized at an institutional level (ACRL, 2015). The
understanding and usefulness of threshold concepts in a discipline can be enhanced by
exploring the views of both instructors and students who are closer to the learning
experience (Land, 2016). The ACRL Framework has been criticized by some for not
being applicable to students in two-year college settings (Reed, 2015). There is a gap in
the literature relating college student experiences of threshold concepts in information
literacy and how these student experiences relate to threshold concepts identified and
codified in the ACRL Framework. By exploring student perceptions of threshold
concepts in information literacy, this study provides a strategy for learning more about
the experiences of students at an institution where the ACRL Framework is being
employed. The resulting understanding of how threshold concepts in information literacy
are experienced and perceived by college students can help to inform efforts by librarians
and faculty members to customize information literacy instruction to needs of students at
the institution.
Assumptions
Assumptions are what a researcher accepts as true without concrete proof in order
to proceed with a research study (Ellis & Levy, 2009). The assumptions for this study
are:

Campos 8

x

Information literacy is a phenomenon that can be experienced and understood by
students.

x

After completing at least a second level English course (English 1302) with a
grade of B or above, writing at least two college-level research papers, and
received library instruction, participants have experienced some threshold or
transformative experiences in information literacy.

x

The perceptions and experiences of the participants were typical of other students
at the same institution who had completed similar coursework.

x

Students answered interview questions honestly and without reservation.

Limitations and Delimitations
A limitation is a weakness or problem beyond the control of the researcher, which
may influence the study (Ellis & Levy, 2009). The following factors were identified as
having an impact on the study beyond the control of the researcher:
x

The size of the sample was small.

x

The ethnic and cultural diversity of the sample was very limited, consisting
primarily of Hispanic students, which constitute the majority of students at the
location where the study took place.

x

Because the perceptions collected in this study are drawn from a small sample, the
results of the study, while suggestive of the experience of other students at the
study site, cannot be generalized to a larger population.

x

It is difficult for participants to identify threshold concepts in a field because the
process of learning these concepts transforms their outlook on the field, memory

Campos 9

can become unclear, and, with respect to novice learners, participants often lack
the vocabulary to clearly articulate these concepts (Shinners-Kennedy, 2016).
A delimitation is a constraint or factor within the control of the researcher, which
sets boundaries on the study and which may influence the study (Ellis & Levy, 2009).
The following factors were identified as having an impact on the study and being under
the control of the researcher:
x

The study was delimited by focusing on the perceptions of students who
completed at least a second level English course (English 1302) with a grade of B
or above, writing at least two college-level research papers, and have received
some library instruction.

x

The study was delimited to students who were at least 18 years of age.

x

The researcher has a personal interest in the study.

Definitions

Information literacy – “Information literacy is the set of integrated abilities
encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how
information is produced and valued, and the use of information in creating new
knowledge and participating ethically in communities of learning" (ACRL, 2015,
p. 3).

x

Phenomenography – “[P]henomenography is a research method for mapping the
qualitatively different ways in which people experience, conceptualize, perceive,
and understand various aspects of, and phenomena in, the world around them”
(Marton, 1986, p. 31).

Campos 10

x

Threshold concept – A threshold concept is a concept that, when understood,
opens up “a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about something. It
represents a transformed way of understanding, and interpreting, or viewing
something without which the learner cannot progress” (Meyer & Land, 2006, p.
3). It is likely to be (1) transformative, in that once understood, it permanently
changes a student’s view on a subject; (2) irreversible, in that once learned, it is
not likely to be forgotten; (3) integrative, in that it reveals the interrelatedness of
previously unrelated knowledge about a subject; and (4) bounded, in that it may
demarcate the boundaries of a discipline. (Meyer & Land, 2006).

Summary and Organization of the Study
This qualitative research study proposal consists of five chapters. Chapter I
provided an introduction, background, problem statement, theoretical foundation,
purpose, research questions, rationale, assumptions, limitations, delimitations, and
definitions for key concepts used throughout the study. Chapter II is a review of the
literature involving the development of the ACRL Framework, threshold concepts, and
phenomenon-centered research in threshold concepts and in information literacy. Chapter
III describes the methodology for the study including preparation, data collection, and
data analysis. Chapter IV presents the findings of the study. Chapter V summarizes the
study, discusses conclusions in the context of the literature, discusses the implications of
the findings, and recommends areas for future research.

Chapter II
Review of the Literature
The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand the perceptions and
experiences relating to information literacy threshold concepts of lower-level
undergraduate students enrolled in an associate degree program at a Texas college.
Information literacy threshold concepts are defined as gateway, transformative concepts
or milestones in the development of information literacy, including but not limited to
those concepts identified in the ACRL Framework (ACRL, 2015). This chapter reviews
the evolution of information literacy norms leading to those currently used by higher
education institutions. It then examines general findings of research on the status of
information literacy in higher education in the United States. In addition, it reviews the
use of experience-focused approaches such as phenomenography and the application of
threshold concept theory to information literacy research.
Evolution of Information Literacy Norms and Practices
The concept of information literacy has evolved over time, because the
information landscape is constantly evolving (Rader, 2002). For instance, the use of
printed information materials has shifted somewhat to accommodate an increased
reliance on digital technology including Web resources, e-books, and video streaming.
Accordingly, the ability to interact effectively with information is a skill that changes
with social conventions, information resources, and technology (Pinto, Cordón, & Gómez
Díaz, 2010; Rader, 2002). The evolution of notions of what constitutes information
literacy has also resulted in the development of several norms and practices for
developing and assessing information literacy. This section will highlight some early

Campos 12

approaches to library instruction and will then consider some of the more prominent
information literacy models that have informed current norms and practices in library
instruction.
Early approaches to library instruction. As far back as the 17th century,
German universities provided users with library orientations including lectures on
reference resources, good study habits, and library use (Virkus, 2003). Rader (2002)
reported that in higher education, information literacy instruction has gradually
developed from library orientation, to information skills instruction, and to efforts to
integrate information literacy education into the curriculum. The use of the term
“information literacy” as the skill of employing information resources for decisionmaking and problem solving, dates to 1974 and is generally attributed to Paul Zurkowski,
who at the time was President of the Information Industry Association (Owusu-Ansa,
2005; Pinto, Cordón, & Gómez Díaz, 2010). Rader (2002) noted that, except for some
instances involving small liberal arts colleges, library professionals traditionally have had
limited success in working with faculty to integrate information literacy into the college
curriculum. More frequently, faculty members in some courses are willing to give up
some class time to invite a librarian to provide a brief library instruction session (Phelps,
Senior, & Diller, 2011). These one-time sessions, often referred to as “one-shot” sessions,
where the librarian provides an overview of resources and services in under an hour, have
become the norm in most academic institutions (Masuchika & Boldt, 2012; Phelps,
Senior, & Diller, 2011).
The 1989 final report of the American Library Association Presidential
Committee on Information Literacy articulated a seminal notion of information literacy

Campos 13

and prompted school and academic libraries to cultivate the development of information
competency (American Library Association, Presidential Committee on Information
Literacy, 1989). Recognizing the rapid growth and fragmentation of information brought
about by technological developments in information processing, the Committee on
Information Literacy highlighted the value of information literacy skills to worker
effectiveness, civic life, and quality of life. The Committee identified the following as
key elements of information literacy: (1) the ability to recognize when information is
needed, (2) the ability to locate information, (3) the ability to evaluate information; and
(4) the ability to effectively use information to solve problems (American Library
Association, Presidential Committee on Information Literacy, 1989). The Committee did
not envision developments in the information landscape such as the Web and the
widespread use of mobile devices, which collectively would accelerate the proliferation
of information and the corresponding need to provide students with information literacy
and life-long learning skills. Subsequent information literacy formulations proposed an
expanded understanding of information literacy to encompass digital literacy (ACRL,
2015).
Models of information literacy.
Many models of information literacy have been developed over time and a full
survey of these is beyond the scope of this study. This section highlights some of the
more prominent models of information literacy that have influenced and continue to
inform current practices in library and information literacy instruction (Al-Issa, 2013;
Baker, 2013).

Big6 TM. The Big 6TM was developed in 1989 soon after the work of the ALA
Presidential Committee on Information Literacy (Owusu-Ansa, 2005). Since then, it has
become a prominent conceptual framework for cultivating information literacy around
the world, especially in the K-12 environment (Baker, 2013; Eisenberg, 2008). This
system, developed by Mike Eisenberg and Robert Berkowitz, divides information literacy
competencies into six stages, each with two associated sub-stages. The Big 6TM stages
are:
1. Task definition - define the problem and the information needed;
2. Information seeking strategies - determine all possible sources and select
the best ones;
3. Location and access - locate sources and find information within sources;
4. Use of information - engage the information and extract relevant
information;
5. Synthesis - organize information from multiple sources and present the
information; and
6. Evaluation - evaluate the product and the process (Big 6TM, 2014;
Eisenberg, 2008).
SCONUL Seven Pillars of Information Literacy. The SCONUL Seven Pillars of
Information Literacy: Core Model for Higher Education (SCONUL Seven Pillars Model)
is an information literacy model developed by the Society of College, National, and
University Libraries, a consortium of academic libraries from the UK and Ireland
(SCONUL, 2016). The SCONUL Seven Pillars Model was initially introduced in 1999
and updated in 2011. It identifies seven pillars or core components of information

Campos 15

literacy, within each of which one can demonstrate varying levels of proficiency
(SCONUL, 2011).
The SCONUL Seven Pillars Model identifies the following seven components of
information literacy:
1. Identify – determine when one needs information;
2. Scope – determine the extent of current knowledge and gaps in knowledge;
3. Plan – plan how to locate the information needed;
4. Gather – access and collect the information needed;
5. Evaluate – evaluate the research process and the adequacy of the information
gathered;
6. Manage – organize and store information appropriately and ethically;
7. Present – present knowledge gained from the research process in order to
create and disseminate new knowledge (SCONUL, 2011).
SCONUL intended its Seven Pillars Model to serve as a foundation for the
development of “lenses” or adaptations of the Model. Each of these lenses would adapt
the Model to particular contexts and user populations (SCONUL, 2011).
Australian and New Zealand Information Literacy Framework. The Australian
and New Zealand information literacy framework: Principles, standards, and practice, is
an information literacy model developed in 2004 by the Australian and New Zealand
Institute for Information Literacy (ANZIIL). This information literacy model was based
in part on the ACRL Standards (Bundy, 2004). The model consists of six standards:
The information literate person recognizes the need for information and
determines the nature and extent of the information needed;

Campos 16

1. The information literate person finds needed information effectively and
efficiently;
2. The information literate person critically evaluates information and the
information seeking process;
3. The information literate person manages information collected and generated;
4. The information literate person applies prior and new information to construct
new concepts or create new understandings;
5. The information literate person uses information with understanding and
acknowledges cultural, ethical, economic, legal and social issues surrounding
the use of information (Bundy, 2004).
The ANZIL Framework is intended to be general and applicable to all educational
sectors and lead to lifelong learning (Bundy, 2004).
Standards for the 21st Century Learner. Developed and promulgated by the
American Association of School Librarians (AASL), the Standards for the 21st Century
Learner (AASL Standards) are an information literacy model designed for application in
the K-12 environment (AASL, 2007). It details skills, dispositions, responsibilities, and
self-assessment strategies for the following four practices:
1. Inquire, think critically, and gain knowledge;
2. Draw conclusions, make informed decisions, apply knowledge to new
situations, and create new knowledge;
3. Share knowledge and participate ethically and productively in society;
4. Pursue personal and aesthetic growth (AASL, 2007).

Campos 17

The AASL standard is intended to encourage the development of lifelong
learners. The AASL Standards are undergoing a revision that is expected to result in an
updated model in the fall of 2017 (AASL, 2016).
Information Literacy VALUE Rubric The information literacy VALUE (Valid
Assessment of Learning in Undergraduate Education) rubric was developed by the
American Association of Colleges and Universities (AACU) and made available for use
in 2009 (Rhodes, 2011-2012). It was part of a broader initiative of the AACU to facilitate
assessment of student learning in 15 broad crosscutting competencies such as applied
learning, civic learning, and information literacy (Rhodes, 2011-2012). The information
literacy VALUE rubric identifies the following six standards of information literacy and
provides standards to determine a student’s level of proficiency:
1. Determine the extent of information needed;
2. Access the needed information;
3. Evaluate information and its sources critically;
4. Use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose; and
5. Assess and use information ethically and legally (AACU, 2009).
Affective and cultural considerations In addition to the information literacy
models described here, information literacy instruction has been enriched by research and
theoretical reflection on the affective and cultural aspects of the research process.
Kuhlthau (2013) highlighted the importance of adopting a holistic approach to
information literacy instruction that looks beyond the cognitive aspects of the information
research process by (1) recognizing emotions such as anxiety, confusion, and frustration,
which are a normal component of the research process and (2) guiding learners through

Campos 18

these experiences. Another aspect of information literacy that has received some recent
recognition is the role of culture. Baker (2013) proposed that cultural dimensions such as
power distance or the way power inequality among persons is handled in a country can
influence how learners will exercise critical thinking practices. For example, in a society
with a high power distance, students will be less likely to question authority figures such
as teachers (Hofstede, Hofstede, & Minkov, 2010).
ACRL Contributions to Information Literacy.
The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) has played an
influential role in the evolution of the concept of information literacy in higher education
in the United States in part because several regional accrediting organizations have
adopted some variation of the ACRL standards (Saunders, 2007). ACRL has also been
active in providing forum for discussions, research, collaborative initiatives, and training
in information literacy. For these reasons many colleges and universities in the United
States look to ACRL for guidance on developing information literacy instruction
programs.
ACRL Standards. The Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education (ACRL Standards) have been widely used by higher education institutions as a
resource for information literacy instruction since their adoption in 2000 (ACRL, 2000).
The American Association for Higher Education and the Council of Independent
Colleges have endorsed ACRL Standards (ACRL, 2000). The ACRL Standards
incorporated the American Library Association Presidential Committee on Information
Literacy’s definition of information literacy which included recognizing when
information is needed, and locating, evaluating, and effectively using the needed

Campos 19

information (ALA, 2000). However, the ACRL standards expanded on the basic
processes of information literacy adding the ability to recognize and respect the economic
value of intellectual property.
The ACRL Standards were prescriptive and extensive. They consist of 5
standards, 22 performance indicators, and 87 outcomes (ACRL, 2000). The ACRL
Standards proposed that an information literate student is able to
1. Determine the nature and extent of information needed;
2. Access needed information effectively and efficiently;
3. Critically evaluate and incorporate information into their existing knowledge
base and value system;
4. Use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose;
5. Understand the economic, legal, and social context of information and uses
information ethically and legally (ACRL Standards).
As noted earlier, one-time sessions are the norm in college library instruction
(Bravender, McClure, & Schaub, 2015; McDonough, 2014). Asher and Duke (2010)
pointed out that, when taught using a traditional lecture style, there is little or no time in a
single session to discuss information evaluation, analysis, and synthesis or to discuss the
ethical use of information (Asher & Duke, 2010).
ACRL Framework. To keep the ACRL Standards aligned with continuing
changes in information technology and the information environment, ACRL organized
the ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education Task Force
(the Task Force) in 2012 to study and consider a possible revision of the ACRL
Standards. The Task Force proposed replacing the ACRL Standards with a new

Campos 20

Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (ACRL Framework). Instead
of an outright replacement of the ACRL Standards, ACRL initially adopted the ACRL
Framework as one of “a constellation of documents on information literacy” (ACRL,
2015; ACRL 2000). In June 2016, however, the ACRL Board rescinded the ACRL
Standards leaving the ACRL Framework as its primary guidance for those engaged in
information literacy instruction (Drabinski, 2016).
Like the ACRL Standards before it, the ACRL Framework further modified the
definition of information literacy by expanding its scope. The ACRL Framework defines
information literacy as “the set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective
discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued,
and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically in
communities of learning” (ACRL, 2015, p. 3). This new definition expands the scope of
information literacy in several ways. For example, it articulates a reflective approach to
information discovery; it includes understanding of how information is produced; and it
recognizes the role of information users in the creation of new knowledge.
The ACRL Framework emphasizes the development of practices and dispositions
that will guide students through information literacy thresholds that once crossed
constitute a desired level of information proficiency (Gibson & Jacobson, 2014). The
ACRL Framework builds on the work of Townsend, Brunetti, and Hofer (2011), who
applied the idea of threshold concepts to information science (Gibson & Jacobson, 2014).
Initially proposed by Meyer and Land (2003), threshold concepts are conceptual
milestones that must be understood in order for a student to become proficient in a
discipline.

Campos 21

The ACRL Framework identifies and elaborates on six threshold concepts or
frames for information literacy: authority is constructed and contextual, information
creation is a process, information has value, research as inquiry, scholarship as
conversation, and searching as strategic exploration (ACRL, 2015). These concepts were
developed through a process of extensive consultation with information literacy experts,
which included a Delphi Research study (Gibson & Jacobson, 2014). The task force that
constructed the ACRL framework circulated three rounds for drafts for public comment
and gathered feedback through an online questionnaire and through public meetings
(ACRL, 2015).
Because of its use of broader conceptual frames, the ACRL Framework is not as
prescriptive as the ACRL Standards (Oakleaf, 2014). For example, it does not provide
learning outcomes. Instead, for each threshold concept, the ACRL Framework lists
knowledge practices that a learner who has internalized the given threshold concept
should be able to do and dispositions or attitudes that characterize a learner who has
internalized the threshold concept (ACRL, 2015). The expectation of the drafters of the
ACRL Framework is that postsecondary institutions will adapt the ACRL Framework to
their particular needs and develop their own learning objectives and outcome measures
(ACRL, 2015). Seeber (2015) suggested an advantage of the ACRL Framework is that it
recognizes the importance of context, including cultural context, in information literacy.
The ACRL Framework has encountered criticism on theoretical and practical
grounds. Seale (2015), for example, describes an ambiguity in the ACRL Framework in
that it recognizes individualism and contextual factors, on the one hand, but provides a
set of knowledge practices, learning objectives, and dispositions, on the other. Saracevic

Campos 22

(2014) questioned whether threshold concepts are useful to the ACRL Framework, noting
that these concepts have too much uncertainty to be defining characteristics of a
discipline; that they do not imply ability on the part of a student; and that what is
troublesome is a subjective quality that depends on the actor. Saracevic (2014) also
questioned whether one can assert with confidence that disciplines have a bounded body
of threshold concepts. Reed (2015) questioned the breadth of the ACRL Framework
noting that it is primarily applicable to universities and does not lend itself to practical
use by community colleges.
State of Information Literacy in United States Higher Education
Information literacy is an important lifelong skill that colleges and employers
expect of students (Wiebe, 2015). Three important research projects that have shed light
on the state of information literacy in the United States are Project Information Literacy
(PIL) (Head, 2012; 2013; 2016), Ethnographic Research in Illinois Academic Libraries
(Duke & Asher, 2012), and D’Couto and Rosenhan (2015).
Project Information Literacy (PIL).
PIL is a national mixed-methods study of the information-seeking habits of
students following secondary school. In a study of information literacy competence of
college freshmen, PIL found that most college students have inadequate information
literacy skills (Head, 2013), that is, they lack skills that enable them to effectively
research, evaluate, synthesize, and use information. This PIL study of freshmen, involved
an analysis of information resources at 30 high schools and six colleges and universities,
interviews with 35 first-term college freshmen, and an online survey of 1,941 high school
and college students. The researchers found that most first-term college freshmen

Campos 23

struggle with the information literacy competencies. They found that freshmen often have
difficulty formulating searches as well as searching in college and university research
collections, which generally are much larger and more complex than high school
collections. They found that freshmen often revert to sources like Google and Wikipedia,
with which they are already familiar and comfortable. The PIL researchers found that
first-term freshmen have difficulty analyzing information and drawing inferences (Head,
2013). The researchers also found that college students often graduate and join the
workforce with gaps in information literacy skills (Head, 2012). In the last of its Passage
Studies series, Head (2016) found that most of the 1,651 recent college graduates
surveyed in that study lacked certain information literacy skills relating to critical
thinking and self-management required to be lifelong learners in their personal and
professional lives. According to Head (2016), graduates often reflected that as students
they were used to being given the questions to answer rather than learning to formulate
questions that need to be answered.
Ethnographic Research in Illinois Academic Libraries (ERIAL).
The ERIAL project is another important study on the status of information
research in higher education. Involving over 650 participants in over 700 research
activities between 2008 and 2010 at five Illinois universities, the ERIAL Project
employed an ethnographic qualitative approach to understanding how college students
conduct academic research and use library resources and services (Duke & Asher, 2012).
Among other methods, ERIAL Project researchers used ethnographic interviews with 156
students, 75 teaching faculty, and 49 librarians to explore each group’s understanding of
their role in the research process, their expectations of the other groups, and the

Campos 24

experience of students doing academic research (Duke & Asher, 2012). Ethnographic
interviews by the ERIAL researchers (Duke & Asher, 2012) found that students often do
not seek help from academic librarians because they are not familiar with academic
librarians or with how librarians at their academic institution can help them select a
research topic or conduct research. The researchers theorized that owing in part to a lack
of administrative structures that connect libraries and librarians with the student’s college
experience, students often seek assistance with their research from friends, family
members, their professors, or even public librarians with whom they may be more
familiar (Duke & Asher, 2012). A study within the ERIAL Project focused on how
undergraduates at Illinois Wesleyan University find and evaluate information for their
academic research assignments (Duke & Asher, 2012). The researchers found that the
majority of students who participated in the study exhibited “significant difficulties” at
almost every stage of the research process (Duke & Asher, 2012).
ProQuest research study.
In a qualitative study consisting of 18 focus groups and 35 in-depth contextual
interviews with 125 academic researchers at six academic campuses in the United States,
ProQuest researchers D’Couto and Rosenhan (2015) explored research behaviors and
challenges faced by academic researchers. D’Couto and Rosenhan (2015) confirmed
some of the findings of the PIL and ERIAL studies, such as student tendency to rely on
Web search engines and a hesitation to consult academic librarians for assistance. The
researchers found that the research behavior, especially as regards persistence in locating
required information, varied with the level of engagement of the academic researcher
with the research topic (D’Couto & Rosenhan, 2015). At one end of the spectrum are

Campos 25

students completing assignments for a general education course whose research behavior
is heavily influenced by the requirements of the assignment and the guidance of the
instructor. The domain learner is the student who might be majoring in a discipline and
who invests time learning about the information sources specific to their field. The
apprentice is a researcher, such as a graduate student, who aspires to contribute to their
field of study and whose research activities in the field are ongoing and thorough. At the
other end is the scholar who is already an expert, whose research activities are
continuous, and who contributes to the field (D’Couto & Rosenhan, 2015). The academic
researcher profiles identified by D’Couto and Rosenhan (2015) suggested that it is
important to tailor information literacy instruction to the need of the student. The ACRL
Framework recognizes this in identifying diverse information practices and dispositions
for each frame depending on whether the student is a novice or an expert (ACRL, 2015).
User Experience Research in Information Literacy
Experience or perception-focused qualitative research studies in information
literacy have adopted phenomenography as the preferred methodological approach
following Bruce’s (1997) seminal study, which proposed a relational model for how
information literacy is experienced and conceptualized by information users (Bruce,
1997; Bruce, Davis, Hughes, Partridge, & Stoodley, 2014; Diehm & Lupton, 2012;
Diehm & Lupton, 2014; Gross & Latham, 2011). Phenomenography was popularized as a
research methodology in the 1970s by educational researchers (Gross & Latham, 2011)
who used it for curriculum development research. Cibangu and Hepworth (2016) traced
the term “phenomenography” back to Italian mathematician Marco Tulio Falcomer who
used the term in a 1902 book at a time when Husserl’s phenomenology was influential in

Campos 26

Europe. Phenomenography is viewed as a branch of phenomenology because it shares
many ontological assumptions and terminology with Husserl’s phenomenology (Cibangu
& Hepworth, 2016). Phenomenography is similar to traditional phenomenology in that it
focuses on the perceptions and experiences of participants in relation to a particular
phenomenon and as with phenomenology, the researcher employing phenomenography
takes measures to approach the research project in a self-reflective way to avoid
introducing preconceived ideas about the phenomenon (Creswell, 2013; Gross & Latham,
2011).
Phenomenological research in information literacy.
Hill, Betts, and Gardner (2015) employed an interpretive phenomenological
analysis (IPA) approach in their information literacy study because of its suitability for
exploring the making of meaning. The researchers explored the experiences and attitudes
of older adults in the United Kingdom with respect to digital technology—a form
information literacy within the ACRL Framework (ACRL, 2015)—and their perceptions
of wellbeing in relation to the use of this technology. The researchers identified two
overarching themes. First, digital technology was perceived as disempowering for older
adults who do not engage with it because unfamiliarity with digital technology can have
the effect of isolating persons from social communities and activities that rely on this
technology. They also found that those who do learn how to use digital technology
perceive it as empowering (Hill, Betts, and Gardner, 2015).
Phenomenographic research in information literacy.
Unlike phenomenology, which involves creating a narrative description of a
phenomenon that captures the essential experiences of the participants,

Campos 27

phenomenography maps qualitatively different ways in which participants experience,
conceptualize, and understand various aspects of the phenomenon being studied (Diehm
& Lupton, 2012; Marton, 1986). The resulting product of a phenomenographic study is a
description of the interrelated categories of experience, known as the outcome space,
identified through interviews with participants and the relationships among these
categories (Diehm & Lupton, 2014; Gross & Latham, 2011). Traditionally, the objective
of developing an understanding of student perceptions of a phenomenon is to create
appropriate learning interventions (Marciales Vivas, Castañeda-Peña, Barbosa-Chacón,
Barreto, & Melo, 2016).
Forster’s (2015) review of previous research employing a phenomenographic
approach to information literacy research suggests that students experience information
literacy in a context-specific manner; that is, not as a set of information seeking skills, but
as an experienced phenomenon. Even the ACRL Framework implicitly acknowledges the
experiential component of information literacy in its enumeration of knowledge practices
and dispositions associated with each threshold concept (ACRL, 2015). Gross and
Latham’s (2011) study of the perceptions of information literacy among seventy-seven
first-year college students of proficient and below-proficient information literacy levels
confirmed many of the findings by non-phenomenographic studies discussed earlier but
provided some additional nuances (D’Couto & Rosenhan, 2015; Duke & Asher, 2012;
Head 2012, 2013). Gross and Latham (2011) found that students measure success by the
ability to find information irrespective of the search process employed. The researchers
found that students think they are already proficient in working with information. In fact,
below-proficient students tend to overestimate their information literacy skills. Students

Campos 28

viewed information technology as the primary way of engaging with information. While
they viewed the Web and search engines like Google as the best way to research,
participants modified their information seeking practices and used library resources
where needed to conform to the course-related requirements of their instructors.
Participants also viewed other persons, especially friends and peers, as important sources
of information. Finally, the quality of information was a concern in course-related
assignments, but not as much for purposes of self-initiated personal information searches
(Gross & Latham, 2011).
In a phenomenographic study of 15 university students, Diehm and Lupton (2012)
explored student approaches to information literacy. The researchers outlined six
categories in which information literacy is experienced, including: (1) learning to find
information, (2) learning a process to use information, (3) learning to use information to
create a product, (4) learning to use information to build a personal knowledge base, (5)
learning to use information to advance disciplinary knowledge, and (6) learning to use
information to grow as a person and to contribute to others. The researchers identified
three ways in which students approach information literacy within these categories: (1)
learning by doing, (2) experimentation by trial and error, and (3) interacting with other
people, either by seeking advice or observing (Diehm & Lupton, 2012). The ACRL
Framework includes frames that correlate to some of the experiences identified by Diehm
and Lupton. For example, learning to find information is similar to the searching as
exploration frame. Learning a process to use information relates to the research as inquiry
frame. Learning to use information to create a product relates to the “Information
Creation as a Process” frame. Learning to use information to build a personal knowledge

Campos 29

base relates to the “Research as Inquiry” frame and to the “Searching as Strategic
Exploration” frame. Learning to use information to advance disciplinary knowledge
relates to the “Scholarship as Conversation” frame (ACRL, 2015). Notwithstanding these
correlations, it is not clear that students experience the categories identified by Diehm
and Lupton (2012) as threshold concepts because this question was outside the scope of
that study.
Maybee (2015) used phenomenography to research the relationship between the
information experiences of a teacher and her students and the role of information in
learning about a subject. Findings from this line of research suggest that students learn
information literacy best in the context of learning disciplinary content (Diehm &
Lupton, 2014; Maybee, 2015). Building on their (2012) study of approaches to
information literacy, Diehm and Lupton (2014), focusing on conceptions of information
literacy, identified related and increasingly sophisticated ways in which students learned
to use information; (1) a study view in connection with learning to find, process, and use
information to create a product; (2) a workplace view in learning to use information to
build a personal knowledge base and advance disciplinary knowledge; and (3) a
worldview in learning to use information to grow as a person and contribute to others.
Diehm and Lupton (2014) suggest that through varied experiences with information,
students learn that information has many applications. According to the “informed
learning” perspective, educators can help students develop information proficiency by
exposing them to different ways in which information is applied in their discipline and by
providing them with varied opportunities to practice using information in the process of
learning a discipline (Diehm & Lupton, 2014; Maybee, 2015).

Campos 30

Threshold Concept Theory
Threshold concept theory is a relatively new approach to teaching and learning
(Meyer & Land, 2003). The application of threshold concept theory to information
literacy and to the ACRL Framework in particular is even more recent (Blackmore, &
Freeland, 2012; Townsend, Brunetti, & Hofer, 2011; Townsend, Hofer, Hanick, &
Brunetti, 2016; Tucker, V.M., 2014; Yorke-Barber, Atkinson, Possin, & Woodall, 2008).
This section briefly reviews origins and applications of threshold concept theory. It then
discusses how this approach to teaching and learning has been applied to information
literacy.
Origins and applications. Threshold concept theory is an approach to teaching
developed by Meyer and Land (2003), who after consulting with colleagues in several
disciplines (e.g., economics, literary and cultural studies, mathematics, and physics),
theorized that there exists critical “threshold concepts,” among the core concepts within a
field. These “threshold concepts” must be understood and integrated by novices to
develop the mindset of an expert or practitioner in that field. Unlike other core concepts,
which need to be learned to develop an understanding of a discipline, threshold concepts,
according to Meyer and Land (2003), also serve as cognitive portals that open up a new
way of thinking about a discipline. Myer and Land’s (2003) threshold concept theory was
built in part on the previous work of Perkins (1999) on the various types of troublesome
knowledge. According to Perkins (1999, 2006), constructivism in education should be
employed in a practical manner that draws from a toolbox of techniques including active
learning, social or collaborative learning, and creative or re-creative approaches to

Campos 31

promote deep learning in a way that addresses the particular ways in which knowledge
may be troublesome or challenging for learners.
Perkins (1999) identified the following types of troublesome knowledge: (1) inert
knowledge, which like some vocabulary words are not used unless needed; (2) ritual
knowledge, which is routine and meaningless; (3) conceptually difficult knowledge,
which is complex and subject to being misunderstood; and (4) foreign knowledge, which
is from a perspective that conflicts with that of the learner. Meyer and Land (2003) added
to these, tacit knowledge, which is used but which remains unexamined. Meyer and Land
(2003) suggested that there are concepts and systems of concepts and practices or
epistemes as Perkins (2006) later called them, which constitute the ways in which experts
in a discipline think, but which are often not made explicit in the course of instruction.
Being aware of these threshold concepts can promote effective curriculum design
according to Meyer and Land (2003).
Meyer and Land (2006) identified five characteristics of threshold concepts: A
threshold concept is likely to be (1) transformative, in that once understood, it
permanently changes a student’s view on a subject; (2) irreversible, in that once learned,
it is not likely to be forgotten; (3) integrative, in that it reveals the interrelatedness of
previously unrelated knowledge about a subject; (4) troublesome, in that it represents a
hitherto foreign way of understanding; and (5) bounded, in that it may demarcate the
boundaries of a discipline. Meyer and Land (2006) have qualified some of these
characteristics in various ways. A key characteristic of a threshold concept is that it is
transformative. It causes a substantial shift in student perceptions and behaviors with
respect to the field. Two other important characteristics are that a threshold concept is

Campos 32

irreversible and integrative (Meyer & Land, 2006). It is not always the case that a
threshold concept is bounded or troublesome (Meyer & Land, 2006). These are true in
information literacy because information literacy is an interdisciplinary field, with
concepts that apply across several disciplines of study. Similarly, what is difficult for one
person to grasp may be easier for another to understand (Meyer & Land, 2006).
Application to information literacy. Threshold concept theory has been applied
to explore better ways to understand and teach information literacy (Blackmore, &
Freeland, 2012; Townsend, Brunetti, & Hofer, 2011; Townsend, Hofer, Hanick, &
Brunetti, 2016; Tucker, 2014; Yorke-Barber, Atkinson, Possin, & Woodall, 2008). With a
view to developing ways of improving information literacy curriculum, some researchers
have focused on troublesomeness as a key characteristic for identifying threshold
concepts. For example, Yorke-Barber et al. (2008) surveyed faculty members, students,
and librarians at a university engineering program in Australia regarding stumbling
blocks students encounter in gathering and using information and ways these can be
overcome. The researchers identified the following as possible threshold concepts: (1)
formulating a research topic and a search strategy; (2) locating, critically evaluating, and
tracking information research; and (3) referencing and citing information (Yorke-Barber
et al., 2008).
Librarians working with students at help desks at an English university listed
troublesome concepts in an effort to identify threshold concepts to focus on in library
instruction curriculum (Blackmore & Freeland, 2012). The threshold concepts reported
by Blackmore and Freeland (2012) were (1) managing emotions associated with
interacting effectively with information; (2) understanding the contextual nature of

Campos 33

information whereby, for example, the type information that is appropriate will vary with
the situation; (3) bricolage or the creative and individual ways in which individuals
engage with information; (4) time/outcome ratio or the appreciation of time as a resource
in research; (5) systemic thinking or the recognition that information can be viewed as a
series of interconnected systems; and (6) pattern perception in the way information
appears, is organized, and related.
In a qualitative grounded research study using semi-structured interviews, search
tasks with think-aloud narratives, and talk-after protocols with professional searchers,
Tucker (2014) researched threshold concepts associated with becoming an expert
information searcher. The study suggested four threshold concepts: (1) information
environment or an understanding of the information setting and the implications this has
for the search; (2) information structures or an understanding of how documents and
digital information is organized and how this applies to searching; (3) information
vocabularies such as the use of controlled vocabularies, proximity searching, and
truncation; and (4) concept fusion including synthesizing information, combining
sources, and combining searching styles (Tucker, 2014; 2016).
Using a qualitative Delphi method, Townsend, Hofer, Hanick, and Brunetti
(2016) sought to identify threshold concepts in information literacy. The researchers
secured the participation of 19 prominent contributors to the field of information literacy
(Townsend et al., 2016). Over the course of four rounds, the researchers asked the
panelists whether the threshold concepts approach might be useful for information
literacy. They also asked the panelists to identify, evaluate, and rank the most important

Campos 34

threshold concepts in information literacy (Townsend et al., 2016). The researchers
reported the following six threshold concepts:
(1) Authority – authoritative evidence is contextual;
(2) Format – the packaging of information varies with the process through which
the information was created and shared;
(3) Information commodities – costs are associated with the production of
information and revenues are generated through the use of information;
(4) Information structures – the way information sources are constructed and
organized facilitates the effective use of information;
(5) Research process – the research process is an extension of the thinking
process involving the formulation of questions, information seeking, testing,
reformulation, and the creation of knowledge; and
(6) Scholarly discourse – knowledge is created in the context of an ongoing
conversation within a community of information creators and users
(Townsend, et al., 2016).
The threshold concepts identified by Townsend et al. (2016) are very similar to
the ACRL Framework, with each of these thresholds identified by the researchers
mapping back to one or more of the ACRL Framework frames. The ACRL Framework
references the then ongoing research work of Townsend et al. (2016) as a basis upon
which the frames were formulated (ACRL, 2015). In opting to employ a Delphi method
to identify threshold concepts for information literacy, Townsend et al. (2016) cite,
among other things, the difficulties identified by Shinners-Kennedy and Fincher (2013) in
using a phenomenographic approach to identify threshold concepts in computing and

Campos 35

information sciences. The difficulties identified by Shinners-Kennedy and Fincher (2013)
included hindsight bias or the difficulty of assuming a mindset that preceded knowledge
of a threshold concept and attempting to recall the circumstances that led up to its
acquisition. Additionally, Shinners-Kennedy and Fincher (2013, 2016) cite the work of
Blane (1996) suggesting that events that were associated with high emotions, as the
process of learning threshold concepts might be, are less likely to be recalled with
accuracy. While the Delphi method can elicit expert opinions on threshold concepts in
information literacy, a question remains as to whether a better understanding of how
students perceive and experience threshold concepts in information literacy might help
(1) validate the threshold concepts proposed by the ACRL Framework, (2) add to our
understanding of the transformative concepts experienced by students at a particular
place and time, and (3) assist instructors in customizing and applying these threshold
concepts to particular teaching situations (Akerlind, McKenzie, & Lupton, 2014; Cousin,
2008, 2010; Felten, 2016)
Critiques of threshold concept theory. Threshold concept theory has been
applied in several disciplines as a practical approach to developing curricula that help
students engage and overcome common conceptual barriers to developing understanding
and an expert mindset in their field (Land, Meyer, & Smith, 2008; Land, Meyer, &
Flanagan, 2016; Myer & Land, 2006). Threshold concept theory represents a departure
from the student-centered approach to teaching and learning in that it focuses on
challenging concepts within a discipline (Cousin, 2008, 2010). However, rather than
being a return to a teacher-centered approach to teaching and learning, Cousin (2010)
suggested that the threshold concept approach engages academic discipline specialists

Campos 36

which have been overlooked in student-centered approaches such as phenomographic
studies of students.
One of the difficulties with identifying threshold concepts for purposes of
improving curriculum within a discipline is that because threshold concepts are by
definition transformative, in that they change the knowledge and outlook of the learner,
consulting experts about their state of knowledge and way of thinking prior to acquiring
an expert mindset, is subject to inaccuracy (Skinners-Kennedy, 2016; Tucker, 2016). In
relation to information literacy, Saracevic (2014) raised several difficulties with the
adoption of threshold concept theory:
(1) Threshold concept theory is still evolving and questions remain as to which of the
characteristics that constitute a threshold concept must be met before some aspect of a
subject can qualify as a threshold concept.
(2) Several of the characteristics of threshold concepts are proposed as “probable,” but
how can a probable characteristic be a defining characteristic?
(3) The use of the term “concept” is misleading because in some instances threshold
concepts are actually skills and not mental representations as we normally think of
concepts.
(4) What is “troublesome” depends on the learner, so this is a difficult characteristic to
use in defining a threshold concept
(5) The notion that disciplines have a unified body of knowledge is problematic because
it suggests that rather than expanding a student’s mindset to think outside of
established norms, critical thinking is being sacrificed in favor of reducing disciplines
to a static body of knowledge.

Campos 37

As regards the difficulty of assigning definite and universal characteristics to threshold
concepts, Land (2016) has proposed, “[t]he superordinate and non-negotiable
characteristic of a threshold concept is its transformative capacity” (p. 16).
In a criticism of the threshold concepts or frames identified in the ACRL
Framework, Reed (2015) suggested that the frames are highly theoretical and provide no
guidance to librarians who provide library instruction to community college students in a
one-time environment. Insights from the critiques of threshold concept theory described
here highlight considerations that inform how best to interpret and adapt the ACRL
Framework to local institutional needs (ACRL, 2015).
Areas for Future Research Identified in the Literature
Meyer and Land (2006) suggested the following research area in relation to
threshold concepts: “A research question is also opened up on the degree to which
threshold concepts, as perceived by teachers, are experienced by students, and with what
variation” (p. 17). Entwistle (2008) suggested that in order to understand the
transformative aspect of threshold concepts we need to learn much more about how these
are experienced by students. Felten (2016) also suggested that student experiences and
perspectives can add to our understanding of threshold concepts. For example, Felton
(2016) found that student participants in undergraduate seminars on threshold concepts
viewed threshold concepts as rites of passage; that students highlighted the affective or
emotional challenges of anxiety and the development of confidence; and that students
were more likely to view threshold concepts as applicable to interdisciplinary contexts.
Akerlind and Lupton (2014) proposed a curriculum design approach involving the
identification of threshold concepts, application of phenomenography to identify student

Campos 38

understandings of these concepts, and the creation of lessons that help students learn
these concepts.
Summary
Chapter II provided a review of the literature relating to the evolution of
information literacy in higher education. It then turned to research on the state of
information literacy in higher education in the United States. Experience-focused,
qualitative approaches to information literacy and threshold concept research were then
examined. Research directions identified in the literature were also discussed. Chapter III
describes the methodology for the study including preparation, data collection, and data
analysis. Chapter IV presents the findings of the study. Chapter V summarizes the study,
discusses conclusions in the context of the literature, discusses the implications of the
findings, and recommends areas for future research.

Chapter III
Methodology
The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand the perceptions and
experiences relating to information literacy threshold concepts of lower-level
undergraduate students enrolled in an associate degree program at a Texas college.
Research suggests that college students often experience gaps in their ability to
effectively engage with information to solve problems and for lifelong learning (Head,
2013). The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Framework for
Information Literacy Instruction for Higher Education (ACRL Framework), adopted in
2015, is built around six threshold concepts identified by experts as transformative
milestones in the development of proficiency (ACRL, 2015; Gibson & Jacobson, 2014).
Because the ACRL Framework is broad and library instruction opportunities with
students in associate degree programs are infrequent, this study employs a qualitative
phenomenographic approach to explore concepts that students in their second year of
college perceive as transformative milestones in learning information literacy as a way to
inform the integration of the ACRL Framework into library instruction.
This chapter discusses the purpose of the study and related research questions that
guided the study. It describes the research design, the participants, setting, and data
collection methods used for the study. It then reviews treatment of the data and
provisions for trustworthiness. Finally, it closes with an epochè attempting to set out the
researcher’s experience and interest in information literacy.

Purpose of the Study and Research Questions
The purpose of this phenomenographic study was to understand the perceptions
and experiences relating to information literacy threshold concepts of lower-level
undergraduate students enrolled in an associate degree program at a Texas college.
Information literacy threshold concepts are defined as transformative concepts or
milestones in the development of information literacy, including but not limited to those
concepts identified in the ACRL Framework (ACRL, 2015). The overarching research
question of this study is “How do lower-level undergraduate students perceive threshold
concepts or transformative milestone concepts in their experience of learning information
literacy?” Below are the six related research questions explored in this study:
1. What do students consider as the transformative milestones in their experience of
learning information literacy?
2. What is the experience of students in understanding and internalizing these
transformative milestones?
3. What are student perceptions of what would have eased their internalization of the
transformative milestones they identified?
4. How do these transformative milestones compare to the threshold concepts
identified in the ACRL Framework?
5. What are student experiences and perceptions of engaging with information from
the perspective of the ACRL frames?
6. What are student perceptions of what would have eased their internalization of the
ACRL frames they have experienced?

Campos 41

Research Design
This was a qualitative research study using phenomenography as the research
approach. Creswell (2013) proposed that qualitative research is appropriate where an
issue needs to be explored and does not lend itself to easy measurement. Qualitative
research is also deemed appropriate for gaining an understanding of a complex issue by
talking directly to people and allowing them to tell their stories (Creswell, 2013). This
study sought to understand the perceptions of college students toward threshold concepts
or transformative milestone concepts in their experience of learning information literacy.
The researcher employed in-depth, semi-structured interviews (Cousin, 2009) with
participants asking open-ended questions relating to each participant’s experience of
developing information literacy skills. The researcher recorded the interviews and took
notes. An interview protocol was used to guide the interviews. See Appendix B. Because
the study focused on the variety of ways individuals perceive a phenomenon with a view
to identifying categories of common experiences in relation to that phenomenon, a
phenomenographic qualitative approach was deemed appropriate for this study
(Entwistle, 1997; Lupton, 2008; Svensson, 1997).
Lupton (2008) identified some of the distinctive characteristics of
phenomenography as a qualitative research approach. Phenomenography is primarily
concerned with variation in the ways people experience a phenomenon and the
relationship among these conceptions (Entwistle, 1997; Lupton, 2008). Historically,
phenomenography has been associated with the ways people experience teaching and
learning. Accordingly, this research approach lends itself to the practical application of
outcomes to the curriculum (Cibangu & Hepworth, 2016; Entwistle, 1997, Lupton, 2008).

Campos 42

Phenomenography takes a second-order perspective, which investigates a phenomenon
through the experience of the participant rather than that of the researcher (a first-order
perspective) (Entwistle, 1997; Lupton, 2008). The outcome of phenomenographic
analysis is the collective experience rather than the individual experience of a
phenomenon (Lupton, 2008).
Participants. The study employed a purposeful sampling approach (Creswell,
2013) identifying 80 eligible college students. Bruce (1997) citing Sandberg (1994)
suggested that in a phenomenographic study, a sample size of 20 provides a sufficiently
rich description of the variety of conceptions for the phenomenon being studied. Cousin
(2009) recommended a sample size of at least ten for a phenomenographic study. Of the
students identified, eleven students participated in the study. Creswell (2013) identified
three considerations that go into the purposeful sampling decision: 1) whom to select, 2)
the sampling strategy, and 3) the size of the sample. In a phenomenographic study, the
selection of participants is driven by the requirement that participants have an experience
of the phenomenon being studied and represent as wide as possible a variation of how the
phenomenon is conceptualized in the given population (Bruce, 1997; Marciales Vivas,
2016). Each student was enrolled at the same college in Texas. Each of the 11 student
participants had completed at least a second level English course (English 1302) with a
grade of B or above, written at least two college-level research papers, and had received
library instruction. This criteria was employed to identify students who had experienced
doing college research. Successful experience doing college-level research suggests that
the participants have some experience of threshold concepts or transformational
milestones associated with becoming information literate. Accordingly, the sample was

Campos 43

selected purposefully to focus on those who had experienced the phenomenon under
study (Bruce, 1997). The sampling strategy was designed to select participants who
reflect gender balance and the ethnic distribution of the student body at the college,
which is over 90% Hispanic. Participants selected were more readily accessible to the
researcher. Finally, sampling size was initially set at 22, consisting of 20 participants for
the study and two for a pilot test of the research protocol (Creswell, 2013). Because of the
difficulty encountered recruiting participants, 11 students participated, the first served as
a pilot for the research protocol, but no material changes were made to the protocol
following this first participant.
Data routinely collected by the library on classes and students participating in
library instruction sessions was reviewed to help identify students who had participated in
at least two library instruction sessions over the past two years. The college’s Research
and Analytical Services Department then compared this information to data from the
college’s student information system to identify students 18 years of age or over who
have completed ENGL 1302 with a grade of at least a B (3.0). The researcher used the
resulting list to contact 80 potential participants by e-mail, telephone, and/or text.
Ultimately, 11 students participated in the study.
Setting. The study took place at a large multi-campus Texas college. The college
offers over 100 associate degree and certificate options as well as four bachelor’s degree
programs. The college has a large dual credit program as well as a large online program
with over 500 online course sections. Approximately 67% of students at the college are
the first in their family to attend college, over 90% of students are of Hispanic descent,
and approximately 72% of students receive some form of financial aid. A single

Campos 44

organizational site was selected to increase the likelihood that the perceptions and
experiences of participants are typical of those of most other students at the same
institution. The purpose of the study was to explore student experiences and perceptions
of the broad interdisciplinary threshold concepts of information literacy rather than
threshold concepts associated with any particular discipline. Accordingly, the sample of
participants represented a broad range of contexts for the phenomenon under study; that
is, the experience of threshold concepts in information literacy at a college campus
without limitation to any major or sequence of courses other than the second level
English course (ENGL 1302) with a grade of B or above, completion of two research
papers, and the experience of library instruction (Bruce, 1997; Vagle, 2014).
ENGL 1302 Composition II – Rhetoric is a second level English course required
by many of the academic programs at the college, making this an important gateway
course for lower level undergraduates at the college. Among other things, the course
description for ENGL 1302 provides that research and documentation techniques will be
used in completing a research project. ENGL 1301-Composition I is a prerequisite of
ENGL 1302-Composition II. In both of these courses as well as in several other courses,
instructors often take their classes to the library or invite the library to provide one or
more library instruction sessions. Library instruction sessions at the college are generally
tailored to the requirements of the course instructor, which tend to relate a specific
research assignment. Library instruction sessions generally provide an overview of
library services, pertinent subject guides, key research databases, and research strategies.
Although there is an ongoing effort by library staff at the college to integrate the ACRL
Framework, in most single “one-shot” sessions there is little opportunity for discussion of

Campos 45

abstract information literacy concepts. Students are expected to write at least one research
paper for ENGL 1302, so the requirement that participants have written at least two
research papers increases the likelihood that these students have experienced threshold or
transformative concepts in learning information literacy.
Data collection. Data collection methods for phenomenographic research
outlined by Ashworth and Lucas (2000), Cousin (2009), and Smith and Hepworth (2012)
were employed. The data collection methods for this study included extended, individual,
face-to-face interviews consisting of open-ended questions and comments. The
interviews were semi-structured and opened with light conversation to help each
participant relax and focus on the experience being studied (Moustakas, 2004; Smith &
Hepworth, 2012). Cousin (2009) suggested that one approach for eliciting how the
interviewee conceptualizes the phenomenon is to ask the participant to describe instances
where they have experienced the phenomenon being studied. Each participant was
contacted in advance to go over consent and research protocol issues and to verbally
confirm their consent to participate in the study and that they had written at least two
college-level research papers and had participated in library instruction. An interview was
then scheduled, each participant was provided with a copy of the Letter of Consent and
Consent Form, and the signed Consent Form was collected before or at the start of each
interview session. See Appendix C. At these sessions, data was collected through an
extended (40 to 60 minute), individual, face-to-face interview with each participant. The
researcher began with social conversation to put the participant at ease. The participant
was then asked to focus on the experience of doing academic research and was then
engaged in a series of open-ended questions and comments to elicit the participant’s

Campos 46

perceptions and experience of threshold or transformative milestones in information
literacy (Moustakas, 1994; Smith & Hepworth, 2012). The first student meeting the
requirement for participation in the study and agreeing to participate were selected to take
part in the pilot phase of the study. After this interview was completed, the researcher
examined the process and results to determine whether any improvements should be
made to the guided protocol. No material changes were made to the protocol. The study
then proceeded with the remaining 10 participants.
Treatment of the Data. Data was analyzed as prescribed by Ashworth and Lucas
(2000) as well as by Smith and Hepworth (2012) for phenomenographic qualitative
research. Interview transcripts were read at least four times and the recordings listened to
at least twice. Cousin (2009) recommends the use of software for analyzing
phenomenographic data because it facilitates comparing and grouping data. Data from the
transcribed interviews was entered into Nvivo 11 Qualitative Data Analysis Software
(NVIVO 11) for coding and analysis.
Notes were made to code the data. Significant words and statements were
identified and these in turn were grouped into meaningful units according to the various
ways in which the phenomenon appeared to be experienced among the participant group.
Preliminary categories of experience were identified and illustrated using quotes from the
transcripts. Labels were developed for each category until all variations were represented
(Cousin, 2009). A diagrammatic representation of the relationships among the categories
of description, also known as the outcome space, was developed (Smith & Hepworth,
2012). To encourage candor and comprehensiveness (Moustakas, 1994), participants’
identities were kept confidential through the designation of aliases (Creswell, 2013).

Campos 47

Interview recordings and documentation relating to the study was kept on file in a locked
office or in a password protected computer. Computer data was also backed up to an
external drive kept in a locked office.
Provisions of Trustworthiness. Various measures were taken to promote the
trustworthiness of the results of this study. The researcher preceded implementation of
the actual study with a pilot test involving an interview with participant who met the
same selection criteria as the other participants. The pilot interview enabled the
researcher to attempt to identify unanticipated limitations with the study design and to
make appropriate refinements before implementing the full study (Turner, 2010).
Creswell (2013) described methods for promoting trustworthiness in qualitative research
and recommends that researchers employ at least two of these. This study employed the
following validation methods identified by Creswell (2013): peer review and clarifying
researcher bias. Peer review or external audit involved having another researcher not
associated with the study review the study design, interview transcripts, and the product
(Creswell, 2013). The researcher’s biases in relation to the research topic were made
explicit in the limitations and delimitations section and in an epochè.
Comparable measures of trustworthiness are described in relation to
phenomenographic research by Maybee (2015), who drawing in part on Collier-Reed,
Ingerman, and Berglund (2009), identifies credibility and dependability as measures of
trustworthiness. Peer reviewing corresponds to a “dialogic reliability check,” a measure
of reliability, where the researcher engages in a continuous discussion and critique of the
data with other researchers such as peers and members of the dissertation committee
(Maybee, 2015). Bracketing, or clarification of the researcher’s biases balanced with

Campos 48

content knowledge are part of content-related credibility. Credibility of method as it
relates to phenomenographic research requires that the purposive sample selected relate
to the central question of the research (Maybee, 2015). The purposive sample selected
here focused on a cross-section of students who have successfully completed at least a
second-level English course (ENGL 1302) involving college-level research and writing.
Another measure of trustworthiness in phenomenographic research incorporated in this
study is the use of quotations from the transcripts to exemplify outcome space categories
(Cousin, 2009).
Epochè. This study employed epochè, a measure characteristic to the
phenomenological qualitative approach, which also promotes trustworthiness (Creswell,
2013). Because phenomenography shares its philosophical and historical origins with
phenomenology (Cibangu, 2016), studies using this approach are strengthened by tools of
self-reflection and trustworthiness employed in phenomenological studies (Ashworth &
Lucas, 2000). Epochè is a process of self-reflection through which researchers attempt
first to become aware of their preconceived ideas, judgments, and biases relating to the
phenomenon being studied and second to set these aside so as to be able to accept the
phenomenon with an open mind (Moustakas, 1994).
The researcher in this study has been a librarian for over 18 years, doing research
for clients and training users during that time. The researcher has been an academic
librarian, working at a college, for seven of those years and has been involved in the
process of acquiring information resources, developing online instruction materials, and
providing library instruction to users. The researcher has a professional interest in the
results of this study. The researcher has followed the development of the ACRL

Campos 49

Framework and subsequent initiatives throughout the United States to use these
guidelines to improve information literacy instruction in higher education. The researcher
has participated in a taskforce at the academic library where he works whose purpose is
to review existing library instruction at this institution in light of the ACRL Framework
and to provide recommendations for improving information literacy instruction. The
researcher intends to share the results of this study with colleagues to assist in improving
library instruction by tailoring the ACRL Framework where appropriate to the needs of
students at the institution. He also intends to use the results of this study inform possible
work with professional peers in school and university settings to develop boundary
spanning (K-20) strategies for information literacy from high school, to college, to
university.

Chapter IV
Findings/Analysis of Data
The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand the perceptions and
experiences relating to information literacy threshold concepts of lower-level
undergraduate students enrolled in an associate degree program at a Texas college. This
chapter discusses the transformative milestones in information literacy identified by
student participants. It also discusses those areas that students identified as areas
involving information literacy where they are currently experiencing challenges. It
discusses student experiences associated with understanding and internalizing
transformative milestones in information literacy. It also compares the transformative
experiences identified by students with the threshold concepts in the ACRL Framework.
It then discusses the outcome space for each of the ACRL frames as these are perceived
or experienced by the participants. For purposes of this study, participants were assigned
aliases to preserve their anonymity.
Research Question One: Perceptions of Information Literacy Milestones
The first research question explored what students consider as the transformative
milestones in their experience of learning information literacy. Each participant was
asked to think about a time when they completed a research paper for a college course,
received a good grade for the assignment, and learned something because of the project.
The participant was then asked to identify some of the actions they took or attitudes they
assumed in planning, researching, and writing the paper that they think helped them be
effective. Three follow-up questions were asked relating to the practices and attitudes
identified by the participant to determine whether these align with key characteristics of

Campos 51

threshold concepts (Land, 2016; Meyer & Land, 2006): first, whether the participant
experienced an “aha” moment in learning any of the practices or attitudes identified so
that the learning of it was a turning point or milestone in the development of their ability
to do research or work with information; second, the participant was asked whether with
respect to any of the practices or attitudes identified, once they learned these, as with
riding a bike, which generally is not unlearned, they were changed in the way they
approach information; and third, the participant was asked whether with respect to any of
the practices or attitudes they identified, once they learned it, it helped them make sense
of information. In almost every instance, one or all of the practices and attitudes
identified by each participant was deemed by the participant as aligning with these key
characteristics of threshold concepts. Transformational milestone practices and attitudes
identified by participants revolved around attitudes of empowerment, the notion of
authority, consulting with others, aspects of searching, synthesis, and time-management.
Attitudes of empowerment. Several participants identified attitudes that they felt
were important to being effective in researching and writing papers. These revolved
around self-confidence, interest, and persistence. An attitude of self-confidence in the
form of a “can-do” attitude, was identified as a milestone in developing informational
literacy by Bill, who stated
So, I believe you have to have a “can do” attitude. I’m a science major and with
the course structure, you have to take some courses that are outside the realm of
science and math. I don’t believe we are limited in resources. I believe further if
you open up the opportunities to always be able to expand to different levels, so
I’ve always been open minded. There are certain times you feel limited and

Campos 52

think, “This is difficult, I can’t do it.” So I always kind of give myself an open
thought that “Hey, this is a possibility you can do this.”
Later, Bill added, “It has become second nature and if you say research paper, it doesn’t
scare me anymore. I feel like I have the tools to do it already.” Nora’s reflections
suggested that she might be on the preliminary stages of developing a “can-do” attitude
as she described a feeling of intimidation when doing print research in a library. She
stated,
I think with the research, it’s just the physical. Coming in, I get, how do you say
it, intimidated by walking into a library and not knowing exactly where to go, or
the books, or how to pull up where exactly to go for the research versus online,
where you just punch it in and it starts filtering all that for you. When I’ve come
to use the library when I first started to research, I’ve always went to the help
desk to help me get books all the time. So, that was the only thing that I felt
intimidated to do it on my own.
Tomas identified the attitude of not becoming stressed as important in becoming effective
in researching and writing research papers. He shared, “I would say, not being stressed
out” and added, “Finding the right information can be stressful,” but that for him “taking
some time off the paper and then jumping right back to it” helps.
Some participants observed that having a personal interest in the research topic
has helped them be effective in researching and writing papers. Tina stated,
It would have to be the topic. She provided some topics, but she allowed us to be
more open. She just wanted to provide us with new ideas. And I chose really odd
topics like agriculture, slaughterhouses, other stuff. And since it was a topic I

Campos 53

found interesting, it was easy to find research. I had been talking about that topic
in previous classes, so I was informed about the process. So choosing a topic that
students can somewhat relate to or have previous knowledge.
Lydia spoke of difficulties associated with writing on something about which she had
little interest. She shared, “so that’s why research papers are always a little bit harder,
cause you’ve got to like get into it, for it to make sense to you and mean something to
you.”
Persistence also surfaced as an important attitude that enabled participants to
become effective in researching and working with information. Ben, for example,
indicated that a challenging aspect of research is that you have to work through dead ends
in the initial phase of searching. He observed,
The information searching process is very difficult because there are some times
when you’ll be looking for what you’re researching on and it looks like it’s what
you would do your research on, but comes out to something vague or obscure and
it looks like it wouldn’t be relevant at all. The sense in which this has helped me
is that it’s helped me kind of root out stuff like that...In my searching process, I go
through all possibilities and if it turns out to be a dead end then I know it’s not
something that I want to go through, so I root that one out and just continue on.
Ben recognized that dead ends are a normal part of research and should not become a
source of frustration. Laura responded to the example of persistence as an attitude that
might contribute to effective research by stating,
Oh, yeah. For sure that. I think that I know that if I put “social work” and “health
care” I know that the first thing that appears is not going to be it, so I need to

Campos 54

change words, yeah... I think that would be it maybe. That I would like not give
up by the first ten times and I will do it again and again and again and I will
change words.
In summary, six participants identified, attitudes of empowerment including selfconfidence, personal interest, and persistence as important in being able to research and
write papers effectively.
Authority. Another theme that surfaced when participants were asked about a
practice they felt enabled them to be effective in researching and writing papers, was the
notion of authority. When asked about whether she had experienced an “aha” moment in
relation to learning a research practice, Tina shared,
When I first started writing the papers, I didn’t know what kind of references she
wanted, so I went off any website or whatever I had learned. As she went and she
noticed that everyone was making that kind of mistake, she explained that we
needed actual professional sources, so she taught us how to actually go online and
find sources that are reliable and so she taught us the JSTOR, the online STC
library, and that actually helped us a lot.
Tina later added that authority for her was situational, depending on whether the research
is for personal use or part of an academic assignment. She stated,
I would say that I have learned how to do it the proper way, but easily I would
probably still do go to my old habits... Using Wikipedia any simple website that
comes up... But when it comes to a professional paper that is an actual grade, I am
more experienced towards knowing what I need to do.

Tomas pointed to the importance to effective research of, “getting like a reputable site
that gives me the information.” Bill spoke of the importance of using “reliable sources.”
He stated,
Even though I enjoy a lot the news and I get most of my information at home, the
professor makes it so that part of your information has to come from the school
resources. So you have to combine the television media, cable media, so with my
knowledge bank, even though I have the information, I still have to find a reliable
source... you should be able to get educational references instead of the cable
sources, which can be contradicted by anyone else.
These three participants identified the ability to select reliable or reputable sources as an
important personal milestone in becoming more proficient researchers. They each came
to the conclusion that not all sources have the same level of credibility. Tina also
recognized that what is considered authoritative can vary with the situation.
Consultation. Another transformative milestone practice identified by a couple of
participants as helping them be effective at researching and writing papers was
consultation either by following the guidance of the instructor or a library staff member.
Tina shared of following the guidance of her instructor,
We just followed her plan and she wanted to see everything beforehand and then
as the process continued she would tell you what you did wrong, what needs to be
corrected, if you are using the correct APA format so that you could go back and
fix everything. As you learned, in her next paper she would increase the intensity
so that as you went along, your papers would get better, more professional in a
way.

Campos 56

Also speaking of the practice of consulting with the instructor to be clear on the
requirements of a research paper, Larry stated, “I’d say it was kind of like an “aha”
moment after I experienced where I was wrong and where I was right. And what helped
me the most was talking to my teacher because I guess I sort of base it to what the teacher
says is good because she’s the one grading it.” Nora, who shared that she felt intimidated
by doing research in the physical library, shared, “when I’ve come to use the library
when I first started to research, I’ve always went to the help desk to help me get books all
the time.” Laura shared that for her the practice of consulting model papers shared by her
instructor has been important to researching and writing successfully. She shared, “I will
look to other examples. Not copying papers, but looking to samples... like so I can
accommodate and fit the information a certain way... That’s something that I have done
and it has helped me.” Four of the participants pointed to consulting as a useful practice
that they have adopted.
Searching. Various aspects of the information searching process were identified
as transformative milestones in becoming proficient in researching and writing papers.
Larry pointed to the importance of searching for relevant sources that support the thesis
of the paper. He said, “It would have to be making sure these sources have something to
do with what I want to say. Make sure this is my side that I’m dealing with... I’m getting
better at it, I suppose. Sort of manipulating what they say.” He discussed the challenge of
using the right search terms to elicit the best sources. Speaking of his last successful
paper, he shared, “I couldn’t find the right terms to search for a good source that had to
do with what I wanted to say.” Asked if there was anything he was still struggling with
involving research Larry responded:

Campos 57

On the research side, no—No, other than the fact that you have to get sort of
specific, like with the online library you have to type dashes. I don’t remember
how they taught me anymore, cause it’s kind of a hard concept. If I type it again it
would be very weird because, like I said, you have to be very specific of the kind
of source you want because it will give you all sorts of like articles.
Ben recognized that it is important to identify a central focus of research in any research
paper assignment. He emphasized the importance of keeping the focus of the paper in
mind. He said,
It was really trying to center on the objective of the paper, like getting the main
points in all of it--just trying to pinpoint all the main aspects of what the paper
was supposed to be written on and coordinated in a way that was effective while I
was writing it, so nothing would seem out of place. I was trying to maintain the
focus of the paper.
Ben later shared that it can be difficult in the early stages of writing a paper to settle on a
central focus. Noting that the abundance of information available at the start of a research
project, he added,
It’s really when you first try to find the main focus of the paper because there is a
lot of information and there is a lot that you can base off for the focus of your
paper that it’s like “This is too much. What can I write about?” And then
eventually, you get to single out the strong points of what your searching into to
make for the strong point of the paper.
Juan also identified narrowing the topic as an important practice that has helped him
research and write more effectively. He shared,

Campos 58

A good example would be in English I. We were given topics and I picked the
one on global warming... So, I broke all the sources down like what contributes to
global warming—human activity, obviously. I broke it down into what we do,
what nature does. Like as a bone map. I broke it down, cause global warming is
just broad term, and I needed to solidify it into a single [topic].
Like Ben, and Juan, Laura identified narrowing a topic as important to effective research.
She shared, “I think another thing that just came to my head, to narrow topics, like really
narrowing.” She also identified the practice of skimming through sources as valuable to
effective research. She shared, “Well I think that one of the things that has most helped
me doing research is the SQ3R Method... It’s like not really reading the articles, but
skipping.”
Several participants identified the use of electronic search tools as a key practice
for effective research. Bill for example shared,
So during those papers I wrote a number of them and my views I would say are
more liberal, so I was excited and motivated to take more information and I was
amazed about how much information I could find in the school resources to back
up my claims. There were some of the things I have heard of in the media but I
did not know the sources but when I came here, I was able to find the source to be
able to back up my view.
When asked if he was referring to the databases he said, “Databases, that one. So it was
very helpful and I believe the least grade I got on any of the four or five essays I did was
an A-.”

Campos 59

Similarly, Carla spoke of brainstorming and using the college’s database search platform,
Discovery Search, which she said has helped her a lot. She stated,
Like I think it’s better because I usually just like Googled stuff and I don’t know
if everything on Google is like true, and with Discovery, everything is like right.
Like nothing is false or anything like that. With Google, I would put information
into a research paper and I could not show that it was true, but if I put in an
article, I can say look it says so here. You can show proof.
Carlos identified learning about the research database JSTOR as a real turning point in
improving his research effectiveness. He stated, “If there was an “aha” moment, I would
say it’s, when it comes to the research, I would say it’s finding JSTOR.” In noting that he
would not be likely to return to his old practices, Carlos shared,
Oh yeah-definitely. I’m not resorting to Google or any other search engines for
articles. I can find everything I need right there besides the books themselves... I
don’t trust the internet as much and I know JSTOR, yeah is internet-related,
you’re searching a lot of things, but have sources. I’ve got names. I have
information. It’s not just some guy’s blog.
Likewise, Nora identified the use of research databases as pivotal to developing
proficiency in research. She shared,
I think it was the online resources... Yes, because I had done papers already
before with no knowledge of even how to go about in the library and I didn’t want
to ask. But then when I took English II, that’s when we got the orientation here at
the library and I thought I wish this had been part of the initial orientation when
we first come to the school. I think that would have been a lot more useful and

Campos 60

helpful in the previous papers that I have written, because I would have
thoroughly understood how the online research tool helps us. I wouldn’t have
wasted so much time manually doing so much of the work. So after I dealt with
the orientation, then I thought that I was much more prepared to do the second
paper or the third paper, whatever it was because I knew where to go to look for it
online on my own time; it could be one or two o’clock in the morning or, if I
wanted to, on the weekends. I wasn’t constrained to coming to the library and felt
pressured because I had to get out of here before the library closed. And on the
online, I felt it much better because it was a broader selection of things I could
look for. I could save them. I was able to print out only those areas that I needed
to reference it. I loved that it would do the citations for me. I didn’t have to worry
if I had them in the correct form or not the correct form, just had to proof read it
and make sure all the writing was correct. So, I thought because of that particular
tool I provided a better outcome as far as my paper was concerned. And, it did
reflect on my grade. Even though the other ones were good, with this one I felt
confident in turning it in. I wasn’t like “Oh my God, what am I gonna get.” I
thought “I know I’m gonna get a good grade,” because I felt a lot better.
In short, aspects of searching were the most common practices among those identified as
transformative milestones with four participants discussing aspects of narrowing and
focusing on a topic and eight pointing to some aspect of working with electronic
searching tools.
Synthesis. Carlos identified the ability to bring together different points of view
and develop his own perspective as important to being able to research and write

Campos 61

effective papers. In describing a research paper he wrote on the myth of Sisyphus, he
shared,
Reading it repeatedly for one. Reading the myth of Sisyphus, that is, repeatedly.
Reading other interpretations that others might have about it. JSTOR helps out
sometimes. Sometimes I’ll browse a website called Quora. Again, that’s just other
people’s analysis of it. Sometimes I’m a little, I don’t like to take other peoples’
ideas. But if there’s something that I just never would have thought of on my
own. I’ll try to take what they’ve got and put into my own words...Elaborate on
the idea itself. Like, OK, here’s a good idea. I know where this person is headed
with this. Let me put my own spin on it then I can elaborate and put my own
personal take on what is being said.
Carlos was the only participant who identified synthesis as important to effective research
and writing. He described how he collects material from various resources , puts this
material into his own words, and elaborates on key ideas. Carlos explained that he takes
what he has synthesized and adds his own perspective on the topic.
Time management. Four participants identified time management as a practice
or attitude they have adopted which has enabled them to research and write papers
effectively. Lydia shared,
Well the attitude that I can tell you that I lost in college was to do my papers
towards the end when it’s already going to be due. Because with the research, you
need to put time in it, so the attitude that I did take was to put more time, like my
time management. Put time for research and then put time for the actual paper,

Campos 62

instead of trying to do it all at once and just cramming it and not being able to do
everything right.
Sharing a similar view, Larry stated, “I always base myself on the fact that no matter
what, I’ll have it done. Cause I never like being ‘Ah I didn’t have time’ or turning it in
late. I always get it done on time.” Bill elaborated on setting goals and organizing his
research into manageable blocks. He said,
I believe my advance preparation for research has helped, so when research is
given, I take the timeline into consideration. I come to the library almost
religiously. And, if I have class I’ll to research in the library to do a portion of it. I
spread out the research paper. Usually, I set an objective. I set goals and
objectives in a way to try to make them manageable and achievable with my
timeline in place.
Juan also explained that to him it is important to plan his research out well in advance so
he does not experience too much stress in the process. He shared,
I actually start, like I had, a month and a half to prepare, so the thing I did is if
you try to do everything in one time, that’s going to be stressful. If you’re taking a
class, that’s going to be stressful too. So what I do, is every day I read—like it
doesn’t have to be a 20-page long article—I have read little summaries of what
contributes to global warming as the example, or like I narrowed it down to a
specific topic, I see what caused it, what are the effects, what causes the ozone to
disintegrate and I take it little by little cause I have in the past gathered so many
research sources that it stressed me and overwhelmed me. Like I had so much to
read, cause I printed it all at the same time, so it stressed me knowing that If I

Campos 63

have all of them, and if I read one, but knowing that I have more to read, that
stresses me. So I took it slowly, one at a time. I didn’t go overboard.
As seen in the comments from these four participants, they considered being able to
manage their research over time was an important developmental milestone in being able
to research and write effective research papers.
Research Question Two: Understanding and Internalizing Transformative
Milestones
Each participant was asked to describe their experience from not knowing about
the practices and attitudes they had identified as transformative milestones in information
literacy to having these become a regular part of doing research. They were also asked to
estimate how long it took for these practices and attitudes to sink in or become a part of
the way they do or understand research.
For several participants the process of understanding and internalizing the
transformative milestones they identified was marked by the experience of moving from
intimidation to self-confidence. Nine participants described a process of moving from a
state of stress or intimidation to a state of self-confidence. Lydia explained,
Well from not knowing, it was super stressful. From learning and adapting to it, it
just took a lot of stress off of me because like it just made the paper easier and
more bearable in being able to do. Not stressed. Of course, I have other things to
do, so I couldn’t put all my focus on that one paper.
Lydia shared that the transition helped ease the stress she initially experienced when
doing research. Learning effective research practices helped Lydia become more efficient

Campos 64

in writing papers while doing her other assignments. She indicated that this transition
took her a full semester. Tomas shared,
When you know you’re going to do a research paper and you don’t know about
these practices you experience it as an overwhelming task. Once you know those
practices you take on another attitude towards the paper you know that you can
prepare well for the paper and do the research.
According to Tomas, it took him two semesters to internalize the research practices he
identified. Larry, who reported that the transition process took about two to three
months, also spoke of a process of becoming confident after consulting with his
instructor. He shared,
It happened cause I guess I wasn’t confident. Yeah, so I’m like “I need help.” I’m
sure no one thinks, “my essay is perfect.” So, it was kind of natural that I did that
especially in college, I suppose. I wanted to get a good grade, so I wasn’t going to
say, “Oh, my paper is perfect the way it is.”
Ben described his transition from not knowing to internalizing the research practices he
identified as milestones in his development as a researcher by highlighting a sudden
change in perspective. He explained,
The way I can describe it as kind of like a moment of clarity, like it kind of clicks
to you that your just like “This is so frustrating, I don’t know how it’s gonna be
done” to where just gradually you’re just like “I’m starting to get it now”. It’s like
there was a time when I wouldn’t have known this and now I do. And, it seems so
easier now.

Campos 65

Even though he described the transition as a moment of clarity where things just clicked,
Ben shared that getting there took some time. Ben reported that for him the transition
took about two semesters. He shared,
So about like a full two semesters, but it was gradual. By the end of Composition,
it was like that first turning point thing where it’s like “I need to get into this
mindset” and by the middle of Rhetoric it’s like, “I’ve got this down. In the
beginning of Composition, I couldn’t get it through my head, by the end of
Composition it was like “I need to change my tactic here,” and by the middle of
Rhetoric I was like “OK, this is starting to click for me”.
Bill also described beginning from a position of being daunted to developing greater
confidence in a little over a semester. He shared,
The transition wasn’t swift. It was gradual and it required a lot of thinking and
practice...It also requires a lot of challenging yourself; in terms of believing you
can do it even though sometimes it seems very daunting. But, the result has been
amazing and to me it’s been a wow moment in the sense that it kind of changed
my view about writing papers. I know how it feels when other students complain
“I don’t like writing” or maybe they hear a paper is eight pages or a four-page
essay and they complain, “how am I going to do that?” I don’t have that kind of
feeling anymore. I feel I will be able to do it if I set my mind to it, cause I have
these kind of resources and a process that works for me. So I think that in the
initial stages there was this kind of doubting process but then with time the
transition from there is gradual, it takes time to build up. And once you build it
up, it becomes repetitive. I mean it’s just there for you to use it throughout. And

Campos 66

so far I think it’s helped me throughout every project I’ve done. I wouldn’t say
it’s been a smooth drive, but it’s been an enjoyable one and it’s been a worthwhile
one.
Carlos described being pushed out of his comfort zone by instructors who required
articles from a reliable source. He explained,
Because a lot of the papers I’ve had to write-I’m sure any other student that’s
been through English I will tell you-the teachers will ask you to write and cite
your sources. But there has to be books as well as articles. That’s when I initially
got into JSTOR and eventually I started finding “Hey, a lot of the stuff is really
good.” Like, I could probably use this for something else. And sure enough, after
enough papers it just kind of became second nature. Hey, there’s JSTOR. Or even
if I’m working on something for something unrelated for a different class, “I’ve
got JSTOR.”
Carlos added that the process of internalizing the practice of using library database
articles for his research took about three months. He said, “it probably took about three
months to really get into it cause we weren’t writing so many papers that we were
required to do constant research, but every couple of weeks or so.”
Juan shared that form him the process had to happen quickly because of the
expectations conveyed by his instructor. He described having to learn a new style manual
different from the one he used in high school. He said,
I had to evolve quickly... When I did my first English class, I did not know how to
do APA. I was struggling; I was upset with my high school. How come we
weren’t taught that? Cause we were all trained in MLA. When we were required

Campos 67

to do APA it as academic shock, because the construction for MLA is so different
from APA and the funny thing is, I had a month to figure out how to do APA
cause a lot of people are busy and a simple article in a website on showing you
how to do APA is not going to do it, so I had to really study how to do APA
correctly, because it’s a different format... It was academic shock. I had to forget
all I knew about MLA. Really, like everything and then start from scratch...
There’s just so much.
Juan stated that it took him about two semesters to internalize APA citation and this
occurred over the course of several papers after he made a decision to learn it. He stated,
After my second semester, which was in the spring. When I was in the spring
semester, I was given multiple essays for English II, so it was a good practice
cause we had four major essays. The first one I struggled with because I was still
new at it, the second one got a little better, the third I was grasping more, and by
the fourth I was already doing better, way better than I was from the beginning. It
depends because that class gave me a lot of chances because I was given a lot of
essays, so I had to force myself to improve, because I couldn’t just waste my time
and say “Oh, it’s going to be a first essay, so why don’t I just do it the normal
way?” I had to force myself to do it in that format, because in college, I’m
assuming the majority is APA, and if I don’t learn it now, I’m going struggle in
the future if I don’t learn it.
Nora, who was introduced to the research databases at a library instruction session, stated
that for her the transition was immediate and said of the transition experience,

Campos 68

It was a world of difference because before it was just relying on someone else to
tell me. “I’m doing a research paper; this is what it’s about; where do I find the
books?” So it was their knowledge of whatever it was in saying “Here are the
books,” or “We have one at Tech, we have one at Nursing, we’ll get them” versus
going online where it’s just a wealth of information. I can choose and pick. I have
a better variety of choosing and picking what I want.
As the experiences above suggest, the predominant experience among the participants
was a transition from initial intimidation or lack confidence to an increased selfconfidence in researching and writing papers.
Research Question Three: Facilitating the Internalization of Transformative
Milestones
Participants were asked to reflect on what they think might have helped them
more readily internalize the transformative milestones they identified. Most participants
identified some aspect of instruction, others identified practice, and one pointed to visual
notation. Two participants did not know of anything that might have helped them
internalize the practices and attitudes they identified as transformative milestones in
becoming more proficient researchers.
Instruction. Four participants identified some aspect of instruction as a possible
aid in navigating the transformative milestones in information literacy that they
identified. Reflecting on her experience enrolled in a college program as a dual credit
student, Tina spoke of what she perceived as a benefit of having instructors early on with
strict expectations. Her transformative milestone was following a method for doing
information research. She shared,

Campos 69

When teachers are intimidating and when they don’t give you breaks, like they’re
strict, that’s when you learn the most, because when they’re lenient and they’re
more of a friend it’s kind of like you’re more laid back, you can skip deadlines
and turn things in late. When a teacher is on you, that’s when you know “I have
to get everything together and turn it in before the deadline and be prepared”,
because if not, it’s going to affect your grade and there is no way that they’re not
going to curve it. When they don’t curve it, that’s when you know that you need
to really get serious and work harder.
Bill for whom identifying reliable resources in his research projects was a transformative
milestones in his development and who viewed citation as a current struggle in his
research development, suggested “probably more subject-matter experts ” available to
him for consultation near where he studied would have helped in his internalization of
effective practices and skills.
Juan, who had discussed the effectiveness for him of mapping and narrowing a
topic and organizing his research into manageable segments, shared that citation
continued to be a struggle and suggested that earlier instruction in this area would have
helped in the development of his research skills. He stated,
Every instructor is different. I think the instructor just gave it to us, when I first
began, the APA, and it was just given--like you were expected to know it and
which I didn’t know. So it would have been better if it were explained, “if you
know MLA, for this class we do APA, which is a different format.” Like the
introduction to like a new language, an introduction to the APA format. We
should have been given a heads up... Yes, cause in high school we didn’t even

Campos 70

know what APA was. All we knew was MLA, which was standard for high
school students to learn, so it was just a different thing.
Carla for whom learning how to use the college’s discovery search platform to
search through the library’s research databases was in her view a key practice that helped
her be successful in researching and writing papers, felt that having received an
orientation on Discovery Search early on aided in internalizing the practice or using the
discovery platform. She shared, “Yeah, the first week we had library orientation.” She
later added, “when I came to the library, they were like first search the keyword, and
that’s where I got it, from the orientation.” Nora also identified the ability to do research
using the library’s research databases as a transformative milestone in becoming more
proficient in researching and writing papers. However, Nora was not introduced to these
resources until later in her college experience. She shared,
Having it part of our orientation. If it was like an orientation that is mandatory for
us to come in as new students. If we get that orientation that’s giving information,
I wish that they would do a library orientation where students to have to attend
one also as well. You know give them a period of time where you say, “You have
to complete it by this date.” I think that’s where you might have a lot of students
who are not successful maybe in their remedial classes because they just don’t
know how to navigate, or get the information, and don’t want to ask. But if it’s
part of the orientation package at the beginning, I think it will save a lot of time
for everybody.
Practice. A couple of participants identified practice doing research as something
that would have aided them in internalizing the practices and attitudes of effective

Campos 71

research that had been transformative milestones for them. Tomas who had spoken of the
benefit to him of learning how to identify reputable sources and of taking steps not to
become stressed shared that practice doing research might have helped in internalizing
these transformative milestones. He said, “Taking courses that require you to write
research papers a lot earlier. That way you go through the experience a lot faster and you
develop a better sense of how to write research papers.” Speaking of when he learned to
look for reputable sources, he shared, “when they required you to have reputable sources,
that’s when it happened.”
Laura, for whom skimming through resources, narrowing her topic, and
persistence were important for researching and writing effective papers, also suggested
practice in research as a possible aide in integrating these practices and attitudes. She
shared,
Maybe taking more courses on it... More courses that require research...
Specifically on the research process... Because we have classes on grammar and
English and stuff and then they put like research, but they do not go deep into like
this is research or this is composition like really that deep as I would like it to be.
So maybe that’s something.
Visual notation. Ben, who described finding the main focus of a research paper
as a key research practice for him, shared that he thinks that if he had employed visual
notation earlier this might have helped him internalize this practice. He said,
I’m more of a visual learner, so probably if I had delved more into the notation
and stuff because I’m a little bit of a visual learner. Seeing words kind of takes a
little bit more to click with me than actually seeing it worked out.

Campos 72

Research Question Four: Milestones Identified by Students and the ACRL Frames
The fourth research question that this study sought to explore was how the
practices and attitudes associated with information proficiency by participating students
compare to the threshold concepts identified in the ACRL Framework (ACRL, 2015).
Several of the transformative milestones identified by the participants form part of the
ACRL frames. These included various attitudes, authority, consultation, searching, and
synthesis. Time management, which was important to some participants, is not a
prominent of explicit concept or practice within the ACRL Framework. Figure 1 below
summarizes the relationships identified between the transformative milestones
participants identified and the ACRL frames:

Figure1 Relation between Transformative Milestones and ACRL Framework.
Transformative milestones identified by participants are depicted in lower case
green lettering. ACRL Framework concepts are depicted with upper case first
letters and purple lettering.

Campos 73

Searching. Students identified various aspects of searching among their milestone
practices. These search practices aligned with novice or basic level practices associated
with the ACRL frame searching as strategic exploration. Four participants discussed
aspects of narrowing and focusing on a topic and eight pointed to some aspect of working
with electronic searching tools as practices that they considered important developmental
milestones in being able to research and write effective papers.
The “Research as Inquiry” frame aligns with the practices of narrowing and
focusing on a research topic. The “Research as Inquiry” frame generally provides that,
Research is iterative and depends upon asking increasingly complex or new
questions whose answers in turn develop additional questions or lines of inquiry
in any field (ACRL, 2015, p. 8).
The “Research as Inquiry” frame lists the following among the abilities associated with
this frame:
x

Formulate questions for research based on information gaps or on reexamination
of existing, possibly conflicting information

x

Determine an appropriate scope of investigation

x

Deal with complex research by breaking complex questions into simple ones,
limiting the scope of investigations (ACRL, 2015, pp. 8-9)
The “Searching as Strategic Exploration” frame aligns with these practices. This

frame generally provides that,
Searching for information is often nonlinear and iterative, requiring the evaluation
of a range of information sources and the mental flexibility to pursue alternate
avenues as new understanding develops (ACRL, 2015, p. 10).

Campos 74

Among the knowledge practices encompassed by the “Searching as Strategic
Exploration” frame is the ability to “determine the initial scope of the task required to
meet their information needs” (ACRL, 2015, p. 11). This aligns with the practices of
narrowing and focusing on a research topic identified by some of the participants.
The “Searching as Strategic Exploration” frame also lists among its knowledge
practices the ability to “understand how information systems (i.e., collections of recorded
information) are organized to access relevant information” (ACRL, 2015, p. 11). This
ability aligns with the practices identified by participants as relating to the use of search
tools.
Authority. Students also identified aspects of authority as key milestones in
becoming more proficient at researching and writing papers. These practices align with
the ACRL frame “Authority is Constructed and Contextual,” albeit the notions of
authority identified by participants were fairly basic conceptions of this frame.
Participants who identified authority as a transformative milestone spoke of learning to
use reliable or reputable sources for research. The “Authority is Constructed and
Contextual” frame generally provides,
Information resources reflect their creators’ expertise and credibility, and are
evaluated based on information need and context in which the information will be
used. Authority is constructed in that various communities may recognize
different types of authority. It is contextual in that the information need may help
to determine the level of authority required (ACRL, 2015, p. 4).
Some of the learning practices associated with the “Authority is Constructed and
Contextual” frame include the following:

Campos 75

x

Define different types of authority, such as subject expertise (e.g., scholarship),
societal position (e.g., public office or title), or special experience (e.g.,
participating in a historic event).

x

Use research tools and indicators of authority to determine the credibility of
sources, understanding the elements that might temper this credibility.

x

Understand that many disciplines have acknowledged authorities in the sense of
well-known scholars and publications that are widely considered “standard.” Even
in those situations, some scholars would challenge the authority of those sources.

The practices of looking for reliable and reputable resources align with some of the basic
level practices listed here that relate to the “Authority is Constructed and Contextual”
frame.
Consultation. Consultation was a practice identified by students that while not a
top level ACRL frame is identified as a practice in the “Research as Inquiry” and the
“Searching as Strategic Exploration” frames. The two types of consultation identified as
important in the development of the ability to research and write effective papers
included consulting with the instructor to understand requirements and expectations and
consulting with a librarian for assistance and guidance in the research process.
The “Research as Inquiry” frame includes among its dispositions the ability to
“seek appropriate help when needed (ACRL, 2015, p. 9).” Similarly, the “Searching as
Strategic Exploration” frame lists among its dispositions the ability to “seek guidance
from experts, such as librarians, researchers, and professionals (ACRL, 2015, p. 11).
Attitudes. Some of the attitudes identified by participants are elements of certain
ACRL frames. Six participants identified, attitudes of empowerment including self-

Campos 76

confidence, personal interest, and persistence as important in being able to research and
write papers effectively. Some participants identified how important having a personal
interest in the research topic was to their effectiveness in researching and writing papers.
The “Research as Inquiry” frame states that a disposition associated with becoming
information literate is the ability to “value intellectual curiosity in developing questions
and learning new investigative methods” (ACRL, 2015, p. 9). This disposition is aligned
with the personal interest identified by some participants.
Persistence appears among the dispositions associated with the “Research as
Inquiry” frame and the “Searching as Strategic Exploration” frame. The “Research as
Inquiry” frame lists the following among its associated dispositions: “Value persistence,
adaptability, and flexibility and recognize that ambiguity can benefit the research
process” (ACRL, 2015, p. 9). The “Searching as Strategic Exploration” frame states that
learners who are becoming information literate “understand that first attempts at
searching do not always produce adequate results” (ACRL, 2015, p. 11). It also states that
such learners “persist in the face of search challenges, and know when enough
information completes the information task” (ACRL, 2015, p. 11).
Time management. Time management was an important practice identified by
some participants as something they had learned over time that helped them be more
effective in researching and writing papers. Time management is not among the ACRL
frames nor is it an explicit component of any of the frames. The closest alignment to an
ACRL frame is the ability to “manage searching processes and results” listed as a
learning practice under the “Search as Exploration” frame (ACRL, 2015, p. 11).

Research Question Five: Student Experiences and Perceptions of ACRL Frames
In the course of each interview, after exploring what the participant considered as
transformative milestones in becoming effective at researching and writing papers, the
focus turned to reviewing the ACRL frames to determine how the participants
experienced and understood each of these frames. Preliminary categories of description
were generated for each of the ACRL frames from an analysis of the interview
transcripts. These categories were then organized into logical relationships, known as the
outcome space in phenomenographic analysis (Smith & Hepworth, 2012). The resulting
interrelated categories describe the ways in which each ACRL frame was understood
collectively by participants based on the perceptions and experiences each shared.
Excerpts from the interviews are provided to illustrate the outcome space categories.
“Authority is Constructed and Contextual” frame. Authority was perceived as
reputable or reliable information, verifiable information, providing more information, and
as relevant information. Most participants recognized authority as varying with the
context.
Reputable. Several participants associated authority with being reputable. Tomas
(participant 27) described the importance to research of “getting like a reputable site that
gives me the information.” He elaborated on his idea of a reputable site by providing an
example:
P27:

Using educational websites, those are a higher authority.

I:

By educational websites, you mean what?

P27:

Those ending with “e-d-u”.

I:

I see like the “e-d-u” sources. OK.

Campos 78

P27:

Yes.

Similarly, Bill (participant 57) shared that even though he is exposed to information from
several sources, not all of this information meets the standard established by his
professor. Bill described having to provide reliable information from school resources:
P57:

It depends specifically on the paper. I love writing essays, so the one I

remember the most about was last semester in Rhetoric class, where we did a lot
of politics. Even though I enjoy a lot the news and I get most of my information at
home, the professor makes it so that part of your information has to come from
the school resources. So you have to combine the television media, cable media:
so with my knowledge bank, even though I have the information, I still have to
find a reliable source.
I:

Reliable sources.

P57:

Reliable sources, so you have to use Jagnet [research database sources?]

and you should be able to get educational references instead of the cable sources,
which can be contradicted by anyone else.
Carlos shared that he associates authority with people. He shared, “every time I think of
authority, I don’t think about research. I think about people.” This notion seems to align
with the notion of authority as information coming from a reputable person or expert.
Nora (participant 71) shared her notion of authority as a reputable source in the following
exchange:
P71:

No, not all sources are the same, because obviously you want a reputable

source.
I:

OK. That’s where I’m going.

Campos 79

P71:

Yeah. Like the New York Times, if you’re looking for articles or anything

like that you’re looking for the New York Times. You’re looking for notable and
reputable sources versus like Wikipedia and people that you just don’t know-smaller publications.
I:

So taking that as an authority. An authoritative source is a reputable

source, how do you understand a reputable source. What makes a reputable
source?
P71:

A reputable source for me would be an organization that has been around

for some time that has produced or published articles or journals or written
information that has not so much not been questioned, but have more truth in it.
Laura spoke of how she transitioned from relying on search engines for all of her
research to learning how to use authoritative research databases for her school
assignments. In describing her notion of authority as reliable information, Laura shared,
Something that I have learned recently, is that instructors tell us “Don’t go and do
research on Google, because there is gonna be a lot of stuff that is not reliable
information. So you need to go search for—yes, internet—but encyclopedias and
like STC databases or something like that.” That’s what I have learned in the past
six months. It’s something that I didn’t know. I was like Googling it, because it’s
the easier way. So I have needed to go search encyclopedias, but at STC databases
and that kind of stuff that I didn’t know, which is a new thing for me.
Laura also proposed that information is authoritative if it comes from “people who are
recognized in that area.” Similarly, Tina described a notion of authority associated with
specialization and recognition:

Campos 80

I mean in my personal life, information is automatically correct on the Internet.
But when it comes to schoolwork, I know that the authority comes from whether
the person is educated or has insight in that topic. If it’s information about
education, automatically you would go toward someone with a Ph.D. in
Education, but when it’s in the medical field, I am not going to go with the Ph.D.
in education, I would rather go with the Ph.D. in medicine and trust their
information. Or whatever the topic may be, you just need to know that they know
what they’re talking about rather than having information in a totally different
subject and talking about a topic that doesn’t relate to their specialty.
Verifiable. Another conception of authority that emerged from the interviews was
the notion of authoritative information as being verifiable. Ben (participant 2) shared,
P2:

It comes to mean that it has been proven before, like research. People have

to have like results and stuff like that. Like for any respectable scientist they have
to have a hypothesis, they have to have experimented, and they have to come up
with a result. And someone who says, “Oh no, this doesn’t happen” well maybe
someone who’s done it before will present their results and present what they
found. And that kind of invalidates the impression of the other person.
I:

So your sense of authority is basically...

P2:

Whether it can be proven

I:

So if your source establishes facts that are provable, then that has, as you

see it, more authority than something that wouldn’t.
P2:

Yes. Like if it’s just blind speculation compared to hard evidence it kind

of tips the scale towards that.

Campos 81

Bill explained his view of authority as involving verifiability. He emphasized that for him
a primary source is a strong form of authority. Using history as an example, Bill shared
I always believe in primary resources, cause that’s the main resource. To me I
have a feeling that they have more weight. Maybe it’s my African baggage
because we believe in having it in print something that happened in real life. Print
can be there but if you have some doubt, what’s there to show that this actually
happened—maybe a mountain that has inscriptions on it. We believe that more
than purely someone’s fabrication.
Carla shared the view that a resources that lends itself to verifiability is authoritative. She
shared that learning about research databases was an important milestone in becoming
more proficient as a researcher. Pointing to the verifiability of information found using
the library discovery portal Carla stated,
Like I think it’s better because I usually just like Googled stuff and I don’t know
if everything on Google is like true, and with Discovery, everything is like right.
Like nothing is false or anything like that. With Google, I would put information
into a research paper and I could not show that it was true, but if I put in an
article, I can say look it says so here. You can show proof.
Similarly, Carlos shared a view of authority stemming from verifiability. He
distinguished between the weight of opinion and that of facts derived from research. He
stated,
I would say it has to be summed up, I don’t know, I guess an objective stance on a
particular topic. If there’s something that can be said that is factual, then just,

Campos 82

“Here’s the facts, this is what research says.” Not, “Here’s what I think.” There
are facts to whatever it is you’re researching. I’m sure there are many things.
Laura also associated authority with verifiable information. She described her doubts
about the reliability of information found on the Web. Laura (participant 72) shared that
for her information must come from verifiable source. She said,
P72:

I think it’s really important to go to certified encyclopedias, because like

there’s Wikipedia and those sites that you know are not good una buena fuente [a
good source]
I:

It’s not a reliable source?

P72:

Yes. So it’s really important for me, while doing research to go look for

the las fuentes ques son verificadas [sources that are verified].
I:

Those sources of information that have been verified that are reliable.

P72:

Yeah. Because there have been studies on it

Informative. Some participants perceived authority as relating to whether the
source is informative. Carla (participant 63) shared,
P63:

Using the one that has more information is far better I guess.

I:

Yeah. OK. So, what makes it better? What is your sense of what makes it

authoritative or better? So you have two sources?
P63:

So, it would be like one I really want to talk about and the other one it’s

like not really.
I:

OK. So why would you want to talk about one and not the other like if

they both talk about the same thing? Why would you want to use one over the
other?

Campos 83

P63:

Maybe one has more information. Like it says it better than the other one.

Similarly, Juan (participant 67) shared that he lends more weight to sources that provide
detailed information on a topic. He contrasted these authoritative sources to those that
only provide broad coverage of a topic. He noted,
P67:

It means that certain websites are more factual, and, while others appear

copy and paste. While I was researching global warming, some websites like the
news, CNN, or like science.com appeared it was just general information that like
appeared too standard, not enough detail. It was just too broad. When I went to a
website for global warming, it was this weather website, not weather.com, and it
was more statistics-based, it was more articulate, more structured. If I were to
write an essay and use one of those, I would use the one that had the statistics and
more weight than the one that looks like it’s just an opinion that was just copied
and pasted.
I:

So you find that resources that have like more statistics are weightier and

more authoritative than maybe resources that are just very general and don’t have
specifics.
P67:

Yes. The general ones would be good for reading. Like if you write your

introduction, you may mention that, but after the introduction when you go into
the details of something, that is where you would you use a more weighted type of
authority source.
Relevant. Some participants associated authority with relevance. When asked
about authority, Lydia, shared,

Campos 84

Well, what’s always been hard for me is that I was never able to put like what was
like important information and true information compared to not needed or just
added information. So, it was hard for me to see the main point in the research
paper.
Bill pointed to the relationship between authority and his objectives in discussing how
what is authoritative may vary with the context.
When I’m writing a research paper the alternative might be different because of
my political perspective and usually my ideas might be if I find information
although I know the information may be authoritative and is very useful, because
of my political leanings I see it as baggage and as not having that much weight to
me because then it would disprove my own ideas I’m trying to bring into the
essay. So, those are the things I see as authority but then I will try to advance
from them to use them in my argument against whoever is writing something
against what I am writing. So in a debate in class, I know in your side what you
see as authority in your conservative ideas and then I’ll find a way to go around,
because I’ve read about it. Knowing about it and I do appreciate it’s authoritative
but because it doesn’t advance my views, I’m not going to see it that way.
“Information Creation as a Process” frame. Information creation did not
resonate with four participants. Among the others, three categories emerged around the
concept of information creation. Information is created through studies or empirical
processes; information is formal and reliable or informal and less trustworthy; and there
are levels of information from primary to more removed secondary and tertiary sources.

Campos 85

Empirical. One view of information creation focused on the use of studies and
empirical research. Tina (participant 1) shared
Well wouldn’t that be through like personal experiences like this interview? The
way you’re getting your information is from the actual. Like you’re going out and
getting information yourself rather than just trusting somebody else’s word.
Information lies through studies and experiments.
Tina associated conducting primary research with information creation and used
qualitative methods such as interviews to illustrate how information is created. Along the
same vein, Larry used studies to illustrate how information is created. Larry (participant
28) observed,
P28:

I suppose it was created by studies.

I:

So by studies, you think?

P28:

Usually most of the sources I got are from a study or from a book.

Larry shared that the information he uses in his research is usually derived from studies
or from a book. Carla (participant 63) shared a similar view of the creation of
information. She pointed to scholarly publication as an illustration. Carla said,
P63:

Like how someone writes an article and publishes
it?

I:

Yeah

P63:

They probably like want to write something about
like that topic and they feel strongly about it. And,
they start researching and writing it and publish it.

Campos 86

Formal/Informal. Another view of the creation of information that emerged
contrasted formal to informal information. Tomas (participant 27) for example shared,
P27:

I think it’s created by the schools. I think by a professor or something.

I:

By an authoritative or reputable person? An authoritative person is the one

who creates that information?
P27:

Yes. In contrast to that, the websites where it’s created by just anybody,

like Wikipedia. Yeah that’s.
I:

That would be the contrasting example.

P27:

Yeah.

Tina described a pragmatic approach to using information where the information need
determines how authoritative the source needs to be. In discussing her approach,
however, she conveys some reservations about still using less authoritative sources. Tina
shared the following regarding her use of formal and informal sources of information:
P1:

I would say that I have learned how to do it the proper way, but easily I

would probably still do go to my old habits.
I:

Which are what?

P1:

Using Wikipedia any simple website that comes up.

I:

OK

P1:

But when it comes to a professional paper that is an actual grade, I am

more experienced towards knowing what I need to do.
I:

OK. Alright. So basically, to understand you correctly, when you’re doing

personal research on something you’re curious about, then you’ll use Wikipedia

Campos 87

or whatever, but then if you’re writing a paper that is a professional paper for like
a class then you have learned that “I need to go and use authoritative sources.”
P1:

Yes, cause I don’t want to write a paper on something that might be

wrong.
Primary, secondary, tertiary. A view of information creation was also expressed
distinguishing among primary, secondary, and tertiary types of sources. Bill (participant
57) shared,
P57:

So information creation. Once again, I will go to the source. I would say

there is primary, there is secondary, and tertiary source. It could be in terms of
print, in terms of cable, in terms of Internet. Most of the primary sources could be
in terms of artifacts, real objects, tangible objects. I believe in tangible objects. I
like to go down to the roots and refer to the real sources. Those of the ones I
believe the most. Most tertiary and secondary sources are derived from those
primary sources and in a way become generic. So, that is how I believe how
information is generated. Sometimes I think it is a very strenuous process for
someone to develop that kind of base. Cause then it becomes a whole resource.
Maybe in the future my writing becomes like a Picasso for someone to admire and
get access to it.
I:

So your idea of primary sources would be like artifacts.

P57:

Artifacts

I:

Your secondary source would be like . . .

P57:

Maybe someone is describing this very artifact or maybe a picture of the

same artifact, but to me taking a picture or a copy of it is still not the real item. I

Campos 88

refer to the primary ones as the main, tangible ones, so it could be my birth
certificate; it could be a document that was written by maybe the Queen of
England from the main source, from the source's mouth.
I:

How about your idea of tertiary source?

P57:

It could be like the cable sources. It could become complicated, because

some of them combine primary and tertiary together to develop those kinds of
information.
I:

Yeah. Do you mean like a blog or something like that?

P57:

A blog can be one. Yes.

“Information Has Value” frame. The value of information was perceived in
various ways by the participants. The categories that emerged were inherent value, value
as content, value as evidence, investment value, monetary value, and value depending on
the impact of the information.
Inherent value. One perception of information that emerged is that information is
valuable because it is information. Under this view, more information is better. Tina, for
example, stated “it’s always brains over brawn... Knowledge is always going to overcome
everything.” Lydia shared, “learning more information is always beneficial instead of
non-beneficial.” Carlos observed,
To me personally, sometimes. But that’s only for personal pleasure kind of thing.
If I’m reading something and there’s something I didn’t know but it’s something
that I should have known. You know that initial mind blowing experience when I
read something that is “Oh my God, incredible,” plus it feels good. Besides that, it
has value to me because I’m learning something new. Maybe for somebody else,

Campos 89

it’s just something else or they find something else in the same text that they find
they relate to more. Yeah to me it has value but only for personal reasons.
Juan (participant 67) spoke of the enduring value of information. He described that for
him every research paper is an opportunity to learn something he did not previously
know. Accordingly, he recognized value in information that extends well beyond the
immediate assignment at hand. Juan stated,
P67:

I think it does provide value because information stays with you for like

long periods of time. It’s not just read and just type. It’s more than just work.
We’re still referring to research papers?
I:

Yeah. We’re talking about when you write a research paper you pull

together all kinds of information. Does all that information that you’re working
with does it possess value? Does it carry value?
P67:

For me as an individual it does because knowledge is power. So when I

research for certain research papers, I acquire new things I didn’t know about. It
wasn’t just, I had to read it and write and essay. I actually liked learning about it,
whatever topic I had to write about. And, to this day I still remember what I
understood from those essays and what I didn’t and what I use it for.
Value as content. Information was valuable because it provides content for
papers. Carla posed the question, “If you don’t have information, how are you going to
write something about it?”
Evidentiary value. In a similar vein, some participants highlighted the value of
information as evidence for papers. On whether information has value, Larry shared,

Campos 90

It does cause you’re trying to convince someone and you need to have evidence.
And the more information you get, the more evidence you have. It makes your
paper stronger and it makes you sound like you know what you’re saying instead
of just “this is coming out of my mind” or something.
Ben associated the value of information to its ability to support the point one is trying to
make. According, to this view if information does not convey the point of one’s thesis, it
has no value or place in the paper. Ben stated,
It possesses value if it is able to relay the point you are trying to make to the
person that is reading your research or that you are trying to do research on. It’s
almost like something that’s out of place. If it doesn’t make sense, then there’s
really no place of it being there. Like if it’s just like a run on, people will believe
that it’s just out of place in that sentence.
Bill took up the same position on the value of information. Bill stressed a utilitarian
approach where the value of information is measured by the extent to which it advances
one’s thesis. He shared,
Information possess a lot of value, because I believe in advancing my cause all
the time and without that information being available, I would not be able to
advance my cause. I always believe in showing proof. I’ll tell you something and
I’ll show you proof. So information has always been the source in every case, in
the sense that there is no realism without information. You can say whatever you
want. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry can say whatever they want but to advance
your cause and prove the validity of your case, you need knowledge bank or a
source of information to back it up.

Campos 91

Investment value. Another view of the value of information that emerged from
the interviews focused on what went into its creation. Laura shared,
Yes. It has value because of the amount of effort and time that is invested in doing
it; because of the research and the experiments and stuff, that’s why I think it
really has value. So there’s people doing it, but not everyone is going to do it the
way they do it.
Monetary value. Monetary value also arose as a source of value. Tomas observed,
“I think so. In some instances, to get the right information, you would need to pay for it
as a value.”
Impact value. Information was also valued based on whether it has a positive or
negative impact in the community. Exemplifying this view, Nora shared,
Well I feel that it has value because it depends on who it reaches and how it
would affect us if it’s something that in our own independent lives will change
our health or our goals or our family situation or living conditions, then it’s very
important to us because of that. And the information that’s out there can either
lead us to the right way or to the wrong way. It just depends on us making sure
that we find that balance and know that the information is going to better us rather
than hurt us.
Practical implications of value assessment. In most cases participants recognized
that information also had value to its creator. For some participants recognizing that
information possesses value translated into a justification for citing sources. Carla stated,
“You can’t just like copy someone and not cite it because that’s not giving the writer the
credit. Like that’s not your idea. It’s the writer’s that wrote it.” Juan shared,

Campos 92

Back then I used to be lazy with researching and looking at research papers, but
now I take into consideration that what I’m reading is more than just some paper
that I have to do. It’s like I appreciate it, because of all the information that is
given to me. I appreciate it more because I’m citing it or using that information
for my purpose to write an essay.
Laura (participant 72) raised the same practical implication. She recognized that the value
that information has to a researcher and to the creator of information constitutes a
justification for crediting authors for their intellectual work. She shared this in the
following exchange:
I:

How has it affected the way you work with information?

P72:

It has affected it in the way that if I use that information, they have to get

credit for it.
I:

So you give people credit for that information because it’s valuable to

them because they made it so you give them credit, by citing?
P72:

By citing. That’s another thing that I didn’t do until maybe six months

ago, because I didn’t know how much people do in order to have the research and
the information.
I:

To develop the information.

P72:

Yeah. So I knew, like OK, these people put time and effort and all that

stuff and I’m just gonna copy it. It’s not fair. So, that is why I need to cite stuff.
“Research as Inquiry” frame. Four categories emerged from interview
discussions of research as inquiry: questioning and seeking, finding solutions to
problems, learning, and building on existing knowledge.

Campos 93

Questioning and seeking. Viewing research as a process beginning with
questioning oneself, Bill stated,
I see research as a very thought-provoking process because once, you seek for
information, you doubt yourself, and sometimes you find yourself doubting very
relevant and positive information. But then in the doubting, it gives you the sense
to be able to be very goal oriented, very subject specific, and able to narrow down
your thought process to be able to come to very depth of information that you’re
looking for. So sometimes, it is seen that way, but I have come to realize that the
thinking when I begin doubting myself I begin to narrow down to the very aspect
of the subject matter that I’m looking for.
Finding solutions. Another conception of research that arose focused more on
finding solutions. Exemplifying this view, Nora stated
Well, in a more broader sense, research to me is taking the problem that you have
and then finding out if there is any solutions out there to begin with already
addressing that problem. And then seeing, if there is, how can we better
solutions? Is there something we can do more on the solutions. If there isn’t then
let’s try to figure out a better way to streamline it. Maybe they take four or five
steps to get to the solution. Maybe we can streamline it to get it down to a twostep solution instead of a four-step solution. And so to do that, we would have to
go out into that area that we’re at and see what is it affecting it, those solutions
that are out there or the problem is it economic, is it social, is it culture? What
areas are most affecting it and how can we better it?

Campos 94

Learning. Some participants associated research with learning. Tomas, for,
example, noted that research involves learning about something new and being able to
explain it to someone else who may also need to understand it. He shared,
Oh. It means learning something new. So if it’s a topic you don’t know anything
about, it’s just a challenge to go out and understand it and then interpret it into a
paper maybe to help someone else who may not understand it.
Similarly, Carla took a broad view of research as a practice that is integral to every
subject. She explained that it has been her experience in every course that in order to
learn one has to do research. She stated,
Well like, we have to research stuff for every class. Like every subject, like if you
want to know it, like you have to research it. Like if you have to learn something
about it, you have to research it. Every class, even math, you have to research.
Carlos also associated research with learning. He noted that in the process of research he
learns new things and he also becomes a more proficient researcher. Carlos shared,
It definitely serves its purpose. I guess for every student it’s different, but for me,
it helped me because besides learning new things, I’m also learning how to look
for these things as well. I’m sure some students, they don’t admit it they don’t
care about it. They ask for help from somebody else and somebody else will do it
for them etc. for free. I did a lot, and I’m learning how to use the engines, and I’m
getting the information I need.
Improving on existing knowledge. Research as inquiry was described also as
improving on existing knowledge. Carlos (participant 67) conveyed this approach in his
interview

Campos 95

P67:

It’s a process. It’s not something that you want to rush into. And it’s like

you’re creating something. You’re not just copy and pasting. You’re making
something. You’re actually going to improve what they said to make it better in
your text, in your essay, to make a better understanding for the reader, the
instructor, or whoever reads it.
I:

So it’s a process, you’re kind of building on the existing knowledge by

adding more to it?
P67:

Yes.

“Scholarship as Conversation” frame. Scholarship as conversation did not
resonate with five of the participants. For those who shared a reflection on this frame, it
took more explanation by the interviewer than it did for the other ACRL frames. For
example, the interviewer needed to explain that by scholarship he did not mean money
awarded to students for outstanding academic work. Two categories that emerged in
relation to this frame were instruction and the creation of knowledge.
Instruction. Some participants perceived scholarship as associated with the
teaching activity of instructors. Bill, for instance, shared,
To me I believe that scholastic work is a very strenuous process because not only
are you kind of imparting knowledge, but you are also creating knowledge in the
process. It takes a lot of planning. It takes a lot of skill. You have to be very
specific. You have to be very measurable. And, it has to be achievable and you
have to be time effective. It brings over the sides of motor skills to use. You have
to be all-rounded. I would say “omniverse.” One has to be very advanced in terms
of knowledge, and skill to be able to impart or present it. Cause it’s one thing

Campos 96

knowing the theory, but presentation, having the relevant previous knowledge,
wouldn’t not mean a thing if you don’t know how to go about the skill of
presenting it. And, going through the process of research and everything, all that
comes under one umbrella. I mean research to me itself is just a whole world, so
to combine research in all of the other fields and non-academics including
aesthetics and other things is a daunting task. I see it as a complex but I think it’s
very rewarding. When you get things done and you see that you change minds or
you get students to understand or you impart knowledge or you have a finished a
product in terms of a project or in terms of something that you engineered, then
you get that fulfillment, it’s intrinsically motivating.
Creation of knowledge. Some participants commented on academic scholarship
as the creation of knowledge and some recognized the give and take among scholars as
scholarship as conversation. Juan (participant 67) exemplified this in his comments
P67:

Yes. It’s more professional. It’s not just a normal essay. It’s more

academic.
I:

I have a sense of what you mean. That it’s kind of more formal and maybe

more rigorous.
P67:

It gives you an idea of how upper college levels are going to be like. That

you are gonna have to adapt into that type of, in a sense formality. So it does
provide me a sense of what I’m gonna have to do in the future when I go for my
Bachelor’s and so on.

Campos 97

I:

Does the idea of scholarship of this form, as a conversation resonate with

you? Can you view this or do you see it in any sense as a type of conversation?
People generating these peer-reviewed articles and doing things like that.
P67:

Yes. Because I believe it’s like the work, like the opinion of a certain

subject could be compared or contrasted with another. It’s like you did your
research and then we’re doing ours to see if it connects with ours or if it’s wrong
or if it’s true.
I:

Right, so in that sense, it’s kind of like a conversation among scholars.

P67:

Research papers are not solid. What I mean is, just because it says on a

research paper the way it is, doesn’t mean it’s always going to be true, because
there’s another improved version. There’s always a new work. There is always
research of a certain topic being explained or disproves another one. It’s always
evolving.
Nora described her perception of academic scholarship as involving a specialized and
intensive research in a particular area with a view to solving problems or improving
conditions. She also suggested that dialog among scholars helps them work through
research questions in their discipline. Nora (participant 71) shared,
P71:

When I think of academic scholars, these are people that invest a lot of

time in a particular area to get the most out of it, being that they invest their time,
their effort their energy and try to get the best possible result from that. And that
result being that it will affect the most people in a positive way. So for me
academic scholars are those that write the journals for medical breakthroughs that
in turn will provide the drugs or the new techniques or the new surgeries or

Campos 98

equipment that in turn will give cures, better turn around for patient safety, and
not being down for so long. That’s how I see the scholars--those that spend a lot
of time in a specific area to better that source or that problem to get the best
outcome out of it.
I:

OK. Great. Does the idea of that process as a conversation resonate with

you in any way?
P71:

By conversation do you mean speaking about it?

I:

Or a back and forth.

P71:

Yes.

I:

Yes. Tell me more about how you see that as a conversation—academic

scholarship.
P71:

Well because you will learn a lot more by communicating and talking

about it. Because if you don’t know it maybe somebody else does and they can
give their input, their insight, and the only way that you’re going be able to grasp
more information is by speaking to other people and holding maybe conferences
or forums or video conferences. Whatever, because maybe what I don’t know
here, maybe somebody is dealing with it in India. And, so maybe they have
something and I have the other part of the puzzle without knowing. And so, the
only way we’re gonna know is by communicating and putting two heads together
and getting the outcome that we want.
After being provided with additional background explanation, Laura (participant 72)
expressed a conception of scholarship as conversation involving the back and forth of
information creation.

Campos 99

P72: Scholarship like how?
I:

Scholarship is looking for answers to academic questions by doing

research. And actually, the next part of this question is whether the idea of
scholarship as conversation means anything to you. So, scholars may talk to one
another. Say I write a paper that says all migration is from the south to the north.
And, you may look at that paper as another scholar and say there is also migration
that goes from the north to the south. And then, I’m going to do my own research
and write a paper. And then, you write a paper in response to my paper and so that
is an example of academic scholarship as a conversation.
P72: Ah. OK.
I:

So that is the conversation for academic scholarship. Do you see what I’m

saying?
P72:

Yeah. It’s like Como la gente inteligente. Los maestros ques esciben y se

responden [Like intelligent people, like teachers who write and respond to one
another].
I:

Yeah. Like professors, instructors, people, write and they respond to each

other. Yes, that’s essentially it. I wanted to know if you had any exposure, had
seen, or had been taught about that idea.
P72:

I have an example. I saw a documentary. It’s about how in 2008 the

economy of the U.S.; I don’t know how to say that.
I:

There was a recession?

P72:

Yeah. Companies would hire people to write essays and research papers

to prove that the company was stable. Then, there would be other people that

Campos 100

would read those essays and they would say, “no this is not true.” So, I learned
that through that documentary.
I:

Yes that is kind of a scholarly conversation because someone is doing

research and they’re writing and someone else is finding that they don’t quite
agree and they explain, you know, how the conclusions of the one may not stand
given additional information.
As noted earlier, the concept of scholarship as conversation, did not resonate with many
participants. The exchange with Laura showed that after additional explanation, some
participants were able to formulate their thoughts on the concept.
“Searching as Strategic Exploration” frame. Participants shared a variety of
notions and practices relating to searching. The categories that emerged were narrowing
a topic; developing search terms, reviewing results, and deciding what to use; interacting
with information search tools and resources; and synthesizing information.
Narrowing a topic. Some participants focused on the process of following
through initial leads and narrowing their topic. Ben, for example, described the process of
encountering dead ends and narrowing his topic.
P2:

The information searching process is very difficult because there are some

times when you’ll be looking for what you’re researching on and it looks like it’s
what you would do your research on, but comes out to something vague or
obscure and it looks like it wouldn’t be relevant at all. The sense in which this has
helped me is that it’s helped me kind of root out stuff like that.
I:

So like a dead end. You run into dead ends.

P2:

Yes.

Campos 101

I:

At the beginning.

P2:

Yes.

I:

So, that’s part of the information searching process. You start searching

for information, you run into dead ends, anything else?
P2:

Yes. In my searching process, I go through all possibilities and if it turns

out to be a dead end then I know it’s not something that I want to go through, so I
root that one out and just continue on.
I:

You try another tack

P2:

Yes.

I:

And then what do you do? So you start searching, how do you search?

P2:

If I find too many dead ends, I’ll start narrowing down my search, so if it

goes to something generic, I’ll go to something specific and then to something
even more specific.
I:

So you start narrowing your search question.

P2:

Yes.

I:

So this understanding of the search process that it’s gonna have some false

starts and that you’re gonna need to narrow your search approach, has that
affected the way you do research?
P2:

Not entirely.

I:

How’s that.

P2:

Well, I go through research, but there are some topics where you don’t

find as many dead ends. So there will be some times in a while when I don’t have
to narrow down that much.

Campos 102

I:

OK. So you know that it may come up, but you may not need to

P2:

It may not be right away, but it may come up eventually.

Deciding on the type of sources required. A category that arose in relation to
searching was deciding on the type of sources required for the project based in part on the
audience. Bill (participant 57) shared
So, first you need to set a target, what are you looking for? And when you know
what you are looking for, what kinds of sources are you trying to get what you are
looking for from? Are you trying to get very valid legitimate information or
depending on who you present it to does it have to be formal or informal? That
also kind of narrows it down. And then once you have this information, does this
formal or informal information fit into exactly the kind of project you are doing?
How much weigh does the formal information have? How much weight does the
informal one add? Because usually if you stick to only the formal information, the
project becomes boring, so sometimes it requires you to balance formal
information with some kind of information but yet relevant information to balance
the process. That’s how I’ve always looked at it. With the session’s more
scientific projects, you’re kind of limited to formal resources because it requires
strictly that. If I’m writing a research for biology, you’re information has to be
strictly technical. I don’t know if technical is the word but you have to use
scientific words and meanings because you cannot just bring words into it just for
embellishment.
Developing search terms, reviewing results, and deciding what to use. Another
theme that emerged around the “Searching as Strategic Exploration” frame was the

Campos 103

process of developing search terms, reviewing results, and deciding what to use. Larry
(participant 28) outlined this process
P28:

First think of the topic. First think of the topic and things I might want to

mention. From there, cut my topic into different terms that I can search.
I:

OK. Searchable terms.

P28:

Search different terms and find, look through all the results. Not click on

just the first.
I:

So you want to look through everything you found?

P28:

Not everything exactly.

I:

Cause you do get a lot? You might get thousands of hits?

P28:

The ones that look most important, most appealing. And read it, and then

decide from the paragraphs what I’m going to take from him or her.
I:

Alright.

P28:

What I’m going to quote, to be exact.

Interacting with information search tools and resources. Many reflections
associated with searching revolved around working with information search tools and
resources.
Online search tools. One category emerged relating to using online research tools.
Carla (participant 63) described the following:
I:

Alright. What is your perception or experience of the information searching

process and has this perception affected the way you do research? So, what is your sense
of the information searching process? What is it to you?
P63:

Like searching?

Campos 104

I:

The searching process.

P63:

Like I usually search like a keyword. Like different stuff will come out.

From there, I’ll be like “OK, I’m gonna write about this, this, not this, and then
I’ll type another keyword and see what else comes out.
I:

So then you look at the keywords that come out once you put in your

initial key word, then you find other keywords and then you use those
P63:

Mhm.

I:

To try and . . .

P63:

Write something combining all the information together.

Juan (Participant 67) also described a process centered on the use of online search tools.
He described transitioning from using Google to using a discovery search portal that
returns results from research databases. He explained,
P67:

I type in the topic. I know that STC has that research engine on it.

I:

Yes, Discovery Search.

P67:

That was very useful for me and when I was doing my essay on Leukemia,

it was more beneficial to look at that type of engine than ever to go on Google.
I:

Right. What did you find that was so much better.

P67:

It was much more professional. It was people’s experience, people’s

viewpoints of a certain topic. It wasn’t just “here is information this is what it
means.” It was experience, viewpoints. And the structure of it was interesting too.
It provides side page. You can narrow it down. It has videos, articles, books, and
different types of stuff.

Campos 105

I:

So that was useful for you in your approach to doing research. So the

searching process to say very generally, what is the searching process. How
would you describe it? What is the searching process in research?
P67:

It’s to find an answer.

Mixed format resources. Another conception of the search process involved the
use of the physical collection and electronic search tools. Laura shared,
P72:

Ah, OK. First, I select a topic, or the instructors give me a topic. I will go

to the library. Go find some books about it. Then I would go and look in the,
where they have the list of topics. I don’t know how you say it. Just at the
beginning of the book.
I:

Oh, I see. The table of contents?

P72:

Yes. If there is something I can use.

I:

Or the index. Are you talking about the index, table of contents or both?

P72:

Both. And then, I will do extra research by Internet, go see videos, or

movies, or documentaries, or interviews about it. Then I will start writing. I’m a
person that needs to look for information, not just written information, but to see
videos, hear podcasts, stuff like that.
I:

OK. Alright. And you spoke of how you recently learned to use the STC

databases. How do you work with those? Like how do you find information in
the databases that you use?
P72:

In the search I will put the information I am looking for. I will narrow it

by years. And see if it’s PDF or something else.

Campos 106

Synthesis. Taking information found and synthesizing it for use was another
category of comments made in relation to the searching process. Carla (participant 71)
shared,
Well my understanding of the search process is you need to make sure to get
different sources and read on each one, and then find if there’s a common link
between them, and then see what the perspective of each writer is of that common
link. Because even though they have a common link, each one may have different
conclusion to it, and so you want to see where is that middle in all three, and how
it affects what you’re writing on.
Research Question Six: Facilitating Internalization of ACRL Frames
Participants were asked for their thoughts on what would have eased their internalization
of the ACRL frames they have experienced. Three broad categories emerged across all of
the frames experienced by the participants: earlier instruction, practice, and taking an
interest earlier. Access to technology was also suggested. Some participants said that
they did not know of anything that might have helped them transition to their current
understanding more readily.
Earlier instruction. Several participants indicated their thought that an earlier
explanation from an instructor might have helped them arrive at their current
understanding of the frame more readily. In speaking of his experience of authority, Juan
(participant 67) shared,
P67:

Yes. I think it would be the instructor’s verbal experience with it. Because

we were just told to find research, to look for sources, implement them, explain,
put a quote, add your opinion, etc., etc. If they had explained that some had more

Campos 107

weight because of its title or because of it history, it would have helped me or any
other students in the past because some sources can either break or make your
essay. I have in the past cited certain sources that were OK for like a middle
schooler, but in the context of a college student, it was not good enough.
I:

So has it ever really happened that an instructor has told you up front what

their expectations of what an authoritative source is, or does it usually happen in
the back end once you write the paper and they tell you “Oh, this is not
authoritative enough?
P67:

Yes.

I:

But they never really spent time on the front end telling you “these are the

kinds of sources of sources you’re going to be using and that’s what you’re going
to try to find because that’s what I consider weighty and that’s what I want.”
P67:

Yes.

I:

So normally that’s not what you get. You get it after the fact?

P67:

After we finished writing that’s when you get feedback.

Similarly, in speaking of developing in her concept of authority, Carla said, “Maybe if
the teachers or instructors gave us more information on how to write a research paper,
like introduce like authoritative and not, stuff like that.” Later, in discussing how she
might have arrived at her current understanding of the information creation process more
readily, Carla suggested, “Probably if our teachers explained it, like our instructors.”
Reflecting on the information creation process, Larry (participant 28) suggested
that instruction could have helped him arrive at his understanding earlier. He shared,

Campos 108

P28:

Maybe if they taught more about the sources—the teacher. Instead of just

talking about how to find them maybe if they taught more of this author’s writing
from this perspective I suppose.
I:

Yes. So if the teacher discussed more how the information kind of comes

to you.
P28:

Like different kinds of authors. Like an example, a study or this is an

interview. If they would have touched more on that, I suppose you could.
Juan (participant 67) also suggested that instruction might have helped him arrive at his
understanding of the information creation process more readily. He shared,
P67:

I think it would be from my instructors. They requested a proficient essay

and they.
I:

So you’re thinking the instructor would have been important in getting

there faster.
P67:

Cause they want “good essays” but they don’t specifically explain how it’s

supposed to be, like the structure.
I:

Like maybe they haven’t modeled it enough or shown you a good example

of how to put together well, so that you can see “That’s the way it’s supposed to
be.” Is that what you’re thinking?
P67:

Yes because they just want a very proficient essay and most people don’t

know what that is. They just assume it’s just finding sources, putting sentences
together and works cited or references.

Campos 109

Practice. A second category of aids to the internalization of frames the
participants had experienced was practice. Bill, for example, in speaking of authority,
shared,
P57:

I think my love and passion to write has helped and I think that the

number of opportunities I have gotten to get to do research projects has also given
me that nudge to get to this point. Think about, it if I learned a skill about doing
projects, even though I’m saying it becomes second nature and psychomotor, if I
don’t do it enough, I may lose it. If you are a good athlete and you don’t practice,
you’re not going to be as efficient as other athletes, who practice.
I:

So you think that if you had more opportunities to do more. To be more

exposed to research, then you probably would have learned these ideas faster.
P57:

Probably faster.

Reflecting on how she might have arrived at her understanding of research more readily,
Tina also proposed that more practice doing research would have helped. She suggested a
modest primary research assignment along the following lines:
But maybe we could have, I don’t know how to explain it, if we had had a hands
on kind of thing where we perform our own study in the classroom. Maybe
something really simple, like how many students in here actually do their
homework or some small study to get a little hands-on in the classroom?
Carlos also suggested that practice might have helped him arrive at his understanding of
research more readily. According to this view, the best way to learn how to do something
is to practice doing it. He shared

Campos 110

P65:

I think it’s just the experience that comes with doing research. That’s one

of the initial benefits. If you’re gonna do research, you’re gonna learn how to do
research.
I:

So doing it is how you get better at it.

P65:

Yeah.

Personal interest. Another category of aid to arriving at their current
understanding of a frame that emerged was personal interest. Ben for example, in
speaking of research shared
P2:

If I had tried to arrive at this mindset sooner. I was kind of laid back about

research at the beginning.
I:

OK

P2:

And being in college now it’s kind of opened my eyes to that, that I can’t

be doing that a lot. So, I have to just draw myself into the research.
Bill identified self-motivation as something that could have helped him arrive at his
perception of the value of information more readily. He indicated that he could have done
more to learn about research in American college settings. Bill said,
Maybe if I was more proactive when I moved here. If I had proactively done more
research into college settings in the U.S. and probably found out more about the
difference between the British style of education and the American system, maybe
my idea of research would not have been so poor. I wouldn’t say “poor.” It was
average. “Poor” is too harsh. So maybe if I had taken the initiative, I would have
had relevant previous knowledge to build on.

Campos 111

Access to technology. Earlier access to technology was also raised as a possible
aid in a couple of instances. One participant discussing what might have helped him
arrive at his understanding of the information creation process suggested that earlier
access to technology would have helped. Bill shared, “I think maybe growing up, if I had
access to a lot of technology in terms of education teaching-learning process.
I believe back in Africa, teaching is a very tedious process because there is not
that much technological supply, so you are kind of limited to a monotonous way
of teaching-learning unless you have a teacher who is advanced in terms of
improvisation and yet though improvisation skill is creative, it’s still not gonna be
the same as the real objects. So maybe, if I had access at an earliest age, maybe
my ideas about this probably would have been very different and more readily
developed ideas.
In discussing what might have helped her arrive at her understanding of the value of
information more readily, Nora proposed, “Having the online earlier” as she did not learn
about online databases until later.
Summary
Chapter IV discussed the results of the study reviewing these in relation to each of
the six research questions. Chapter V summarizes the study, discusses conclusions in the
context of the literature, discusses the implications of the findings, and recommends areas
for future research.

Campos 112

Chapter V
Summary, Conclusions, Implications, and Recommendations
The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand the perceptions and
experiences relating to information literacy threshold concepts of lower-level
undergraduate students enrolled in an associate degree program at a Texas college.
Information literacy threshold concepts are defined as gateway, transformative concepts
or milestones in the development of information literacy, including but not limited to
those concepts identified in the ACRL Framework (ACRL, 2015). This chapter provides
a summary of the study. It discusses conclusions in the context of the literature. It
discusses the implications of the study’s findings. It then goes over some
recommendations for further research and ends with some concluding remarks.
Summary of the Study.
Overview of the problem. Information literacy, the ability to recognize
information needs, find information, and employ this information ethically to solve
problems or achieve their purposes is an important lifelong skill that students are
expected to develop by the time they complete their formal education (Wiebe, 2015).
Various national studies suggest that many college students experience information
literacy gaps (Head, 2013). Recent ACRL guidance on information literacy for higher
education provides a framework of threshold or transformation concepts considered
important for students to integrate into their thinking and practice in order to become
proficient in doing research and working with information (ACRL Framework, 2015).
Because the ACRL Framework is general and non-prescriptive, the drafters of the ACRL
Framework suggest that colleges and universities should adapt the ACRL Framework to

Campos 113

the local needs of their institution (ACRL, 2015). The ACRL frames were developed
from the perspective of information literacy experts (Gibson & Jacobson, 2015). There is
a gap in the literature describing student perceptions of threshold concepts in information
literacy. A better understanding of student perspectives of transformative milestones in
the development of information proficiency and the ACRL frames in particular can assist
in adapting the ACRL Framework and tailoring library instruction for lower-level college
students (Marciales Vivas, Castañeda-Peña, Barbosa-Chacón, Barreto, & Melo, 2016).
Purpose statement and research questions. The purpose of this
phenomenographic study was to understand the perceptions and experiences relating to
information literacy threshold concepts of lower-level undergraduate students enrolled in
an associate degree program at a Texas college. The overarching research question of this
study is “How do lower-level undergraduate students perceive threshold concepts or
transformative milestone concepts in their experience of learning information literacy?”
Below are the six related research questions explored in this study:
1.

What do students consider as the transformative milestones in their experience of

learning information literacy?
2.

What is the experience of students in understanding and internalizing these

transformative milestones?
3.

What are student perceptions of what would have eased their internalization of the

transformative milestones they identified?
4.

How do these transformative milestones compare to the threshold concepts

identified in the ACRL Framework?

Campos 114

5.

What are student experiences and perceptions of engaging with information from

the perspective of the ACRL frames?
6.

What are student perceptions of what would have eased their internalization of the

ACRL frames they have experienced?
Study design. This qualitative research study employed phenomenography as the
research approach. Qualitative research is deemed appropriate for gaining an
understanding of a complex issue that does not lend itself to simple measurement but
which lends itself to talking directly to people and allowing them to tell their stories
(Creswell, 2013). This study sought to understand the perceptions and experiences of
college students relating to threshold concepts or transformative milestone concepts in
their experience of learning information literacy. The researcher employed in-depth,
semi-structured interviews (Cousin, 2009) with participants asking open-ended questions
relating to each participant’s experience of developing information literacy skills.
Because the study focused on the variety of ways individuals perceive a phenomenon
with a view to identifying categories of common experiences in relation to that
phenomenon, a phenomenographic qualitative approach was deemed appropriate for this
study (Entwistle, 1997; Lupton, 2008; Svensson, 1997).
Lupton (2008) identified some of the distinctive characteristics of
phenomenography as a qualitative research approach. Phenomenography is primarily
concerned with variation in the ways people experience a phenomenon and the
relationship among these conceptions (Entwistle, 1997; Lupton, 2008). Historically,
phenomenography has been associated with the ways people experience teaching and
learning. Accordingly, this research approach lends itself to the practical application of

Campos 115

outcomes to the curriculum (Cibangu & Hepworth, 2016; Entwistle, 1997, Lupton, 2008).
The outcome of phenomenographic analysis is the collective experience rather than the
individual experience of a phenomenon (Lupton, 2008).
Participants. The study employed a purposeful sampling approach (Creswell,
2013) of 11 lower-level college students. Bruce (1997) citing Sandberg (1994) suggested
that 20 is an adequate number of participants in a phenomenographic study to provide a
sufficiently rich description of the variety of conceptions for the phenomenon being
studied. Cousin (2009) recommended a sample size of at least ten for a
phenomenographic study. Of approximately 80 eligible students identified, eleven
students participated in the study. In a phenomenographic study, the selection of
participants is driven by the requirement that participants have an experience of the
phenomenon being studied and represent as wide as possible a variation of how the
phenomenon is conceptualized in the given population (Bruce, 1997; Marciales Vivas,
2016). Each student was enrolled at the same college in Texas. Each participants had
completed at least a second level English course (English 1302) with a grade of B or
above, written at least two college-level research papers, and received library instruction.
This criteria was employed to identify students who had experienced doing college
research. Successful experience doing college-level research suggests that the participants
have some experience of threshold concepts or transformational milestones associated
with becoming information literate. Accordingly, the sample was selected purposefully to
focus on those who had experienced the phenomenon under study (Bruce, 1997).
Participants selected were more readily accessible to the researcher. Sampling size was
initially set at 22, consisting of 20 participants for the study and two for a pilot test of the

Campos 116

research protocol (Creswell, 2013). Because of the difficulty encountered recruiting
participants, 11 students participated. The first served as a pilot for the research protocol,
but no material changes were made to the protocol following this first participant.
Setting. The study took place at a large multi-campus Texas college. The college
has a large dual credit program as well as a large online program with over 500 online
course sections. Approximately 67% of students at the college are the first in their family
to attend college, over 90% of students are of Hispanic descent, and approximately 72%
of students receive some form of financial aid. A single organizational site was selected
to increase the likelihood that the perceptions and experiences of participants are typical
of those of most other students at the same institution. The purpose of the study was to
explore student experiences and perceptions of the broad interdisciplinary threshold
concepts of information literacy rather than threshold concepts associated with any
particular discipline. Accordingly, the sample of participants represented a broad range of
contexts for the phenomenon under study (Bruce, 1997; Vagle, 2014); that is, the
experience of threshold concepts in information literacy at a college campus without
limitation to any major or sequence of courses other than the second level English course
(ENGL 1302) with a grade of B or above, completion of two research papers, and having
experienced library instruction. Library instruction sessions at the college are generally
tailored to the requirements of the course instructor, which tend to relate a specific
research assignment. Library instruction sessions generally provide an overview of
library services, pertinent subject guides, key research databases, and research strategies.
Students are expected to write at least one research paper for ENGL 1302, so the
requirement that participants have written at least two research papers increases the

Campos 117

likelihood that these students have experienced threshold or transformative concepts in
learning information literacy.
Data collection. Data collection methods for phenomenographic research outlined
by Cousin (2009), Smith and Hepworth (2012) and Ashworth and Lucas (2000) were
employed. The data collection methods for this study included extended, individual, faceto-face interviews consisting of open-ended questions and comments. The interviews
were semi-structured and opened with light conversation to help each participant relax
and focus on the experience being studied (Moustakas, 2004; Smith & Hepworth, 2012).
Each participant was contacted in advance to go over consent and research protocol
issues and to verbally confirm their consent to participate in the study and that they had
written at least two college-level research papers and had participated in library
instruction. See Appendix D. An interview was then scheduled, each participant was
provided with a copy of the Letter of Consent and Consent Form, and the signed Consent
Form was collected before or at the start of each interview session. At these sessions, data
was collected through an extended (40 to 60 minute), individual, face-to-face interview
with each participant. The researcher began with social conversation to put the participant
at ease. The participant was then asked to focus on the experience of doing academic
research and was then engaged in a series of open-ended questions and comments to elicit
the participant’s perceptions and experience of threshold or transformative milestones in
information literacy (Moustakas, 1994; Smith & Hepworth, 2012).
Summary of key findings. Findings suggest that transformative developmental
milestones in information literacy as experienced by lower-level undergraduate students
were aligned with some of the ACRL frames. Some developmental milestones were

Campos 118

different from the ACRL frames and some, but not all, of the ACRL frames resonated
with these students.
Research question one. The first research question explored what students
consider as the transformative milestones in their experience of learning information
literacy. Practices and attitudes identified by participants revolved around attitudes of
empowerment, the notion of authority, consulting with others, aspects of searching,
synthesis, and time-management.
Research question two. Each participant was asked to describe their experience
from not knowing about the practices and attitudes they had identified as transformative
milestones in information literacy to having these become a regular part of doing
research. The predominant experience among the participants was a transition from initial
intimidation or lack confidence to an increased self-confidence in researching and writing
papers.
Research question three. Participants were asked to reflect on what they think
might have helped them more readily internalize the transformative milestones they
identified. Most participants identified some aspect of instruction, others identified
practice, and one pointed to visual notation. Two participants did not know of anything
that might have helped them internalize the practices and attitudes they identified as
transformative milestones in becoming more proficient researchers.
Research question four. The fourth research question that this study sought to
explore was how the practices and attitudes associated with information proficiency by
participating students compare to the threshold concepts identified in the ACRL
Framework (ACRL, 2015). Several of the transformative milestones identified by the

Campos 119

participants form part of the ACRL frames. These included various attitudes, authority,
consultation, searching, and synthesis. Time management, which was important to some
participants, is not a prominent concept or practice within the ACRL Framework.
Research question five. Research question five involved reviewing the ACRL
frames to determine how the participants experienced and understood each of these
frames. Preliminary categories of description were generated for each of the ACRL
frames from an analysis of the interview transcripts. These categories were then
organized into logical relationships, known as the outcome space in phenomenographic
analysis (Smith & Hepworth, 2012). The resulting interrelated categories describe the
ways in which each ACRL frame was understood collectively by participants based on
the perceptions and experiences each shared. Excerpts from the interviews are provided
to illustrate the outcome space categories.
Research question six. Participants were asked for their thoughts on what would
have eased their internalization of the ACRL frames they have experienced. Three broad
categories emerged across all of the frames experienced by the participants: earlier
instruction, practice, and taking an interest earlier.
Conclusions
The ACRL Framework is a set of six threshold concepts with associated practices
and attitudes that according to a group of experts at the time of its formulation
characterize persons becoming proficient in doing research and working with information
(ACRL, 2015; Gibson & Jacobson, 2014). The results of this study suggest that the
ACRL Framework is consistent with the perceptions and experiences of participating
lower-level college students, but that there are other practices and attitudes that these

Campos 120

students experience as transformative milestones in becoming proficient in doing
academic research and working with information, which are not part of the ACRL
Framework. These students perceived the six ACRL frames in various ways and shared
ideas as to what might have helped them through the process of becoming proficient
information users. The results of this study can help information literacy curriculum
designers formulate instructional experiences that are responsive to the needs of this user
group.
Research question one. What do students consider as the transformative
milestones in their experience of learning information literacy? Participants identified
attitudes of self-confidence, personal interest, and persistence; basic notions of authority;
consulting with others; aspects of searching; synthesis; and time-management as
transformative milestones in their journey toward becoming more proficient in
researching and writing papers. The “Authority is Constructed and Contextual” frame and
the “Searching as Strategic Exploration” frame are top-level ACRL frames (ACRL,
2015). Additionally, other practices and attitudes that emerged, as developmental
milestones for the students such as personal interest and persistence are consistent with
attitudes associated with the “Research as Inquiry” frame and the “Searching as
Exploration frame respectively. Similarly, synthesis is a knowledge practice associated
with the “Research as Inquiry” frame. Attitudes of self-confidence and the practice of
time-management, which also emerged as milestone developmental attitudes and
practices, do figure explicitly into the ACRL Framework. Before the ACRL Framework,
however, Blackmore and Freeland (2012) suggested the appreciation of time as a
resource was an information literacy threshold concept.

Campos 121

Early speculation raised questions about the applicability of the ACRL
Framework to community colleges. Reed (2015) observed that the frames are highly
theoretical and provide no guidance to librarians who provide library instruction to
community college students in a single session. The findings of this study suggest that
aspects of the ACRL Framework are applicable to lower-level college students. These
findings also highlight other knowledge practices and attitudes such as time-management
and self-confidence that may be useful to keep in mind in planning library instruction for
lower-level college students at this institution.
Research question two. What is the experience of students in understanding and
internalizing these transformative milestones? Several participants described a transition
from initial intimidation or lack confidence to an increased self-confidence in researching
and writing papers. The stage between exposure to a threshold concept and proper
understanding of the concept, often referred to as the liminal space, is a cognitive and
affective stage where learners undergo a transformation in their grasp of the concept and
their way of thinking about the discipline (Mayer & Land, 2006; Rattray, 2016). The time
a learner spends in this liminal space varies as the learner overcomes possible
intimidation of the unknown, attempts to understand the concept, and reconciles this new
understanding with the learner’s existing knowledge, hence anything that can help a
learner negotiate the liminal space toward grasping a threshold concept speeds the
learner’s journey toward developing proficiency in the discipline (Mayer & Land, 2006;
Rattray, 2016).
Knowing about the transition experience of students provides some idea of the
pre-liminal, liminal, and expert stages of developing information proficiency.

Campos 122

Understanding this experience can help those involved in instructional design help
students negotiate cognitive and affective challenges of information literacy. The
experience reported by participants in this study of moving from intimidation or a lack of
confidence to self-confidence in doing research and working with information aligns with
the basic threshold concept journey through the liminal stage.
Research question three. What are student perceptions of what would have
eased their internalization of the transformative milestones they identified? While not all
participants could think anything that would have helped them internalize the
transformative milestones in information literacy they identified, most participants
identified some aspect of instruction, others identified practice, and one pointed to visual
notation. These aids when provided at contextually appropriate points in a course of
instruction can help a student see the relevance of what is being taught and internalize the
content more readily. Smith (2014), for example, proposed the use of problem-based
learning and concept mapping in the context of adult literacy as ways to improve
retention by making the concepts more relevant to students. As some study participants
suggested, instead of just assigning papers that conform to some citation format, students
express the value that learning the why of citation would have. The same is true of what
constitutes authority in different contexts when assigning a research paper that should use
authoritative resources. When instruction provides the context for the requirements of an
assignment, these requirements can acquire greater relevance and meaning. Additionally,
the opportunity to apply the concepts through practice can help students internalize the
desired practices and attitudes of information proficiency. Junisbai, Lowe, and Tagge
(2016), reporting on a three year study of faculty-librarian collaborations in integrating

Campos 123

information literacy into coursework, observed that “librarians are especially good at
helping faculty think through the scaffolding of assignments so as to give students
sufficient practice applying the IL [information literacy] skills that they will then use to
carry out a final research project.”
Research question four. How do these transformative milestones compare to the
threshold concepts identified in the ACRL Framework? The ACRL frames cover several
of the transformative milestones identified by the participants. These included various
attitudes, authority, consultation, searching, and synthesis. Time management, which was
important to some participants, is not a prominent concept or practice within the ACRL
Framework. As discussed under research question one above, the overlap between the
transformative milestones and the ACRL frames suggests that the ACRL Framework is
useful for lower-level undergraduate instruction in information literacy.
The transformative milestones identified by the participants were generated
through semi-structured interviews with students and the ACRL frames were developed
through an iterative process of consultation among information literacy experts (Gibson
& Jacobson, 2014; Townsend, Brunetti, & Hofer, 2011; Townsend, Hofer, Hanick, &
Brunetti, 2016). The practices and attitudes identified by student participants in the study
tracked three key characteristics of threshold concepts: It is likely to be (1)
transformative, in that once understood, it permanently changes a student’s view on a
subject; (2) irreversible, in that once learned, it is not likely to be forgotten; (3)
integrative, in that it reveals the interrelatedness of previously unrelated knowledge about
a subject (Meyer & Land, 2006). The overlap between the ACRL frames and the
transformational milestones identified by participants may be due in part because the

Campos 124

ACRL Framework was developed with a view to identifying threshold concepts in
information literacy (Gibson & Jacobson, 2014; Townsend, Brunetti, & Hofer, 2011;
Townsend, Hofer, Hanick, & Brunetti, 2016). Additional transformative milestones in
becoming effective in researching and writing papers, which were particular to the
participants, like time-management can be used to tailor information literacy instruction
at the institutional level as proposed by the ACRL Framework (ACRL, 2015).
Research question five. What are student experiences and perceptions of
engaging with information from the perspective of the ACRL frames? Preliminary
categories of description were generated for each of the ACRL frames from an analysis
of the interview transcripts. These categories were then organized into logical
relationships, known as the outcome space in phenomenographic analysis (Smith &
Hepworth, 2012). The resulting interrelated categories describe the ways in which each
ACRL frame was understood collectively by participants based on the perceptions and
experiences each shared.
Authority is constructed and contextual. This ACRL frame provides that
Information resources reflect their creators’ expertise and credibility and are
evaluated based on the information need and the context in which the information
will be used. Authority is constructed in the various communities may recognize
different types of authority. It is contextual in that the information need may help
to determine the level of authority required (ACRL, 2015, 4).
Figure 2 below summarizes the outcome space or related concepts that emerged
from interviews with participants for the “Authority is Contextual and Constructed”
frame:

Campos 125

Figure 2. Schematic of student perceptions of authority in research.

The outcome space or set of perceptions shared by participants with respect to the
“Authority is Constructed and Contextual” frame suggests a variety of nuances in the
way students understood the concept of authority. While most students recognized that
what is considered authoritative might vary with the context, one participant also
expressed the view that if a resource has been proven empirically to be authoritative then
it is an authority independent of context. Aspects of this frame such as the recognition
that unlikely voices or voices not packaged in traditionally authoritative formats can be
authoritative did not emerge during the interviews. A novice level conception of the
“Authority is Constructed and Conceptual” frame characterized most of the participant
comments.
Information creation as a process. This ACRL frame provides that,

Campos 126

Information in any format is produced to convey a message and is shared via a
selected delivery method. The iterative process of researching, creating, revising,
and disseminating information vary, and the resulting product reflects these
differences (ACRL, 2015, p. 5).
Figure 3 below summarizes the outcome space or related concepts that emerged
from interviews with participants for the “Information Creation as a Process” frame:

Figure 3. Schematic of student perceptions of information creation as a process.

The outcome space that emerged in relation to the “Information as a Process”
frame touched on basic ideas regarding traditional processes of information creation. One
theme recognized the creation of information through empirical processes. Another
theme contrasted formality and reliability with informality and untrustworthiness. The
third theme distinguished among primary sources and more removed categories of
sources. These themes align with the knowledge practice that states, “Learners who are
developing their information literate abilities recognize that information may be
perceived differently based on the format in which it is packaged” (ACRL, 2015, 5).

Campos 127

There was no discussion when covering this frame of the knowledge practice of assessing
the fit between a product’s information creation process and the information need
(ACRL, 2105, p. 5). The “Information Creation as a Process” frame generally did not
resonate with four of the eleven participants.
Information has value. This ACRL frame provides that
Information possesses several dimensions of value, including as a community, as
a means of education, as a means of influence, and as a means of negotiating and
understanding the world. Legal and socioeconomic interests influence information
protection and dissemination (ACRL, 2015, p. 6).
Figure 4 below summarizes the outcome space or related concepts that emerged
from interviews with participants for the “Information Has Value” frame:

Figure 4.Schematic of student perceptions of the value of information.
The outcome space for the “Information Has Value” frame revealed a general
sense that information has value to the user and to the creator, though the later sometimes
required further reflection. There were a number of different ways in which participants
ascribed value to information, including more information is better, the value of
information as evidence or content, monetary value, and its impact—good or bad—on a

Campos 128

community. Giving credit to others through citation arose in some instances when
discussing what effect the idea that information has value affected their practice. Expert
level knowledge practices associated with this frame (e.g., the recognition of oneself as a
contributor to the information marketplace and deciding how one’s information will be
published) did not emerge. The participant’s experience with information emphasized
during the interviews was from the perspective of an information consumer, which may
be expected for a lower-level undergraduate.
Research as inquiry. This ACRL frame provides that “research is iterative and
depends upon asking increasingly complex or new questions whose answers in turn
develop additional questions or lines of inquiry in any field (ACRL, 215, p. 7). Figure 5-4
below summarizes the outcome space or related concepts that emerged from interviews
with participants for the “Research as Inquiry” frame:

Figure 5. Schematic of student perceptions of research as inquiry.
Four themes emerged in relation to the “Research as Inquiry” frame. The first
viewed research as a process of questioning one’s current views and seeking new
perspectives. A second theme took a more scientific and practical view of research as
finding solutions to problems. A third strand essentially viewed all learning as requiring

Campos 129

research. Finally, the fourth theme seemed to emphasize a constructivist conception of
research as a process of building on existing knowledge. Various concepts, knowledge
practices, and dispositions associated with the “Research as Inquiry” frame did not
emerge in the discussion of this frame, but were raised elsewhere in the interviews. For
example, the expert level notion of research as a collaborative effort did not emerge in the
discussion of the “Research as Inquiry” frame, but was recognized elsewhere in the
interviews while discussing the “Scholarship as Conversation” frame. The knowledge
practice of synthesizing ideas from multiple resources arose in a separate discussion of
transformative milestone practices. The “Research as Inquiry” disposition of valuing
intellectual curiosity in developing questions also arose in the discussion of
transformative milestone practices.
Scholarship as conversation. This ACRL frame provides that, “communities of
scholars, researchers, or professionals engage in sustained discourse with new insights
and discoveries occurring over time as a result of varied perspectives and interpretations
(ACRL, 2015, p. 8). Figure 6 below summarizes the outcome space or related concepts
that emerged from interviews with participants for the “Scholarship as Conversation”
frame:

Figure 6. Schematic of student perceptions of scholarship as conversation.

Campos 130

The “Scholarship as Conversation” frame did not elicit any recognition or
response from five of the participants. The other participants required more clarification
before they could share any reflections on this frame. For example, some participants
initially thought that academic scholarship referred to college financial aid. The
“Scholarship as Conversation” frame was perceived by some as the teaching that
instructors do through classroom dialogue Some participants understood the idea of
“Scholarship as Conversation” as the process by which knowledge is created by scholars
engaged individually and in relation to other scholars through individual exchanges and
publication in the literature. The notion of “Scholarship as Conversation” makes sense
after some explanation, but it is a concept that did not reflect the academic experiences of
the participants as lower-level undergraduate students. This frame may resonate more
fully with students later as upper-level undergraduate or graduate students after they have
had more exposure to doing research. An important insight from this frame, which one
participant noted was that knowledge is always growing and evolving so that in doing
research, one should not expect to find a definitive answer. This is an example of a basic
insight that may be a useful adaptation from the “Scholarship as Conversation” frame
when introducing this frame to a novice researcher.
Searching as strategic exploration. This ACRL frame provides that, “searching
for information is often nonlinear and iterative, requiring the evaluation of a range of
information sources and the mental flexibility to pursue alternate avenues as new
understanding develops” (ACRL, 2015, p. 9). Figure 7 below summarizes the outcome

Campos 131

space or related concepts that emerged from interviews with participants for the
“Scholarship as Conversation” frame:

Figure 7. Schematic of student perceptions of the searching process.

The categories that emerged in relation to the “Searching as Strategic
Exploration” frame were narrowing a topic; developing search terms, reviewing results,
and deciding what to use; interacting with information search tools and resources; and
synthesizing information. The “Searching as Strategic Exploration” frame seemed to
align closely the experiences shared by the participants. Participants, however, tended to
limit themselves to only a few “go to” search tools, usually these were the library’s
Discovery Search platform or specific library research databases such as JSTOR.
Accordingly, dispositions such as recognizing the value of serendipitous methods of
information gathering such as browsing were not mentioned.
Research question six. What are student perceptions of what would have eased
their internalization of the ACRL frames they have experienced? Three broad categories
emerged across all of the frames experienced by the participants: earlier instruction,

Campos 132

practice, and taking an interest earlier. Earlier access to technology was also proposed as
an aide to internalization of frames. As discussed with respect to research question three
above, instruction and practice emerged as possible ways in which the transformational
milestones in the development of information proficiency could have been internalized
more readily. Taking an interest in information literacy earlier also arose as a factor that
might have improved the internalization of the identified frames. This observation aligns
with Buchanan, Harlan, Bruce, and Edwards (2016) conclusions on the promise of
inquiry based learning (IBL) models for teaching information literacy. These models
engage students by letting them select the problems they will research.
Implications
The ACRL Framework is a useful tool for developing information literacy among
lower-level undergraduate students, however, as the document suggests, it needs to be
adapted to the needs of each institution (ACRL, 2015). The ACRL Framework provides a
broad scope of what experts in the field consider developmental milestones in developing
information literacy. These describe an evolving journey in learning to work with
information, one that may best be developed over time from K-12 through postsecondary studies.
The experiences shared by some participants in this study confirm that through
course curriculum requirements, instructors set expectations for what aspects and levels
of information literacy students will need to develop and demonstrate. For example, if
students are expected to cite using APA, use scholarly articles from a research database,
or use some other authoritative resource, and students are taught how and why to cite or
what constitutes an authority in a given context as part of the course content, then

Campos 133

students have an opportunity to develop these information literacy practices and attitudes.
Some ACRL frames apply more to the experience of lower-level undergraduate students,
and others seem more appropriate during later studies. These findings are consistent with
D’Couto and Rosenhan (2015), who found that the research behavior of students taking
general education courses is heavily influenced by the requirements of the assignment
and by the instructor, whereas the apprentice level researcher is more likely to be a
graduate student interested in contributing to the field. Integrating the ACRL Framework
into a K-20 educational schema where appropriate elements of frames are introduced in a
way that is integrated into coursework might help make information proficiency relevant
to students and provide an orderly progression in the development of information literacy
skills. One-shot library instruction unrelated to the curriculum or to other previous and
future opportunities to learn about information literacy may be viewed as irrelevant by
students and therefore be less memorable.
In addition to those more basic knowledge skills and attitudes described by the
participants such as authority and searching, it may be useful to integrate certain other
concepts and practices that arose in this study into information literacy instruction. For
example, several participants considered time-management an important practice for
successful research. Similarly, other students identified consulting with instructors,
librarians, and others as a valuable practice in the research process.
The semi-structured interview approach employed in this study highlighted that
through a process of Socratic, constructivist dialog, students can be assisted in building
on concepts they already know to arrive at threshold concepts that they had not
previously considered. Several of the ACRL frames are abstract information literacy

Campos 134

concepts that lower-level undergraduate students have not reflected on such as the value
of information. However, by having participants think through the value information has
for them and for creators of information, some students arrived at the notion that this
recognition serves as a justification for the practice of citation and for avoiding
plagiarism.
Recommendations for Future Research
There is a need for additional research on the perceptions and experiences of
threshold concepts by students in secondary school, upper-level undergraduates, and
graduate or professional school students. Entwistle (2008) and Felten (2016) suggested
that that student experiences and perspectives can improve the understanding of threshold
concepts. This study looked only at lower-level undergraduate students. A better
understanding of student experiences of threshold concepts in information literacy at
different levels in the educational journey, can help educators develop more coherent
approaches to information literacy instruction and to tailor instruction to the needs at
particular institutions.
This study focused on the experience of lower-level undergraduate students with
threshold concepts in information literacy, especially as they relate to ACRL Framework.
In addition to preparing students to complete four year programs and to enroll in graduate
school, Community colleges, also prepare students for specific careers in areas such as
nursing and allied health and paralegal practice. Development of discipline-specific
information literacy threshold concepts using information from instructors, students, and
practitioners would be valuable in tailoring information literacy instruction for these
students.

Campos 135

Concluding Remarks
This study explored the perceptions and experiences of lower-level undergraduate
students of threshold concepts in information literacy with a view to finding ways to
tailor the ACRL Framework to these students. Findings suggested that many, though not
all, of the practices and concepts that students viewed as transformational milestones in
information literacy fall within the purview of the ACRL Framework. Some of the ACRL
frames such as “Authority is Constructed and Contextual,” “Information Has Value” and
“Searching as Strategic Exploration” resonated more with students than others such as
“Information Creation as a Process” and “Scholarship as Conversation”. Novice level
understandings of the ACRL frames were prominent among the participant descriptions.
Students provided useful reflections on approaches that may assist in helping them
internalize the concepts and practices underlying the ACRL Framework and other
transformative milestones in information literacy that they identified.

Appendix B
Guided Protocol
Interview Questions – College Student Perceptions of Threshold Concepts in Information
Literacy

Greet the student and explain the role of the researcher and the researcher’s background.
Explain the researcher’s personal interest in information literacy in higher education and
the reasons why this study is of interest to him. Begin with open-ended introductory
questions and then proceed with subject specific questions. Give the student a gift card
as a token of appreciation for their participation.

Introductory Questions:

1. How are you today?
2. What you majoring in?
3. Have you written at least two research papers for classes while in
college?
4. Tell me about one of the courses you have enjoyed so far in your major
and what you have liked about it?
5. How about one of the courses you have enjoyed the least and why?
6. What do you see yourself doing in five years?

Interview Questions:

1. What do students consider as the transformative milestones in their
experience of becoming information proficient?

Campos 155

a. Think about a time when you completed a research paper for a
college course, received a good grade for the assignment, and
learned something as a result of researching and writing the
paper.

(1) What are some of the actions you took in the process of
planning, researching, and writing the paper that you think
helped you be effective?

(2) What are some of the attitudes or state of mind that you
adopted in the process of planning, researching, and writing the
paper that you think saved you time and helped you be
effective?
b. Think about the practices or attitudes you have described that
have helped you be effective in researching and writing research
papers.
(1) Did you experience an “aha” moment in learning any of these
practices or attitudes so that the learning of it was a turning
point or milestone in the development of your ability to do
research or work with information?
(2) With respect to any of these practices and attitudes would you
say that once you learned it, as with learning to ride a bike, you
were changed in the way you approach research?

Campos 156

(3) With respect to any of these practices and attitudes would you
say that once you learned it, it helped you make sense of
working with information?
c. Generally speaking, is there anything about research or working
with information that you have struggled to learn or feel you are
still struggling to make sense of? Tell me about these
experiences?
d. Talk me through the last college research paper assignment you
did. Was there any aspect about it that you found troublesome
or challenging?
2. What is the experience of students in understanding and internalizing
these transformative milestones?
a. We have spoken about aspects of doing research or working
with information that changed your views about information
and the research process.
(1) Tell me about your experience of moving from a state of not
knowing about this practice, attitude, or idea [Recap if possible]
which perhaps now is automatic to you, and having it become a
regular help to you doing research or working with information.
(2) How long did it take for these new ways of thinking and acting to
sink in and become part of the way do and understand research?
3. What are student perceptions of what would have eased their
internalization of the transformative milestones they identified?

Campos 157

a. Thinking about these transformative milestones in your
experience with information, is there anything you can think of
that would have helped you move more quickly from not
knowing about these to making these a part of your regular
thinking and practice?
4. How do these transformative milestones compare to the threshold
concepts identified in the ACRL Framework?
[This research question will be answered by comparing the data
collected in the previous questions and comparing it with the frame
from the ACRL Framework. Phenomenography avoids
introducing preconceived categories into the interview process.]
5. What are student experiences and perceptions of engaging with
information from the perspective of the ACRL frames? [ To facilitate
the flow of the interview questions 5 and 6 will be addressed together
with respect to each frame]
6. What are student perceptions of what would have eased their
internalization of the ACRL frames they have experienced? [ To
facilitate the flow of the interview questions 5 and 6 will be addressed
together with respect to each frame]
a. (1) Tell me about your experiences with authority--—and I
don’t mean authority figures, but the idea that some sources
have more weight than others--in the process of doing
information research and working with information? What has

Campos 158

it come to mean to you? Do you think authority may vary with
the context or situation and if so how? (2) Is there anything in
your learning experience that you think could have helped you
come to your current understanding of authority in the process
of doing information research more readily?
b. (1) Tell me about your perception of how the information you
use for research or otherwise is created? What has this come to
mean to you? (2) Is there anything in your learning experience
that you think could have helped you come to your current
understanding of how information is created more readily?
c. (1) As you see it, does information possess value, and if so
how? [Does it have value to whomever who created the
information, and why?] Has this affected the way you work
with information and if so how? (2) Is there anything in your
learning experience that you think could have helped you come
to your current understanding of the value of information more
readily?
d. (1) What is your perception or experience of the information
searching process? Has this perception of the information
searching process in some way affected the way you do research
or interact with information and if so how? (2) Is there anything
in your learning experience that you think could have helped

Campos 159

you come to your current understanding of the information
search process more readily?
e. (1) Thinking broadly about research at all levels, what is your
perception of research as a [form of inquiry or] scholarly
activity? Has this perception of research in some way affected
the way you do research or interact with information and if so
how? (2) Is there anything in your learning experience that you
think could have helped you come to your current understanding
of the process of research more readily?
f. (1) How would you describe the process of academic
scholarship, including what it is and how it happens? Does the
idea of scholarship as a conversation resonate with you in some
way? Has this perception of scholarship in some way affected
the way you do research or interact with information and if so
how? (2) Is there anything in your learning experience that you
think could have helped you come to your current understanding
of the practice of scholarship more readily?
Thank the student for participating and explain the next steps in this research
study.
