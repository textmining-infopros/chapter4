E-Science as a Catalyst for Transformational Change in University Research Libraries

Abstract

Changes in how research is conducted, from the growth of e-science to the emergence of
big data, have lead to new opportunities for librarians to become involved in the creation and
management of research data, at the same time the duties and responsibilities of university
libraries continue to evolve. This study examines those roles related to e-science while exploring
the concept of transformational change and leadership issues in bringing about such a change.
Using the framework established by Levy and Merry for first- and second-order change, four
case studies of libraries whose institutions are members in the Association of Research Libraries
(ARL) are developed. The case studies highlight why the libraries became involved in e-science,
the role librarians are assuming related to data management education and policy, and the
provision of e-science programs and services. Each case study documents the structural and
programmatic changes that have occurred in a library to provide e-science services and
programs, the future changes library leaders are working to implement, and the change
management process used by managerial leaders to bringing about, and permanently embed
those changes into the library culture. Themes such as vision, team leadership, the role of library

iii

administrators, skills of library staff, and fostering a learning organization are discussed in the
context of e-science and leading transformational change. The transformational change included
a change in culture, organization paradigm, and redefining the role of the university research
library.

Chapter 1
INTRODUCTION TO E-SCIENCE

In today’s highly collaborative, data-driven research environment, roles and
responsibilities of university libraries are changing; opportunities abound for the development
and provision of unique and valuable services across academic institutions. Consequently, a
number of libraries serving universities with membership in the Association of Research
Libraries (ARL) have moved beyond the traditional roles of providing access to, organizing, and
ensuring the preservation of print-based library resources. Some of these libraries have expanded
their role in education to include data management and have seized opportunities to collaborate
with faculty and academic departments as they proactively become more involved in e-science
(Arms, Calimlim, & Walle, 2009; Choudhury, 2008; Delserone, 2008; Ferguson, 2012;
Gabridge, 2009; Gold, 2010; Heidorn, 2011; Johnson, Butler, & Johnston, 2012; Mullins, 2010;
Reznik-Zellen, Adamick, & McGinty, 2012).
Terms such as e-research, e-science, cyberscholarship, and cyberinfrastructure are
appearing more frequently in the literature of library and information science (LIS) and are often
used interchangeably; however, these terms carry different meanings across disciplines,
institutions, and countries. E-science, e-humanities, and e-social sciences refer to a specific
discipline or a set of disciplines, whereas the term e-research or cyberscholarship is most often
employed within the context of all scholarly disciplines (Gold, 2007a; Harvey, 2010). The terms
cyberscholarhip and e-research, which represent the broadest concept, originated in the United
Kingdom. They refer to the “development of, and the support for, advanced information and
computational technologies to enhance all phases of the research processes” (Luce, 2008, p. 43).

1

For libraries that have historically focused solely on managing the traditional outputs of research
(e.g., books and journal articles), cyberscholarship, or e-research, offers new opportunities to
engage and support researchers throughout the research process as computational technologies
make data an important asset and managing those data becomes more challenging (Lougee,
2010).
Cyberinfrastructure, often mentioned in discussions about e-science and e-research, is
multi-layered and is comprised of integrated computation and storage systems, software,
services, raw data, evidence-based information, published knowledge, social practices,
communication systems, institutional and other policies, and personnel (Atkins et al., 2003).
According to Atkins et al. (2003), these layers, when working together, provide an “effective
and efficient platform for the empowerment of specific communities of researchers to innovate
and eventually revolutionize what they do, how they do it, and [determining] who participates”
(p. 5). Cyberinfrastructure is more than the physical hardware that constitutes the computing
infrastructure or any one tool or resource developed for a particular project, and it cannot be
limited to a particular discipline (American Council of Learned Societies, 2006).
Cyberinfrastructure serves as the core on which data-intensive research is built (see Figure 1.1).
Advances in cyberinfrastructure, such as robust computing power, low storage costs, and
the ease with which information can be shared across the Internet, are some of the factors that
have transformed the way research is conducted (Hey & Hey, 2006; Johnston & Hanson, 2010;
Larsen, 2008; Luce, 2008; Macdonald & Uribe, 2008). Researchers in such fields as genomics,
climate modeling, and demographic studies, to name a few, increasingly conduct research using
data originally generated by others and frequently access these data in large public databases
found on the Internet.

2

With the aid of these advances in cyberinfrastructure, researchers are collaborating across
disciplines and institutions to address research questions and hypotheses that were previously
difficult to examine because of the scope, magnitude, and complexity of the topics being
studied.1 In the physical, biological, and medical sciences, large-scale, distributive,
computationally intense, and data-driven research is referred to as e-science. Taylor (n.d.) of the
UK National e-Science Centre defines e-science as:
Large scale science that will increasingly be carried out through distributed
global collaborations enabled by the Internet. Typically, a feature of such
collaborative scientific enterprises is that they will require access to very large
data collections, very large scale computing resources and high performance
visualization back to the individual user scientists. (para. 1)

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is one example of a worldwide project in which over 200 researchers at 150
academic institutions are working together to capture digital images of the universe (http://www.sdss.org/).

The Concept of Data Defined
The definition of data varies from discipline to discipline and from researcher to
researcher. Individuals assign value to data based on the context in which the data are produced
and at what stage of the data life cycle the information exists. Data are, according to one
definition, comprised of “facts, numbers, letters, and symbols that describe an object, idea,
condition, situation, or other factors” (National Research Council, 1999, p. 15). The Research
Information Network (2008) based in the United Kingdom identifies five sources of data:
1. observational: data are captured in real-time and are usually irreplaceable. Examples
include sensor data, survey data, sample data, and neuroimages.
2. experimental: lab equipment generates data, which may be reproduced, although it may
prove difficult or not cost-effective to do so. Examples include gene sequences and data
collected from the large hadron collider.2
3. simulation: data are generated from test models (such as climate models and economic
models) where the model and metadata are more important than output data.
4. derived or compiled: new data that results from the processing or combining of “raw” or
other data sources. Examples include the results of text and data mining, compiled
databases, 3D models, or geographical data.
5. reference or canonical: a (static or organic) collection of smaller (peer-reviewed) datasets
that are published and curated, such as gene sequence databanks or chemical structures.
During the conduct of scientific inquiry, data are collected, observed, analyzed, or created
to produce original research. After they are collected, they undergo various transformations.

2

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a massive underground scientific instrument that spans the border between
Switzerland and France, near Geneva. It is a particle accelerator used by physicists to study the smallest known
particles of the universe – the fundamental building blocks of all things (European Organization for Nuclear
Research, 2008).

Primary or raw data are data that have not been manipulated or changed by researchers. Once
researchers dissect, filter, analyze, or organize primary data, that primary data become
secondary or processed data (Tjalsma & Rombouts, 2010).
The data life cycle represents all of the stages of the life of a datum from its creation for a
study to its distribution and reuse (see Figure 1.2). The data life cycle begins with a researcher(s)
developing a concept for a study; once a study concept is developed, data are then collected for
that study’s research. The data are then processed for distribution so that they can be preserved
and used by other researchers at a later date. Once data reach the distribution stage of the life
cycle, they are stored in a location (i.e., repository or registry) where other researchers can
discover them. Data discovery leads to the repurposing of data, which creates a continual loop
back to the data processing stage, where the repurposed data are preserved and distributed for
discovery.
Each of the steps in Figure 1.2 represents a stage in the life cycle. The breaks between
sections represent the transitions between phases. In these periods of transition, important
information about the data can be lost if there is no forethought given to preserving a snapshot of
the data at that point in time. “These transition points become important areas in negotiating the
digital curation plan for a project as partners in the life cycle of research identify who is
responsible for the digital objects created at each stage” (Humphrey, 2006, p. 4).

In the professional literature related to e-science and data management, the term dataset,
which describes collections of data (primary or secondary), is a heterogeneous term that could be
made up of any type of collection for any type of data. For example, a dataset may contain
multiple files such as raw imaging files, 3D reconstructions, protein sequences, DNA sample
data, and a variety of segmentations. Renear, Sacchi, and Wickett (2010) have identified four
features of a dataset from the scientific literature (see Figure 1.3):
1. grouping: terms like set, aggregation, container, and collection are routinely used to
indicate that datasets are data treated collectively, as a unit.
2. content: the substance of a dataset are things of some particular kind. The data in
datasets are variously described with terms such as observations, facts, values, and
records of values.

6

3. relatedness: datasets are thought of as grouping together constituents (data) that are
related to each other in some way that goes beyond both the grouping itself and the
identification of the grouped things as all being of the same general kind of entity.
4. purpose: datasets are created in order to contribute in some way to scientific activity.
This might be by providing evidence to be analyzed, suggesting new hypotheses,
providing refutation or confirmation of existing hypotheses, or supplying new
phenomena to be explained (Renear et al., 2010).

Sacchi, Karen Wickett, 2010. Reproduced with permission of Allen Renear.
Dataset is an important concept in data curation and citation (Borgman, 2012). In regard to
curation, the lack of a precise common definition of a dataset that is shared across disciplines can
create curatorial problems for multi-disciplinary digital data repositories. These repositories are
intended to integrate data from many sources in order to solve real-world multi-disciplinary

7

problems and must present their resources in a uniform common context (Renear et al., 2010).
Datasets are important to data citation in that researchers are able to identify the individuals
responsible for creating the data so that the datasets can be verified for completeness and repurposed for future study. Datasets also facilitate attribution to research data sources to allow for
easier access to research data within journals and on the Internet. Having a complete, citable
dataset also supports the reuse of data, ensures that researchers remain accountable for their data,
and allows researchers to claim credit for developing datasets.
Growth of Data
The data used in e-science are generated as part of the research process or come from
existing datasets that previous researchers have made available. In 2009, the amount of digital
data in all forms (e.g., quantitative, voice, images, and text) grew 62 percent to 800,000
petabytes3 (Gantz & Reinsel, 2010); in 2011 it was estimated that this number would reach over
1.8 zettabytes.4 By 2020, the amount of digital data created, stored, and managed is projected to
expand from 2009 by a factor of 50 to reach 40,000 exabytes5 (or 40 zettabytes) (Gantz &
Reinsel, 2012) by 2020. Much of that data will be created from computer processes, applications,
or other machines without the intervention of a human. Acknowledging this growth of scientific
data, the 2020 Science Group (2005) reports that the immediate challenge for researchers is
“end-to-end scientific data management” (p. 8). Data must be managed from the point of creation
or acquisition to long-term preservation or disposition and throughout all the activities inbetween, such as mining, sharing, and migrating. Sharing is a critical element in data
management because reusing research data accelerates the rate of new discovery (Nelson,

A petabyte equals one million gigabytes.
A zettabyte equals one trillion gigabytes.
5
An exabyte equals one billion gigabytes.

2009),6 avoids the expensive duplication of data-collection activities, facilitates replication and
verification of research results, and promotes collaboration (Borgman, 2012; National Institute of
Health, 2003).
Data Sharing Requirements
In order to promote data sharing, federal agencies require that research data produced as
part of a funded project be made publicly available and/or have instituted requirements for
formal data plans. In 2003, the National Institute of Health (NIH) implemented a data-sharing
policy for grant proposals of more than $500,000, and expects data to become available at the
same time the findings are published. Although the policy encourages researchers to create datasharing agreements, and the NIH will provide the funding to create secure data enclaves, the
methods of sharing data are up to the researcher and institutional practice. The policy
recommends that raw data that will be shared have documentation in the form of codebooks,
which explain the data fields and how and when the data were collected; it also specifies
identifying any use restrictions (National Institute of Health, 2003). In October 2010, the
National Science Foundation (NSF) implemented a policy requiring any new proposal
(regardless of size) submitted after January 18, 2011 to include a data management plan in the
form of a two-page supplementary document, stating that this was the first step of a more
comprehensive approach to data policy (National Science Foundation, 2010). Although the data
management policy does not require sharing, researchers are encouraged to make their data
publicly available or state why they will not. The data management plans are included in the

6

The Human Genome Project (HGP) is a prime example of how early distribution of genomic sequence data have
accelerated discovery of new information in areas beyond the original scope of the project. These areas include, for
instance, identifying new types of biofuels that can be used as energy sources, discovery of migration patterns
through genetic inheritance, and the creation of stronger, more disease-resistant plants and animals (Department of
Energy, 2009).

9

peer review process of submitted proposals, whereas with the NIH sharing policy, the details of
the plans are limited to the center or institute’s program officer.
Other federal entities, such as the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
and the Environmental Protection Agency, have also issued guidelines and policies for
researchers to follow. The trend continues. On February 22, 2013, the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) issued a Memorandum for the Heads of Executive
Departments and Agencies (Holdren, 2013), which calls for federal agencies investing in
research and development (more than $100 million in annual expenditures) to have clear and
coordinated policies (within six months) for increasing access to research products (Strasser,
2013). The memo requires that agency plans cover both scientific articles and scientific data.
Data are defined as:
… digitally recorded factual materials commonly accepted in the scientific
community as necessary to validate research findings including datasets used
to support scholarly publications, but does not included laboratory notebooks,
preliminary analyses, draft of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer
review reports, communications with colleagues, or physical objects, such as
laboratory specimens. (Holdren, 2013, p. 5)
By December 2013 no definite policy has emerged, yet three approaches are gaining
ground. The first, put forth by a coalition of scholarly publishers, is named Clearinghouse for
Open Research for the United States (CHORUS). In this approach data reside with the publisher
and through a series of metadata tags and monitoring of embargo periods scientific research
becomes available over time (Ratner, 2013). ARL put forth a competing proposal named the

10

Shared Access Research Ecosystem (SHARE). In this approach universities (their libraries) build
and maintain a serious of interlinked institutional repositories in which commercial search
engines, such as Google Scholar, provide cross-searching and retrieval (Association of American
Universities, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, & Association of Research
Libraries, 2013). A third approach, without any official sponsor, is named “PubFed Central”
(Crotty, 2013, para 4), which expands the use of PubMed Central® to all federal agencies.7
The Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR), a bill introduced in
Congress8 on February 14, 2013, focuses on published journal articles, often thought of as the
finished product of research and not the actual research data generated throughout the process.
The bill would require at least 11 U.S. government agencies with annual extramural research
expenditures of more than $100 million to make manuscripts of journal articles stemming from
research funded by that agency freely accessible and reusable via the Internet. The Public Access
to Public Science Act (PAPS), a bill introduced in the House on September 19, 2013, requires
four federal agencies9 to develop public-access policies that “allow the public to read, download,
and analyze by machine covered works in digital form” ("Public Access to Public Science Act,"
2013, 2.b.1). These new potential mandates and policies are prompting a wider discussion about
data sharing and management among researchers and other stakeholders in publicly-funded
research, including journal publishers. Moreover they are sparking the creation of public data
7

“PubMed Central® (PMC) is a free archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National
Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NIH/NLM). In keeping with NLM’s legislative mandate to
collect and preserve the biomedical literature, PMC serves as a digital counterpart to NLM’s extensive print journal
collection. Launched in February 2000, PMC was developed and is managed by NLM’s National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NLM), 2011)” (National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NLM), 2011, para 1).
8
FASTR in the Senate (S. 350) was introduced on February 13, 2013 by John Cornyn (R-TX) and Ron Wyden (DOR) and introduced in the House (H.R. 708) the same day by Mike Doyle (D-PA), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), and Kevin
Yoder (R-KS). The bill was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and the Senate
version was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
9
The four agencies are: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Science
Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Weather Service
(NWS). The bill was referred to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.

repositories based on subject, location, and/or organization10 (Birney et al., 2009; Doctorow,
2008; Howe et al., 2008; Schofield et al., 2009).
Despite the benefits of sharing datasets, the means to share data are still new, and
acceptance of the practice varies by field of study and individual researchers (Birney et al., 2009;
Nelson, 2009). Worldwide the process of sharing data can be so confusing that some scientific
researchers are limiting themselves to informal distribution options unless mandated by a
funding organization (Nelson, 2009). The method of sharing data may be formally specified by a
funder’s policy or a publisher’s requirement, such as creating a separate version of the data that
is annotated and in which all personal, identifiable information is removed. Data may also be
shared informally among co-authors or co-investigators within the same research group where
there is a high level of trust and the risk is perceived to be low (University of Edinburgh, 2009).11
Some researchers are so concerned about surrendering their data to other researchers before all
potential uses are exhausted that they are unwilling to share. Those researchers who are willing
to share data must decide which data to distribute and then determine whether there are existing
standards that dictate format.
Institutional Support for E-Science
Meeting the needs of researchers working in the highly data intensive environment of escience requires the appropriate support services, infrastructure, and policies to be in place.
Considering the growth of data and pace of change associated with e-science, many research
institutions are simply reacting to the data management needs of individual researchers instead of

10

Examples of formal subject based data repositories include arXiv.org for physics, mathematics, and computer
science; the International Council for Science’s World Data System (http://www.icsu-wds.org/services/data-portal)
for geophysics; and Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org/pdb/home/home.do) and GenBank
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank) for molecular biology.
11
Informal methods of sharing data include posting files on internal networks, distributing data through e-mail,
DVD or CD-ROM upon request, or distribution through social media sites.

taking a systematic approach and providing institutional level solutions. The stages of
cyberinfrastructure development present a common set of difficulties whether in a nascent stage
of development, in practical deployment and operation, or stabilized as an institution (Ribes &
Lee, 2010), and call for a strategic approach:
Campuses are making local CI [cyberinfrastructure] investments ranging from minimal
capabilities up through multi-teraflop computational systems with support facilities.
Lacking is the larger goal of developing a coherent, coordinated vision to leverage these
capabilities among the individual, campus, and national facilities. (EDUCAUSE Campus
Cyberinfrastructure Working Group and Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation,
2009, p. 4)
The development and implementation of university-wide solutions will require the input and
participation of a wide variety of institutional entities, including academic departments,
computing services, libraries, and the offices of research services; no one office, department, or
center will be able to provide everything that is required due to the scale of the issue. Research
institutions already have considerable experience in providing a research infrastructure for their
constituents, but this expertise must be integrated, built up, and expanded. Researchers are
asking questions such as where data will be stored, who owns the data, how to connect and
collaborate across institutions and across the world, and who will pay for infrastructure
investments. Each research institution must answer these questions based on its local
environment and culture. To do so, research institutions have assembled task forces, committees,
or working groups with cross representation from various departments on campus to address
these issues and offer recommendations for a more strategic approach (Ogburn, 2010).

13

Role of the University Research Library in Providing E-Science Services
Within the scientific research community, there is an identified need to improve the
management of the massive amounts of research data that are generated daily as the research
process becomes more technology-based, collaborative, and data intensive (Doctorow, 2008).
Recognizing the importance of this issue, the NSF has a cyberinfrastructure vision for the
twenty-first century that features goals to support innovation in data management and
distribution systems, including the continued development of digital libraries to house scientific
data (National Science Foundation, 2007). Some of the challenges that researchers encounter
when meeting data management needs are long-term preservation, short-term storage, data
sharing, digital rights, copyright, metadata creation, and the creation and availability of user tools
(Pritchard, Anand, & Carver, 2005). Successful data management programs are highly
collaborative and include participation by researchers, computer scientists, networking
specialists, and university administrators, as well as national data centers, funding agencies, and
libraries (Friedlander & Adler, 2006).
Libraries at research universities offer expertise and skills to the research community in
the selection of resources, metadata creation, preservation, data organization and management,
and access management. Some of these libraries are developing data reference and consulting
services and are informing faculty and other researchers about the importance of preserving and
sharing raw data. A few libraries are involved in the planning phases of research projects,
designing data management plans, providing workspace for researchers to collaborate
(physically and virtually), and contributing to the development of institutional-level policies
regarding data management (Choudhury, 2008; Cornell University Library Data Working Group,
2008; Delserone, 2008; Gabridge, 2009; Johnston & Hanson, 2010; Soehner, Steeves, & Ward,

14

2010; University of Minnesota Libraries, 2006; Witt, 2008). University research libraries are also
developing partnerships by creating and managing long-standing archives, generating policies
and programs for open access to scholarly information, and developing user-focused tools for
data mining and information discovery (Joint Task Force on Library Support for E-Science,
2007; Mullins, 2007; Steinhart et al., 2008; Walters, 2009).
The ARL Joint Task Force on Library Support for E-Science maintains that university
research libraries have an important role in managing and preserving research-generated
datasets; however, data management is just one aspect of e-science (Atkins et al., 2003; Pritchard
et al., 2005). There is a range of opportunities within e-science for libraries to extend their
services (Soehner et al., 2010); however, the extent to which they become involved in other
areas, such as developing new tools and services, forming new partnerships, and collaborating
with researchers, depends on a commitment from library administration to support this new
direction. In order for a library to engage in any e-science program on campus, it must first
establish itself as a valued strategic partner (one that can provide physical and/or intellectual
resources towards the achievement of a defined common goal) and form good working
relationships with faculty and those associated with envisioning the role of e-science or eresearch. For libraries that are able to form these new relationships, the ARL E-Science Task
Force suggest the results might redefining those research libraries for the future (Joint Task
Force on Library Support for E-Science, 2007, p. 5). As Gold (2007b) states, e-science has the
potential to both revitalize and transform university research libraries.
Conclusion
As science becomes increasingly characterized by large-scaled collaborations and
computational datasets, researchers face a range of data management challenges and needs.

15

Librarians can offer researchers at their institutions a range of data management programs and
services associated with e-science (see Figure 1.4). Librarians have the opportunity to connect
and collaborate in new ways with the research communities within their institutions. Along with
actually identifying, curating, preserving, and archiving datasets, and assigning metadata
elements, librarians can teach researchers and students about data management fundamentals and
assist researchers with writing data management plans. The traditional roles of librarians can be
adapted to work in this new data environment; at the same time, they may need to acquire
additional knowledge, skills, and abilities. The librarians that fill these research roles may be
called e-science librarians, scientific data curators, data librarians, informationists, or embedded
librarians (Creamer, Martin, & Kafel, in press). Whatever the title, some university research
librarians are already participating in these activities, while others are examining models to best
provide a range of research data services. Redefining relationships and assuming new roles will
require time and resources. Libraries must determine how e-science services and programs align
with the existing mission, vision, and priorities; and then, they must ask what changes are
needed.

employed to address the questions regarding the academic library’s role and responsibilities
related to e-science. The chapter starts with the problem statement, which sets up the parameters
of the study and its originality. The investigator then provides a literature review on the role of
academic libraries in developing and providing e-science services. Following this, the research
design presents a description of the process the investigator used to determine the institutions to
approach as potential participants, along with the case study methodology she used.

Chapter 2
THE STUDY’S REFLECTIVE INQUIRY AND PROCEDURES

As advances in research benefit from the power of high-performance computing,
researchers, with the support of their institution and other service providers, are developing and
using new tools and services to manage the resulting abundance of data. The knowledge, skills,
and abilities librarians required to facilitate and participate in this data-driven research, go well
beyond familiarity with disciplinary literature (Luce, 2008).
Redefining relationships and assuming new roles will require time and resources. It will
necessitate reallocating some library resources from the management of traditional collections to
engaging with the research community and for librarians to assume new roles as data managers.
These types of opportunities, however, will vary from institution to institution based on the
extent to which the library participates in and leads them. The senior leadership team of each
library must determine how e-science services and programs align with the existing mission,
vision, and priorities; and then, they must ask what changes are needed.
Problem Statement
Many university libraries whose institutions have membership in the Association of
Research Libraries (ARL) have a foundation in collaboration, outreach, and knowledge
management from which to assist the research community and become contributing partners in
departmental and institutional level e-research initiatives. The degree to which these libraries
have a role in e-research initiatives at the department and institutional levels and the internal
changes implemented to assume that role, however, have not been examined. This study fills that
void by exploring how and why ARL universities and their libraries became engaged in one

26

aspect of e-research, namely, e-science, how e-science was conceived and implemented within
such institutions, the structural and programmatic changes that have occurred in the libraries to
provide e-science services and programs, and the library leadership necessary to bring about
those changes. The intention is to focus on libraries and the support and programs they offer, but
within the institutional context.
Research regarding the role of libraries in e-science is timely because many research
libraries are seeking to assume a larger role in e-science programs at the institutional level. The
results of this study provide those libraries considering the implementation of an e-science
program with a greater understanding of how other university libraries are designing and
implementing e-science programs and how the institutional context affects these efforts.
Moreover, this research raises awareness of the issues associated with realizing e-science
programs, such as needed resources and skills, the importance of strategic partnerships, and
barriers to change. The study assists libraries considering a role in e-science by showing how to
integrate programs and services with existing activities, raising awareness about the types of
changes that are needed, and exploring the leadership needed to bring about a successful escience support program.
Given the interdisciplinary nature of e-science, the findings of this study are also of
interest to those working in related areas such as computer science departments, campus
computing centers, upper administration, and those studying change management. A successful
e-science program is collaborative by nature — each group of potential partners can benefit from
learning more about e-science programming and services, and how the library can be a part of
those programs. In addition, these findings can be applied beyond e-science--this study’s

27

findings suggest strategies for libraries seeking to support e-research programs in the social
sciences and humanities.
Literature Review
Libraries and E-Science Support
The early twenty-first century surge in e-science projects can be linked to increased
funding in the biological and physical sciences (Ribes & Lee, 2010). The proliferation of projects
has provided an opportunity for university research libraries to form new partnerships, contribute
to institutional-level planning and policies, develop new services, and collaborate with other
libraries. The majority of studies of e-science activities in libraries consist of reports on ongoing
planning (Brant, 2007; Johnston & Hanson, 2010), development, and deployment of related
services (Arms et al., 2009; Choudhury, 2010; Denison, Kethers, & McPhee, 2007; Garritano &
Carlson, 2009; Soehner et al., 2010; Walters, 2009), or explanations of the concepts of e-science
and calls for library involvement (Heidorn, 2011; Hey & Hey, 2006; Joint Task Force on Library
Support for E-Science, 2007; Macdonald & Uribe, 2008; Mullins, 2009; Rambo, 2009).
Soehner et al. (2010) provide the most comprehensive report on e-science activities in
ARL affiliated libraries to date. The results of their survey of 123 ARL libraries indicate that, in
2009, 44 of 57 respondents support e-science activities or plan to do so. The information
gathered from follow-up phone interviews at Purdue University, the University of California,
San Diego, Cornell University, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Illinois at Chicago,
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology served as the basis for developing more in-depth
case studies to highlight programs and services currently offered by those libraries. The six case
studies illustrate that each library is working in a unique culture and environment. Obstacles to
developing e-science programming, such as limited resources and skill sets, deciding whether to

28

hire new staff versus re-training existing staff, and the lack of a unified direction at the
institutional level, are some of the barriers faced by the case study libraries.
Libraries and Data Management
For many libraries a first step in getting involved in e-science has been to take an active
role in projects that center around data management and data-related services (Ferguson, 2012;
Reznik-Zellen et al., 2012). Libraries involved in data management often started with a service
role. For example, a library may offer an introductory non-credit course on data management for
graduate students and provide a website with a list of resources to assist students and faculty with
data management. Introductory services can lead to the library working with individuals to offer
more specialized and customized services. Table 2.1 is a compilation of services related to data
management taken from case studies by Choudhury (2008), Garritano and Carlson (2009), and
Soehner et al. (2010).

* Adapted from Gold (2010).
Despite Lewis’ (2008) comment that the library’s role regarding e-science and data
management is secure (p. 51), many libraries see mixed results related to the categories
mentioned in the table (Salo, 2010). Partnerships have been formed to write grants, but if the
grants are not funded, the partnerships then focuses more on identifying new sources of funding
and less on providing services (Soehner et al., 2010). Few libraries have been invited to
participate in institutional-level policy making. Faculty are not always receptive to the library’s
gestures to assist on research projects, and are hesitant to share their data (McKay, 2010).
Libraries also confront the challenge of recruiting staff with a mix of computer, subject, and
library knowledge to work with data (Joint Task Force on Library Support for E-Science, 2007).
However, some libraries have been successful. The case studies presented by Soehner et al.

30

(2010) identify libraries that have formed new departments specifically designed to develop and
provide e-science services. Librarians in these departments are creating new tools for data
discovery, analysis, and deposit, and are finding researchers willing to collaborate on e-science
related projects (Arms et al., 2009; Choudhury, 2008; Lage, Losoff, & Maness, 2011; Soehner et
al., 2010; Zhao, 2009). Some library administrators are redefining the concept of the liaison
librarian and opting to embed librarians fully into departments to offer customized services and
partnership on research projects (Shumaker & Talley, 2010). Embedded librarians can be
assigned to one project on a short-term basis (Carlson & Kneale, 2011), or they can be
department-based, where the librarians are hired on a long-term basis to work on a range of
projects with varying responsibilities (Oliver & Roderer, 2006).
One way in which libraries are preparing to offer data management service is by gaining
an understanding of data management practices among researchers (Tenopir et al., 2011). They
are doing this by interviewing faculty and researchers to discuss their information needs (Lage et
al., 2011; Witt, Carlson, Brandt, & Cragin, 2009). These studies have shown that different
disciplines have unique needs (e.g., confidentiality requirements, the amount of data to be
managed, and proprietary formats), which means that libraries need to realize that data
management services must be highly customizable and flexible (J. C. Molloy, 2011). As libraries
become more involved in data management services, the level of support required and the cost of
that support increase (Reznik-Zellen et al., 2012).
Faculty, researcher, and student interviews have also shown a need for teaching data
literacy1 at various education levels and for librarians to be an essential part of that training

1

Data Literacy in the sciences can be described as the "knowledge and skills involved in collecting, processing,
managing, evaluating, and using data for scientific inquiry. Although there are similarities in information literacy
and digital literacy, science data literacy specifically focuses less on literature-based attributes and more on
functional ability in data collection, processing, management, evaluation, and use. This emphasis on operational

31

(Carlson, Fosmire, Miller, & Nelson, 2011; Piorun et al., 2012). Gabridge (2009) points out that
“academic communities have a constantly revolving community of students who arrive with …
uneven skills in data management. … Librarian subject liaisons already teach students how to be
self-sufficient, independent information consumers. This role can be easily extended to include
instruction on data management and planning” (p. 17). Teaching data management provides
libraries with opportunities to extend current instructional services; however, it is important to
have a clear understanding of research needs in this area and to possess the knowledge to be
effective instructors.
Desired Skills and Continuing Education of Library Professionals
As library professionals carve out their roles in data management, the question arises as
to what knowledge, skills, and abilities are needed to develop and provide e-science services and
become effective members of research teams. Some librarians describing their experiences
working on e-science projects have identified knowledge that they thought would be useful, such
as subject expertise and familiarity with current metadata standards (Garritano & Carlson, 2009).
However, there are studies that have employed a more systematic approach to identifying the
knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for data management. Lankes, Cogburn, Oakleaf, and
Stanton (2008) propose the new role of “cyberinfrastructure facilitators (CI-Facilitator),”
individuals who foster collaboration between the scientist and the information professional. After
analyzing research and technology-focused federal job descriptions and comparing that
information with the results of interviews of faculty and students from a variety of science,
technology, engineering, and medical fields, they concluded that knowledge of information
technology alone would not suffice; specific subject knowledge was also needed. Cox, Verbaan,

skills coincides with the practice-based production, operation, and use of digital datasets during scientific research”
(Read, 2013, Definition).

32

and Sen (2012) take this one step further to suggest that experience in doing research is also a
critical ability:
Librarians often lack direct personal experience of research and so may lack a
depth of insight into the motives and practices of researchers. Understanding
the diversity of ‘research data’ itself, within the context of different
disciplinary and sub-disciplinary cultures and varying data practices is an
important aspect of the context that needs to be understood. (para. 5)
Stanton et al. (2011) placed students in master’s level library and information science
(LIS) programs on e-science projects and asked them to keep a log of their activities. The log
analysis, which sought out mentions of technology skills and subject expertise, found that escience professionals needed to work with data (metadata standards, data integrity, and quality
assurance), people (communication skills, project management skills, and ability to collaborate),
and things (web content management systems, grid computing, and scripting and programming).
They undertook their analysis with the intent of developing a graduate-level curriculum to be
included in LIS programs; however, they concluded that most e-science positions are not asking
for such a diverse range of skills to be present in one person, and, due to the large number of
courses that would be needed, that it is unlikely that students could take the suggested number of
courses in a two-year program. Rather, the authors suggest that students choose a range of
electives depending on their interests and locate internships to gain on-the-job experience.
Taking the employers’ side of the issue, Alvar, Brooks, Ham, Poegel, and Rosencrans
(2011) examined a series of librarian job advertisements that they categorized as e-science
related. Similar to previous studies, they found that communication and collaboration were the

33

most sought after personal abilities, along with subject knowledge and technical expertise in
working with and managing data.
With LIS programs unable to provide all the training needed to become an e-science
professional, it falls on the employing library and individual librarian to have applicable postgraduate training. Creamer, Morales, Crespo, Kafel, and Martin (2012) surveyed health science
and science and technology librarians to determine the areas in which they thought there was a
need for additional training to meet the requirements of researchers who request data
management services. Participants indicated a need to learn about conducting data interviews,
assisting with creating data management plans, and gaining hands-on experience in curating and
describing large datasets. As a result of their survey, they have developed an online portal2 to
help librarians learn more about educational opportunities related to e-science librarianship.
International Activities
Supporting e-science is an institutional, regional, national, and global concern
(Lippincott, 2010). For example the Research Councils in the United Kingdom (RCUK) began
planning for e-science in 2001 by investing in a national research infrastructure with centers that
focus on the preservation and curation of research data and the development of collaboration
tools to be used by virtual research communities. This effort continued in 2006 with
representatives from the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC), the Research Information
Network (RIN), and the British Library, and culminated with the release of a report, 20/20
Vision: An e-infrastructure for the next decade (Bicarregui et al., 2006). Library representatives
2

The E-Science Portal for New England Librarians (http://esciencelibrary.umassmed.edu/) is “designed for
librarians working in research organizations that generate, share, store and/or use data for basic scientific research in
the health, biological, and physical sciences. Bringing together resources on education, outreach and collaboration,
current practices and e-science news—the portal provides librarians with the tools, knowledge and skills to
effectively participate in networked science” (University of Massachusetts Medical School, 2010).

34

in this national report acknowledged that libraries have a role in e-science and reinforced the
importance of collaboration. The final report advocated for additional training and funding
resources to support e-science, and communicated the importance of adopting appropriate
metadata standards and developing national and subject-based research repositories, and the need
to fund theoretical and applied research to address long-term digital preservation and curation
requirements.
The development of the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) in in the United Kingdom was
based on the JISC/RCUK e-infrastructure initiatives.3 The DCC, which focuses on research and
disseminates information about data curation, has become a center for best practices and expert
advice and a clearinghouse for information on metadata standards, data management plans, and
repository software. JISC has also funded a number of studies that are shaping the role of

3

In addition to establishing the Digital Curation Centre there were eight identified initiatives for 2002-2005:
1.

Development through RSLG of a national repository for the preservation of e-journals used by the
community. Completion of the JISC e-journal archiving feasibility study commenced in April 2002 to
support the scoping and implementation of this service.

2.

Completion of a web-archiving feasibility study being jointly funded by JCIE and Wellcome Trust and
development of web-archiving initiatives including a pilot Archive for JISC Project websites in 20022003.

3.

Completion of preservation risk and retention criteria assessments for all JISC funded content, during
2002-3.

4.

Future calls in subsequent years to implement their recommendations for services, and integration of
preservation activity and standards into repositories funded by JISC.

5.

A series of community calls to support records management and digital preservation in institutions.
This would focus initially on records management but increasingly focus on digital preservation in
subsequent years.

6.

Development of the Digital Preservation Coalition as an independent entity with JISC membership and
sector activity supported by JISC.

7.

JISC Partnership funding. Facility for external organizations to propose joint funding of work of
mutual interest in support of this strategy.

8.

Continuing development of JISC Digital Preservation Focus activities through the work of the
Programme Director and Electronic Records Manager. (Beagrie, 2002)

35

libraries in data management (Frieman, Ward, Jones, Molloy, & Snow, 2010; Swan & Brown,
2008). Swan and Brown (2008) identify four distinct roles: data creator, data scientist, data
manager, and data librarian. Central to these roles is for data librarians to: train researchers to be
more data-aware, adopt a data archiving and preservation role, and train new data librarians.
Frieman et al. (2010) conducted semi-structured interviews to understand how researchers create,
manage, and preserve research data, teaching materials, and administrative records. Their
findings suggested a number of important things for librarians to consider when developing new
programs and services, such as the need for tools and resources to be simple, engaging, and easy
to access. The researchers with whom they spoke were interested in guidance and support for
data management, but were often unaware of existing resources and training. Researchers also
stated that training opportunities were often inconveniently timed and not well-tailored to their
individual needs. Many thought that brief training, online resources, or someone to talk to faceto-face would be more helpful.
A survey conducted by Cox and Pinfield (2013) of university libraries in the United
Kingdom identified how the libraries were involved in research data management and the extent
to which the development of research data management services was a strategic priority for
them. Outside of large research-intensive institutions Cox and Pinfield (2013) found limited
services were offered. Reasons given for the lack of more services were not having the adequate
skills and resources, as well as the need to institute a culture change across the institution. These
findings were also mirrored in the survey of services conducted by Corrall, Kennan, and Afzal
(2013) in which 140 libraries in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom were
surveyed for current and planned data management services, target audiences, service
constraints, and staff training needs. They found that it was important for library staff to

36

understand the research environment and methods and workflows in order to design and deliver
appropriate support services.
Efforts in the United Kingdom to plan for the infrastructure requirements related to escience and to work with scientists, computer professionals, and librarians to develop national
level principles and policies have resulted in a well-coordinated effort to advance e-science and
support the research community. Auckland (2012), writing for the RLUK (Research Libraries
UK), reports on the skills needed to support researchers and compares different types of library
support for researchers.
Libraries in the European Union (EU), Australia, and New Zealand are working in escience and participating in national policy level discussions (Digital Archiving Consultancy,
2008; Munch, 2011); however, when it comes to implementation at the local level, university
research libraries outside the U.S. are experiencing similar barriers to those identified by ARL
affiliated libraries (Hey & Hey, 2006; Kallenborn & Becker, 2008). After analyzing the role of
library and information-based services in a number of German-sponsored e-science projects in
2005-2006, Osswald (2008) discovered that only three of nine e-science projects involved
libraries. An analysis of sponsored research in the United Kingdom showed only two of 51
funded projects for that period were concerned with data management and data access (Osswald,
2008). Although EU libraries are experiencing difficulties in gaining formal recognition as
partners, many of them are creating the foundation for future partnerships and building digital
data repositories (Gastinger, 2009).
Theoretical Framework
The ARL Task Force on E-Science suggests that research libraries “engage the broader
community in a fundamental reassessment of the research library’s role and structure, in effect,

37

in redefining the research library for a new era” (Joint Task Force on Library Support for EScience, 2007, p. 5). The idea of remaking or transforming an organization is a common theme
in the change management literature (Huber & Glick, 1993; Levy & Merry, 1986; Waters,
Marzano, & McNulty, 2003; Watzlawick, Weakland, & Fisch, 1974). To categorize the change
experience of the libraries in this study, the characteristics of first-order change and second-order
change, as defined by Levy and Merry (1986), are used (see Table 2.2). First-order change
occurs naturally as organizations grow and develop, and support continuity and order (Bate,
1994); it is often consistent with current values and norms, is readily accepted, and can be
incorporated into daily activities using people’s existing knowledge and skills. Such change
consists of minor improvements and adjustments in systems, processes, or structures, but does
not involve a fundamental change in strategy, core values, or identity (Levy & Merry, 1986).
Second-order change involves not only developing the organization, but also
transforming the core of the organization. It is “multidimensional, multi-level, qualitative,
discontinuous, radical organizational change involving a paradigmatic shift” (Levy & Merry,
1986, p. 5). Second-order change challenges or conflicts with prevailing values and norms, and is
a break from the previous way of thinking and doing.
Levy and Merry (1986) developed their list of characteristics based on a survey of the
literature from the fields of management, organization, and change theory. First-order and
second-order changes have been the topic of numerous studies (Allen, 2009; Bess, 2006; Graf,
2010; Lanier, 2009; Sanders, 2009; Wilbur, 2005). Titus (1998) and Hanson (1995) have
specifically applied Levy and Merry’s work in the university setting. Those libraries that have
been successful in participating in e-science initiatives, they found, had a greater understanding

38

of the nature of change occurring and could better inform other libraries which are considering
becoming involved in e-science.

Procedures
Qualitative research, which is often multimethod, explores phenomena in a natural
setting, and interprets those phenomena in terms of the meanings people experience (Denzin &
Lincoln, 2005). One form of qualitative research is the case study, which is “an empirical inquiry
that investigates a contemporary phenomenon in depth and within its real-life context when the
boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident” (Yin, 2009, p. 18). This
study meets the criteria identified by Yin (2009) in that it:
•

studies a modern management problem;

•

uses a variety of data collection methods;

•

asks how something worked; and

•

seeks varied and complementary perspectives to address the research questions.

A multiple case design allows for the examination of processes and results across many
cases, the identification of how individual cases might be affected by different environments, and
the specific conditions under which findings occur. It may also help to form more general
categories of how the specific conditions might be related. This makes the results more
compelling than those from a single case and demonstrates the issues across a more varied range
of circumstances than a single case can provide. Generalizability could be enhanced relative to a
single case. Multiple-case designs are therefore more powerful than single-case designs in this
respect, and more extensive descriptions and explanations of the issues are developed (Chmiliar,
2009).
Site Selection
ARL, which is comprised of 126 research-intensive institutions in the United States and
Canada (as of October 2010), has been studying the role of libraries in e-science since 2007. To

42

narrow the focus of this study, the investigator eliminated non-university research public
libraries and government libraries in the United States and all Canadian libraries from the ARL
membership list, which reduced the population to 99 libraries. The investigator chose to focus on
U.S. libraries because these institutions are among the largest university recipients of federal
funds.
The investigator searched the library and institutional websites of the 99 members to
locate strategic planning documents, stated initiatives, institutional priorities, frameworks,
directions, annual reports, and mission and vision statements to determine if there were any
references to e-science. In addition, she reviewed the library’s website, the university’s main
website, and portions of the website dedicated to research departments, institutes, and centers. If
no relevant documents were available, or if the materials found were more than five years old,
the investigator sent an e-mail message to the online reference service at the library to determine
if such documents existed.
Nineteen libraries did not have strategic planning documents because they were either
currently engaged in the strategic planning process, had recently hired a new director, moved
away from formalized planning programs, or did not have any e-science activities documented at
the university level, reducing the population to 80. The collected documents were searched for
indicators of e-science, e-research, or cyber-research initiatives; Table 2.4 contains a list of the
relevant terms used in this search process.

The search produced 31 ARL libraries that had e-science initiatives at the library level
and formal support among institutional administrators. After a second review of strategic
planning documents, these 31 libraries were divided into three categories based on the StageGate®6 process (Cooper, 2001):
1. general discussion and data gathering: libraries that were just beginning to think
about planning e-science services;
2. planning, designing, and marketing: libraries that had made a commitment to
designing an e-science program but had not yet fully implemented programming; and
3. established programs and services: libraries that had already redesigned library
services, cultivated strategic partnerships, and were actively providing services.
Table 2.5 lists the specific criteria used to place member libraries into one of these three
categories. Of the 31 libraries, 7 were categorized as general, 14 as planning, and 10 as
established. Libraries in the general discussion and planning phases were eliminated from the list
of potential sites because they were not far enough along in the implementation process to add
meaningful content to the study. Duane Webster, Executive Director Emeritus of ARL, and Neil
Rambo, ARL Visiting Program Officer for Research and E-Science from 2007-2009, were
contacted and asked to review both the criteria used and the categorization of the 10 libraries.
They agreed that the criteria used were relevant and complete and that the libraries were properly
categorized.

6

The Stage-Gate® process has five steps: (1) assessing the environment, (2) building a business case, (3) product
development, (4) testing and validation, and (5) launch (Stage-Gate International, n.d.).

The investigator further narrowed down the 10 libraries with established programs to 6,
which represented public, private, and land-grant institutions, as well as institutions that had a
national reputation in the areas of scientific research and innovative programming. Then, the
investigator compiled supplemental data for the six sites, such as geographic location, total
research dollars, library budget, and number of library staff. The supplemental information,

46

along with the strategic planning documents and information from the websites of the six
institutions and libraries, was reviewed to complete a brief description of e-science activities.
There was much overlap in two of the six possible participants. As result, the number of
institutions to be invited to participate in the study was reduced from six to four.
Recruitment
The chair of the researcher’s dissertation committee sent an e-mail message to the library
directors7 outlining the research study, the importance of their participation in the study, and
notification that a formal letter requesting their inclusion would be sent via U.S. Postal Service
(see Appendix A). Once the chair received some indication that the director was willing to
participate in the study, the investigator sent a letter on institutional letterhead. The letter
included an introduction, an overview of the research project, and a request for a telephone call
to discuss inclusion in the research study (see Appendix B).
During a subsequent phone conversation with the library director (or his/her designee),
the investigator confirmed that the library had been placed in the correct category. Once the
placement was confirmed, the investigator conveyed to the director the importance of the
library’s participation in the research project, and reviewed the information on the library’s escience activities that had been collected from the institution and library websites. The
conversation included potential library personnel and external partners to be interviewed. The
investigator also reviewed the purpose of the focus group interviews, and requested a list of
names of potential staff to participate.

7

“Director” will be used as the common title throughout this dissertation in place of individual titles such as dean of
libraries or university librarian to help disguise identities.

47

Methodology
For this study, the investigator employed a multimethod approach to data collection. This
included developing institutional histories of the institutions’ involvement in e-science, gathering
and analyzing relevant documentation, and conducting semi-structured interviews (narrative
inquiry), and focus group interviews. The institutional history established the context in which escience activities were occurring. Relevant documents offered additional information on the
context in which the institution and the library were operating. Using semi-structured interviews,
the investigator asked people to recall a sequence of major events associated with e-science and
how e-science had been implemented in the library. Focus group interviews afforded an
opportunity for those in the library providing e-science services to reflect on their experiences
and the changes that have occurred in the library. Table 2.6 links the various methods and
instruments used throughout the study to the study’s research questions.

Document Analysis
Document types of various kinds were collected to provide a brief history of how the
institutions, strategic partners, and the libraries became involved in e-science. The result is an
extensive picture of e-science at each institution, specifically regarding the role of the library.
The researcher searched the website of each institution for publicly-available documents related
to e-science activities and requested that the individuals participating in the study provide any
additional documentation. Document types included, but were not limited to, strategic planning
documents, annual reports, speeches, team or committee reports, job advertisements, newspaper
clippings, journal articles, and professional presentations. All documents were reviewed and

52

those that were relevant were further examined using thematic analysis; thematic analysis is the
analysis of text (or other symbolic materials) for the presence of certain themes, trends, and
concepts.
Institutional History
An institutional history is a narrative that records key points about institutional processes
and events over time that (in this case) led to the emergence and advancement of e-science. The
purpose is to introduce institutional factors (see the section on research questions) into the
narrative regarding the status of e-science at each institution (Prasad, Hall, & Thummuru, 2006).
An institutional history of e-science activities was developed for each site based on document
analysis and was supplemented with information obtained in the interviews.
Narrative Inquiry
Stories are communicated from generation to generation as a method of teaching values
as well as lessons about life. These stories often follow a pattern of birth, death, rebirth;
separations, initiation, return; or simply, beginning, middle, resolution. The basic pattern of
conflict followed by resolution, or crisis followed by victory, is a way that stories provide the
audience with a sense of shared past and common cause (Atkinson, 1998).
Narrative inquiry involves the use of stories to identify key events. The researcher works
with participants to probe one or more of the major events in order to document the interviewees’
stories about their experience, and to understand the context in which the stories are remembered
and communicated. “The purpose is to see how respondents in interviews impose order on the
flow of experiences to make sense of events and actions” (Riessman, 1993, p. 2). The researcher
is then able to reconstruct a holistic picture of the environment in all its complexity and richness
(Webster & Mertova, 2007) in which key events and individuals are identified. In this study, key

53

events are described as setting strategic goals, reaching important milestones, reorganizing the
institution, and assigning resources to e-science. Narratives, as described by Ospina and Dodge
(2005), have five essential characteristics:
1. They serve as an account of characters and selected events that occur over time, with
a beginning, middle, and end.
2. They are retrospective interpretations of sequential events from a certain point of
view.
3. They focus on human intention and action.
4. They are part of the process of constructing identity (self in relation to others).
5. They are coauthored by the narrator and the audience. (p. 145)
Narrative inquiry has been applied in a number of relevant subject areas, such as
information technology (Cater-Steel, Hine, & Grant, 2010), higher education (Clandinin &
Connelly, 1996; De Long, 2012; MacCarrick, 2009; Spiller, 2010), change management (GarciaLorenzo, 2010), and organizational studies (Boje, 1991; Czarniawska, 2007). Narrative inquiry is
useful in organizing and finding meaning in past events; in organizations it can be used to
identify which actions contributed positively or negatively to attaining set goals (Polkinghorne,
1988, 1995).
Narrative inquiry was used with the representatives from university administration,
strategic partners, library directors, and associate directors to build on the information discovered
during document analysis; major events were used to engage the participants as they shared their
stories and perspectives of how the universities became involved in e-science and how the role of
the libraries evolved (see Tables 2.7 and 2.8).

Semi-Structured Interviews
The library director and the associate or assistant director responsible for overseeing escience activities were interviewed. These interviews provided different viewpoints of library e-

56

science activities, the development of the programs and services, and the changes that have taken
place. They also indicated how the libraries responded, both internally and externally, to the need
to support e-science on campus.
The interviews built on the information identified in the document analysis (see Table
2.9). The interview questions were brief and succinct; they addressed one issue at a time by
focusing on e-science, determining how and why participants became involved, identifying their
roles, and highlighting any memorable events that were part of the implementation process. Each
interview included an introduction, detailed questions, and a wrap up (Courage & Baxter, 2005).

Focus Group Interviews
To gain the perspective of those developing and offering e-science programs and
services, a focus group interview was conducted at each institution with library staff members.
The investigator used this approach because such interviews enable in-depth examination of a
topic as the participants discuss their experiences and the interviewer gains a rich understanding
of the issues from their perspectives. The emphasis was on the changes that occurred in the
library because of the library’s involvement in supporting e-science and on who is leading these
changes; Table 2.10 lists the pertinent questions.

59

The library director or designee issued the invitation to potential focus group participants,
requesting their participation in the interview. The investigator explained the purpose of the
study and supplied potential participants with relevant information before the focus group
interview was conducted to assist them in deciding whether to participate.

The investigator served as moderator, probed for responses, and encouraged everyone in
attendance to participate. With the permission of all study participants, she used a digital
recorder to capture the sessions and hired a professional transcription service to transcribe the
recordings (see next section).
Data Collection
Data collection, which occurred in fall 2011 and winter 2012, focused on the five-year
period from January 2005 to December 2010. The emergence of e-science may have begun at the
case study sites before 2005, but a national dialog began among the scientific community in 2005
with the publication of Long-lived digital data collections: Enabling research and education in
the 21st century (National Science Board, 2005). This work brought the importance of preserving
datasets to the forefront. In 2006, ARL formed a Joint Task Force on Library Support for EScience to explore the role of libraries in e-science, stating that it was time to get involved. Since
many strategic plans look three to five years out, participating libraries that have set goals related
to e-science would have had time to plan and launch initiatives within the five years covered by
the study. Activities prior to 2005 are included in the institutional history as appropriate. In some
cases, the persons selected to participate in the study have not been working at the institution for
the entire five-year period covered by the study. In this situation, participants were asked to
discuss their experiences since they arrived at the institution.
When it was not possible to schedule a face-to-face meeting with the library director or
associate director while the investigator was visiting the campus, the interview was conducted
over the telephone. Everyone who was interviewed was asked to sign a consent form stating his
or her agreement to participate and allowing the interview session to be recorded with a digital
recorder (see Appendix C). These recordings were transcribed by a professional transcription

61

service. The transcripts were sent to participants to review before the analysis. The finalized
versions were used for thematic analysis and were the basis for the case reports.
Data Analysis
Thematic analysis was used to process data transcribed from the interviews as well as
from the collection of relevant documents. A codebook was developed after carefully reading the
documents and transcripts to define codes for themes and subthemes (see Table 2.11 for an
excerpt from the codebook). Then, all documents were re-read, marking and coding text
instances of themes and subthemes with theme codes. After all transcript coding was completed,
text segments that were similarly coded for each library were grouped together for further
analysis in a spreadsheet. Once the coded-text instances were clustered within the library for
each theme code, code validation was conducted. All text instances for each theme code were
read to ensure they had been properly coded into that particular theme category. If they had been
coded incorrectly, they were recoded and regrouped with the correct theme code (Klenke, 2008).

Hierarchical analysis was then conducted using the codes in the codebook to determine
whether any of the theme-code groupings could be grouped to help define a higher-level concept
that encompassed multiple theme groups. Hierarchical analysis of theme codes continued from
the bottom up until the key major theme groupings of significance were identified. The theme
hierarchy is represented in a tree structure with the most significant themes at the top. The
researcher then reviewed each major theme code for each library and compared theme instances
across cases with Levy’s and Merry’s (1986) characteristics of first- order change and secondorder change (see Table 2.2), and with the services identified in Table 2.1.
Data Quality
It is typical for two people experiencing the same event to describe what happened
differently. The story to be re-told depends on the values and interests of the narrator: “A
personal narrative is not meant to be read as an exact record of what happened nor is it a mirror
of a world ‘out there’” (Riessman, 1993, p. 64). Webster and Mertova (2007) have observed that
there is “consensus in the literature on narrative research that it [narrative research] should not be
judged by the same criteria as those that are applied to more traditionally and broadly accepted
qualitative and quantitative research methods” (p. 89). However, there are still methods to test
the dependability of the data (reliability), as well as the strength of data analysis, trustworthiness
of the data, and ease of access to data (validity). As suggested by Yin (2009), the investigator
created a case study protocol, a case study database, and a chain of evidence by which an
independent investigator could “follow the derivation of any evidence from initial research
questions to ultimate case study conclusions” (p. 122). In addition, the investigator provided the
interviewees with a summary of their sessions and offered them the opportunity to make
corrections, add clarification, or supply additional information, if necessary. She also provided

63

the library director (or designee) with a draft case study report and requested that the person
supply any revisions to ensure its accuracy.
Validity
Riessman (1993) offers four tests for validity that were used in this study. The first test is
persuasiveness; this test asks if the interpretations of the data are reasonable and convincing.
This test will require any theoretical claims to be supported with direct evidence from study
participants’ accounts and alternative interpretations of the data to be considered. The second test
is correspondence; analytic categories, interpretations, and conclusions are shared with the
participants to determine if there is a recognizable and adequate representation of events. This
test served as an opportunity for the participants to determine whether confidentiality was
preserved. A third test is coherence. This test for validity exists at three different levels: global
(goal of the narrator is known), local (the effect of the story is known), and themal (repeated
themes); the data collected comes together to form a narrative. The fourth and final test of
validity, pragmatic use, determines whether the study’s results are useful to future researchers.
This test is future oriented and will not be considered as part of this research process.
Inter-coder Reliability
The investigator recruited two additional researchers with content analysis experience to
code a portion of the interview transcripts from each participant and sample of collected
documents. The results were compared with each other as well as with those of the investigator.
These activities resulted in 96 percent intercoder reliability. Intercoder reliability refers to the
extent to which two or more independent coders agree on the coding of the content of interest
with an application of the same coding scheme. Ninety-percent agreement or greater is

64

considered highly reliable (Cho, 2008). In addition, the investigator coded the same content more
than once to ensure stability.
Pre-Test
In order to ensure the quality of data collected throughout this study, the investigator
conducted a pre-test at a site selected by the investigator and her dissertation committee. Prior to
the site visit, the investigator reviewed the research proposal, research questions, and period of
the study (January 2005-December 2010) with the director of libraries at the study site. Based on
this review, an appointment was scheduled with selected library staff to review the study
objectives, research questions, interview scripts, and potential study sites.
The investigator also gathered feedback and comments on the invitation to participate and
subsequent follow-up e-mail messages. In addition, the investigator gained valuable information
on issues associated with scheduling the required interviews in a two-day period. Most
importantly, the pre-test provided the investigator with feedback on the study research questions,
and data collection process; suggestions were incorporated before visiting the institutions
selected for the study.
Nature of Change
To verify the characterization of first-order and second-order change, two researchers
received a randomized list with changes that came from the interviews and from the document
analysis. These outside researchers were asked to categorize the changes as first-order change or
second-order change. The results were compared with each other as well as with those of the
investigator. Results of the parallel content analyses were in agreement for 95 percent of the
coding. For the remaining 5 percent, data were compared and differences resolved.

Conclusion
Changes in how research is conducted will have an effect on how the library carries out
its mission of supporting research and other information needs of the university. The traditional
processes of library acquisition and preservation of scholarly materials were suitable when
scholarly outputs were principally in tangible forms and the responsibility for its stewardship
was relatively clear (Ogburn, 2010). There are potentially important new roles for librarians in
contributing to data management and supporting research as digital data present new challenges
because of volume and relative value of data. Librarians recognize the value of maintaining
primary documents for the historical record; they are also cognizant of the planning and effort
long-term preservation requires (Carlson & Garritano, 2010). As well, librarians are experienced
in navigating complex information systems, have an understanding of how system architecture
relates to user needs, and are familiar with the importance of incorporating standards to
interoperability.
The role of the library is still being defined and must be balanced with practical skill
development and strategic perspectives (Luce, 2008); however, it is clear that university research
libraries have opportunities to develop new services and forge new partnerships. How four
libraries initiate and implement these changes will be explored in Chapter 3.

Chapter 3
OVERVIEW OF THE FOUR CASE STUDIES

A representative of each library director assisted the investigator with the logistical
arrangements for the site visits (case sites A, B, C, and D), including scheduling of interview
appointments, communicating with library employees to obtain focus group interview
volunteers, and arranging for meeting rooms.1 The investigator visited three sites (A, B, and C)
in November 2011, December 2011, and January 2012 respectively, with several follow-up
telephone calls when necessary. The interviews for site D were conducted by telephone in
February and March 2012.
All of the library directors, assistant library directors, and librarians agreed to be
interviewed; however, only in the cases of sites A and C was contact made with an institutional
representative from the office of research willing to participate in the study. Only site C provided
access to strategic partners (three of them); sites A, B, and D indicated that there were
appropriate strategic partners, but they were not available. Consequently institutional and
strategic partner data are used when available to supplement and validate the findings from the
interviews with library staff as well as the data available from the document review.
Table 3.1 shows some characteristics for the four universities, including differences in
key statistics. Each institution is classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching as a comprehensive doctoral institution with very high research activity; all but one has
a medical/veterinary school. Two institutions are located in the Midwest, one institution is in the

University A
The library at University A has been involved in e-science for approximately 10 years.
The process by which the library became involved was described as organic and grew out of the
library’s long history of supporting researchers, engaging in library and information science
research, remaining current in e-science issues, and monitoring the relevant literature, as well as
providing limited archival services for datasets when requested. The institution’s award of a
large long-term national grant raised unforeseen policy, data management, and metadata issues
as the data transitioned from being stored in boxes on cards and paper, to being captured
digitally. Researchers started looking for help with storage, access, and retrieval. As these issues
were identified university administration realized that the impact and implications of decisions
and systems being put in place went beyond the initial grant; awareness emerged that the
university needed to develop a comprehensive solution that could be adapted for use by other
researchers. When the library provided advice on metadata and worked with others groups such

79

as the office of research and information services on campus to address this need, it solidified its
involvement on campus.
Data Gathering
The investigator conducted personal interviews with the associate vice chancellor for
research, the library director, and the associate library director. She also convened a focus group
interview, but with only three librarians who provide e-science services. To expand her
understanding of the interview participants’ comments, the investigator consulted university and
library strategic planning documents, online press releases from the university’s administration,
scholarly articles written by librarians describing services, and web-based chronicles in the form
of news articles and blog posts. The following is a summary of the findings.
Institutional Perspective
At the institutional level, e-science has two main characteristics. First, it is thought of as
being highly collaborative and involving many different groups on campus (several of which are
administrative), and second, it is based on data that are born digitally and remain in a digital
format throughout their life cycle. E-science is a main generator of research data on campus, but
areas such as the humanities and social sciences also have significant data needs, and those data
formats are different from what is being generated in the life, physical, and engineering sciences;
these areas are also supported, fostered, and considered to be part of the larger domain of eresearch. E-science support on campus comes from a close working relationship among three

80

departments: (1) the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research,2 (2) the Chief Information
Officer,3 and (3) the library.
The university’s mission is based in research, teaching, and service and is built on a
foundation of collaboration. In e-science a shift has occurred from individual researchers
working independently to the formation of large institutes where people are brought together
under research themes. The focus is more multi- and inter-disciplinary than in the past. Overall,
there is a greater awareness across campus that information technology has become a ubiquitous,
indispensable component of research, information management, and decision making. To
strengthen the tradition of innovation and achievement, the university engages a broad array of
partners and stakeholders. As a whole, the institution facilitates boundary-crossing interactions
among departments and colleges when new knowledge generates new insights.
One barrier to the expansion of e-science campus wide has been cost. It is estimated that
it will take at least $4 million initially to provide the necessary infrastructure to manage
efficiently and effectively the data that are currently being produced on campus. This estimate
does not include administrative support or staffing. Another barrier is that since this is one of the
first institutions to move into this area (planning having begun in the late 1990s), there are no
identifiable best practices at the institutional level; decisions are being made as needed, but there
is a desire to implement a comprehensive plan rather than react to individual researcher needs.
As an example, a campus debate continues to focus on whether data management services should
be centralized or decentralized. Moreover, the institution has to deal with researcher resistance to
2

The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research has policymaking and oversight responsibility for the research
mission of the institution. The office works collaboratively with the academic colleges and other administrative units
to both lead new research initiatives and facilitate the ongoing scholarly endeavors of campus staff, students, and
faculty.

The campus Chief Information Officer is responsible for information technology strategies and capabilities
supporting excellence in research, education, and outreach. This includes information technology governance,
policy, central information technology services, and initiatives to exploit new technologies in support of scholarship.

81

sharing data. Embracing the new mindset of sharing data presents a new way of thinking for
some researchers. As funding agencies place more requirements on researchers to make their
data available for others, university administration views this as an opportunity for the campus to
discover and institutionalize best practices, to provide the necessary policies and provisions to
meet the requirements, and to increase institutional efficiencies.
Institutional View of the Library’s Role in Supporting E-Science
The library has taken a lead role in facilitating discussions on policies and services across
campus to determine what is needed to foster e-science collaboration. The library is driving the
evaluation procedures throughout the planning and implementation phases. The library is also
assuming a role in data curation. The university sees the library playing a major role in
overseeing whatever centralized service develops: “It is possible that this [service] could be
based in the library, supported by IT and research, rather than having it in the research office,”
said the Associate Vice Chancellor for Research.
Library-Based E-Science Services and Programs
Initially the library was involved in a number of digital humanities projects. Based on
that experience, library administration realized that: (1) the library needed a different technology
infrastructure to manage the large datasets associated with e-science, and, (2) to assist
researchers better with their data management needs, library faculty had to become involved in
the research process earlier on (see Table 3.2 for a full list of library e-science services as they
relate to each site).

Education. The education efforts related to e-science are twofold. First, the library
provides continuing education for librarians to upgrade their skills; anyone wanting to learn more
about e-science and data management will not be denied the opportunity. Second, librarians are
developing and offering workshops for faculty, students, and researchers focused on the benefits

83

of managing data, including how to manage data (e.g., file naming, storage, and versioning) on a
day-to-day basis; key points for preserving data; options for sharing data; and unique issues
related to data citations, intellectual property, and privacy. The goal is to ensure that the data will
be secure, discoverable, and preserved for future use. Other educational programs focus on
compliance with the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) data management requirements,4 the
visualization5 and presentation of data, management of bibliographic data, and tools for
collaboration. Educational programs are offered one-on-one, in small groups, and as self-paced
learning through online tutorials and presentations from the library website.
Policy. The library has assumed a major role advising on information related policies and
establishing university procedures related to e-science and data management. There has been
library representation as well as library leadership on university-wide committees dealing with
data management issues, such as infrastructure needs and facilitating data compliance options for
researchers. The library is also viewed across campus as the location for expertise on applying
and setting metadata standards.
Research. The library’s support of research is twofold. First, the library has been
successful in a number of instances in gaining grants to facilitate library-based research related to
data management. Second, the library is partnering with faculty to secure external funding to
support the library’s involvement with research teams as a contributing member.

4

Beginning in January 18, 2011, any new proposal submitted to NSF was required to include a supplementary
document of no more than two pages labeled "Data Management Plan" (National Science Foundation, n.d.).
5
A definitional of data visualization is “the graphical presentation of information, with the goal of providing the
viewer with a qualitative understanding of the information contents. Information may be data, processes, relations,
or concepts. Graphical presentation may entail manipulation of graphical entities (points, lines, shapes, images, text)
and attributes (color, size, position, shape). Understanding may involve detection, measurement, and comparison,
and is enhanced via interactive techniques and providing the information from multiple views and with multiple
techniques” (Ward, 2011, para. 1).

84

Services. The library’s most noted service is its institutional repository,6 which was
developed to preserve and provide persistent and reliable access to the digital research and
scholarship of faculty, staff, and students in order to give their works the greatest possible
recognition and distribution. The repository, used for online journal publishing and to facilitate
the dissemination and discovery of locally created datasets, provides permanent uniform resource
locators (URLs) and digital object identifiers for future referencing. It also provides a showcase
for the library to display its expertise in developing and modifying controlled vocabularies and
setting content standards.
The library also provides a number of consultation services, including copyright and
rights management, reference services, and data management planning. In addition, librarians
participate as members of research teams assisting with data management, and the library
actively seeks opportunities to increase those types of partnerships.
Delivery. E-science programs and services are delivered through departmental libraries
(e.g., engineering, agriculture, and life sciences). However, the library created a new department
to provide faculty, researchers, and students with access to experts in digital content creation and
analysis and geospatial, textual, and numeric data analysis services. In both instances the
emphasis is to partner on writing grant proposals as librarians seek to become embedded
throughout the research process.
Resources needed. Discussions about the resources needed to provide e-science
programs and services begin with having the appropriate staff and skill set. The library has hired
new staff with data management skills and has provided professional development opportunities
6

A definition of institutional repository is “a university-based institutional repository is a set of services that a
university offers to the members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital materials created
by the institution and its community members. It is most essentially an organizational commitment to the
stewardship of these digital materials, including long-term preservation where appropriate, as well as organization
and access or distribution” (Lynch, 2003, p. 2).

85

for all staff interested in learning more. Beyond knowledge of the tools needed to manage, mine,
and analyze data, librarians need to be able to explain the issues and have an understanding of
the research process, as well as to be advocates for the library’s role in providing expertise in
data management. Time management ability is also highly valued because e-science support is
viewed as an additional service to be assumed while maintaining the current offerings of library
educational and outreach programs and services.
The library purchases commercially available datasets when requested by faculty,
researchers, and students, but otherwise does not see the collection development policy as being
affected by e-science. On the other hand, the library identified a number of technology-related
improvements that needed to be completed in order to provide services, including increased data
storage capacity and the purchase of numerous high-end workstations. It also invested heavily in
the development of an institutional repository and improved web-discovery tools to assist
faculty, students, and researchers with locating library and institutional resources.
Instructional classrooms, collaborative work areas, and meeting spaces have been built
within the physical spaces of the main and departmental libraries to facilitate the work and
research associated with e-science. An information commons7 area was created in which library
faculty have set hours to work with faculty, researchers, and students to assist with their research
and data needs.
Implementation facilitators and barriers. A staff shortage was the primary barrier to
implementing e-science programs and services. Additionally, some researchers were interested in

7

Information commons is used here as a generic term. The characteristics of the information common are identified
as offering “shared spaces, real and virtual, where communities with common interests and concerns gather. They
take advantage of the networked environment to build information communities, and they benefit from network
externalities, meaning the greater the participation, the more valuable the resource. They are interactive,
encouraging discourse and exchange among their members. Many are free or low cost. Their participants often
contribute new creations after they gain and benefit from access” (Kranich, 2004, p. 30).

86

using the library solely as a data storage facility. The library was forthcoming in acknowledging
when this would be appropriate and when it was not. The library always sought to promote a full
suite of educational and data management services.
Facilitators to implementation have been both internal and external. Internally, the staff
directly involved in e-science work had made it a priority to develop and offer new services; they
have welcomed the challenge of the additional workload. Externally, national initiatives such as
the NSF’s data management requirements and the open access movement have helped bring the
library to the forefront as a center of expertise in the area of data management.
Changes Occurring to Provide E-Science Services and Programs
In 2007, library administration made a conscious effort through strategic planning and
reorganization to focus library services on a new future. E-science played a central role in that
planning and that future. As explained in the strategic plan,
Over the past several years, the term “E-Science” has been used to describe
new research methods in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities that
take advantage of increases in computing power, storage capacity, and
measurement techniques to ask new questions, as well as new information
and communication technologies that link data, people, and computational
services together in virtual organizations. E-Science encompasses
computationally-intensive inquiry carried out in distributed environments,
science that uses large datasets requiring grid computing, as well as inquiry
in the social sciences and humanities that requires the management and use
of quantitative data or the systematic mining of textual data. Pursuing this
proposal will ensure that the University Library will be in a position to

87

provide ongoing support to established and emergent e-science and escholarship programs across campus and with external partners.8
Early in the implementation phase of the strategic plan the library director rearranged the
departmental structure to form a new department to provide centralized services and programs
related to e-science, data management, and scholarly communication. This has resulted in a new
oversight structure and workflow changes for the library staff as faculty, researchers, and
students are now referred to the new department for consultation services. New staff members
were hired to work in this department.
The librarians stationed in departmental libraries found that they needed additional skills.
To feel more comfortable talking to researchers about their data needs, subject librarians sought
training opportunities and made efforts to increase their subject knowledge. This is viewed as a
critical step to becoming embedded in a department and to being considered as a potential
research partner.
Supporting e-science was viewed as both an added responsibility and a change in the
traditional role of librarians. With the emphasis on all things electronic and with fewer faculty
and researchers coming into the physical library, e-science programs and services were seen as
an opportunity to reach new faculty members, students, researchers, and especially
administrators at the university and department level.
Future changes. The director indicated there was more work to be done in order to meet
the goal of being a critical partner in the university’s efforts to provide data management
services, specifically to develop the domain knowledge necessary to be an effective member of
the research team, and the success measures for the programs and services that are currently

88

being offered to ensure that they are meeting the needs of the research community they are
seeking to serve.
Experience of change. The changes resulted in librarians assuming new attitudes and
views of library services; the traditional roles of the past were being reinvented. It has also
necessitated that they learn new skills and be willing to learn some of them on their own.
Overcoming the fears often associated with change was not an issue; library faculty willingly
embraced the new changes. However, challenges remained due to resistance outside of the
library as faculty members were reluctant to share data and seek outside help to manage project
data. The library sought willing partners and began their transformation slowly.
Type of change. There was agreement that the changes occurring in the library were
evolutionary in nature, but for some librarians it felt more revolutionary, like “rapid little steps.”
There was no consensus among the librarians as to whether the change was primarily of content
(type of materials, skills used) or context (environment, new skills needed). One librarian stated
that the changes were primarily due to outside forces in technology and how scientific research is
conducted, and the library simply reacted and was not proactive.
Role of Administration
The roles of library administration were twofold. First, the library director secured
funding which would pay for staff, training, and other resources needed to develop and provide
services; second, the associate director headed the programs and services. When asked who
provided the leadership across the institution to implement e-science, the associate director
indicated it was the library; the director stated that leadership was being shared among the Office
of the Vice Chancellor for Research, the Chief Information Officer, and the library. Both the
director and the associate director maintained that a shared vision was created and implemented.

89

Library vision statement. Library A has a formal vision statement which focuses on
facilitating the intellectual exploration of the faculty, staff, and students of the university, the
state, and scholars and visitors from across the country and around the world through its
leadership in the:
•

design and delivery of exceptional user services;

•

acquisition and curation of extraordinary research collections;

•

identification and application of new information technologies;

•

research and development into innovative library services and information technologies;
and

•

promotion of substantive and sustained collaboration with partners on campus, among the
local community, across academic institutions, and around the world.

Library administration views the e-science initiatives that the library is leading as being in
alignment with the overall library vision. The goal of the e-science program is to support digital
scholarship by meeting the emerging needs of students and scholars engaged in e-science and
other forms of digital scholarship. The library does this by establishing programs that support
access, dissemination, preservation, and curation of digital content created, managed, or acquired
by the library. The library is investing in new positions or re-allocating resources from among
existing human resources toward data curation activities. In addition, the library is actively
promoting outreach, acquisitions, and scholarly support programs associated with the data
services it provides.
Leadership challenges. Both the director and the associate director identified several
challenges to implementing the changes associated with providing e-science programs and
services. The associate director saw the primary challenges to be raising awareness of the issues

90

associated with data management, and customizing services to match the needs of each group.
The director thought initially that identifying the appropriate role of the library in relation to
other stakeholders who were providing services was a challenge, along with educating faculty,
developing staff expertise, and finding ways to help those researchers who are not able to
manage on their own.
Communication. The primary modes of communication used within the library to
communicate the importance of e-science are the annual state of library address, given by the
director, and the library strategic plan. External to the library, library administration connects
with other faculty, researchers, and members of university administration by participating on
campus committees which are concerned with data management issues. This participation at the
university level serves to raise awareness of the libraries role in e-science support.
Empowering staff. Library administration empowers staff by providing funding for
continuing education and any needed resources, such as hardware, software, and appropriate
temporary staff to assist with project work. Library staff are also encouraged to pursue their own
research to help advance the library profession. Ultimately, staff are empowered to assume new
roles as faculty ask them to take on new tasks and develop new services.
Sustainability. In order to incorporate the recent changes into the culture of the library,
library administration has had to make the new e-science programs and services an integral part
of the library’s core mission. Data management and e-science goals are incorporated into the
reporting and evaluation structure. When a library position is vacated, administration actively
seeks out a new staff member with appropriate skills and is interested in data management. The
library also provides a number of internal opportunities to learn about data management and

91

develop new skills through the provision of workshops and collaboration with local champions
and mentors.
Hurdles to implementation. Sustainability is a long-term concern for library
administration, specifically because of limited resources and the lack of technical expertise
among library staff. Library administration continually modifies job descriptions and seeks out
new candidates to fill gaps in technical expertise. As well, the lack of clarity on how to manage
this new direction is a concern. There is strong support across the university for the library to
take an active role in setting a direction for the institution. How the new direction affects the
long-term internal management of the library is not as clear as staff are reassigned to assume new
roles and their work takes them out of the library and into research departments.

The library administration has been thinking about and planning for e-science for more
than fifteen years as it closely monitored the rapidly changing trends in the conduct of scientific
research. Formal programming was put in place in 2008. The library’s involvement in e-science
can be attributed to three factors. The first is people, both faculty and library staff. The faculty
were encouraged to take initiative, accept risk of failure, be leaders in their respective fields, and
seek out mutually beneficial collaborations as appropriate. Faculty acknowledged the expertise
the library offered. In turn, key library staff embraced the entrepreneurial culture (a focus on
creativity and the pursuit of new opportunities) they work in and created programs and services
that met their clients’ needs. The second factor is the library’s history of advocating for
information policy and management on campus, such as advocating for open access and
providing document repository systems. Third, the library is viewed as a center where innovative
technology can be developed, tested, and implemented.
Data Gathering
The investigator conducted a personal interview with the library director, two telephone
interviews with the associate director, and a focus group interview with ten librarians who
provide e-science services. The director was unable to secure access to an institutional
93

representative or to any strategic partners for interviews. However, the director provided the
investigator with transcripts of recent interviews conducted by librarians with the vice president
for research and associate provost,9 the head of Information Services and Technology,10 and a
principal research scientist. In addition, the investigator consulted university and library strategic
planning documents, online press releases from the university’s administration, scholarly articles
written by librarians from the institution describing services, and web-based chronicles in the
form of news articles and blog posts to expand her understanding of the interview participants’
comments. The following summarizes the findings.
Institutional Perspective
University research activities range from individual projects to large-scale, collaborative,
and sometimes international endeavors. The university provides faculty with the infrastructure
and support necessary to conduct research; however, individual researchers often manage their
own computing resources and provide for their needs in their local laboratories, resulting in a
decentralized approach.
From the university perspective e-science is not just the data an individual researcher
generates. It also includes the science performed using digital tools to manipulate digital data,
bringing together data and other objects of scientific investigation from a variety of sources. The

9

The Vice President for Research (VPR), who has overall responsibility for research administration and policy,
oversees more than a dozen interdisciplinary research laboratories and centers. The VPR is responsible for research
integrity and compliance and plays a central role in research relationships with the federal government, industry,
foundations, and international sponsors.
10
According to the Information Services and Technology (IS&T) public website, it “provides foundational IT
services that make it easy for the university community to do its work: communicate, collaborate, and interact
locally and internationally. It provides the technical resources, services, and support to help everyone work smarter,
faster, and safer. From helping professors collaborate on research, to helping students get the software they need for
class, to helping protect the network from cyber attacks, IS&T is the information technology backbone that supports
the university.” (Citation withheld to anonymize the library)

94

university has a role in preserving data that may provide additional value in the future, but the
expense associated with doing that is high and requires a change in culture and a unified vision.
Participation varies across the disciplines, as the cost associated with more detailed record
keeping and preparing data for other users versus the future benefit of long-term preservation is
determined by individual researchers. At the administrative level, university administration sees
profound merit in a policy of open research and free interchange of information among scholars,
but acknowledges that there is no clear articulation of what the local impact is and what the
needs are when it comes to the management of research data.
Institutional View of the Role of the Library in Supporting E-Science
University administration views the library as having a role in supporting e-science on
campus. It looks to the library to provide reports on what is happening at other universities, to be
a source of credible information, to be a unit that can bring different groups together, and to be a
resource for developing and supporting new data management systems. The administration
considers the library as a partner that can assist in identifying possible solutions for data
management on campus.
A few individual faculty members have come to the library for help in preserving
selected datasets. In these instances the library is viewed as an organization that faculty can work
with to discuss long-term data preservation issues and offer reasonable solutions. Yet, the intense
decentralization and independence of researchers has the majority of them seeking ways to solve
their own data management needs.
Library-Based E-Science Programs and Services
The library had extensive involvement working with geographic information system
(GIS) datasets and social science datasets. Those experiences led the library to hire a data

95

librarian and begin offering data management consulting services. The emphasis was placed on
the opportunity for collaboration, whether the collaboration focused on humanities, social
sciences, or scientific data. Table 3.2 lists library e-science programs and services.
Education. The library designed a website that explains on the landing page why data
management is important. The content has been as comprehensive as possible so that researchers
and students can address their research needs independently, whenever, and from wherever.
Topics covered on this website include how to evaluate data needs, meet funding requirements,
design a comprehensive data management plan, develop documentation and metadata, organize
data, create backup and security plans, and share and cite data. The website also introduces legal
and ethical issues that need to be considered.
The educational effort is not only focused on the research community. Librarians are
encouraged to seek opportunities to further their understanding of the evolving research data
management needs of campus researchers and further their own education and expertise.
Librarians who are working to provide e-science programs and services have also taken local and
national roles in helping to educate other library professional and students in how to develop and
provide e-science programs, specifically data management services. Those looking to learn about
data management often consult the information posted to the web by the library or invite a
representative from the library to speak at local or national LIS conferences.
Policy. A number of librarians have helped to establish national metadata standards
related to GIS. They have assumed roles on national committees and have publicly commented
on proposed standards. At the institutional level, librarians participate on two committees that
discuss policy issues related to data issues: the Committee on Intellectual Property, and a
temporary committee that recommended policies regarding the use of restricted data.

96

Research. In order to secure external funding, the library has actively sought out
opportunities to partner with researchers. A number of grant proposals have been submitted in
which library personnel are listed as contributors or in which library services are a critical
component.
Services. Besides the education services mentioned above, the library also provides
outreach services to researchers to raise their awareness of both best practices for data
management, and the resources and services available in the libraries to help them manage and
archive their data. The library also provides an institutional repository for documents. Additional
services include identifying tools and resources to help researchers manage and archive their
data, create permanent URLs and digital object identifiers (DOIs), and comply with funder and
publisher requirements. Outreach methods include self-help tools and information, data storage
solutions, and tailored individualized consulting over the course of a research project.
Data services include data in any format, such as numeric, geospatial, text, images, audio,
video, and software. These data can be either primary (directly collected by the researcher) or
secondary (originally collected by another researcher but used by someone at the university). The
working group provides established services and undertakes a limited number of experimental
projects. Consulting services are targeted to members of the local research community.
Delivery. In place of forming a new department, the library established an internal
research data management working group as the central service unit for data management
services. The group consists of a subset of subject liaison librarians interested in data
management. The members gather and discuss data related programs and services and support
one another as they seek out collaborations with researchers. The library has created an extensive
website to serve as a central place for researchers and students to learn about data management

97

practices. In addition, the library works one-on-one or in small workshops with researchers and
students.
Resources needed. The library places a high value on staff who are technically adept and
like to learn. Staff also need to have good interpersonal skills and be willing to leave the library
to work with researchers as partners. In addition to skilled staff, the library must have the
appropriate technology to meet the data management needs of the research community. This
includes analytical software, high-end library workstations, video conferencing, a highperformance computing center (local or in the cloud), and shared repositories and preservation
facilities to store data. The library provides collaborative areas for researchers to work together.
It also purchases datasets as part of the collection development policy.
Implementation facilitators and barriers. A major facilitator of the library’s e-science
outreach programs has been key personnel who are continually monitoring trends in e-science as
well as changes in research processes and data management. These librarians press the need for
the library’s involvement and take the initiative upon themselves to discuss the issues with other
library staff and seek to influence library administration. Another important catalyst came when
library administration formally assigned the working group to take up the topic of e-science and
data management. With that came formal authority to act on behalf of the library to develop new
programs and services, as well as recognition that data management was now considered part of
the librarian’s official job description. The primary barrier to expanding programing and services
has been resource constraints, particularly reductions in the library budget.
Changes Occurring in Order to Implement E-Science Programs and Services
The changes that have occurred have been manifested in different layers of the library. At
the highest level, getting involved in e-science and data management has defined a new role for

98

the library. The library is now being viewed less as a repository of print materials and is starting
to be recognized for the unique skills and depth of knowledge librarians can bring to the research
team. Operationally, the library reorganized and restructured departments and services. Outside
forces also contributed to the library’s need to restructure, but the administration specifically
wanted to leverage library staff expertise to meet the new demands for data management
services.
As part of the reorganization process, the data management working group was formed.
New positions, in which data services were a key component, were designed and recruited for,
and in the case of any staff turnover, previous job descriptions were updated to address the
technical and data skills the library wanted in the staff.
At the point of service, librarians who were interested in getting involved in data
management found that they needed additional training on metadata standards and new subject
knowledge in order to work more closely with researchers and their datasets. Working with data
was viewed as a major change in role for many of the librarians because this was the first time
they were asked to work with a changing product (as research data moves through the research
cycle its characteristics and values changes). As a result of this new role, librarians found that
they were now reaching out to and working with a new group of faculty members, students, and
administrators.
Future changes. The library administration is working to engage the necessary
stakeholders on campus and guide the conversation; the library wants to be seen as a key player.
It is critical that all the stakeholders have a clearer understanding of roles, responsibilities, and
the various support services available on the campus as a whole. The emphasis is on developing
a better partnership with the Office of Sponsored Programs and improving the relationship with

99

the vice president for research. The library wants to have affiliations with departments such as
Information Services and Technology and other relevant players. Due to the decentralized nature
of the institution, the major goal of the library is to foster better collaboration with the key
central services that support the research endeavor.
Library administration sees the new environment into which libraries are moving as
fundamentally and profoundly volatile. Many libraries are reacting to what is going on among
the major information providers such as Google and Microsoft. Before major corporations start
to develop new tools that support researchers data management needs, the library wants to have
firm relationships and be recognized across the institution as an important asset available to all.
The library administration continues to monitor and think about technology in terms of major
changes every two to three years.
Experience of change. The librarians in the focus group interview viewed e-science
programs and services, specifically data management, as an added responsibility; however, they
felt as if the initiation of and momentum behind the changes were part of a grassroots effort in
which a select group of librarians moved in this new direction and became submerged in data
management. Over time, with the support of library administration, what started as an informal
interest became a formal library-wide initiative. The changes experienced by the librarians have
created opportunities for those who have previously worked independently on specific tasks or
with pre-determined departments within the library to form new working relationships, across
the university, and with external organizations, such as other university libraries.
Type of change. The library administration categorizes the changes as revolutionary
because faculty are being asked to think about using information resources in a new way, and the
library is challenging its traditional role in that process. The administration also characterizes the

100

changes as bold as the library takes a leadership role at the national level. Librarians describe the
changes as revolutionary because they are working with new content in a new way, and the
context in which they work is changing. However, there was consensus that many of the changes
that had been implemented were well discussed and processed, in essence providing a framework
and increasing the chances of success, and resulting in the changes being incorporated slowly
over time. Participants in the focus group interview think that they are so immersed in the
changes that it is difficult to categorize these changes as transformational; that characterization,
they believe, could only happen in hindsight.
Role of Administration
The primary role of the library administration has been to provide a framework for the
new direction in which the library is moving. The goal is twofold: (1) people will see how the
work they do fits in with the desired future, and (2) all library staff will work together and be
informed about what other staff members are doing so that when a new opportunity arises
everyone will know how to handle the inquiry or to whom to refer it.
The library, having strong support from university administration and the respect of the
faculty, is often left alone to provide solutions to self-identified problems. As a result, the library,
in the institutional context, is viewed as leading from behind in that it is subtly convincing
people of the importance of data management and, through education, helping to build
organizational capabilities so that researchers can make informed decisions. The library tries to
anticipate university needs and relies on knowing the best timing with which to deploy new
services for maximum impact.

101

Library vision statement. The vision for the library is shared and developed with
participation by library administration and staff. The vision was formulated with a user-centered
approach and in partnership with the faculty and seeks to:
•

enable seamless discovery and access to scholarly information sources;

•

manage and preserve knowledge, with an emphasis on locally-created content;

•

provide faculty, students, and staff with expert support and training to find, evaluate,
manage, and use resources;

•

create high-quality spaces for both reflective and collaborative work and study; and

•

lead initiatives to inform and shape the future of libraries and scholarly research.

With respect to e-science the goal is to create a service model in which the library
becomes an agile, creative, and data-driven organization that facilitates discovery, manages
knowledge, and provides faculty, students, and staff with expert support and training to find,
evaluate, manage, and use library resources in support of e-science.
Leadership challenges. Challenges at the institutional level include role identification
both for the library and other service centers on campus, such as information technology
services. It has also been a challenge for campus network services to manage the amount of data
that are produced daily and to identify and build a common delivery infrastructure in such a
decentralized institution. Internal to the library, the challenges have been to balance the
entrepreneurial culture among employees, who have been encouraged to develop new and
innovative programs and services, with ensuring that engaged staff members continue to work
towards the mission and shared vision of the library. It has also been a challenge to raise
awareness, manage competing priorities, and develop a core set of services to meet the needs of
many, as opposed to individual, researchers or research groups.

102

Communication. The library administration uses staff meetings to communicate the
importance of e-science and data management. There are ongoing discussions articulating where
the library is headed, and reinforcing why that direction is important. These events are followed
up by all-staff e-mails and newsletter summaries. All planning and communication are backed up
with allocation of resources around identified priorities. The director helps staff visualize the
new direction and discuss where they see themselves fitting in. Staff are offered supplemental
training to develop any new skills needed to be fully functional.
Empowering staff. Staff are empowered by having the latitude to explore new
opportunities and suggest new ideas; they are encouraged to be innovative. There is a substantial
rewards and recognition program. Through clearly defined roles and responsibilities, librarians
can develop new relationships and partnerships outside of the library.
Sustainability. The administration acknowledges the hard work it takes to stay focused
and deal with new challenges. Staff are mentored to deal with such challenges in the most
systematic way possible; in many instances they are asked to rise to the challenge and deliver
their best work. Through annual evaluations they are reminded of their tasks at hand and
encouraged to be innovative and take calculated risks.
Hurdles to implementation. The main hurdle for library administration has been the
limited amount of financial resources available for use and trying to match these resources with
user expectations and demands. The pace of the institution is fast and the library must
continually be ready to anticipate and respond to the latest changes, while maintaining a strategic
model of library services in which the library proactively engages the community and not simply
responds to the latest trends. As well, working in a constantly changing environment can be
difficult for some staff to adapt to. The administration acknowledges that dealing with staff

103

resistance to the fast pace of change is a hurdle that must be acknowledged and overcome on a
regular basis.

University C

The library has been involved in e-science for nearly a decade. The catalyst for its
involvement is attributed to the arrival of a new director who emphasized the need for the library

104

to support the research community more, and engage in its own research related to library and
information science. These two initiatives were launched at the same time that faculty from
across the institution started asking for help related to data management, the proper application
of metadata standards, and the long-term preservation of data associated with a major grant.
These were areas which the institution, specifically Information Technology (IT)11 services and
the Office of the Vice President for Research12 recognized as expertise held by the library. The
library, in turn, wanting to be better placed strategically within the university, seized the
opportunity for collaboration. Recent requirements such as those of the National Institute of
Health (NIH)13 and the NSF14 for data planning have solidified the library’s participation.
Data Gathering
The investigator conducted four interviews; one with the associate vice president for
research, and one each with three strategic partners (two faculty members and one representative
from IT). Library interviews were conducted with the library director, two associate library
directors, one data librarian, and one subject librarian. In addition, the investigator conducted a
focus group interview, but only with three librarians who provide e-science services participated.
The investigator consulted university and library strategic planning documents, online press
releases from the university’s administration, scholarly articles written by librarians from the
institution describing services, and web-based chronicles in the form of news articles and blog
11

IT services is responsible for the management of all IT resources including administrative systems, enterprise
applications, cyberinfrastructure for research, IT infrastructure, IT networks and security, academic and classroom
technologies, IT support and customer relations, and IT communications.
12
The mission of the Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR) is to support faculty members in developing
research programs and producing competitive research proposals. The OVPR assists in locating funding
opportunities, proposal preparation, and providing support for regulatory requirements.
13
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a data sharing policy that went into effect beginning
October 1, 2003, for applicants seeking NIH funding of $500,000 or more in direct costs in any one year. The policy
expects final research data, especially unique data, from NIH-supported research efforts to be made available to
other investigators. It includes data from: basic research, clinical studies, surveys, and other types of research
(National Institute of Health, 2003).
14

105

posts to expand her understanding of the interview participants’ comments. The following
summarizes the findings.
Institutional Perspective
The institution regards e-science as research that is undertaken using intense computation
to perform many experiments simultaneously, to generate data which can be manipulated by
computers through simulation and visualization, and to share/mix/reuse those data to explore
new problems. The university’s goal is to provide the infrastructure needed to support disciplinebased research and multidisciplinary collaboration among researchers for breakthrough
advancements in research programs. These large-scale multidisciplinary research programs,
dependent on computational research, are primarily conducted in the physical, life, and
environmental sciences.
The university’s mission is to facilitate learning, discovery, and engagement. The
university administration views the library as a critical resource to enable discoverability and
availability, and to establish provenance15 in the area of e-science. The university is aware of the
increased need to have processes in place to manage the large amount of data produced and is
concerned that without proper planning the institution will soon be overwhelmed with research
generated data. The administration is looking to the library for that preparation and planning to
avoid such a situation.
Three resources were identified as essential to providing e-science programs and support:
equipment and infrastructure, people, and time. Having in place the proper equipment and
infrastructure such as storage systems, search and retrieval interfaces, and high-speed computing
options, along with backup systems, is essential. It is also crucial to have the staff expertise to set

15

Provenance in the context of e-science and data management refers to the history of how the data were acquired
and subsequently processed (Dinov et al., 2010).

106

up and manage these systems. Simply adding these tasks to the workload of current staff is not
an option, as they do not have the time for such a major undertaking.
Three campus departments were also characterized as critical: IT to provide the
infrastructure and technical expertise, the Office of the Vice President for Research to secure
funding and advocate for researchers’ needs, and the library to provide expertise in organization,
management, and preservation of data, as well as the vision and managerial leadership to
coordinate the various stakeholders.
Along with these resources and partners, the success of various e-science projects is
attributed to several champions, and there are success stories associated with early projects.
Faculty and researchers have seen high-profile projects which have involved IT, the Office of the
Vice President for Research, and the library thrive, and, as a result, have been willing to work
with these partners to duplicate their achievements. One barrier identified by university
administration is that faculty and researchers use the physical library less due to the vast number
of electronic resources; library staff, therefore, are not in close physical proximity to the end
users. This can make it difficult for the library to ensure that faculty are aware of the services
that the library offers.
Institutional View of the Role of the Library in Supporting E-Science
When the new library director arrived, the institution and strategic partners indicated that
it was critical to have the library involved from the beginning in e-science initiatives because of
the unique skills and expertise found on staff. The library is regarded as a resource offering
expertise in tagging, classification and subject indexing, authority control, metadata, and the
publication process. It is viewed as having brought organization to a number of large projects by
developing and implementing standards and authoritative auditing procedures. The library is

107

seen as a partner providing strategic advice on how to create a modern data management system
that is flexible and can be used by a variety of disciplines. Library staff have identified system
requirements and written customized code to meet those needs. The library is also seen as an
active research partner because it facilitates communication between the disciplines and knows
how to deal with the issues of terminology that become more important when datasets are
created and shared. Lastly, the library is considered a peer in co-authoring grant requests,
presentations, and publications, as well as leading its own local and national research and grant
program.
Library staff are seen as experts at converting data that are locally understandable and
locally accessible into datasets that are universally understandable and universally accessible.
The relationship between researchers and librarians has evolved over time; what started out as an
occasional, lower-grade effort has developed into a higher-grade, collaborative effort to try and
advance common interests. The library staff are described as being extremely patient and willing
to dedicate time and resources to the development of new collaborations by participating in
brainstorming sessions and participating in projects that have grown from ideas into fully written
proposals.
Library-Based E-Science Programs and Services
The library began its work in e-science slowly. The first step was to develop the staff’s
comfort level by supporting training requests and professional development activities. After staff
had a better idea of what e-science was about, the library administration began to build staff
confidence and encourage them to talk with potential partners. Finally, administration supported
any additional subject training that was needed to increase overall staff competence.

108

Early activities included developing educational classes for faculty and researchers on
data management, expanding the concept of reference services to include a data consulting
service, and offering staff time for collaboration on projects outside of the library. In 2004, the
library began developing data archiving options for researchers and examining how researchers
manage data throughout the research process. Table 3.2 provides a full list of library e-science
programs and services.
Education. The library provides learning opportunities for librarians. There is
cooperation among the librarians to educate one another, and there is also support from library
administration to hire outside experts to help instruct librarians in new or emerging areas when
needed. Subject librarians have the option to team with a data services librarian when discussing
data management planning issues with a researcher. The intention of this arrangement is twofold.
First, by pairing a more experienced data services librarian who has worked on a variety of data
projects with the subject expertise of the liaison librarian, the two together can offer the
researcher the most complete and current recommendation to meet data management
requirements. Second, this type of partnership provides a learning opportunity for everyone
involved. The subject librarian becomes more comfortable conducting a data interview so that he
or she can work independently in the future, the data services librarian learns about the specific
data requirements of a discipline, and the researcher has a team of librarians with whom to
collaborate and discuss options.
Formal educational workshops for researchers, faculty, and students are focused on issues
such as working with sensitive research data, in which researchers are legally and ethically
obligated to ensure that confidentiality is maintained. Library staff have also developed in-depth
instructions on citing and the use of secondary research datasets.

109

Policy. Individual researchers and university administration have turned to the library for
advice on policy and procedures. Individual researchers have sought out library services to assist
them in managing the data production process, providing long-term access to and preservation of
research data, and complying with external data sharing requirements. In these instances, the
library is viewed as the most authoritative expert on campus.
Research. The library’s wants to establish itself not only as a resource, but also as a
reputable research center that takes the lead in investigating issues and problems related to
making research data available. It collaborates to develop solutions for research data curation,
management, dissemination, and preservation. As a research center, the library has applied for
and obtained numerous grants related to the study of data management and curation. It has also
shown that it can be an effective contributor to research projects originating outside of the
library. Between 2005 and 2010 the library’s faculty partnered with 68 faculty members in 31
departments to write 95 grant proposals. A small percentage of these were funded, but the
number of successful grant submissions has increased over time.
Services. The services provided for faculty, researchers, and graduate students are
categorized into two levels: consulting and collaborating. At the consulting level, librarians,
primarily subject liaisons, work on developing a data management plan, identify relevant data
repositories, guide the preparation of data for deposit, and find and make use of metadata
standards, ontologies, or other tools and resources to manage, share or curate data. At the
collaborating level, dedicated library staff (not necessarily those with a master’s degree in library
and information science) work with researchers to integrate data management, dissemination, or
curation into research workflows; identify and implement data management and curation
solutions that are tailored to the needs of a laboratory or research project; increase the discovery

110

and utility of data through the design and application of metadata; enhance the dissemination of
data through the application of standards as OAI-PMH16 and promote the use of linked data;17
and add value to data so that others can others can cite them through the use of DataCite’s digital
object identifiers (DOIs).18
The library provides a number of technological solutions. These include an online,
collaborative working space with data-sharing platforms to support the data management needs
of researchers and their collaborators. Examples of data that the library staff are working with
include spreadsheets, instrument or sensor readings, software source code, surveys, interview
transcripts, images, and audiovisual files. The library also supports a traditional institutional
repository that highlights university scholarship of various types (e.g., working papers, journal
articles, and dissertations and theses).
Delivery. The library director is a strong advocate who initiates and promotes the library
data management services and encourages future partnerships from across the university. The
library uses its website to deliver educational materials on relevant data management issues.
Initially a few dedicated staff, who were hired for this specific purpose, delivered the librarybased e-science programs and services. These staff members proactively engage with faculty to
discuss collaborative opportunities. Over time, an increasing number of subject librarians have

provides a framework for persistent identification, managing intellectual content, managing metadata, linking
customers with content suppliers, facilitating electronic commerce, and enabling automated management of media”
(German National Library of Science and Technology, n.d., para. 4).

111

become more comfortable discussing data management issues with their faculty contacts, and
these librarians serve as additional contact points to initiate data management discussions.
Resources needed. The most valuable resource identified by the library is appropriate
staff. A thorough review is conducted of each position that becomes vacant, and descriptions
may be rewritten to incorporate the desired qualification and skills. The preferred list of skills
and knowledge areas include: interviewing skills, project management skills, interpersonal
communication, social skills, a science background, technical skills, a willingness to learn and to
approach people, self-confidence, and an understanding of the research process. Hiring library
staff to meet these requirements has been the priority, along with retraining current staff, so that
the library will have the skills and knowledge to meet future needs.
Additionally, the library has developed a framework for selection, acquisition, deacquisition, and de-selection policies related to datasets and the institutional repository. The
library is incorporating policies for long-term preservation at the point of acquisition, rather than
waiting to make a decision in the future or in reaction to some other event. Through an analysis
of current collection policies the library is hoping to find areas where the process can be
improved in order to manage this additional collection development work.
The library has three repositories which provide faculty with long-term preservation and
access: archives, document, and data. Some of these systems were developed in-house, others
purchased, and some are based on open-source software.19 The library is not fixated on
developing new tools; it is willing to use what already exist and to test their limits. Library
administration also believes that beyond the development of new technologies there is a role for
librarians in teaching researchers how to use existing technology, such as locally developed
19

Open-source software is computer software that is available in source code form. The source code and certain
other rights normally reserved for copyright holders are provided under an open-source license that permits users to
study, change, improve and at times also to distribute the software (Open Source Initiative, n.d.).

112

tools, and free or commercially available productivity software, such as citation management
tools.
The library has not intentionally made any modifications or renovations to its current
space to accommodate e-science programs and services; the primary work is done outside of the
library. Routine updates to facilities and computing equipment have been made but not as a
direct result of e-science.
Implementation facilitators and barriers. Although library administration has always
considered the library to be well funded, it still faces issues associated with the constraints placed
on those resources; for instance, there are funds that must be spent on traditional paper
collections, small departmental libraries, or staff working in protected para-professional
positions. The number of staff considered experts in providing data management consultations is
limited. Above all, the librarians feel as if they have no “best practices” to follow since they were
among the first to offer e-science programs and services. Despite having nothing to model
programs and services after, the success of the local programs and services has been attributed to
individual initiative, a strong desire for collaboration within the library and across campus, the
support of library administration, and having vocal champions outside of the library. E-science is
a central part of the library’s strategic plan that was shared across the university. The library
director promotes the e-science related services outside of the library during meetings, and
specifically during discussions among researchers about implementing the NSF data
management requirements.
Changes Occurring in Order to Implement E-Science Programs and Services
With the arrival of the current director, the library began a strategic planning process that
would allow it to advance ground-breaking ideas by focusing on service, collaboration, and

113

research. The goal was to produce innovative products that would serve as models that could be
adopted by other libraries that wanted to become involved in e-science. The library specifically
sought to further its role in interdisciplinary research by increasing campus awareness of the
value added by its participation in interdisciplinary research, the number of collaborative grant
proposals, and the alignment of collections and information resources to support interdisciplinary
research.
To achieve this, a new department was formed with specific goals: to advance
understanding of issues in curating research datasets in distributed environments; to build
partnerships with researchers, technologists, and librarians across the university; and to develop
innovative, applied and disciplinary-based solutions for data management, discovery, and
dissemination. Four library researchers were assigned to this new department and were asked to
work closely with subject liaison librarians throughout the libraries and to address problems of
data curation. Two of the four research positions are recent hires (two involved re-assignment of
existing staff) that were created and designed specifically to work in the new department. An
updated reporting structure was put in place and new workflows across the library were
implemented to leverage the expertise of this specialized unit; any subject liaison could bring
issues of data management to the new department and receive assistance in supporting their
researchers.
Each position that is vacated due to staff turnover is re-examined to include
responsibilities associated with data management and to require specific skills useful for working
in that area. Staff who were already working in the library were encouraged to seek training
opportunities and acquire the necessary skills to be effective.

114

The goal of collaborating with researchers on funded projects was not limited to this
specialized unit. All librarians were asked to take on this role and seek to become embedded in a
department or a research project. For many this required additional knowledge, skills, and
abilities. The librarians worked together to develop training materials that were posted to the web
for easy access for those librarians with questions.
The library believed it was important to make the collection of locally-developed
resources a priority; this included locally-produced publications, technical reports, archival
materials, and data. A data repository was developed to facilitate the discovery and preservation
of such works.
Future changes. In order to meet its strategic goals to become part of the campus-wide
research process, the library began to rewrite job descriptions for newly-vacant positions to
include data management duties. In the future it is anticipated that every position will have some
aspect of data management included in it. Providing supplemental training for librarians in the
area of data management, project management skills, and knowledge of the research process
began in 2006 and continues. Moreover, library administration is closely monitoring how closing
or combining departmental libraries will affect the relationship librarians have formed with
researchers who were formerly situated in close proximity and readily available.
Experience of change. The librarians indicated that there was an adjustment period
through which they had to go. New attitudes and views were required in order to embrace this
new role. They found it difficult to meet these new expectations early on, indicating that there
were not many opportunities for success, and overcoming faculty resistance was difficult.
However, they did find this offered a new way to engage faculty. The librarians felt that it was
important to seek training opportunities and take the extra time needed for education in order to

115

overcome the large learning curve and be successful. The consistent message from
administration that e-science and data management were an important part of the library’s future
was a strong motivating factor.
Type of change. The library’s strategic plan calls for the librarians to take on a
transformed role. Discussions with librarians indicated that the ideas that are being put forth
from library administration are revolutionary, but in fact implementation happened slowly over
time and the changes have been much more incremental. It has taken time to acquire and apply
the necessary resources, there was a period of experimentation, and success has been limited.
There was a feeling that it was a “hurry up and wait” situation wherein the library was doing a
lot of preparation, yet faculty were slow to embrace the concepts of data management and
sharing. One librarian commented that the transformational changes have taken place outside of
libraries, and librarians are simply reacting.
Role of Administration
Library administrators identified multiple roles for themselves. The primary one was to
set the vision, to further the library’s role in interdisciplinary research, which the director and the
associate directors did. The vision was characterized as a shared one conceived by all working
together. Associated with that vision, the administration worked to secure funding, identify
potential problems before they occurred, and made sure nothing fell through the gaps. Another
role of administration is to help the liaison librarians to embrace the new tasks they are being
asked to assume and to make sure they feel equipped and able to do outreach to faculty who are
engaged in e-science.

to be recognized as an essential leader in the advancement of the university’s core
strengths and global mission;

•

to lead in innovative and creative solutions for access to and management and
dissemination of scholarly information resources;

•

to lead in the provision of information literacy;

•

to create leading edge learning spaces, both physical and virtual; and

•

to be regarded as a leader in the national and international research library
community.

Leadership challenges. The challenges associated with these roles involve librarians not
having the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities. It has been difficult for the administration
to allow staff to explore problems and questions on their own and to not step in and solve
problems for them. A conscious effort has to be made to allow staff the time needed to develop
the required expertise.
Communication. The library administration has used the strategic planning process to
communicate the importance of e-science initiatives, including goals such as “lead in datarelated scholarship and initiatives” and “increase the participation of Libraries’ faculty as
partners in multidisciplinary research, applying library, archival, and information science
principles.”20 Progress towards these goals is noted in the library’s annual report and
communicated at all-staff meetings and during one-on-one conversations with staff. Likewise,
the administration has sent a clear message of the importance of these initiatives by re-writing or
creating new job descriptions to include e-science and data management.

Empowering staff. Library administration is encouraging librarians to transition into
new roles by letting them ask questions and express their concerns, and by providing the
necessary education and resources to assume new responsibilities. The goal is to boost
confidence. There has been an open call for participation: anyone interested in learning about
data management and e-science is encouraged to get involved.
Sustainability. The library administration has strived for slow strategic growth. It has
needed the time to obtain the necessary resources, develop staff, and plan for the future. The
approach has been to “do more – know more.” The administration has also been deliberate in its
efforts to reallocate current staff and make sure that the right people are hired. Librarians explore
and undertake new collaborations within the library and across the university.
Hurdles to implementation. The library administration has had to deal with the
allotment of limited resources among competing priorities. As well, it has had to overcome staff
resistance by developing comfort level and confidence. The administration has found that some
on campus hold a traditional view of the library, and there is a need to overcome the image of the
library as simply a repository of books. Additionally, not having the right tool for the problem at
hand (e.g., managing a large dataset) has been an issue. Many of the desired tools do not yet
exist. The library has had to decide whether it should wait for the perfect tool to come along or
invest in developing applications in-house, such as a data repository that is scalable to handle the
needs to the entire university.

University D
The library has been involved in e-science since 2000, and has always been expected to
embrace the entrepreneurial culture of the institution. As a result, the library’s long history in
curating special collections earned it the reputation of being an expert in the long-term curation
of large-scale datasets. Internally, library managers also thought it was important to help
scientists and researchers manage their data, which includes preservation and curation, so the
researchers can focus more on the science and the library can oversee data management issues.
The library promoted itself as the organization that can do that. It markets itself as an
organization that thinks about the long-term, focuses on preservation, has a sustainable source of
funding; and operates under a service-oriented mission. These efforts resulted in the library
director and an associate director being asked to be co-principal investigators and manage the
data curation issues on a major national grant.
Data Gathering
Interviews were conducted by the telephone separately with the library director and an
associate director. In addition, the investigator conducted two focus group interviews by the
telephone, but each with only three librarians who provide data services. The library was unable
to arrange for interviews with strategic partners or any representatives from university
administration. The investigator consulted university and library strategic planning documents,
online press releases from the university’s administration, scholarly articles written by librarians
from the institution describing services, and web-based chronicles in the form of news articles
and blog posts to expand her understanding of the interview participants’ comments. The
following summarizes the findings.

120

Institutional Perspective
The university mission is to educate students and cultivate their capacity for life-long
learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the
world. Data-driven science is a vital part of that mission and a priority across the institution. It is
considered an important element of “signature initiatives.” The university usually has four or five
such initiatives in process at any one time. One of the criteria for a signature initiative is that it
needs to bring together at least three, preferably four or five, areas of the university, around
solving a major problem. The library’s capability in supporting e-science means that it is part of
these initiatives automatically. It was not even imagined that these signature initiatives could go
forward without bringing new resources into the library or having the library as a full partner.
The expectation of being involved is critical, as is the funding that comes from that involvement
in order to expand services. The library began with e-science but it has since seamlessly
expanded into service related to digital humanities, since this requires no additional resources.
Library-Based E-Science Programs and Services
Given the potential scope and magnitude of data generated at the institution, the
challenge was to develop a set of local practices, policies, and activities that reflected the diverse
and dynamic need of the scientists and researchers. The goal was to incorporate enough
flexibility to meet any future needs, as well as to eliminate the possible development of data and
service silos. The library was looking to provide a sustainable data curation infrastructure.
Faculty researchers were identified as the primary users and research support as the primary
services to develop.
It is also important to note that the majority of services being developed by two
departments (a digital library group and a data consulting group) were marketed as a centralized

121

campus service that is housed in the library, and just happens to also be managed and staffed by
librarians. Some of these services, such as data archiving, are provided under a cost-recovery
model.21 A few liaison librarians were also working within their assigned departments to provide
data services, but these projects tended to be smaller in scope and had a limited time
commitment. This study focuses on the centralized services offered by the digital library group
and the data consulting group. Table 3.2 provides a full list of e-science programs and services.
Education. Librarians working in the digital library and data consulting group are
supported to attend conferences and meetings (local and national) to further their own skills and
knowledge. The librarians are also encouraged to share what they are doing locally through
presentations and publications. The digital library and data consulting group do not offer any
formal educational programing. They serve as a resource for liaison librarians who are in need of
consultation and can often get them started in the right direction when assistance is needed.
Policy. The library plays an important role on campus in setting and contributing to
institutional policies related to data management, as well as in assisting faculty and researchers
to comply with those policies. The library also has an important role in informing and educating
the university community about new developments and changes in national data requirements,
such as those issued by federal agencies and other funding institutions. Additionally, the
librarians have taken lead roles in reviewing and contributing to setting national metadata
standards that are used by libraries and subject-specific repositories around the world.
Research. The data consulting group’s approach to research has been to partner with
researchers and scientists on grants. To date projects have emphasized the development of
automated tools, systems, and software to reduce the costs associated with converting print,

21

Cost recovery is a financial model in which fees/prices are adjusted for goods/services so all cost of operations
and maintenance are covered for supplying the given goods or services (Malz, 2011).

122

audio, and video materials in digital form, and with curating content that is born digital, such as
large-scale scientific datasets. These programs and activities emphasize a combination of custom
technologies with strategic project management and planning.
The digital library group conducts research and development related to digital libraries in
collaboration with faculty, librarians, and archivists within the institution and beyond. The
members provide expertise to facilitate the creation of digital library materials and services and
evaluate digital libraries through usability research and economic analyses. As well, they provide
leadership in fostering an environment and culture which is conducive to advancing the library
and university in the digital information age. Reports about the programs and services emerging
from this group have been published in academic papers and featured in articles or news stories
by national newspapers such as The New York Times and The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Funding to support the research work has come from NSF, the Institute of Museum and Library
Services (IMLS), and the Mellon Foundation.
Services. The data consulting group offers two types of services: consulting on data
management and planning, and archiving of research data. As consultants, the group offers to
identify and review researchers’ data management and sharing options during and after a
research project is completed. The consultants also guide researchers on appropriate content for a
data plan to meet specific funder requirements, such as those stipulated by the NSF, as well as
any university requirements, such as internal policies on access and retention of research data
and materials.
The archiving services are closely tied to the data management and planning process.
Throughout the planning phase, consultants review options for storage and access to data during
the active collection phase of the research project. This review process also applies to the long-

123

term preservation of and access to the research data after the research project has been
completed. Researchers are informed of any discipline-specific repositories that they might
consider using, as well as local fee-based options associated with the consulting group or
university. Local archiving services include long-term preservation of media (e.g., CDs and
tapes), migration of file formats (e.g., spreadsheets and PDF files), and long-term storage options
with access and retrieval through an archive system. This system uses persistent electronic
identifiers, such as DOIs, which allow for easy citation and attribution of the researchers’ shared
datasets. The archive system can store cross-disciplinary data, has an integrated framework
allowing for searching across the archive, and is designed to be a long-term preservation system.
The selling point of the archiving service to faculty is that using a trusted digital repository22
service passes responsibility of managing the research data onto a third party, and leaves
researchers with more time to focus on conducting their research.
Delivery. The data consulting group works primarily one-on-one with researchers.
Researchers are asked to contact the group at least two weeks ahead of their proposal deadline. A
consultant meets with the researchers to discuss the proposal in development and to work
through a pre-set questionnaire which was developed to gather and organize the relevant
information needed for a comprehensive data management plan. After the meeting, consultants
are available to review a draft data management plan, paying close attention to the data
management requirements of the funder. Typically the review occurs within 24 hours of
submission.

22

A trusted digital repository is a digital repository capable of reliably storing, migrating, and providing access to
digital collections. Through an audit and certification process, repositories are confirmed to meet a set of criteria
applicable to a range of digital repositories and archives, from academic institutional preservation repositories to
large data archives and from national libraries to third-party digital archiving services.

124

Resources needed. The data consulting group places a high value on three main
knowledge areas. First is computer and information science training. Data consultants are
expected to have a background in computer science and/or informatics, and programing or data
mining skills are preferred. This experience is seen as key in managing scientific data. Second,
consultants are expected to have domain knowledge outside of library and information science,
such as a master’s degree in a scientific discipline or engineering. This contributes to the
consultant’s credibility when working with members of the research team. Third, consultants
must have an understanding of grant proposal preparation and the submission process and other
aspects of research data management: creation, processing, analysis, preservation, access, and reuse. In addition to the above staff skills and knowledge areas, consultants are also expected to
display initiative, confidence, and trust. The university has sought new staff to take on the role of
consultants and sent existing staff to workshops and other professional development
opportunities to foster these skills internally.
To complement the technical skills that the consultants must possess, the university and
library have invested heavily in high-performance computing centers, specialized hardware and
software to aid computational and collaborative science, storage management systems to handle
the large amounts of data being generated, and a usable search and retrieve interface for locating
pre-existing data. The library has also embraced the notion of data as a new type of collection.
Money is invested in the purchase of any datasets that are requested.
Implementation facilitators and barriers. The data consulting group has been
successful and continues to expand its programs and services. There were no identifiable
barriers. The NSF data management plan requirement was an important facilitator of the growth

125

of the group and contributed to recognition from across the institution that the library is the locus
of expertise in this area.
Changes Occurring to Implement E-Science Programs and Services
The library is in a constant state of change. Each year strategic priorities are set and
library staff are shifted to where they are most needed and asked to take on tasks that are critical
at that point in time or need to be further explored. One example is the digital library group that
was initially formed in 2002 without any plan for long-term sustainability. Over the past decade
the library reallocated resources from more traditional kinds of library activities to this one. The
department has grown from four to twelve people, and in all this time has only requested outside
funding for one new position. Seven of the people who currently work in that unit were
reassigned from other library divisions. Library administration admits that it cannot do
everything and that it must choose centers of excellence; and focus on doing things the library is
good at and no one else is doing. That has been a dramatic change that has to do not just with the
organization but also with the way in which the library allocates funds.
A second example of change is the formation of the data consulting group that was
established in October 2011 as a cost-recovery unit. The formation of this group has been
important for the library because it has brought library staff in direct consultation with
researchers, as part of the research team, in a way that did not exist before. According to the
librarians in the group, the researchers recognized the level of customized services offered. The
librarians reported that researchers reviewing the data management plans that were developed to
date were impressed because the plans were clearly not boilerplate, “pulled down and crammed
in,” but really thought-through customized plans. According to the director of this group, being

126

able to show this kind of direct utility so quickly is new for the library and has been the single
most important thing the consulting group has done.
These two new service units for the library have resulted in new roles for library staff.
They are asked to move away from a traditional print and collection focus to a services focus,
and to reach out to new faculty and researchers to partner on work that is occurring outside of the
library and earlier in the research cycle. The library has created new positions and hired new
staff to facilitate this change.
Future changes. The library administration sees more changes ahead, stating “We
cannot be calcified in one area of research methods when the opportunities for research are
changing so dramatically. We really cannot continue to be stuck in our old ways of looking at
what service means.” One area of new focus is GIS, as more faculty are asking the library for
help incorporating GIS into their teaching. The library is planning to create a new instruction
classroom, and to incorporate these requests and other requests for data-based instructional
programing into future library redesigns.
Within the university environment, the library expects a number of new university initiatives
to emerge that will influence future interests and priorities of researchers. In addition, the library
is anticipating changes in national politics and funding mandates that will focus on data
management. The library plans to monitor these changes through a continual environmental scan.
The planned response is to expand library capabilities and funding in areas that are identified
from year to year.
Experience of change. The librarians work in a new environment. What they are
experiencing is different from traditional library services. The new work is seen as being
different from other digitally-oriented library services such as digital repositories for documents

127

or faculty publications. Data management and planning are distinctive in a number of ways.
Some of the functions are similar (organization and cataloging) but data management is seen as a
function different from traditional librarianship; to be engaged in it librarians need to leave the
library and work with the research team.
One key change is the emphasis on service over content. The focus on data management
is more about service provision with the goal that content will start to be collected ‒ similar to a
new special collection for the university. The amount of data the library stores is expected to
grow over time. For those promoting the library’s involvement in e-science and data
management, the acknowledged change in roles and responsibilities has been welcomed, and
there is a strong sense that more needs to be and can be done.
Type of change. The library administrators categorized the change as evolutionary;
gradual, but steady; they are taking the long view. For those working in the digital library service
group and the data consulting group there was a sense of change being both evolutionary and
revolutionary, the latter in the sense that it is a new area and they were trying to figure out how
to do all this because there are pressures to do it quickly and to do it well. Working with data was
perceived as a radically different view of what libraries do, even though data management
activities are at the early stages of development. However, there was acknowledgement that
work had been done in these areas without realizing it, including early work in digitizing
collections and a review and analysis of repositories, platforms, and technologies. All of this was
done in the decade preceding this dissertation research.
Role of Administration
Library administrators identified two roles. One is to highlight the importance of data
management and to tie it back to the library’s mission. This is accomplished by participating in

128

and influencing the dialogue and conversations that are taking place throughout the university,
and representing the library and the role it can play. The other is to show that the library is
committed to furthering research in library and information science and being viewed as a
research unit equivalent to any other university center. The library, which is viewed as a partner
and a leader, is seen as a valuable resource in contributing to the development of data
management services across the institution. The library has been recognized for the unique skills
library staff offer the institution's researchers.
Leadership challenges. The challenges that the library administration has faced involve
raising awareness, educating faculty, and developing the appropriate staff expertise. Due to the
low turnover rate among staff it has been a challenge to work with human resources to add new
responsibilities to existing job descriptions and to encourage staff to assume new roles.
Additionally, as one of the first institutions to become involved in data management,
administration and librarians have had to deal with a large amount of trial and error, and discover
and set best practices. Doing this without a set of peers to consult has been a challenge.
Communication. The administration relies on internal and external methods to
communicate the need for librarians and staff to assume new roles. Internally it used Web-based
tools and social media. The library maintains a wiki, blog, and Twitter feed. The library
administration also relies on peer-to-peer communication among librarians to promote new
knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as the new services under development. Librarians are
encouraged to write for professional publications and attend and present at conferences related to
data management.
Empowering staff. Librarians who are actively moving in the new direction set by the
library administration are rewarded and recognized. These librarians are given a broad

129

framework within which to work and explore new roles. They are also given special assignments
and held up as an example to others. Staff are also empowered by having set goals and rigorous
evaluation plans in place to measure success.
Sustainability. The primary method used to sustain the enthusiasm for change has been
to hire staff who are interested in and dedicated to these new opportunities. It is critical that
library goals and priorities remain aligned with institutional goals in order to ensure long-term
partnerships with faculty. The library is relying on grant funds to sustain the data consulting
group. That group in turn relies on peers from other libraries to help develop the tools and
resources needed to build and advance data archiving and retrieval technology.
Hurdles to implementation. One important hurdle for library administration is to change
the current culture in the library. The culture is described as being very passive. Some of the staff
are not interested in taking on new duties or learning new skills. This, coupled with a lack of
turnover and resistance from human resources to think of the library job descriptions in a new
way, partially accounts for the slow, evolutionary change that is happening.
In addition to the resistance to change among some staff, the library administration has
had to deal with limited resources and competing priorities. The library budget has been stable
but is unable to keep pace with the cost of resources and the desire to expand services. Library
administration reviews priorities on an annual basis and adjusts staffing and funding accordingly.

Conclusion
Throughout the site visits the investigator noticed that the participants felt that, although
they had been working on e-science and data management issues for a number of years, there
was still much work to be done. The library is seen as a critical partner in helping these
institutions move forward. The leadership provided by the library director is viewed as one of the
vital elements in the library’s inclusion in e-science across campus.

131

The four libraries exhibited a number of similarities in their organizational responses to
assuming the new role of data management. These included creating a new specialized unit or
team to develop and provide services to faculty, supporting the continuing education of existing
staff who want to learn more about data management, and hiring new staff with specialized
knowledge, skills, and abilities. In all the cases there was a pervading sense that carving out a
role for the library was critical to the future of library services. Although the library director
heavily influenced the experience of change and how the institution viewed the library, there was
a strong feeling that the libraries (and all university research libraries) were slowly and
methodically moving in this similar direction.
The next chapter presents the general findings applicable to two or more of the four
cases. It relates these findings more explicitly to the role of the library at the institution from the
perspective of the library and university administration, and demonstrates how library
administration has brought about the necessary changes to transition into this new role. The
chapter also explores the cross-case findings to reflect on themes and patterns of similarity and
dissimilarity that have emerged.

Chapter 4
OVERVIEW OF THE CROSS-CASE FINDINGS

This chapter presents an overview of the broad themes and similarities that emerged from
the results of the four case studies, but does not include the investigator’s interpretation of the
meaning of these results. Interpretation and discussion occur in subsequent chapters, followed by
the concluding chapter, which analyzes the general themes and implications of the study, and
presents topics for further investigation.
Data from the four case studies demonstrate that there are more similarities than
differences when it comes to research universities and their libraries becoming engaged in escience, including the structural and programmatic changes that have occurred in libraries to
provide e-science services and programs, and the leadership necessary to bring about those
changes. The following discussion focuses on the library’s role in this process as identified by
two or more of the four sites visited. The investigator was unable to collect a sufficient amount
of data at the institutional level to comment on similarities of how e-science is conceived and
implemented at the institutional level, with one exception. Institutions A and C both identified
the same three critical partners in implementing e-science programs and services across the
institution: the office of research, the office of information technology, and the library.
Library-Based E-Science Services and Programs
Gold (2010) identified four areas for library involvement in e-science services: education,
policy, research, and services. All four sites in the study have been active in each of these areas,
with more overlap than uniqueness among the sites. This chapter discusses the roles of library

134

along with the most common delivery methods used to deliver services, and implementation
barriers and facilitators to moving into these new roles.
Education
The educational role the library has assumed has taken two paths. The first focuses on
training faculty, students, and researchers (sites A, B, C, and D); the second focuses on training
librarians (sites A, B, and C). Librarians at all four sites have developed and offer weekly or
monthly workshops related to data management for researchers; however, much of the education
for researchers has occurred face-to-face on an as-needed basis. Three of the sites (A, B, and C)
have also assumed a role in developing and providing workshops not only for their own
librarians to help them feel comfortable talking with researchers, but also for librarians outside of
their institution to begin to build a network of peer support and to learn from one another. In
these instances, the focus has been to bring in outside speakers to talk about the importance of
libraries supporting e-science, and what that means for the local library and for the future of the
library profession. Libraries at sites A, B, and C have also made contact with library and
information science (LIS) master’s programs to exchange ideas as to how to incorporate more
data management techniques and discussion of related issues into the curriculum. One result of
these discussions at libraries A and C has been to support data management internships (typically
one semester long) for students who are interested in working in this area, believing this type of
opportunity to work with data as students will encourage LIS graduates to seek employment and
further their education in the area of data management. Table 4.1 summarizes the common roles
in education.

Policy
All four libraries (sites A, B, C, and D) have had a formal role in setting university-wide
policy by serving on campus-wide committees that discussed issues related to data management.
They have contributed and shared information and have the opportunity to interact and provide
feedback, and express suggestions and concerns. Libraries at sites A, C, and D have partnered
with researchers specifically to manage the external data requirements imposed by funders.
Three of the four libraries (sites A, B, and D) have played an active role in helping to set national
metadata standards; all four indicated that they advised researchers on options or proposed
existing standards that could be implemented on specific projects. Table 4.2 lists common
policy-related roles.

Research
Two main roles related to research were identified in all four libraries (sites A, B, C, and
D): partnering with researchers to secure external funding and writing grants. Details were not
given as to the success rate in these endeavors, or to the specific types of grants applied for, or
what the assigned roles of the grants were (if funded). However, more details on the types of
services provided are listed in the next section.
Services
In relation to the list of 14 services related to e-science provided by the libraries (Table
4.3), all four libraries provided eight of the services. These core services included traditional
reference and consultation services, but with a focus on data: how to manage, store, and ensure
long-term preservation and access. Offering assistance in designing data management plans has
been the one service that has led to opportunities for libraries to highlight the importance of
sharing data, promote services the library offers through the institutional repository, and explain
it is appropriate to store data there. Libraries have been able to plant ideas for future partnership
when data management is considered and implemented throughout the course of a research
project.

A number of services relate to facilitating the dissemination and discovery of datasets.
First, university administration and research faculty view librarians as the local expert on
metadata standards. Librarians consult on projects in a wide range of subjects, often working
with researchers to determine which data elements are critical to the project and to identify the
key elements that future researchers will be interested in using as discovery points. Two libraries
(sites A and C) create controlled vocabularies for local projects. Second, all four libraries create
DOIs for datasets. Libraries (sites A, B, and C) are also involved in documenting data usage
rights and creating permanent URLs for datasets. Sites A, B, and D indicated that new e-science
programs and services provided opportunities for librarians to become embedded in and to be
active members of research teams in which they manage research data and offer other
information-related services such as literature searches, bibliographic management, and other
contributions to the overall work of the project.

138

Delivery
The four libraries use two different approaches to offering services for researchers: (1) a
special section of the library website dedicated to the topic, and (2) customized workshops as
described above, in which researchers can learn about data management requirements specific to
their areas of study and funders. These two methods, in addition to reaching researchers through
a liaison role1 (sites B and C), offer flexibility by providing just-in-time/on-demand services.
Additionally, libraries at sites A, B, and D conducted an internal assessment of researcher
needs and how these lined up with the current library services, and then decided to form new
departments to bring like staff together and add formal authority and recognition to the services
being offered. These same libraries have also actively sought opportunities to partner with
researchers on grants and provide data management services as part of the research team. Table
4.4 lists the common delivery methods used.

The liaison role is characterized by Rodwell and Linden Fairbairn (2008) as an outward-looking service,
emphasizing stronger involvement and partnership with the faculty and direct engagement in the university’s
teaching and research programs.

Implementation Facilitators and Barriers
Facilitators and barriers to implementation were solicited from librarians who provide escience support services. Two facilitators were identified by two or more libraries; librarians at
sites A, B, and C recognized individual initiative as an important contributor to their success,
indicating that it took a concerted effort to educate themselves and translate the knowledge
gained into an action plan to reach out to faculty and form new partnerships. Associated with this
is the other common facilitator shared by librarians at sites A, C, and D: the NSF data
management plan requirement.2 As a result of this new policy, librarians saw an opportunity to
identify what NSF was looking for in a data management plan and then talk with researchers and
share their expertise. Only one barrier, limited resources, was shared by three libraries (sites A,
B, and C). The resources specifically identified referred to staff, and particularly funding to hire
additional qualified staff.
Changes Occurring to Provide E-Science Services and Programs
Of the 10 shared changes identified, all four libraries experienced at least five of them
(see Table 4.5), which allowed the investigator to detect a common process used in the four
libraries to bring about change. There was an identified need for data management support and
education on campus, and the library administration believed it was essential for the library to
establish itself as a principal contributor, offering unique skills that could be applied to meet this
need: organization, classification and subject indexing, authority control, and metadata. Initially
one or two librarians were asked to take the lead in developing some new data-related services.
These librarians at first saw this task as an added responsibility, but then realized it was really
more than a new service; it was a new role that that they were assuming. They were soon

Effective January 18, 2011, all proposals submitted to NSF must include a supplementary document of no more
than two pages labeled "Data Management Plan" (DMP). The supplementary document must describe how the
proposal will conform to NSF policy on the dissemination and sharing of research results.

working with new groups across campus and building new partnerships. As the demand grew,
the library administration formed a new department and redesigned positions and recruited staff
to meet demand.3

Three of the four libraries (sites A, B, and C) indicated that the creation of the new
department resulted in a larger restructuring of the library. This restructuring included new
reporting lines and hiring new staff and/or managers. During interviews at these same three
libraries, librarians and administrators discussed the need to acquire new knowledge, skills, and
abilities to meet the demands of providing data management services; hiring new staff was seen
as the primary way to fulfill the need for a new type of expertise.
Libraries at sites A and C shared two common changes. The first change was to become
actively embedded in departments outside of the library. This is primarily done by partnering on
grants. The second change was the impact of data management on internal library workflows. As
specific departments and individual librarians become knowledgeable about NSF data

requirements, metadata, and subject repositories, questions arose as to how to handle inquires for
data services; should everyone be able to answer questions and provide services, or should
inquiry be funneled to a designated library department or individual?
Libraries at sites B and D were the only two to indicate that supporting e-science and data
management was a new role for librarians. The traditional independent and entrepreneurial
nature of researchers at these two universities resulted in a decentralization of many networking
and related technical infrastructure services; however, researchers look to the library for its
expertise in long-term preservation, access, and metadata. As new relationships formed,
librarians found themselves in a new role.
Future Changes
Although all the libraries in the study have established programs and services to support
e-science and specifically data management, they indicated more work still needs to be done and
additional changes were to come. Libraries at sites B and D specified that additional resources
and effort would be put towards monitoring the environment, both at the university level and in
how research is being conducted, so that they may continue to modify existing services and plan
for new services. They also specified that they would continue to monitor what was happening at
other peer libraries and how e-science affects the library profession.
At the time the investigator conducted interviews, libraries at sites C and D, had not made
major changes to librarians’ job descriptions. New descriptions were written for newly created
positions, but no substantial re-writing of current positions had been undertaken. E-science
related goals were set annually and discussed; there remains a specified need to formalize duties
such as data management and partnering on research grants into new positions, and also to go
back and incorporate those duties into existing job descriptions.

142

Experience of Change
Despite the differences in local culture and among individual librarians, there is some
overlap in the experiences of changes that have occurred (see Table 4.6 for a summary of the
changes). Librarians at institutions C and D considered the many changes they experience and
indicated that they believed librarianship was moving into a new area or environment; one that
focuses less on the historical print collection and considers raw data to be an important asset.
They believe that they have the foundation and the skills necessary to take an active role in this
new environment, one where the emphasis is more on services than on collections.

Agreeing with the above statements, but experiencing the changes as an internal rather
than external reaction, librarians at sites A and C stated that in order to manage change it was
necessary to adopt a new attitude or view of the library’s role and purpose within the institution;
librarians are embracing the opportunity and welcoming the changes that e-science has brought
about. Librarians at both institutions emphasized the importance of self-education. They
indicated that there was support from library administration for additional training, but still felt it
was their personal responsibility to participate in the training being offered and to acquire any
secondary subject knowledge required.

143

Librarians at sites B and D shared a common experience of reaching out to new groups
while providing e-science services. One group on campus specified was those working in
administrative positions within research departments, but new researchers and faculty were also
mentioned. By contrast, librarians at institutions A and C indicated that researcher resistance was
a hurdle that they had to overcome; they had to do a more effective job at communicating the
benefits of including librarians early in the research process.
Type of Change
Library administrators and librarians were asked two questions regarding the types of
changes occurring in the library. First, they were requested to categorize the changes that have
been taking place as either evolutionary (small and methodical) or transformative (major and
revolutionary). Second, they were asked if the changes were primarily in content (type of
materials, skills used) or in context (environment, role) (see Table 4.7).

The question of whether the changes were evolutionary or transformative in nature
sparked much discussion. Although no one interviewed believed the changes to be out-right
transformative, librarians at three locations (B, C, and D) indicated there was an element of the
transformativeness present, stating such things as:

144

•

“the ideas are a revolutionary way to think of librarianship” (Focus Group
Participant at site C),

•

“if we had more time to dedicate to the projects it could be revolutionary” (Focus
Group Participant at site B),

•

“part of the constraints on how transformational it is for us is the resource
constraints that we are under” (Focus Group Participant at site B),

•

“I think for the library at large, it is revolutionary. I would share that my manager
looks at it and says this is the future of libraries. It is quite revolutionary. It really
shakes the fundamentals of what libraries do but we are just at the early stages of
it. But it has great potential” (Focus Group Participant at site C).

Sentiments such as these lead to two other shared themes. First, comments such as “rapid
little steps” (Focus Group Participant at site A) or “hurry up and wait” (Focus Group Participant
at site C) were shared, implying that the changes were evolutionary, but at times felt
revolutionary; as if they were being taken in a whole new direction and required to learn new
skills. A second theme common to these two libraries (sites A and C) is that the library was
reacting to external forces, stating that the truly transformational changes were occurring outside
of the library. Examples mentioned included how scientific research is being conducted and the
emphasis on collaboration and interdisciplinary research.
The associate directors were consistent across the four libraries in declaring that the
change was evolutionary in nature: three of the directors (at sites A, C, and D) agreed with them,
testifying that it took time to communicate how e-science and data management fit with the
overall vision of the library. Administration was slowly setting goals that would gradually bring
about the changes. The directors wanted to make sure the staff were in place and were trained

145

and ready for the new role, and that there were opportunities for early successes. Other reasons
given for the evolutionary pace of change were: all changes are carefully planned and processed,
applying the resources took time, there was a period of experimentation, and success had been
limited.
Regarding whether librarians view the recent changes as changes in context or content,
there was no clear answer (see Table 4.8). Eight librarians indicated that the change was in
context (environment and role). In their opinion the content was the same; however, librarians
were now getting involved earlier in the research process and data life cycle, forming new
relationships, and placing a greater emphasis on services: “It certainly is the context because
we’ve traditionally been in the point of helping the faculty member find supplementary
information to help them with their current research. Here we are helping them conduct their real
research as opposed to the literature review or looking up things that they might use” (Focus
Group Participant site C). However, five librarians (at site A, B, and C) did not see the
distinction so clearly:
I would say when you start doing it; it feels like a whole new area. It’s not
something that you can just walk in and instantly feel comfortable with. There
is a large learning curve to be able to adequately understand even what you
are talking about. … There was a lot of self-education that had to happen
there. Once you are in it, I see a lot of parallels with what I am already doing.
I think it depends on how far you are into it whether that is the case or not.
(Focus Group Participant at site C)

146

Further,
The content is a different kind of content and yet the content is so different
that the context is different too. I am still using a lot of the same skills that I
always had, analyze, breakdown, facilitate. I don’t think that taking a dataset
and moving it through the process of getting it absorbed by the library, for
example, is really anything like what we’ve done before because there is
something so inherently different about the content. We have to change how
we do that because it just doesn’t make sense anymore. (Focus Group
Participant at site B)

Role of Library Administration
The role of library administration varies from institution to institution based on local
culture and needs; however, two of the libraries, sites B and C, shared three common roles. The
first is to create buy-in and make sure all staff are pointed in the same direction. This involves
demonstrating how e-science and data management align with a library’s overall mission and
vision, and indicating how current and new staff will fit into this new future. The second is to
provide a workflow so that the library staff can move quickly and decisively when opportunities
arise. The third is to oversee the lasting development and sustainability of programs and services,

147

hoping to ensure the programs and services will remain viable in the long term; meaning it is the
role of administration in these instances to make sure library staff have all the appropriate
resources as librarians focus on building new relationships and learning about the data to be
managed.
Setting Vision
A primary function of leaders is to produce change and set the direction of that change.
Setting the direction is not the same as planning. Planning is a management function designed to
produce results, not long-term transformational change. Setting the direction is inductive; leaders
look for patterns, relationships, and linkages (Kotter, 2008b). The end result is vision. According
to Freed and Klugman (1997) “A vision statement is a philosophy about values; it is futuristic
and optimistic … [It] answers the question: Where do we want to be in five to 10 years and what
do we want to be doing?” (p. 59).
Seeley (1992) defines two types of vision, both related to the concepts of first- and
second-order changes as proposed by Levy and Merry (1986). Using the concept of first-order
changes, those that deal with functional improvements, Seeley asserts that these changes are
connected to first-order vision or program vision. An example of a change requiring a program
vision in this study is the introduction of e-science programs and services.
Second-order changes are those that necessitate a restructuring or a re-thinking of an
organization's roles, rules, relationships, and responsibilities. Seeley (1992) stresses that such
second-order changes require system vision. "The leader has to visualize not just how a new
program or practice would work, but how whole new sets of expectations, relationships,
accountability structures, etc., would fit together into a coherent whole" (Seeley, 1992; Section 2:

148

System Change Requires System Vision). Libraries at sites A, B, and C have both a program and
system vision.
The program visions at sites A, B, and C share the common themes of serving the local
communities, increasing researchers’ data awareness, and providing data management
educational programs. (The systems visions at these same sites are unique to the local
environment.) In addition, the library administrators at the three sites (A, B, and C) all
commented that the program vision was a shared vision4 and was conceived with input from
library managers and key librarians, as well as input from external partners such as strategic
partners, the office of information technology, and the office of research.
Leadership Challenges
All leaders encounter challenges, issues, and difficulties every day. As roles and
responsibilities change, this brings tribulation, and no matter how good a leader someone is,
he/she cannot stop that from happening. How the leader handles those ordeals will define him or
her as a leader and have a great deal to do with how effective the leader is (Kotter, 2008b). Every
leader must face challenges and learn to deal with them in some way.
Five identified leadership challenges were shared by two or more of the four libraries (see
Table 4.9). The one challenge shared by all four libraries is the need for staff with the
appropriate knowledge, skills, and abilities to assume new roles of data manager and researcher
partner. This lack of staff capacity, the need for focused expertise, and the desire for freshness
and objectivity resulted in library administration seeking to recruit new staff who could provide
an infusion of energy and be in a position to seize opportunities more quickly.

The concept of shared vision is developed in more detail in Chapter 8.

The second most frequently identified challenge (libraries at sites A, B, and D) is raising
awareness within the library and across the institution. Lack of awareness of why a change is
being made can be the primary reason for resistance to the change. Without current information
on pending changes, it becomes a challenge for an individual to align with the direction of the
institution. Internal communication is essential in dealing with this challenge; it involves
frequent, detailed, timely, and relevant communications that address what is changing, why
change is being made, and the rewards and risks of not changing as a library and on an individual
level. All of the libraries studied have engaged specific staff in e-science project planning and
visioning from the outset and identified them as “change agents” (someone helping to push the
boundaries of what the library can do differently) to be on-going champions of change within the
library and across the institution. Libraries at sites A and D specifically mentioned the challenge
of educating faculty about the importance of data management and the support that the library is
able to offer. Still, the majority of faculty view the library as a repository of books.
Another challenge that two libraries (sites A and B) face is that each discipline has its
own particular requirements and issues associated with data management. There are highly
independent departments that want to take a decentralized approach, and those that seek

150

centralized support programs. There is tension between the two groups, and it has been difficult
for the library staff to bring together those disparate perspectives, and to communicate that
everyone is working toward the same end. The library seeks to be respectful and supportive of
the different approaches and data needs of various researchers.
Libraries at sites A and B also shared a second common challenge, that of identifying the
role of the library in data management. There is a strong tradition of researcher independence
and control over how they conduct their own research and how they manage the data they
generate; it has taken the library a long time to identify and work through all the issues and reach
a common level of agreement about who should be doing what. These discussions are not just
limited to faculty and researchers; other support services such as information services and the
office of research have also been included in these types of discussions.
Communication
Communication is an important part of change management. One aspect of success in
managing organizational change is the ability to choose the right channels of communication that
match the context and to phrase the messages properly (Kotter, 1990). Although no one method
of communication was shared across all libraries, administrators are using a variety of channels
to relay the importance of the library becoming involved in e-science and data management (see
Table 4.10).
There were two popular methods for communicating the importance of change. The first
is meetings and presentations for all library staff (libraries at sites A, B, and C). This type of
communication was seen as a way for library administration to present formally the plan and
strategic priorities for engaging in e-science and to begin a dialog about the impact of change.
The second method used to communicate the importance of the pending changes was to make

151

structural adjustments to the organization and reporting structures (libraries at site B, C, and D).
Administrators thought the most effective way to communicate importance was to reassign staff
and assign resources to the formal e-science and data management programs.

Empowering
Empowerment occurs when organizational leaders engage staff in ways that promote
personal and professional growth. Leaders help employees to extend their capabilities and thus
make progress toward realizing the staff's full potential (Erickson, Hamilton, Jones, &
Ditomassi, 2003). Administrators at all four libraries see providing encouragement to librarians
as an important factor in empowering them to change. One specific type of program identified to
do this is a formal rewards and recognition program. As well, library administrators at sites B, C,
and D feel that giving librarians the freedom to explore new relationships and roles is a critical
step for librarians becoming comfortable in assuming new responsibilities.
Believing everyone in the library has something to contribute to the development of the
vision, library administration at sites B and C actively encourage librarians to take risks and
propose innovative ideas and programs. Knowing that the library was moving into new territory,

152

and there were no reference points to judge whether ideas were good or bad, useful or useless,
library administrators listened to all ideas and worked in small groups to cultivate the best ideas
and encourage ownership of the emerging initiatives. Table 4.11 summarizes the methods library
administrators used to empower staff.

Sustainability
Sustainability requires widespread operational and cultural changes. Library
administrators have taken a number of operational steps to help ensure sustainability over time
(see Table 4.12). The first action taken at the libraries at sites B, C, and D was that their
administrators prepared library staff to assume new roles through training and/or mentoring
programs. Beyond ensuring that existing staff understood the importance of moving in a new
direction by assisting researchers with data management, administrators at three libraries (at sites
A, B, and D) obtained the funding necessary to provide needed resources, one of which was the
funds to hire new staff. Library managers indicated one of their major challenges was creating
staff expertise. A critical step in sustaining the desired changes has been to bring in new staff
with the needed skills and drive to ensure the library continues to move forward in bringing
about the desired future. Finally, to help internalize the changes and make them part of the new
culture going forward, libraries at sites A, B, and D have incorporated the changes into the

153

reporting and evaluation process. This is an important step in internalizing the libraries’ new
role.

Hurdles to Implementation
Implementing a major change is complicated. Managerial leaders must address not only
individual barriers to change, but also the organizational dynamics that often thwart these efforts.
All four library directors identified to hurdles as limited resources: staff, money, and time (see
Table 4.13). Associated with this, administrators at sites C and D indicated that there were many
competing priorities coupled with limited resources, which make it difficult to meet all the
institutions needs associated with providing comprehensive data management services.

A final hurdle identified by administrators (sites B, C, and D) is staff resistance to the
changes and to assuming new roles. Director D summarized the issue: “Staff are creatures of
habit and find it hard to abandon behavioral routines that the organization considers no longer
appropriate. They like comfort zones by continuing routine role patterns.” People resist structural
and cultural changes that force them out of comfort zones and require investing more time and
energy learning new role patterns.
Conclusion
As Table 4.14 shows, the greatest area of similarity among the four sites is in the services
the library provides and the changes that have been brought about in order to provide those
services. There are fewer areas of overlap in the roles the library assumes on campus in support
of e-science, such as participating in the establishment of policies and assuming a role in
research.

Limited resources

Overall, the majority of librarians and administrators interviewed agreed that the changes
that were occurring were coming about slowly and methodically and that the change was
primarily one in context (the environment). When it came to leadership issues such as
challenges, methods used to empower librarians, and hurdles to overcome, there were some
identified core issues, but overall there were limited similarities, perhaps due to local culture and
leadership styles.
There were five areas in which two or three libraries shared similarities:
1.

Implementation facilitators and barriers;

2.

Future changes;

3.

The librarians experience of change;

4.

Methods of communication; and

5.

How changes are sustained.

156

Again, many of these areas are more closely related to internal factors in which the library
operates, such as the library’s relationship with university administration, the skill set and
learning curve of the librarians, and the resources with which the library has to work.
Findings from the individual case studies and the cross-case themes described in this
chapter are discussed and interpreted in the following chapters. The first of these chapters,
Chapter 5, examines the driving forces for change. Chapter 6 discusses the stages and process of
change, while Chapter 7 reviews what changed and the nature of those changes. Chapter 8
addresses the leadership issues associated with bringing about those changes. Chapter 9 draws
together the important themes covered in this and the previous chapter, and reflects on the
implications of the study’s findings for academic libraries, as well as identifying topics for
further study.

CHAPTER 5
THE DRIVING FORCES FOR CHANGE

There are numerous drivers of organizational change. In some instances change can be a
response to natural growth and success, or to a crisis. Some internal changes can also be
considered necessary adjustments in order to maintain the status quo, not necessarily to
transform an organization. Not all change is of the same magnitude. Some changes have greater
implications than others for staff members and other stakeholders who are experiencing the
changes (House, 2005; Wagner, 2006).
A variety of labels are given to the differing types of change, such as technical versus
adaptive challenges (Heifetz & Linsky, 2002) or episodic versus continuous (Weick & Quinn,
1999). As outlined in Chapter 2, this study uses the concept “first-order” and “second-order” as
established by Levy and Merry (1986) to distinguish the type of change occurring. (Table 2.2
presents the differences between these orders of change.) As a first step in understanding the
order of change, the investigator applied Lundberg’s (1984) forces for transformational change
(enabling, permitting, pre-existing conditions, and triggering events), which serves as the
framework for this discussion about why the libraries under study became involved in e-science.
Before examining the forces that propelled a library to become involved in e-science, it is
important to consider what library administrators said when asked why it was important to be
involved in e-science activities on campus. In all four libraries the investigator was told that the
library staff had skills and expertise, pre-existing relationships, and direct experiences that could
be applied, and that supporting researchers' information needs is a critical part of the library’s

159

mission (see Table 5.1). These themes emerge repeatedly through the chapter as the driving
forces for change are examined.

Well, libraries are all about content. Data underlies the content that makes up the
published scholarly record. So, I think, for me it is a very obvious conclusion that
libraries need to be involved in managing the underlying data or at least in making
the connections with the organizations that will help to manage the underlying data
that supports research across different subject domains. And also developing and
insuring that best practices are used in order to manage and curate that data and
insuring that there is a final or ongoing way in which these data can be maintained.
You know, I see that as one of the three pillars of librarianship with the
responsibility just extended to focus on data because essentially it is what underlies
the content of published literature. (Associate Director)

A

It seemed appropriate and natural to us since we support research here to follow and
in some cases try to anticipate where research was headed in terms of use of digital
objects and digital tools and digital manipulation and data mining and so on and to
support them in these new media as we had supported them before. …This is just the
way that scholars and researchers work these days. It seemed entirely appropriate to
us that the libraries should track with them into this brave new world. (Director)

B

The libraries have a lot to offer, in terms of expertise around issues associated with
managing data, if you think about the life cycle management of it and in terms of
providing access to it and about preserving it for the longer term. These are
important issues that are really going to be, if anything more important, going
forward, as research becomes even more data intensive and more and more data is
created and as mandates for sharing the data increase as well. All universities are
going to have to, or all research institutions are going to have to deal with how to
develop best practices and with data life cycle management and because the libraries
have long experience and expertise, in terms of preservation of information,
applying metadata for discovery and access, and rights management and things. I
think there are roles and value that we can provide. And working with others in our
context here at the university, in terms of coming up with the right set of solutions
and approaches and developing the roles and responsibilities in a manner that will
move us all forward. (Associate Director)

Someone has to do it and we are the ones that have the intellectual and theoretical
knowledge to organize and allocate identifiers to data. You have to think of data as
being analogous to collections. (Director)

C

It’s really important to help scientists and researchers manage their data which of
course, includes the preservation and curation so that they can focus more on their
science. I think the library is an organization that can do that. I think the library is an
organization that thinks about the long-term, focuses on preservation, has a
sustainable source of funding and has some principles and a service-oriented mission
that blends in very well with that. (Associate Director)

D

Permitting Conditions
Permitting conditions are any internal aspects of the libraries’ situation that permit
change to occur. Lundberg (1984) offers four examples of internal conditions that can make
change possible. One is having a surplus of resources to manage the change, such as managerial
time and energy or financial resources. A second example is the readiness and willingness of a
principal coalition of staff to embrace the uncertainty of the pending changes. A third example is
the extent to which the department is connected to and dependent on the larger whole. The final
example focuses on the stability and influence of leadership; there needs to be some stability
among the administrative membership and some degree of strategic awareness and competence
in the power coalitions that exist in the local environment.
Surplus of Resources
In all the study sites directors and librarians commented on the lack of financial
resources, indicating there were some limitations placed on what they sought to achieve. For
example, in one library there was not enough money to hire three new people as desired, yet
there were funds available for training existing staff; and in all cases, once it was demonstrated
161

over time that additional help was necessary to continue forward, funds were available to hire
one or two new staff members as the e-science program started to take shape. However,
resources are not limited solely to money. People, energy, and time are important elements of
organizational resources. Each of the study sites had some critical resources on hand to
contribute to the new direction.
Principal among these resources was a willingness of library administration to become
involved. Through participation on university committees and in discussions with researchers
and university administrators, library administrators became aware of a need for a systematic
approach to data management across the institution. In some instances (libraries at sites B and D)
where the institution as a whole operates as a decentralized organization the challenge to become
involved has been greater. Yet, overall there were a number of internal resources available that
library administrators could use as their foundation for involvement. Among these was skilled
staff with a transferable expertise in a number of areas deemed critical to effective data
management, such as cataloging, organizing, archiving, preservation, access and retrieval. As the
Library Director at site C commented,
Someone has to do it and we are the ones that have the intellectual and
theoretical knowledge to organize and allocate identifiers to data. You have to
think of data as being analogous to collections. … When people in the
libraries question whether we should be involved, they’ve said, we don’t get
involved with research at the beginning. We get involved only with the
publication of the result of the research by archiving it and making it
accessible. … I said, ‘No that is not true.’ Our archives, sitting upstairs have
millions and millions of pieces of paper and monographs and rare books and

162

all kinds of things. They are really raw bits of data until a researcher, a
humanist, or a social scientist comes in and uses them do they actually
become research products. We are actually enabling and facilitating before the
research process starts, if you think about what we are doing in archives and
special collections. In a way, that is the way we think about the e-science
datasets is that they are more or less, raw bits of non-tangible data that we
have a responsibility to describe or assist in describing and that assistance is
with sharing and ultimately if it is deemed appropriate by the researcher or
community of researchers to preserve it.
Additionally, two other pre-existing elements were present in the libraries. First were
department and/or subject-based liaison programs in which current relationships served as the
basis for future working partnerships. Second, there were technology solutions (archiving
systems and institutional repositories) and structures in place that expedited the libraries’
involvement. According to Choudhury (2008), the institutional repository is “a ‘gateway’ to the
underlying digital archive that will support data curation” (p. 211). He also states that
institutional repositories can play an important role in supporting new forms of data-intensive
scholarship, and “data have become a new form of publication, which are critical for [scientists’]
research and teaching purposes” (p. 215).
System Readiness
Library administrators and librarians simultaneously heard requests from researchers for
assistance with managing data. At each site there was a small core of librarians who were
interested in exploring and learning more about managing data. Librarians at site B explained it
as a “grassroots effort” in which a small group of them began working one-on-one with willing

163

researchers to manage small data projects and build a base which future services would be
modeled on. One Focus Group Participant at site C, supporting the “interested core” concept, had
more to say about the level of engagement as he has witnessed it:
There are about 40 library faculty members and about a third of them are pretty
keen on data. It is either [because they have] an individual research interest or it
has impacted their job and they are very progressive in their thinking, very active.
I would say there is another third in the middle that are open to it, interested in it.
They come to the brown bags, maybe they are just getting their feet wet doing it
or they are just being supportive, I don’t know. And there is another third, kind of
the bottom third, who don’t perceive this as part of their job. It is not something
they were trained to do in library school and for whatever reason they just haven’t
or they just feel like they are too busy.
In the library at site D the approach is to move key staff into temporary leadership roles
to help support and bring about new initiatives:
I am trying to break the culture that so many librarians have that is “we do good
things and everyone knows it so why should we have to count it or to quantify it.”
That simply doesn’t work from where I sit. Fortunately, I have a fairly substantial
number of leaders who agree with that and see that. As we develop our annual
refreshed strategic plan and decide the very specific initiatives we are going to be
working on every year, my management team changes. I am calling it a strategic
planning team and no one is there because of the position they hold. They are
there because of the work we want to focus on during a given year. … it has been

164

a very energizing force for the younger staff because it really focuses on not “who
am I” but “what am I doing.” (Director at site D)
System Coupling
Knowing the library is one element of the larger organization, the library administration
at all sites reached out to other vested groups on campus (information technology, the office of
research, and other faculty based committees) to identify issues and brainstorm solutions. These
connections were primarily established through past working relationships and committee work,
and provided an opportunity for all involved to become aware of each other’s services, expertise,
future plans, and concerns. By working together as a group, when one part of the organization
shifts into a new role the others are made aware and also have the opportunity to shift and grow.
Agent Power and Leadership
Two points raised by Lundberg (1984) are pertinent here. First, his reference to
leadership is in regard to the overall need for stability in the leadership and management team.
Stability brings a level of constancy and consistency that individuals, teams, and organizations
need during a time of transformational change. A lack of stability harms culture, stifles
productivity, erodes trust, and makes it extremely difficult to retain top talent (Myatt, 2013).
Instability can also be an indication of larger problems. The libraries in the study have all
experienced stability across their upper level managers and in the director and associate director
positions. They have sought to strengthen the library’s e-science and data management team by
recruiting librarians who have a specific interest and skills in the area.
Second, Lundberg (1984) uses the term agent power to link the concepts of stability with
a strategic awareness and competence in the local power coalitions. Bolman and Deal (2003)
identify power as an important concept in their political structure frame. The political frame

165

looks at the work of a leader in terms of making decisions, resolving conflicts and allocating
resources in the organization (Bolman & Deal, 2003). They identify a basic group of skills
connected with this frame: (1) mapping the political terrain, (2) networking, (3) building
coalitions, and (4) negotiating.
The libraries participating in the study clearly knew who the stakeholders on campus are
and with whom they need to forge coalitions, specifically the campus information technology
services and the office of research (in addition to individual researchers). The library leaders also
know what the strengths and weaknesses of the library staff are and have a clear idea of where
the library could and could not contribute. Table 5.2 compares Lundberg’s permitting conditions
with those noted by the investigator.

166

Enabling Conditions
Enabling conditions are external and environmental circumstances that increase the
likelihood of transformational change occuring. Lundberg (1984) concluded that the extent of the
threat of not changing (domain forgiveness) due to competitors, loss of finances, and customers
looking elsewhere for services are important factors in enabling transformational change to
occur. In addition, the degree to which supporting groups and customers are willing to tolerate
the change, such as a break with a traditionally accepted or mutually agreed upon role, as well as
the extent to which these stakeholders view the change as being too radical, can affect the
environment and the circumstances in which the change occurs.
Domain Forgiveness
The most influential external change propelling libraries to become involved in e-science
is how digital technologies and investments in cyber and information infrastructure have
fundamentally changed the way science is conducted. This change was noted in the National
Science Foundation’s Cyberinfrastructure vision for 21st century discovery, which stated that
“converging advances in networking, software, visualization, data systems, and collaboration
platforms are changing the way research and education are accomplished” (2007, p. 5). Scientific
data are central to this transformation. Every day 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is created — so
much that 90 percent of the data in the world has been created in 2010-2012 alone (Zikopoulos,
Eaton, deRoos, Deutsch, & Lapis, 2012). In the sciences, these data can come from multiple
sources (e.g., microarrays and sensors) and be in numerous formats (i.e., numerical and textual
records, images, and sounds). This abundance is driving changes in the way universities view
data, which are now seen as assets that the university wishes to protect and invest in, similar to
buildings and people. Increasingly value is placed on both raw and processed data for potential

167

future uses such as selling or patent possibilities. Researchers and funding organizations are
realizing that data have a lasting value. There is an awareness that research results could just as
likely be in the form of datasets or parts of larger databases rather than as traditional journal
articles (Lynch, 2008). University administrations are looking for a comprehensive solution and
seeking the most efficient way to implement policy and procedures to address these issues, as
well as how to store, preserve, and retrieve data so that data coming out of a research project are
manageable. A university administrator from site A comments:
So first of all, are there policies for what we [universities] are actually going
to do and provide? What are we going to have as far as a centralized
repository? Are there going to be consultants that help people? How are we
going to work with that? How is that going to be paid for? How are people
going to buy into this? … This is a big problem. This is a huge task. The
University is big. There are a lot of different factions we have to worry about.
Setting policy becomes more complicated as the university places a greater emphasis on
forming national and international collaborations to address global problems, with the goal of
harvesting as much data as possible. As well, universities are bringing what were once isolated
departments that are working on the same issue from different perspectives together under the
formation of large institutes. Again a university administrator from site A speaks to the issues:
The biggest change is the establishment of very large institutes where people
have gotten together under themes of research so we have the Institute of …
But the university has been very engaged in a multi-disciplinary, interdisciplinary work and has really been a pioneer in that area. This is a

168

continuation of that, people working with other collaborators and data
management is just another step in that process.
Organization-Domain Congruence
In exploring roles on campus, when a university administrator from site C was asked
what was critical to the success of the institution’s planning and implementation of services, he
made the following comment:
Looking at things I would call critical, the thing would probably be individual
success stories again. There are things that we talk about when we are trying
to make an administrative initiative work and what you always need is a
champion, a committed individual who is willing to give a little bit more than
what they get back, in order to make something work. When it works it
becomes a catalyst for the adoption or involvement of others. I think we’ve
had that from the library in this area.
And,
Well, somebody has to take charge and I am pretty convinced that the libraries
are the best central choice not just because of their historical role of providing
information resources … they are not learning, they are in a position to lead
and they are also central but also have the tentacles out into the community. It
is perfect. … They also have the second resource that others don’t have and
that’s the people whose careers are invested in moving this kind of enterprise
forward. It is not sideline. It is a passion. You won’t find that in any academic
unit. You won’t find it in any dean’s office. (University Administrator, at site
C)

169

An administrator at University B expressed a similar sentiment indicating that libraries
are the natural home for data related services especially when it comes to long-term
curation of data. There are many questions associated with data services that university
administrators must consider, such as: What are the priorities; how will the services be
funded; and are there any contractual obligations? The library is not in a position to
answer all of these questions, but university administrators see the library as having
something valuable to contribute to the conversation.
When three strategic partners from University C were asked if they viewed the library as
a resource, a peer, or a partner, the answers showed the depth of services that the library has
achieved and the relationship that was formed:
I would put all three. They continue to be resource. We are not going to invest
in [repository software]. Why would we …. They continue to be a peer as we
do these collaborative papers … It is that whole peer faculty, colleague, staff
exchange. As partners, I can’t tell you I had this perfect vision of how to do
this. I don’t think they knew what we needed. How do you get together?
When you get good people together, great things happen. The end product is
better than the sum of the bits. (Strategic Partner 1, at site C)
And,
[We] have been working on a lot of projects side-by-side … I see them as
partners or peers. In fact, they have their own research projects …. We’ve
written a few proposals together … we’ve got a joint team that [a librarian]
leads but it is kind of a joint team in terms of development. (Strategic Partner
2 at site C)

170

And again,
Partner because the way I come to view it is that, I am a field researcher, a
field / lab researcher. I work at one scale. I collect one sort of things. I will use
for my own program to answer the question I initially had when I designed the
experiment and then I am done. If I am even to make it available to [other
researchers] down the street, it has become painfully evident that we need
some help from people who are linguists. It is not just translating for us or
trying to figure out the language that we communicate in. It is developing it
and getting us to agree, “I am going to call this, this. This is what you call it.
We have to come to an agreement about an agreed term.” So they are an
active research partner in trying to understand the disconnects between how
the disciplines communicate. I mean I am a discipline and there is another
discipline and I am painfully aware that we don’t communicate. But I am not
likely the person who is going to develop, research, identify, and implement
the communication process, tools, framework, etc. So they are full partners,
otherwise we are not going anywhere. (Strategic Partner 3 at site C)
The relationship that librarians at site C formed with members of the research community was
unique in this study. The acceptance of librarians as equals who have something valuable to
contribute was not only voiced, but put into action and welcomed. Table 5.3 summarizes
Lundberg’s conditions compared with the enabling conditions gathered by the investigator.

Conditions*

* Lundberg (1984).
Pre-Existing Conditions
Pre-existing, or precipitating conditions, according to Lundberg (1984), include the
predisposition of an organization to grow and/or decline, to perform above or below
expectations, the frustration experienced by organization members at the emergence of new
unmet needs, external pressure from stakeholders who have a vested interest, and a real or
perceived crisis. This combination of past experiences and the historical response to those
experiences influences future changes.
Organizational Growth and Decrement
For many years now libraries have been asked to do more with less. The economic crisis
of 2007-2009 brought that issue to the forefront of many who work and provide services in
libraries. Instead of being paralyzed by economic hardships, library leaders took the opportunity
to fine tune their mission, develop transition strategies, and rethink how library staff can
capitalize on their distinctive capabilities (Dougherty, 2009; Nicholas, Rowlands, Jubb, &
Jamali, 2010; Ross & Sennyey, 2008). This includes leveraging human and material resources,

172

setting priorities, and becoming even more closely aligned with a university’s mission. The
library has a long history of changing with the times, adjusting services, and continuing to add
value along the way (Gilchrist, 2007; Holloway, 2004; Mullins, 2009; Neal, 2001).
In the instance of e-science and the new role of data management, the four libraries
focused primarily on growth. The library directors at each site indicated the new direction was
something that was being built on past performance and/or an existing skill set, such as
cataloging print materials transitioning to applying metadata standards, or teaching information
literacy skills evolves into teaching best practices for data management. Primary among the
experiences mentioned was assuming a key role in developing information policies (such as
considerations of an open access resolution and copyright guidelines) for the institution. The
library director at site B explains, “When data issues come along, the faculty and the
administration naturally think about engaging the libraries just because we’ve been advocating
for the right kind of information policies for a long time. A lot of pieces come together.”
As well, the directors at sites A, B, C, and D mentioned that having a long
history of teaching and demonstrating new technologies provided evidence of
important skills that faculty respected and proved to be an asset as librarians started to
teach courses in data management. A Focus Group Participant from site C noted:
My instruction is ramped up. My outreach is ramped up then the e-science
came on board as well. I was involved with that since it involved outreach. …
For me, the biggest efforts have been in information literacy, instruction, …
and then e-science.
At each site university administration viewed the library administrators (director and
associate directors) as being leaders in their field capable of leading the institution in this new

173

area. As an administrator from University C said when discussing the libraries' readiness to
assume a leadership role in data management on campus:
Somebody has to take charge and I am … convinced that the libraries are the
best central choice not just because of their historical role of providing
information resources to faculty members at a university in general but
because the research interests, the scholarly interests of the people in the
libraries have already moved into the domain.
Each of the library directors and associate directors commented on tasks that staff could
stop doing in order to funnel time and resources to the new e-science and data management
initiatives. The library director at site A commented on the government documents librarian,
who was actively promoting the geographic information system (GIS) datasets and becoming an
expert in their application as use of the paper-based government document collection declined.
The desire was expressed by the library directors at sites B, C, and D to focus less on the
building and paper-based collections contained within the physical structure. The following
observation was made by a university administrator from site B when speaking about the
physical space of the library:
In a meeting recently the Libraries came up, and it’s clear to me that a lot of
people still have a very 19th century vision of libraries, place based, as oppose
to information portals. Changing the mindset of the campus is not a negligible
step that’s needed. Maybe that’s less of a problem for the younger generation
[of faculty].

174

Stakeholders
Stakeholders are those people or departments with an interest in or have some
relationship with the library. The confidence placed in the library by university administration is
based on the library’s strong commitment to the university’s mission. The library director’s at all
four study sites spoke of a strong commitment to their local campus community needs. The
interests and information needs of the faculty, researchers, and students drive the programs and
services that the library develops and offers.
At sites A and B both the university administrators and the library directors interviewed
commented on how the library collectively works towards a common mission (see Table 5.5).
The two libraries are clearly in harmony with their larger institution mission. At University A the
administrator spoke of the importance of research that occurs at the institutions and expressed
concern about the management of the data that results from the research. The library echoes the
importance of research to the university mission and identifies the specific role of the library:
“The Library integrates and manages knowledge to enable learning and the creation of new
knowledge” (University A, Administrator).
The library and university administrators at site B are also in accord. Both mention the
keywords of the university mission, learning, discover, and engagement. The administrator
comments on e-science as a critical part of discovery, and the library director calls the library a
partner is these endeavors and links the library mission to the university mission.

175

Table 5.5
Mission Alignment

Library Director

The mission of University is undergoing some
changes. Research, teaching and service are the
three main ones. If you talk about those
certainly it is how research is handled and
processed here on the campus. But more
directly … how we are dealing with
collaborators and sharing that information.
…We have to reevaluate that as an institution
to see how we are going to facilitate that and
get beyond some of the basic questions … not
only how we are going to handle it from a
functional scale or how we are going to handle
massive datasets but also how we are going to
meet researchers expectations for handling the
data.

The University Library is central to the
intellectual life of the University. By providing
and stewarding collections and content that
comprise a current and retrospective record of
human knowledge and by offering a wide array
of services, it enhances the University’s
activities in creating knowledge, preparing
students for lives of impact, and addressing
critical societal needs. The Library advances
the University’s goals by ensuring unfettered
access to information and by providing a
network of expertise that ensures value,
quality, and authenticity of information
resources. The Library integrates and manages
knowledge to enable learning and the creation
of new knowledge.

University B
University Administrator

Library Director

There is a three-part mission … Learning,
discovery with delivery and engagement. … on
the engagement side, making the outcomes
available as broadly as possible whether that is
something that being required by a federal
funding agency or whether it is just in the
culture . . . From my point of view e-science is
a big part of it is this discoverability,
availability, and provenance.

The Libraries are partners with the schools and
departments of the University in meeting the
discovery, learning, and engagement
commitments of the University.
The Library’s primary role is embodied in five
components of the mission: information
transfer, a partner in teaching and lifelong
learning, a partner in discovery, a partner in
engagement, and a repository of the intellectual
record.

176

Real and Perceived Crisis
A crisis can be defined as “an unstable condition involving an impending abrupt or
significant change that requires urgent attention and action to protect life, assets, property, or the
environment” (ASIS International, 2009, p. 45). In this instance, the crisis was more about not
being part of the solution. The ARL Task Force on E-Science was one of the first groups to point
out that e-science trends were evolving rapidly, and libraries could miss opportunities for
contribution and engagement as this form of research evolved if they did not act fast. “In short,
research libraries are potential partners in e-research, yet our existing expertise and
infrastructures will be seriously stretched by the new, more complex demands of e-science”
(Joint Task Force on Library Support for E-Science, 2007, p. 6). In order for the librarians to be
considered partners, they need to be engaged actively with their research communities and
understand the concepts of the domain and the methodologies and norms of scholarly exchange.
This level of understanding and engagement requires being a trusted member of the community
with recognized authority in information related matters.
The library administrators and librarians in the study, without saying it directly, were
responding quickly and as if a crisis was at hand; they needed to retain value. Crisis management
can be defined as a "holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten
an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an
effective response that safeguards the interests of its key stakeholders, reputation, brand, and
value-creating activities - as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities" (ASIS
International, 2009, pp. 45-46). Library management at the study sites indicated that it was
critical for the library to be involved in order to maintain the reputation and continue to be
viewed as a valuable campus asset.

177

Performance Demands
Both the NIH and the NSF view the services and technologies needed1 for advancing escience as complex and massive. The required infrastructure includes education and workforce
development and a comprehensive integrative program to support collaborations of multidisciplinary teams and communities (National Science Foundation, 2012). As university
communities try to address the same requirements (Lynch, 2008), university administrations
have acknowledged that no one department or office is capable of meeting all the needs on its
own. The creation of the underlying infrastructure requires teamwork and collaboration to
develop a comprehensive plan. The library is often viewed as a neutral place on campus with a
long history of collaboration and important skills to contribute.
The library at site C has been working with research departments and individual
researchers, in contrast to information technology services, which are viewed more as a utility
than as a collaborative service. This has placed the library in a position to help facilitate the
conversation around research data needs without going beyond their expertise. Similarly the
library at site D, librarians state that they have a good understanding of preservation and
curation, but when it comes to visualization tools, high-performance computing, storage, and
data mining, they recognize they are not the leaders but they know who on campus is, and the
library partners with them. Table 5.4 summarizes Lundberg’s conditions compared with the
enabling conditions gathered by the investigator.

These services and technology include the scientific and technological means of managing, analyzing, visualizing,
and extracting useful information from large, diverse, distributed, and heterogeneous datasets.

conditions, any event or activity that creates turmoil (crisis, recession, or a new competitor) or an
opportunity (new needs, excess resources, and technological breakthroughs) can catapult an
organization into change. As well, Lundberg (1984) considered events such as a turnover in
management (e.g., hiring a new leader with a new vision), a new trend or movement, new
legislation, and mergers and acquisitions to be triggering events. In the study sites a number of
consistent triggering events occurred.
All of the site libraries have been thinking about e-science and data management for the
past 10-15 years. In this time frame there have been a number of trigging events. None of the site

179

libraries identified any environmental calamities or managerial crises. Rather, they viewed many
of the triggering events as positive experiences which gave the libraries’ staff an opportunity to
display their unique skills and fill a crucial need.
Environmental Opportunities
The site libraries identified two distinct opportunities. One occurred on the local level.
Libraries at sites A, B, and C shared instances in which prominent local researchers who were
coming to the end of their research career contacted the library to transfer the data that they had
accumulated. Most of these data were presented to the library as having value to a specific
research audience, and needing significant curation work to make them useful to that audience.
In these instances, since the data were viewed as historical, the libraries welcomed the
opportunity to demonstrate their value by transitioning the datasets into a hybrid special
collection and data management project. These projects showcased the libraries’ willingness to
work with researchers and add new value to existing datasets. These projects were promoted to
others as examples of the libraries’ work.
The second, environmental opportunities shaping library involvement in e-science and
data management are national events that affect researchers and thus filter down to the local
level. In the past decade, declarations from two key funding agencies in the United States have
brought attention to the value of making data resulting from publicly-funded research openly
available. Starting in 2003 the National Institute of Health (NIH) has required investigators
submitting an NIH application seeking $500,000 or more in direct costs in any single year to
include a plan for data sharing or state why data sharing is not possible. In 2010, the NSF
followed its example:

180

Investigators are expected to share with other researchers, at no more than
incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the primary data, samples,
physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the
course of work under NSF grants. Grantees are expected to encourage and
facilitate such sharing. (National Science Foundation, 2013, D. Intellectual
Property, 4. Dissemination and Sharing of Research Results, Section b)
These two events focus on data; however, the NIH Open Access policy from 2008
requires scientists to submit final peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to
the digital archive PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication. Recent bills2 focus on
published journal articles, often thought of as the finished product of research and not the actual
research data generated throughout the process. The bills require that U.S. government agencies
with annual extramural research expenditures of over $100 million make manuscripts of journal
articles stemming from research funded by the government freely accessible and reusable via the
Internet.
In general, federal mandates provide an important opportunity for libraries because they
were so closely tied to what is important to the researchers, their funding source. As a result, just
when the researchers are looking for assistance in understanding the mandates, the libraries
began providing educational programing; early on the libraries established their authority in
these areas and continue to monitor national and local events closely:
What the next big frontier will be is really hard to say but there will be some
big changes, there is no question about it. Of course, part of it depends on
what happens in the election too. Politics play a big role particularly in areas

More recently, the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR) was introduced in Congress on
February 14, 2013 and the Public Access to Public Science Act (PAPS) on September 19, 2013. See Chapter 1 for
more details.

like ours. [University D] has been, for the last thirty plus years, receiving …
federal research dollars … so we really keep a very close eye what is
happening with federal funding for research because of such a huge part of
how we fund our operations. I am expecting that even the results of the
presidential election will have a fairly direct, although not immediate effect on
what the library does and how it does it. I think people who are in jobs like I
have now, have to keep a broad - we talk about environmental scans. It is a
very large environment we are looking at. (Library Director at site D)
External Revolutions
Along with the two data-sharing requirements mentioned above, the open access3 and
open data4 movements, coupled with the overall changes in scholarly communications, were
viewed as stepping stones for the four libraries to start engaging with the research community on
a new level regarding their research. Initially the librarians at the four sites had more experience
talking about open access than they did data management. Over time, as new tools5 become
available to assist with data management, librarians become more involved and were more
comfortable discussing options with researchers.
Scientific publishers are also continuing to modify their policies to balance what is
happening at the federal government level. Effective May 2013 a condition of publication in any
of the journals published by Nature is that the authors make materials, data, and associated
protocols promptly available to others without restrictions. Datasets must be made freely

3

Open-access (OA) literature is defined as digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing
restrictions (Suber, 2013).
4
Open data are data that can be freely used, reused, and redistributed by anyone. The one requirement is to attribute
authorship and maintain a Creative Commons license (Open Knowledge Foundation, 2012).

HUBzero (http://www.hubzero.org), Cytobank (http:// www.cytobank.org), and WebPAX

available to readers from the date of publication, and must be provided to editors and peerreviewers at submission, for the purposes of evaluating the manuscript ("Announcement:
Reducing our irreproducibility," 2013). Nature Publishing indicates that the motivator for this
change in policy is to “improve the transparency of reporting and the reproducibility of published
results” (Nature Publishing, 2013, Reporting requirements for life sciences research section,
para.1).
Despite the close relationship among open access, open data, and scholarly
communications, the library at site A is the only one in the study that, when reorganizing,
decided that scholarly communication services and data management consulting would be
offered by the same group, taking a broader view of research services. The library repository
manager at site A speaks of her expanding duties:
When I got started doing institutional repository work, the first two or three
years were really focused on getting the repository set up and doing some of
the typical outreach work that many IR managers were doing. But in the last
four years, I’ve become much more involved in issues around scholarly
communications, so broader than just the repository including things like
copyright, working with faculty around copyright transfer agreements and
publication agreements, working around data, and doing consulting around
data services.
Internal Revolutions
The internal changes identified at the libraries participating in the study are few but taken
together have had a major impact on the success of the e-science and data management
programs. One common occurrence in the libraries was the initiative, drive, and leadership of

183

one or more individuals. For Library C one of those individual was the new library director, who
proactively asked researchers what they needed in terms of data management and advocated for
the library to be the one to fulfill those needs. In all of the libraries studied a particular staff
member, existing or newly hired, was willing to embrace the new role the director identified and
served as an inspiration and mentor to others.
Operationally, each of the library directors found it necessary to reorganize the internal
structure to provide the new services that e-science and data management necessitated. However,
e-science was not seen as the only instigator of the reorganization. The changing nature of the
work the library was performing, such as cataloging shifting into metadata and liaison
librarianship migrating to the idea of an embedded librarian, was an equal contributor. Table 5.6
is a summary of the Lundberg conditions compared with the triggering events as gathered by the
investigator.

Conclusion
Examining the question of why an organization undergoes a change from the perspective
of permitting, enabling, and pre-existing conditions, as well as the triggering events, provides a
framework in which to analyze a complex situation. Figure 5.7 summarizes these conditions as
experienced by the study sites. The first two types of conditions, permitting and enabling, set the
library up for a transition. There was a willingness of the library administration to get involved;
key staff members who were interested in participating; and a clear vision for library
involvement and programs, services, and librarian skills to build on. These permitting conditions,
in conjunction with a series of enabling conditions such as the rate of growth of research data
and that data being viewed as having value as a standalone asset, the formation of large (crosscountry and international) research institutes, and the desire for a strategic approach to building a
stable long-term infrastructure, put the library in the center of the issue.
The permitting conditions facilitate change. The libraries' strong service focus and
willingness to collaborate with research teams, their long tradition of teaching and demonstrating
the application new technologies, as well as being well positioned in the university and
advocating library services at university committee meetings, helped to advance the libraries'
efforts to be involved. As data management became an issue of external compliance and funder
requirements (an example of a triggering event), university administrators turned to the library
for advice and leadership. Not all the libraries experienced each of the variables listed in Table

185

5.7, or experienced those to the same extent; however, there is evidence to detect that a
transformational change is possible.
Why an organization undergoes change is just the first part of the question. How the
organization goes about implementing the change is equally important. Change efforts can fail
for a number of reasons, including culture, bureaucracy, politics, low level of trust, lack of
teamwork, poor attitude, lack of leadership, and fear (Kotter, 1996a). Yet, when a clear vision is
formalized and a process for change is followed, the possibilities for transformational change to
occur increase. This is the focus of Chapter 6.

Chapter 6
THE STAGES AND PROCESS OF CHANGE

According to Conner (1993b), the key elements and flow of events involved in change
represent a framework “composed of both patterns and principles – the structure of change” (p.
88). Process models of change describe the sequence of events necessary to effect organizational
change, focusing more on the essential steps of implementation than on the conceptual tasks
required (Latta, 2009). Most organizational change process models are based on Lewin’s (1947)
classic three-stage model of change as described in Table 6.1. Subsequent process models outline
sequences of events that elaborate upon these essential underlying stages of change to varying
degrees (Bate, Khan, & Pye, 2000; Burke, 2008; By, 2005; Conner, 1993a; Galpin, 1996; Hiatt,
2003; Judson, 1991; Kanter, Stein, & Jick, 1992; Kotter, 1996a; Luecke, 2003; Mintzberg &
Westley, 1992; Reardon, Reardon, & Rowe, 1998).

Review of Other Related Change Models
The change management continuum developed by Conner (1993a) is not incorporated in
this study because its main focus is on resistance to change. The Beer, Eisenstat, and Spector

192

(1990) model was specifically not included because its developers believe that change is only
about work alignment and do not deal with “abstractions like participation and culture” (p. 159).
Rather, they propose a model that focuses on change that comes from the bottom up and does not
require the support of senior management. Prosci’s ADKAR (Awareness, Desire, Knowledge,
Ability, and Reinforcement)1 (Hiatt, 2003) and other models (Armenakis, Harris, & Mossholder,
1993; Pettigrew & Whipp, 1993) that are more conceptual in nature than process driven were
also dismissed. Judson (1991), Kanter et al. (1992), Kotter (1995), and Luecke (2003), however,
provide relevant change models because of their emphasis on a step-by-step approach.
Judson. According to Judson (1991), with all the uncertainties executives and managers
must deal with in organizations, the one thing they can count on is change. To remain viable, an
organization must continuously change the way it operates in order to improve performance and
implement its strategy. When confronted with change, people are more likely to resist than to
support it. This applies not only to those directly affected, but also to those lower-level managers
and supervisors who are often crucial to carrying out the change. Judson (1991), focusing on
how people feel about and behave in response to change, developed a comprehensive and
systematic approach to the management of any change which will transform the likely opposition
of those affected and involved into support for making the change work.
Judson (1991) addresses one of the most difficult and important elements of
management: how to approach and manage change to get the desired results. His five steps to
change are:

Founded in 1994, Prosci Inc. is a research firm specializing in the field of change management. Prosci has
developed a set of common language, customized tools and training programs to facilitate the change process for
global organizations. Prosci's globally recognized ADKAR® model has become of the most used change
management models throughout the world, with an emphasis on helping organizations build internal competency to
lead change, from top-level executives to front-line employees (Prosci, 2013).

193

1. analyze the change;
2. communicate the change;
3. gain acceptance of the new behaviors;
4. change from the status quo to desired state; and
5. consolidate and institutionalize the new state.
Kanter. Kanter et al. (1992) argue that Lewin’s model for change (see Table 6.1) is
based on a view that organizations are essentially static and stable. They disagree with the idea
that change results only from concentrated effort and that it happens in one direction at a time.
They argue that change is multi-directional and ubiquitous; in other words, it happens in all
directions at once and is more or less a continuous process.
Kanter et al. (1992) identify two types of change. The first is referred to as “bold strokes”
(p. 492). These are major strategic or economic initiatives taken at the top of the organization
that have a rapid and significant impact, but do not change culture and do not rely on cooperation
from the rest of the organization for success. The second approach is called “long marches” (p.
492). These are smaller initiatives to create long-term change at the operational level. These
initiatives can change culture, but widespread involvement and support from employees are
necessary for success. Both approaches to change use the same 10 step process (Kanter et al.,
1992, p. 383):
1. analyze the organization and its need for change;
2. create a shared vision and common direction;
3. separate from the past;
4. create a sense of urgency;
5. support a strong leader role;

194

6. line up political sponsorship;
7. craft an implementation plan;
8. develop enabling structures;
9. communicate, involve people, and be honest; and
10. reinforce and institutionalize change.
Kotter. Kotter (1995, 1996a, 1996c, 1998, 1999, 2005a, 2005b, 2008a) has written
extensively in the management and leadership literature about his model for organizational
change; his work is recognized as seminal. He began his study of organizational change in the
mid-1980s and within a decade he “watched more than 100 companies try to remake themselves
into significantly better competitors” (Kotter, 1995, p. 59). Kotter observed large and small
companies based in the United States and elsewhere, including companies that were prospering
at the time of change and those on the brink of failure. As a result of those observations, he
identified two lessons: one, that change takes time and skipping steps to speed up the process is
not effective, and, two, that critical mistakes in any of the phases can have devastating impact,
slowing momentum and negating hard-won gains.
Kotter (1996a) established his model for change in response to a set of eight problems he
recognized in organizations that failed to complete a planned change, and so he offered eight
steps to producing successful change of any magnitude in organizations:
1. establish a sense of urgency;
2. form a powerful guiding coalition;
3. create a vision;
4. communicate the vision;
5. empower others to act on the vision;
6. plan for and create short-term wins;

195

7. consolidate improvement and produce more change; and
8. institutionalize new approaches.
Luecke. Luecke (2003) identified two types of change, Theory E and Theory O. The
former is based on an economic approach. The explicit goal is to increase shareholder value
dramatically and rapidly, specifically to improve cash flow and increase share price. Working
from the top down, the executive team drives Theory E changes; usually outside consultants are
hired to work with an executive team to strategize and implement changes. In these instance
departments, units, and employees are viewed as pieces on a “chessboard.” In contrast, the goal
of Theory O change is to develop an organizational culture that supports learning and a highperforming employee base; the emphasis is on individual and organizational learning. Theory O
necessitates high levels of employee participation, a flatter organizational structure, and solid
connections between the organization and its employees. Leaders of Theory O change are less
concerned with directing the change themselves than inspiring involvement from across the
organization, and in fostering employee behaviors and attitudes that will withstand the changes.
Building on the work of Beer et al. (1990), Luecke (2003) proposes seven steps to follow when
implementing either type of change:
1. mobilize energy and commitment through joint identification of business problems
and their solutions;
2. develop a shared vision of how to organize and manage for competitiveness;
3. identify leadership;
4. focus on results, not activities;
5. start change at the periphery, and then let it spread to units without pushing it from
the top;
6. institutionalize success through formal policies, systems, and structures; and
196

7. monitor and adjust strategies in response to problems in the change process.
Case Study Change Process
In the data collection process and the subsequent thematic analysis, the investigator
identified seven common steps that the participating libraries discussed during their
implementation of e-science programs and services. The steps, which were first mentioned in
Chapter 4, are:
1. identified need;
2. decision to act;
3. resources assigned;
4. partnerships formed;
5. paradigm shift;
6. demand increases; and
7. institutionalization of changes.
Identified Need
Kuhn states that "awareness is prerequisite to all acceptable changes of theory" (1996, p.
67). Externally, library personnel (administrators and librarians) at each of the sites included in
the study were learning of the impact data-driven science has on researchers’ methods and
processes for storing and accessing data. Concurrently, opportunities for libraries to participate
and get involved were identified by library organizations (Joint Task Force on Library Support
for E-Science, 2007) and leaders in the library profession (Atkins et al., 2003; Borgman, 2007;
Brant, 2007; Hey & Hey, 2006; Mullins, 2007, 2009, 2010; Neal, 2001; Rambo, 2009).
Simultaneously, library administrators and librarians became aware of a growing need for data
management services, especially in the area of educational programing. Library administrators

197

learned of this need at the institutional level through committee work and networking events,
while librarians who were engaging in one-on-one discussions about opportunities to support
researchers heard that data management was a growing problem.
Table 6.2 provides brief excerpts from the comments library administrations shared with
the investigator while articulating the need across the institution for new services and programs
to be created. The directors at sites A, B, and C spoke to the scope of the issue. The issue is not
just relevant to one or two researchers or departments: it cuts across the entire campus and a
comprehensive systematic solution is necessary. The quote from the library director at site D
speaks to the role of the library and opportunities that are present for the library that is willing to
act. In all of these statements the explicit understanding is that only through making a change
and through collaboration will a solution begin to emerge.

198

Decision to Act
The library directors at the study sites agreed that the identified need aligned with the
larger vision for the library and made the decision to act. The library director from site A stated
that once the need has been established and the opportunity for library involvement identified,
the institution (and the library by default) has a fiduciary responsibility to get involved (see
Table 6.3). The director from the library at site B regards its involvement as a natural progression
from to its previous campus role in information policy development and advocacy. At site C, the
library director’s motivation to act stemmed from the skill set of the library administration and
staff. There was a strong sense among campus administrators that the library was well
positioned to assume a leadership role and guide the campus-wide effort; the library willingly
responded. The library director at site D realized that the library was responding to researcher
needs for data management, but one particular staff member was the only one providing services
and those services were externally funded. As the needs increased across the institution, the
library as a whole had to follow suit and respond formally to the demand. As a result, when the
decision to act was made and a plan was developed, the implementation was easy to begin
because staff members were aware of the importance and they were part of the decision to move
in a new direction.

“When data issues come along, the faculty and the
administration naturally think about engaging the libraries
just because we’ve been advocating for the right kind of
information policies for a long time.” (Library Director,

“We have found that this growing concern about the needs
in e-science has been expanding and that we are the ones
on campus who can help.” (Library Director, site C)
“The data piece is specific enough that we should
approach it in a dedicated way.” (Library Director, site D)

Resources Assigned
As the staff at the libraries worked to make the actual transition from the current state to a
future state, a critical step involved assigning the necessary resources (people, money, space, and
technology) to the new e-science program. Library administrators at each of the sites realized the
importance of deploying resources in support of the e-science goals by providing the staff with
the tools they needed to do their job well, specifically by supporting additional training and
education programs, hiring new staff, and allowing time for the programs and services to grow
based on environmental scanning and local needs. Table 6.4 demonstrates the commitment to
assign physical resources long-term by library administrators. Directors at sites A and D
specifically mention additional staff, whereas the directors at sites B and C remarked on the
commitment to move forward in a formal process, assigning the necessary resources as they are
identified.

200

At a structural level, the libraries also took steps to change the organization, for example,
by creating and/or modifying major structures and processes. These included adding new
departments and staff, as well as providing training on new policies and procedures.
Furthermore, to advance e-science, there continued to be strong, clear, and ongoing
communication about the need for the change, the status of ongoing change, and solicitation of
staff members’ continuing input to the change effort.

“I think it is the formalization of a lot of things that we

“When we do focus on things like e-science … we are
making explicit decisions that this is an area and divide it
up to say we are going to explore it this way. If we decide
that we need to put recurring resources behind it then we
make that decision.” (Library Director, site C)
“We have two librarians who are in the role of data
management consultants who came on board … last
year.” (Associate Director, site D)

Partnerships Formed
Two types of partnerships were formed at the study sites. The first involved partners from
across the institution who were interested in providing data services or had a vested interest in
services being offered on a large scale. In all study sites the library joined efforts with the office
201

of research and the office of information technology services. These three groups worked
together to identify institutional data related issues of mutual concern. Librarians at sites A, B,
and D spoke about these new institutional partnerships, especially with research and
departmental administrators (see Table 6.5). The task of complying with the National Institute of
Health (NIH) Public Access Policy2 often fell to department administrators. As the libraries
reached out to researchers to work with them on complying with the policy, the librarians were
directed to department administrators.
The second partnerships described by the site libraries were those formed between
individual librarians and individual researchers or research team members. Librarians at site C
speak to these newly formed relationships (see Table 6.6). The librarians are shifting into an
embedded role and providing customized data services and instructional sessions. In these
instances the librarians have defined functions and responsibilities to support the research
activities on the research team. These librarians support multiple projects within the university.
When one project ends, the librarian shifts that percentage of focus to another existing or new
project.

“[E]xamples …working with staff who are not faculty and
students per se but who are computing lab managers or
people who are responsible for data management issues
… people whose job is to manage information in that
department not just people whose job it is to find
secondary information;” “We find ourselves working
more closely with outside departments.” (Focus Group
Participant, site B)
“That has involved things like … pushing librarians out
into the departments more so that they [faculty] are
interacting as people as opposed to going into the library
and talking to whatever librarian is there, embedding
within the different departments and getting more
relationships built and that has led to things like data
services and more instructional opportunities.” (Focus
Group Participant, site C)
“They [department administrators] have been a really
important partner and we recognized that early on and
built that relationship solidly.” (Focus Group Participant,
site D)

According to Goosen, true collaboration is a long-term process, often going through
many revisions as environment and relationships change. There are multiple levels of
partnerships (Goosen, n.d.):
•

networking: simply sharing information for the benefit of both parties;

•

coordination: a willingness to alter activities to achieve a common purpose;

•

cooperation: a form of partnership that builds on coordination by sharing resources;
and

203

•

collaboration: includes not only the exchange of information, altering activities, and
sharing resources, but also enhancing the capacity of other partners for mutual benefit
and to achieve a common purpose.

In two instances the investigator spoke with a representative from university
administration (one each at sites A and C) and in one instance the investigator talked to strategic
partners (three from site C). The administrators, strategic partners, and librarians experienced
the range of these partnerships, which often started out as networking but grow to be a full
collaboration. All of the relationships were mentioned as advancing the library’s involvement in
e-science and the goals the library was seeking to achieve.
Paradigm Shift
A paradigm shift is a change from one way of thinking to another. It is often categorized
as a revolution, a transformation, or a sort of metamorphosis. It is not something that happens on
its own, but rather is driven by agents of change (Kuhn & Hacking, 2012). Building on the
original work of Kuhn (1962), Levy and Merry (1986) define the term organizational paradigm
as “the metarules, or conceptual framework and precepts, or the unquestioned assumptions that
shape the organizations beliefs, values, and operations, and provide meaning and direction for
members’ actions” (p. 14). Today the terms paradigm and paradigm shift are ubiquitous and have
lost much of their original meanings. Levy and Merry mention the similarity of the term
paradigm to other common terms at the time of their writing (shared meaning, world view,
context, and conceptual framework to name a few).
Lowry (2002), in response to the emphasis libraries were placing on digital collections,
indicated that the paradigm shift was occurring in the organization and delivery of information
(scholarly information) — not in libraries. Libraries and the profession of librarianship had no

204

choice but to respond to and embrace this change in format and the technological advances of the
time in an effort to maintain their institutional roles and to expand it; “the paths of IT
development, scholarly information, and library transformation have merged, creating a complex
interaction” (Lowry, 2002, p. ix)
In this investigation, efforts initiated by the study sites resulted in what can be
characterized as a paradigm shift, as indicated by the comments in Table 6.6. Unlike the change
described by Lowry (2002), many of the librarians felt they were breaking away from traditional
library roles (sites B and D) and mentioned being involved in the research process at the
beginning (sites A and B) as examples. This shift in mind set is what the library administrators
were seeking and hoping for when they discussed the importance of getting involved in e-science
and data management services.
Demand Increases
As the change process progressed, the increase in demand surfaced as a tipping point3
and required additional resources to be assigned to data management services, such as number of
staff allocated and the percent of time being spent on data management projects. As news of the
results of the libraries services spread, new researchers came forward for assistance, resulting in
new partnerships being formed. The additional resources and new collaborations all validated the
need for new thinking about the role of the library on campus; the paradigm shift took hold (see
Figure 6.1).

3

Gladwell defines a tipping point as "the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point” (2000, p. 12).

“It has been a real marked shift … in the last three or four
years, from thinking we are a digital library, where we are
collecting this to getting much farther into the research
process.” (Focus Group Participant, site A)
“It feels different to me. I feel like we are moving into a
different role. We are working with data earlier than when
we were cataloging books or create metadata. … But we
are trying to work with data, or prepare people…to
manage data before they have created it. We are earlier in
the data life cycle when we are working with people to

“It’s not just, oh, we are helping professor x out and we

components, and resources, and requirements are so that
the libraries as a whole offers this particular service to
researchers and students.” (Focus Group Participant, site

“It is a different from traditional library services. It is even
different from the more digitally-oriented library services
such as digital repositories for documents or faculty

Figure 6.1
Effects of the Increase in Demand

In the case study libraries, demand is driven by users of the services the library is
providing. Beyond the requirements of the granting organizations to provide access to the raw
research data, word spread among the local research community about the work and services the
library provides. A strategic partner at University C commented on the increase is workload the
library had taken on:
They are part of an active brainstorming research group that has grown from
an occasional idea or occasional proposal, to every time we write a proposal.
It has evolved from where I would go talk to them, “do you want to be
involved?’ to say, “okay, we are thinking of doing this, is your group
interested, these are the pieces of text that I have.” It is a back and forth. Is
this what you would still suggest to do? We have moved from a somewhat
occasional, lower-grade effort to a much higher-grade, although still
unfunded, collaborative effort to try and advance it.

“In the area we are looking at, very specific to how to deal

Institutionalization of Change
Often, the most difficult phase in managing change is when managerial leaders4 work to
sustain the momentum of the implementation (Kotter, 2005b). Change efforts can encounter a
wide variety of obstacles, for example staff resistance to assuming a new role, change in key
staff, or lack of resources. The libraries in the study experienced strong, visible, ongoing support
from institutional administration. This was important as the libraries shifted into a new role. In
4

Managerial leaders are defined as “leaders who are influencing others, creating visions for constructive change,
and developing mutual purposes, while at the same, serving as managers involved in the effective planning,
organizing, staffing and controlling of their organizations” (Lim, 2012, p. 154).

208

the libraries, those directly asked to support e-science through programs and services received
ongoing support, including the provision of resources along with training and coaching.
Three of the study sites (A, C, and D) decided it was important to restructure the library
organization so that specific staff could dedicate time to data management. Library
administrators at site B, who described the library’s involvement as a “grassroots effort” growing
from the bottom up, decided it would be best to encourage all staff to get involved in data
management and formed a cross-functional team structure in which people from various library
departments could be involved. The comments in Table 6.8 make reference to the new
departments and the range of skills needed to support the e-science and data management
services.

“We also have gone out and hired new staff.” “Another

(Library Director, site D)

209

The affirmation and other forms of support that library staff received helped to emphasize
the importance of the new direction. Employee performance management systems were put in
place. These included new job descriptions, individual goal setting, rewarding behaviors that
successfully achieve goals and accomplish change, and addressing performance issues,
especially among those who were slow or resistant to embrace the new direction of the library.
Case Study Change Process as a Model
In order to evaluate the completeness of the case study change process, the investigator
used two widely accepted tools. The first is the transtheoretical model (TTM) (also called the
stages of change model), which was developed by Prochaska and DiClemente (Prochaska, 1984).
Their framework evolved through studies comparing the experiences of smokers who quit on
their own with those requiring further treatment. The purpose was to understand why some
people were capable of quitting on their own and others were not. It was determined that people
quit smoking if they were ready to do so. Thus, the TTM focuses on the decision making of the
individual and is a model of intentional change. Different behavioral theories and change
constructs can be applied to various stages of the model as needed.
The TTM operates on the supposition that people do not change behaviors rapidly and
decisively. Rather, change in behavior, especially habitual behavior, occurs continuously through
a cyclical process of pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and
termination. The TTM framework for change has been applied in numerous situations related to
organizational change efforts and the acceptance by employees of new roles (Boswell, 2011;
Lyons, Swindler, & Offner, 2009; Matheny, 1998; Narayan, Steele-Johnson, Delgado, & Cole,
2007).

210

The investigator paired the TTM framework with the five process groups as originally
defined by the Project Management Institute (PMI) in its standards guidelines, the Project
Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), which guides the practice of project management
worldwide. The life cycle of a project can be broken down into five distinct phases or process
groups (Project Management Body of Knowledge, 2000):
1. Initiating, which defines and authorizes the project;
2. Planning, which refines the project objectives and then plans the steps necessary to
achieve those objectives within the project scope;
3. Executing, in which people and other resources are combined with the project
management plan to carry out, or execute, the plan for the project;
4. Monitoring and controlling, which checks the progress of the project and corrects
problems; and
5. Closing, which formally closes each phase or the project and receives approval of the
project work for the phase or project.
Using the TTM and the PMBOK to form a matrix it is possible to position the steps of the
change process used by the case study libraries for comparison (see Figure 6.2). It is evident that
the case study libraries addressed all the steps of the TTM stages of changes while following a
similar process as outlined by the PMBOK, and that there is an emphasis on the initiating/precontemplation/contemplation phase as well as on the action phase.
Step five in the study process, paradigm shift, is placed in the maintenance/executing
phase. The acquisition of a new outlook, attitude, and purpose constitutes the paradigm shift; this
new view is a necessary part of embracing the process to execute and maintain the work. The

211

final stage of the identified study process is not termination or closing, rather, the goal is to
institutionalize the paradigm shift as librarians assume the role of data manager and researcher.

Change Process Comparison
Despite some differences in the process models proposed by Judson (1991), Kanter et al.
(1992), Kotter (1996a), and Luecke (2003) and that process model which was identified in this
research as being used by the libraries in the study, there are remarkable similarities among them
(see Table 6.9). It is interesting to note that while the models are not perfectly aligned, each
model presents change in a related fashion, beginning with recognizing the need for a change to
occur and ending with formalization of the change. The steps in between vary in scope and order,
but all focus on elements of vision, communication, and assigning leadership and resources.
One noticeable feature in Table 6.9 is the order in which identifying a need for change
and developing a vision occur. In the case of the libraries in the study (and as a first step in the
change models with which the study process is compared) it was the identification of the need to
make a change (to provide e-science programs and services) that came first. The need to make a

212

change in services and programs was based on both internal and external pressures, as identified
in Chapter 5. It is after identifying the need to make a change that the libraries studied
determined that the offering programs and services related to data management and e-science
was in alignment with the libraries’ mission and vision.
Figure 6.3 is a visual representation of the study steps and how Judson (1991), Kanter et
al. (1992), Kotter (1996a), and Luecke (2003) compare. Kotter (1996a), although not aligned
perfectly, offers the closest match to the process used by the study sites. One key difference
between Kotter and the study process is the underlying paradigm shift that must occur for
transformational change to occur. Kotter’s (2006a) process is designed for a large-scale yet
incremental change. (Kotter, 2012a) adds that his proposed model works best when it occurs in
the prescribed order and in an organization that has a strict hierarchy; a paradigm shift will take
longer to achieve in such environments.

Conclusion
Many theories have been developed regarding the design and running of organizations,
and how to initiate change within them. One of the main characteristics of these theories is the
attempt not only to prescribe what organizations should do, but also to set out how to go about
change when faced by a specific set of circumstances. There is no one way to structure an
organization in response to change. The tendency to replace choice with certainty does not just
relate to the structuring of organizations; it is also a fundamental tenet in the organization change
literature (Burnes, 1996).
Just as change comes in all shapes and sizes, so too do models of change. Therefore,
rather than seeing one model as superior or more appropriate, it is better to view these
approaches as applicable to different situational variables, such as organizational culture and the
unique situation. Consequently, managing change is not about managers implementing the best
practice laid down by the latest expert. Nor is it about automatically adopting an approach which
matches a set of circumstances. Instead, it is about making choices appropriate to the current
environment: choice in terms of what to change, choice in terms of the circumstances under
which the change takes place, and choice in terms of the approach adopted.
Organizational transitions signal a break from the familiar: that is, they imply a major
shift in an organization’s character, nature, and functioning. In flux are values and ideals,
structure, and ways of operating that have characterized the organization for some period of time.
Familiar methods which have served as guides for providing services and programs become less
relevant as new needs and processes come into existence. A different future is anticipated and the
transition period unfolds more or less intentionally.

214

After close analysis of why the libraries became involved in e-science (Chapter 5) and the
process by which the library became involved (Chapter 6), Chapter 7 addresses the question of
what changed and whether it can be considered a transformational change (second-order
change).

Chapter 7
THE NATURE OF CHANGE

According to Neal (2001), “Higher education libraries are advancing away from the
traditional or industrial age library; a model that is no longer viable” (p. 1). He goes on to argue
that this metamorphosis requires a shift from incremental change to radical change. Kuhn and
Hacking (2012) said “the transition from a paradigm in crisis to a new one from which a new
tradition … can emerge is far from a cumulative process” (p. 85).
Major corporations, on the other hand, undertake moderate organizational change at least
once a year and major change every four or five years (Kotter & Schlesinger, 2008). This
distinction between a moderate incremental change and a major radical change as it relates to
libraries’ involvement with e-science is a focal point of this study. Organizational
transformations deal with radical, fundamental, and total change in an organization, as opposed
to advancing the organization in a few selected areas. Transformation is often associated with a
situation in which an organization cannot continue to function and perform as it did before. In
order to remain effective and relevant, there is a need for a profound change in every aspect of
the organization, including mission, goals, structure, and culture. This type of change is referred
to as second-order change or transformational change.
Levy and Merry (1986) provide the characteristics for first- and second-order change (see
Table 2.2). These characteristics identify the nature of change and are discussed throughout this
chapter in the context of the four case studies. In addition, Levy and Merry (1986) categorize the
content of change: (1) organizational paradigm, (2) organizational mission and purpose, (3)

223

organizational culture, and (4) functional processes. This categorization is part of the discussion
of the nature of change occurring in the libraries studied.
During the interviews and focus group interviews, participants in the case studies
identified a number of changes that occurred at their institutions, ranging from assuming new
duties to hiring new staff. Table 7.1 lists those changes (which have been classified by the
investigator and to confirm reliability, nine other students from the Simmons College Managerial
Leadership for the Information Professions Ph. D. program) as either a first- or second-order
change, using the characteristics outlined by Levy and Merry (1986) in Table 2.2.

First-Order Change: Examples from the Case Study
First-order changes are incremental modifications that remain within the established
structure or method of operating. Bess (2006) describes first-order change as “change without
change” (p. 9). The implementation of a first-order change through strategic planning or other
organizational actions might include restructuring or modifying current structures, roles, and
processes to support a new initiative, but the organization’s core identity, as embodied through
its values and mission, remains the same.
The first-order changes identified by the libraries, also referred to as functional processes
by Levy and Merry (1986), are primarily related to the libraries’ structure, management,
technology, decision-making processes, recognition/rewards systems, and communications
patterns. Table 7.2 is a combination of the list of changes that have been categorized as firstorder (Table 7.1) and the corresponding first-order characteristics identified by Levy and Merry
(1986) (see Table 2.2). It is important to point out that all of the recorded changes in Table 7.2
are categorized as first-order change because they are quantifiable, logical, and rational, within
the current view of the libraries’ roles, and continue along the same traditional way of thinking
and being. These characteristics that were just mentioned (e.g., quantitative and logical) do not
have any corresponding examples in Table 7.2 as these are concepts that when taken together
further describe the other recorded changes. For example, reaching and connecting with new
faculty members are acting within the old state of being, whereas changes in workflow are
examples of logical and rational choices that fall in first-order change.

* Adopted from the work of Levy and Merry (1986).
A Change in One or a Few Dimensions, Components, or Aspects
A second-order change consists of multiple changes in multiple areas, whereas a firstorder change is more focused and centralized. Reaching and connecting with new faculty
members, students, and administrators are considered first-order changes as these activities are
consistent with the more traditional aspects of academic librarianship. Librarians provide a wide
range of services to faculty and researchers, such as consulting with them to discuss strategies to

226

support instructional needs and offering seminars to them on the library’s resources (Yang,
2000). According to Kozel-Gains and Stoddart (2009),
A good liaison is a jack-of-all-trades incorporating people skills, designing
Web pages, aiding faculty research, writing department or course-specific
resource guides, providing face-to-face consultation, and informing and
facilitating faculty in learning about new and emerging information
technologies, such as those associated with Library/Web 2.0. (p. 131)
In a recent study, Peters and Dryden (2011), writing about the University of Houston
Library’s involvement in research data management, found that one “interesting consequence”
(p. 398) of becoming involved in data management was the development of unanticipated
partnerships forming between the science librarian and researchers in departments with which
the librarian previously had little interaction. This experience was categorized as an “outreach
opportunity” (p. 398). The participants described their opportunity to form new relationships as
exciting and interesting but also in line with their everyday work and not a major change; the
focus of the new relationships is based on the data needs of the researcher but is still viewed as
being a part of traditional services.
A Change in One or a Few Levels (Individual and Group)
Similarly, the impact of a first-order change is limited to one or a few individuals and
even, perhaps, a small group whereas a second-order change affects an entire organization. For
example one sentiment heard during the interviews and focus group interviews at each institution
visited was the need for individual librarians to gain new skills, seek out specialized training
opportunities, improve their knowledge of the research projects on campus, and improve subject
knowledge so they could communicate better with the research teams.

227

Data management is an emerging area for librarians. The goal is to manage data so that
they may be easily available to other researchers. This may require librarians to enhance more
traditional library skills such as cataloging and description, as well as to develop search
procedures for large datasets and explore ways to merge sets in a meaningful way (Creamer et
al., 2012). Gold (2010), in support of establishing training programs, advocates for establishing
the “legitimacy of library roles in data curation through formal education and training as well as
by integrating data curation into existing library services” (p. 23).
A second example of identified change falling under this category is when individual
librarians seek to become embedded within a department or a research team. At the time of the
site visits, few librarians were succeeding in this area, but not for lack of effort or desire. Library
administration made it clear that this was an important milestone, and librarians were working
towards it; however, it is a difficult transition from traditional liaison librarian to embedded
librarian. According to Carlson and Kneale (2011), there are a lack of established approaches or
paths to draw from when making this transition. They offer some basic advice such as gaining
institutional support, being a team player, thinking like an entrepreneur, accepting risk, and
moving outside of the established comfort zone. These types of suggestions confirm the
placement of this activity as a first-order change; no significant change in thinking or acting is
required to move into an embedded role.
Continuity, Improvements, and Development in the Same Direction
Business process improvement, also called functional process improvement, involves
perfecting the quality, productivity, and response time of a business process, by removing any
non-value adding activities and costs through incremental enhancements (Harrington, 2007).
Examination of processes is a first-order change as it seeks to improve the path already chosen,

228

as opposed to developing a new direction. Workflow changes described during the site visits fall
into this process improvement category, and are first-order changes. One example of change
included developing a workflow for requests for data services that came via the reference desk or
through a liaison who did not feel adequately trained to work independently on a data
management project. Another example is developing a referral service or process to involve a
metadata specialist in a new project. The development and expansion of the institutional
repository (IR) are another example. Site participants spoke about the limitations of their current
IR system and how they needed to work with the staff managing the IR and vendors to determine
when it was an appropriate resource for a data management project, and in which ways it could
be utilized.
One example that falls into the business process improvement category is the
development of a training website on data management designed primarily for graduate students,
faculty, and researchers. It is not new for the library to create a specialized website for
educational purposes on a relevant topic. The creation of the data management website is seen as
applying a tried and effective method of reaching library users with the latest topic of interest.
The librarians also identified this as an important tool for the learning process and for
understanding the importance of e-science and data management.
During the site visits, the researcher specifically asked how the growth of e-science at the
institution has affected collection development activities. Participants at each location indicated
that they were purchasing datasets as requested, but they also indicated that they felt this was in
line with past practices and simply an update in format.

229

Incremental Changes
One of the key signs that the changes occurring are first-order is the incremental process
through which the changes come about. Incremental changes are small adjustments made toward
an end result. In an organization, making an incremental change to the manner in which things
are accomplished typically does not threaten to modify existing power structures or alter current
methods in any significant way. Williams (2011) believes that when a business makes only
incremental changes, it will find itself on a path that gets narrower and narrower. Eventually,
when the business reaches the end of the path it will be forced to go in a new direction.
The librarians in the study identified the creation of new data librarian positions as an
incremental change in that the library only hired one or two librarians at a time. They
commented on the fact that the education and background of many of the new employees
differed from their own. The administrators viewed the hiring of one or two data librarians as a
first step: vacant positions were funneled into the data management support program, or at a
minimum the positions were updated to include data management duties.
A Change in Content
Two changes in content (materials and skills used) have occurred since the libraries
started providing e-science and data management services. The first, the emphasis on electronic
over print resources, is not directly related to e-science. Many subject specialists and librarians
working at the graduate and undergraduate level have reported the growth and dependence of
researchers on electronic resources (Fry & Talja, 2004; Groote & Dorsch, 2001; Tomney &
Burton, 1998). However, in this instance, the librarians’ comments also refer to the type of
materials that the researchers need help managing. In the past, a librarian working with a
researcher might be asked to assist in managing paper records. Today, researchers are producing

230

data in many different digital file formats: few paper-based records are associated with the
projects.
The second noteworthy change regarding content is the fact that librarians have come to
view themselves as working with a changing product; as the data move through the research data
life cycle it undergoes transformation. Often there are multiple formats and versions of the same
data. The librarians saw this as something they were capable of managing; it was something new,
but not so different.
Second-Order Change
Levy and Merry (1986), who identified four perspectives of second-order change,
examine the content of change based on four dimensions: organizational paradigm,
organizational mission and purpose, organizational culture, and functional processes. In
additional to these dimensions, they also comment on what elements have changed and the
visibility to the organization’s members of the existence and function of these elements. Table
7.3 summarizes the four perspectives and classifies them according to the organization’s
elements and dimensions that are changed, and the visibility to the organization’s members of
the existence and function of these elements. Levy and Merry (1986) assert that first-order
change or changes in process are easily noticeable and concrete in nature. The examples
mentioned of first-order change were all functional in nature, easily recognizable to outsiders,
and tangible; for example, the training website mentioned above meets all these criteria.

1
Evolutionary theory in relation to the dynamics of institutional change refers to a set of
specified activities (mechanisms of transmissible variation) which generate changes
(transmittable differences), and a mechanism of selection which determines the relative success
with which these differences propagate (Farrell & Shalizi, n.d.).
2
Planned change is a set of activities in an organization that are intentional and goal-oriented
with the purpose of bringing about a different future.
3
Systems theory is a method of formal analysis in which the object of study is viewed as
consisting of a series of distinct but interconnected components or subsystems. The concept was
brought into the social sciences in the 1960s as a means of investigating social complexity and
long-term change.
The change dimensions represented in Figure 7.1, as a nested set, intersect and overlap
with each other in some instances; however, each dimension is embedded in, and formed by the
higher levels (Levy & Merry, 1986). This suggests that changing the organizational paradigm or
world view automatically necessitates changes in the following dimensions: organizational
mission and purpose, culture, and functional processes. Changes in the organizational mission
and purpose require changes in culture and functional processes, but not necessarily in the
organizational paradigm. Hence, change in the organization’s culture causes change in the
232

organization’s functional processes, but not necessarily in its mission and organizational
paradigm (Levy & Merry, 1986).

Examples of Second-Order Change from the Case Studies
Levy and Merry (1986) view second-order change (or transformation) as a change that
occurs in all four dimensions: from the core, functional processes, through mission and purpose,
culture, and finally the organization’s world view. In the case studies, functional processes (or
first-order change) occurred. The remaining changes (see Table 7.4) have been categorized as
second-order change and fall into two of the dimensions identified by Levy and Merry (1986),
mission and purpose, and culture; these are discussed in further detail below.

Organizational Mission and Purpose
Having a clear and concise mission statement to follow is essential for success. A change
in mission is categorized as a second-order change because it involves core questions related to
what business the organization in and what the strategies are for achieving the organizational
mission, goals, and policies. There is an explicit stated program of action to move forward. The
mission statement addresses what the organization is about, what it does, whom it serves, and to
what end (Pearce & David, 1987).
During most of the twentieth century, academic libraries were characterized by activities
that built similar collections of physical materials and by systems of access and services that
mediated between individuals and content to serve the expressed information needs of library
users (Kaufman, 2005). The library building is a prominent iconic representation of status
within the university: centrally located, critically important, large, separate, and distinct.
Historically, it served all disciplines, not only with similar tools but in similar ways (Kaufman,
2005).

234

When data management and e-science were introduced, library administrators saw these
activities as new and a need that was waiting to be filled, yet within the framework of the
library’s current mission. For the libraries in the study, the blueprint for providing e-science
support and services was laid out in the libraries' strategic planning documents. It is there that the
plan for new services and for transitioning into a new role in data management was first outlined
and shared with the library organization.
Organizational Culture
According to Kotter (2012b), organizational culture consists of group norms of behavior
and the underlying shared values that help keep those norms in place. It also deals with symbolic
action and elements such as myths, rituals, ceremonies, the look and arrangement of the physical
setting, and the style of management and relationships. In order to change culture, according to
Kotter (2012b), a person in authority maintains the old ways are not working. As a result, a new
vision is developed; individuals and groups start acting differently and enlist others to also act
differently. If the new actions produce better results and if those results are communicated and
celebrated, new norms form and new shared values grow.
Two changes identified in the study sites fall into the category of organization culture: (1)
a new department/team/workgroup was formed to manage data management requests, and (2) a
new oversight structure was put in place to manage the new department/team/workgroup.
Restructuring and creating a new department are not unusual in libraries. The study sites
restructured specifically to take on new work and provide new services; it was not a matter of
taking an existing group and changing the reporting structure for that group. At study sites A, C,
and D new departments were formed with new reporting lines either directly to the director or to

235

an associate director. At site B, where the team approach was used, the associate director was
assigned to the team and helped to direct the work of the team.
Changing an entrenched culture is a difficult task. Kim and Mauborgne (2005) identify
four hurdles that a managerial leader must face when trying to institute broad cultural change in
an organization. The first is cognitive; people must have some understanding of why the change
in culture is needed. The second is limited resources; inevitably, changing an organization
requires shifting resources away from some areas and towards others. The third hurdle is
motivation; ultimately, workers have to want to make the change. And, the final hurdle is
institutional politics; whether or not the organization’s administration is open to new ideas and
new opportunities, and to working together to determine the best roles for all stakeholders to
assume.
To overcome those hurdles, Kim and Mauborgne (2005) suggest a “tipping point”
approach to management. First, they suggest the importance of recognizing that not everyone
will embrace the new culture from the start. They suggest beginning with people who have
influence in the organization, encouraging their commitment to the change, and once they are
committed to change, shining a spotlight on their accomplishments so others hear the message
that change is celebrated. Second, instead of lecturing on the need for change, they recommend
looking for ways in which people will connect current experiences with the need to make
change. Third, Kim and Mauborgne (2005) identify opportunities to redistribute resources
toward activities that require few resources but result in large change, and away from areas with
large resource demands but likely to experience relatively low impact. By following this
approach, when library administration sets aside dedicated staff resources and time to work

236

formally on data management, a clear message can be sent to all internal and external to the
library that a culture change is occurring.
Experience of Change
The investigator asked the library administrators and librarians working on e-science and
data management if they thought the changes occurring were first- or second-order change,
substituting the word “evolutionary” for first-order change and “transformative” for second-order
change (see Table 7.5). The majority (14 of 20) of them indicated that they thought the changes
were evolutionary in nature. This is indicated by phrases such as “rapid little steps,” “hurry up
and wait,” and the sentiment that the library was reacting to external forces: truly
transformational changes were occurring outside of the library.

Six of the study participants indicated there was an element of the transformative present:
•

“The ideas are a revolutionary way to think of librarianship.”

•

“If we had more time to dedicate to the projects it could be revolutionary.”

•

“Part of the constraints on how transformational it is for us is the resource constraints
that we are under.”

•

“I think for the library at large, it is revolutionary. I would share that my manager
looks at it and says this is the future of libraries. It is quite revolutionary. It really
237

shakes the fundamentals of what libraries do but we are just at the early stages of it. It
has great potential.”
In the context of commenting on the question relating to the order of change, the
participants provided a list of changes they were experiencing. The results are listed in Table 7.6
and classified by their change dimensions. Five of the changes experienced are categorized as
first-order change or relating to functional process. These include issues related to learning new
skills and making new contacts, and some of the frustrations associated with having to deal with
new performance expectations. The comments associated with experiencing a new
organizational culture refer to hearing a message that e-science is important, that there are
internal movements supporting the new direction, and that there is a period of adjustment and an
element of self-motivation required.
As the experiences become more abstract in nature, there are fewer listed (functional
process, 5; organizational cultural, 5; mission and purpose, 2; and paradigm, 1). Among
librarians who participated in the focus group interviews at sites A and C there was a sense that
the library was moving into a new area (e-science and data management), and a strong belief that
the libraries had a role and valuable experience to contribute. As a result, the primary purpose of
the library needed to shift from being a collector of content to a service provider and
collaborator.

Paradigm Shift in Second-Order Change
The organizational paradigm, as already noted, is the “metarules,” presuppositions or
underlying assumptions that discretely form perceptions, procedures, and behaviors. Levy and
Merry (1986) propose that the organizational paradigm provides the context and logic for the
organization’s culture, purpose, and operations. As a result, every change in the paradigm
239

necessitates changes in the other three dimensions: organizational culture, mission and purpose,
and processes. Levy and Merry (1986) also propose that a change in any one of these other
dimensions (e.g., culture) may, but does not automatically, cause changes in the other
dimensions. Functional processes may change because of a new technology or new procedures,
but this will not necessarily trigger changes in the other dimensions. They suggested, therefore,
that the less visible the dimension experiencing change is the deeper the change and possibly the
greater the likelihood the change becomes permanent.
Librarians at study sites A and C specifically mentioned that a new attitude and outlook
were an integral part of the change experience occurring in their library environment. All four
sites commented that the shift to supporting data management and e-science required a new way
of thinking and acting. Using the conditions identified by Levy and Merry (1986) for secondorder change, the organization and placement of the changes identified in the case studies
suggest that the four case studies experienced second-order changes, having undergone changes
in all four dimensions (see Table 7.7).

Future Changes as First- or Second-Order Change
Each of the library administrators interviewed identified changes they thought would be
implemented in the next three years (see Table 7.8). All of the planned changes fall into the
240

sphere of first-order change. The focus of these changes is to continue to grow and train staff for
the changing work, to identify and developing success measures, and to monitor the local and
national environment. The library director from site D specifically mentioned the importance of
monitoring change in national politics, funding requirements, and the national research agenda.
Other pending changes focus on administrative aspects, such as managing facilities, obtaining
funding, and re-writing job descriptions. It is not unusual to expect that the library administration
has a list of first-order change tasks to continue to monitor and follow through on. Any
organizational change, first- or second-order, requires additional adjustments to ensure that the
changes fit within the environment. The associate library director at site D specifically
mentioned new data-intensive initiatives that would be forthcoming from the university
administration, and that the library would need to make an effort to be part of these.

Conclusion
The three questions used for understanding the order of change (the forces identified in
Chapter 5, the process discussed in Chapter 6, and the content considered in this chapter), are
placed in the integrated model developed for second-order change by Levy and Merry (1986)
using the study findings (see Figure 7.2). Their integrated model is based on an open-systems
theory, which identifies organizational behavior by mapping the repeated cycles of inputs,
throughputs, outputs, and feedback between an organization and its external environment.
Systems receive input from the environment either as information or in the form of resources.
The systems then process the input internally, which is called throughput, and release outputs
into the environment in an attempt to restore stability to the environment. The system then seeks
feedback to determine if the output was effective in restoring the desired long-term and shortterm goals (Bertalanffy, 1950; Katz & Kahn, 1978).
Using this model, the libraries that participated in the study could identify clearly some of
the forces for change in their environment, such as the NSF data management requirement or
researchers coming to the library and asking for help managing data, as a triggering event. These
types of triggering events lead to a common process that was used to respond to stakeholder
needs, resulting in similar throughputs such as new positions, new workflows, and partnerships.
These many modifications may lead to a change in organizational culture, mission and,
ultimately, a new view of library services; that is, a transformational change.
Transformational change is defined as those periods in an organization’s life cycle when
there is a major shift in the overarching paradigm that guides the organization. This type of
change is possible when there are certain external and internal conditions, and in the light of preexisting conditions some triggering event occurs. The ultimate goal is to change the underlying

242

assumptions and world view: the organizational paradigm. Library administrators who want to
facilitate second-order change should focus efforts on changing underlying assumptions, beliefs,
and behaviors. The four study sites were able to achieve this organizational transition. Chapter 8
indicates how this transition was led.

Chapter 8
THE ROLE OF LEADERSHIP IN THE MOVE TO E-SCIENCE

Researchers have conflicting views about the cause of change in organizations
(Fernandez & Rainey, 2006). Despite these divergences, a large body of research indicates that
leaders frequently make change happen in their organization (Fernandez & Rainey, 2006).
Leaders serve as the main role models for change and provide the motivation and communication
to change efforts moving forward. Change does not happen easily; good leaders throughout the
organization can facilitate change and help their organizations adapt to external threats and new
opportunities.
The emphasis of this chapter is on leading second-order, or transformational, change. It is
important to distinguish between leading transformational change and the theory of
transformational leadership, since these concepts share common vocabulary but are not
interchangeable. Transformational change, as defined in Chapter 2, involves not only moving the
organization forward, but also transforming the core of the organization and how the
organization views its place in relationship to other organizations. Transformational change is
“multidimensional, multi-level, qualitative, discontinuous, radical organizational change
involving a paradigmatic shift” (Levy & Merry, 1986, p. 5). Leadership focuses on the
organization as a whole and the process of bringing about a new future. Transformational
leadership, on the other hand, is “a process that changes and transforms people. It is concerned
with emotions, values, ethics, standards, and long-term goals” (Northouse, 2013, p. 185). With
transformational leadership the emphasis is on the individual follower (Bass, 1985) and

247

“assessing followers’ motives, satisfying their needs, and treating them as full human beings”
(Northouse, 2013, p. 185).
Typically, when leaders launch change efforts, at least 70 percent of those efforts end in
failure, and only 5 percent of change efforts achieve all of their stated objectives (Kotter, 2013).
One of the primary reasons for this low rate of success is a failure to create the necessary
groundswell of support among employees (Gilbert, n.d.). The ability to lead transformational
change is often a key factor in the long-term success of an organization. Kouzes and Posner
(2007) affirmed the link between leadership and generating change when they said, “Leadership
is inextricably connected with the process of innovation, of bringing new ideas, methods, or
solutions into use” (p. 165). During an interview, Peter Senge noted that the simplest definition
of leadership is the ability to produce positive change (Webber, 1999). Similarly, Kanter (1983)
stated, “Change requires leadership … a ‘prime mover’ to push for implementation of strategic
decisions” (p. 125). Although there are many reasons for which change initiatives fail, a primary
solution is to create better change leadership (Daft & Lane, 2005).
In 1990, Kotter proposed that leading change required establishing direction, aligning
people, and motivation and inspiration. Reardon et al. (1998) added two additional stages,
described by (Kotter, 1990, 2012a) but not formally stated in his change model: launching and
maintaining. Table 8.1 outlines these components and identifies the relevant focus areas within
each component.
Reardon et al. (1998) argued that the formal inclusion of these two stages is critical to
understanding leadership in transformational change, indicating that incremental changes may
not require a formal launch or kick-off marking the change; “Radical change; however, demands
that people depart drastically from the status quo and often that they do so in a limited time.

248

Launching takes the place of introducing change in dribs and drabs” (p. 133). The framework for
examining leadership in the four case studies is the three-change leadership components
identified by Kotter (1990) and the additional two elements added by Reardon et al. (1998).

Establishing Direction
The chief function of leadership is to produce positive change (Kotter, 1990). The
direction of that change is at the core of what leadership is all about: setting direction and
ensuring that change is carried out effectively. The direction-setting aspect of leadership creates

249

vision and strategies. The emergence of e-science has provided library leaders with a wide array
of complex and rapidly changing information regarding their local environment and the data
management needs of researchers. In response, library leaders in the study challenged the
traditional roles of the university research library by experimenting with new services and
programs (see Chapter 4 for a description of such services). Establishing a clear direction early,
especially in the case of non-incremental change, helps to produce useful change by pointing out
where a group should move, showing how it can get there, and then providing a message that is
potentially motivating and uplifting.
Creating a Vision for Change
Kotter (2011b) identifies two types of vision. The first is an overarching vision for an
organization. In these instances, vision is an attractive view of the future that is credible yet not
readily attainable. It links the present to the future, energizes people, and garners commitment;
vision gives meaning to work and establishes a standard of excellence and integrity (Daft &
Lane, 2005). When the investigator asked the case-study library leaders to define leadership, 7 of
the 10 responses stated that having a vision was an important element (see Table 8.2). Having a
vision can help the organization achieve bold change. By attempting to bring about a
transformational change, leaders typically articulate visions that present a highly optimistic view
of the future and express high confidence that a better future can be realized (Berson, Shamir,
Avolio, & Popper, 2001). Kotter (2011b) proposes a second type of vision; he refers to this as a
change vision. A change vision is not the same as an overarching corporate vision; “A generic
corporate vision is … [what] you think you need to look like out there on some fundamental
dimensions to make you prosper” (Kotter, 2011b, para. 6).

A change vision is a picture of what the organization will look like after significant
changes are achieved, and it outlines the opportunities the organization will take advantage of
once change is realized. The change vision serves as a motivator to do something that may not
necessarily be in an individual’s short-term self-interest. During a period of organizational
change employees are often asked to work outside of their comfort zones, function with fewer
resources, and learn new skills. In these situations the change vision motivates staff to overcome
the initial reluctance to try something new. According to Kotter (2011b), a change vision is an
essential aspect of any transformational change an organization is undertaking. Table 8.3
summarizes the responses the investigator received when she asked library leaders to articulate
how e-science fits within the overall library’s vision.

A

To advance and support the work of the faculty and students of the campus. E-science is
part of that. To do this well requires collaboration with others on campus. Those
collaborations are the most successful when all the parties are viewed as having
something equal to contribute. The library is viewed as an equal partner in providing the
necessary services.
To help support the university by developing systems and services that deal with how it
can best disseminate out and preserve the knowledge that is generated. Data … [are] the
latest manifestation of that.
Support researchers across the research life cycle, keeping in mind the whole realm of
scholarly communications, information literacy, and include all the things that the library
has always been doing downstream with tertiary resources, collecting journals,
monographs, archives, and digital objects to further support those in the labs.
Take advantage of new opportunities, form new partnerships, systematically build new
infrastructure to support long-term data preservation by addressing fundamental
questions both from a theoretical, policy, and practical perspective. Scientific datasets are
the new form of collection development; a very special type of collection. Ultimately, we
need to see in the next incarnation of libraries, that we think of data as the collection.

The library administration at all four sites, being aware of an institution-wide need to
respond to data management needs, inventoried the available library resources, created a
deliberate plan to engage the library personnel, and participated with other institutional
stakeholders to formulate a change vision for the libraries’ involvement. The administrators of
the libraries studied had an opportunity to rejuvenate the library, they had a clear direction in
which they wanted to move, and they engaged in a coordinated effort to bring about the change.
Clarifying the Big Picture
After developing a plan for change, managerial leaders share that plan with others and
help them internalize the importance and purpose of the change so that everyone works from the
same starting point. The change effort becomes a common thread connecting people, involving
them personally and emotionally in the organization (Daft & Lane, 2005). Leaders know how to

252

create the framework through which teams view the pending changes, allowing them to interpret
even the most difficult changes in constructive, empowering ways. The contextual lens the leader
creates is often focused on a desired outcome. Setting the context helps the organization
understand how the pending changes relate to the large vision. It helps everyone who is affected
by the change to envision the ultimate goal and then challenges them to build strategies to realize
the change regardless of current obstacles (Maddock, 2012). In this study those strategies include
identifying researchers’ needs for data management and the libraries’ strengths and weaknesses
in this area. It also involves monitoring trends and being aware of pending challenges and
opportunities. The libraries studied were able to set the context in three ways by: (1) assessing
the current environment, (2) exploring the future, and (3) identifying the strategic issues.
Assessing the current environment. Assessing the current environment includes vetting
the key assumptions that drive the strategic thinking, planning, and implementation process.
Tools traditionally used to conduct this type of assessment include a PESTLE1 or SWOT2
analysis or an examination of Porter’s Five Forces.3 Commenting on the importance of being
aware of the local context, the library director at site B stated:
I believe and I think we practice it here at [omitted name] libraries that the
new environment into which libraries are moving is fundamentally and
profoundly volatile. … I think that libraries have to think about that

1

The PESTLE analysis is used to provide a context for the organization’s/individual’s role in relation to the external
environment. It covers political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors. In some instances
it can also include education and demographics (Baines, Fill, & Page, 2013).
2
A SWOT analysis provides information that is helpful in matching the organization’s resources and capabilities to
the competitive environment in which it operates. Internal factors are classified as strengths (S) or weaknesses (W),
and external factors are classified as opportunities (O) or threats (T) (Baines et al., 2013).
3
Porter’s Five Forces are: (1) threat of new entrants, (2) threat of substitute products or services, (3) bargaining
power of customers (buyers), (4) bargaining power of suppliers, and (5) intensity of competitive rivalry (Porter,
2008).

253

technology, space, and services in terms of significant changes every two to
three years if we are tracking them appropriately.
In a similar vein the director at site D commented: “I think people who are in jobs like I
have now have to keep a broad outlook – we talk about environmental scans. It is a
very large environment we are looking at.” This director specifically mentioned
tracking issues such as U.S. government funding, legislation, and data sharing mandates
such as from the NSF, as well as more local concerns related the formation of new
university centers and institutes.
All the libraries studied indicated that they were responding to an emerging
need in their local and national environments. One of the main triggering events
described in Chapter 5 was the NIH and NSF data management requirements. This
caused a real and pressing need among researchers, who did not know how to respond.
At the institutional level, all study participants agreed that the library had an important
role to play in developing local solutions to meet the needs of researchers who wanted
assistance managing research data. For example, a representative from University B
administration stated that the library has an important role in supporting e-science on
campus. University administrators are looking to the library to provide updates on what
is happening at other universities, to be a source of credible information, to be a unit
that can bring different groups together, and to be a resource for developing and
supporting new data management systems.
Exploring the future. Exploring the future involves identifying the general direction of
change and then leveraging this knowledge for more effective strategic action and long-term
success. There are many tools available to help leaders discern an ideal future, including

254

appreciative inquiry,4 future mapping,5 and scenario planning.6 Although none of the participants
mentioned these tools by name, the elements of appreciative inquiry were present. The leaders
had a plan of an ideal service model and how the library would fit into that model. Each leader in
his/her own way set out to make that future a reality by trying to (1) build on what worked in the
past and incorporate the best into the future, (2) harness the power of imagination and dreaming,
(3) create a blueprint for change that integrates the past and the future, and (4) move forward by
matching resources with interests and abilities (Egan & Feyerherm, 2005).
Identifying the strategic issues. Every organization has strategic issues that need to be
identified and considered when undergoing a transformation change. Analyzing these involves
reviewing what was learned during the environmental scan and exploring the desired future,
remembering the need to identify key challenges, opportunities, and the critical unknowns
(Russell, n.d.). For the leaders studied, the primary issue identified was the need to support data
management services across the institution.
Using three steps (assessing the environment, exploring the future, and identifying
strategic issues) to clarify and communicate the changes can be challenging because library
personnel may have different personal beliefs about what a library is and how best to serve
library patrons. Some staff may be working from a different value set, placing importance on
resources and services that are no longer needed and holding on to a very traditional view or

4

Appreciative inquiry is based on the premise that organizations change the direction in which they inquire. So an
organization which searches for problems will keep finding problems, but an organization which attempts to
appreciate what is best in itself will discover more and more that is good. It can then use these discoveries to build a
new future where the best becomes the norm (Cooperrider, Whitney, & Stavros, 2003).
5
Future mapping is a process for creating a vision, deciding how to achieve it and creating a motivation to act. It
builds on the process of planning ahead but looks at this as if success has already been achieved. It can overcome
blockages in thinking that can occur when trying to think ahead. It is a very creative, but fairly structured, process
(van der Lugt & Munneck, 2007).
6
Scenario planning is a technique with which participants develop a set of scenarios that eventuate in possible future
outcomes. Not intended to circumscribe the future, it permits organizations and their staffs to help realize the future
for the organization by reacting appropriately to change (Giesecke, 1998).

255

organizational paradigm of the library. These traditional views affect the thinking processes of
those faced with a major change. Also, given their different professional experiences and general
knowledge of the work and need of local researchers, coupled with the different levels of
awareness of national trends and their potential implications, it is not surprising that the
managerial leaders in the study used a variety of methods to communicate the need for and
nature of pending changes. These methods included all-staff meetings, printed strategic plans,
annual library updates, internal websites, and educational opportunities, and in some cases they
served as resources for staff to refer to if needed.
Setting Strategies
Strategic planning,7 a successful management technique in libraries, provides a direction
and framework for services and guides decision-making. It consists of goals and objectives.
Goals are long-term aspirations that the organization intends to meet, while objectives are clear
and sensible guides to action, clear enough to recommend particular types of actions, and are
time-limited, feasible, and measureable (Hernon & Whitman, 2001). Objectives lead to the
achievement of goals and should be “ambitious enough to be challenging” (Granger, 1964, p. 65)
Participating libraries used a strategic planning document to outline their goals and
objectives for the library, which included e-science and data management programs and services.
The sites varied with respect to the timeframe specified in their planning documents and the
frequency with which the documents were reviewed and updated, as well as the level of detail
specified in the documents. Yet, each library director brought up the importance of having a
documented plan that could serve as a cornerstone on which to build the new programs and
services. The library director at site C commented on the effectiveness of the strategic plan:
7

Strategic planning is defined as “a self-analysis or self-study that identifies the organization’s strengths and
weaknesses and develops priorities within the framework of the organization’s physical and financial capabilities”
(Childers & Van House, 1993, p. 18).

256

There is a critical mass now in the libraries that when I’ve had various visitors
come to the libraries from outside … and even outside the country, they come
and they end up meeting with me at the end and they’ll say, “Everyone is on
board. We hear the same message consistently.” So they understand it. It took
us seven to eight years to do that because it was not a clear thing for us to do.
But now when we hire people, I notice that search committees are much more
likely to hire or recommend people to me who are consistent with our vision
than they might have traditionally done. They seem to get it.
Aligning People
Libraries have been working over the past decade to break down functional silos and look
for cross-departmental collaborations to improve services (P. Miller, 2005; Wood, Miller, &
Knapp, 2007; Zorich, Waibel, & Erway, 2008). As libraries in the study sought to improve
customer services and develop new programs, the interdependence of library departments
became evident. It is unusual for anyone to have complete autonomy in today’s libraries; most
employees are tied to one another by their work, technology management systems, and reporting
structures (Kotter, 1996a). These relationships can pose unique challenges when the library
attempts to change; “unless a large number of individuals line up and move together in the same
direction, people will tend to fall all over one another” (Kotter, 1996a, p. 49).
Managers create systems that they can use to implement plans efficiently (Daft & Lane,
2005). This means getting people lined up behind a vision and a set of strategies so as to help
produce the transformation needed to cope with a changing environment. The goal is to have
everyone share a common understanding of a vision and set of strategies, accept the validity of

257

that direction, and be willing to work toward making it a reality. The potential result is making
progress towards the vision.
Communicate Goals
People are most easily aligned with a new direction when it is clearly communicated.
Communication must occur as often as possible with all those people (staff, administrators,
collaborators, and patrons) whose help or cooperation is needed. It is done whenever possible,
with simple images, symbols, or metaphors that powerfully present the new vision (Giesecke,
2011).
The managerial leaders in the study found that leadership by example was an effective
strategy in communicating the pending changes. It was their individual commitment and
unswerving dedication to the change and implementation strategies that set the stage and
communicated the importance of e-science and data services to the future of the library. On two
different occasions librarians told the investigator how important it was that the director of the
library was attending university meetings, identifying researchers’ data issues, and setting up
additional meeting to identify opportunities to help on an individual basis. The librarians were
determined to meet the commitments the director had set. As well as actively promoting library
services, having the directors stating the message that change is needed in a clear and practical
way, and making sure their words and deeds were consistent (e.g., shifting resources and
providing training opportunities), helped to convey the critical juncture the library faced.
Seek Commitment
People commit to change because they gain something important from their involvement.
When a leader invites them to become involved it is not solely about asking for or needing their
help. In turn for their support, the individuals receive an opportunity to expand their skills, be a

258

part of a team, rise to a challenge, meet high standards, and accomplish something substantial. It
is important for leaders to look for individuals with proven track records and/or enthusiasm to
help carry out the change process.
Throughout the process of introducing e-science program and services, building
commitment was slow. Library leaders worked with groups of individuals who were open to the
idea and willing to learn and try something new. However, none of the leaders interviewed were
willing to say that they had complete commitment from their staff. The library director at site C
remarked: “I’m not saying if you spoke to every single person in the libraries that they would
either understand this strategic goal that we have in data management or the vision that they
would always agree with it.” Other directors spoke of staff who were hesitant to embrace the
change and were more comfortable continuing to offer traditional services.
No director used staff resistance as an excuse to change direction or abandon the change
process. They indicated that they would continue to encourage change in attitude and acceptance
of training opportunities, but specified that there would be a time when acceptance would no
longer be optional. As Kouzes and Posner (2007) note, disruptive change demands significant
commitment and sacrifice, but the positive feelings associated with forward progress generate
momentum that enables everyone to move forward.
Build Teams and Coalitions
Leaders build coalitions and teams systematically and strategically. For the change
process to succeed there must be a shared commitment to the possibilities of organizational
transformation (Watkins, 2008). Kotter (2012a) concluded that the formal hierarchical structures
and managerial processes present in today’s organizations are inherently risk-averse and resistant
to change; “part of the problem is that all hierarchies, with their specialized units, rules, and

259

optimized processes, crave stability and default to doing what they already know how to do” (p.
48). As a solution to this problem, Kotter suggests the formation of a second network that is fluid
and has the power to formulate and implement strategy continually; the network drives problem
solving, collaboration, and creativity.
In the four case studies leaders choose the path of forming a new department or team. At
each site a selected group of individuals were brought together to develop and implement an escience strategy. These individuals were either aware of researchers’ needs, or expressed an
interest, or had a natural aptitude for developing a data services strategy. However, this approach
to working with a limited group had some drawbacks. In all instances, having a specialized
group take on this task caused some tension with members outside the group as new workflows
were established. In one instance at site D there were some indications that specialized data
services were limited to individuals who had been hand-picked to introduce and develop the
initial services, despite the desire of other librarians to provide similar services to their liaison
charges:
So we are not part of the group … . She really heads up the group that
manages library liaisons out into departments. We are thinking about
collaborating together because we are providing different services and
mindful that we are often working with some researchers in our community.
(Librarian, University D)
Launching
When faced with a new challenge, the human brain automatically applies strategies from
past experience. This works well if the new challenge is similar to an old problem; when it is not
similar, the solution from the past blocks new and improved ideas from emerging. When

260

implementing a transformational change it is necessary to have a clear break from the past and a
solid plan for the future. “This requires the organized abandonment of things that have been
shown to be unsuccessful, and the organized and continuous improvement of every product,
service, and process within the enterprise” (Drucker, 2007, pp. 203-204).
According to Blanchard (2010), 29 percent of change initiatives are introduced without
any formal launch or structure. The official beginning of a change effort helps people find new
symbols with which to focus their thinking and create new meaning; transition rituals and
opportunities to mourn the past and celebrate the future are important steps worth
acknowledging. So too is being given the opportunity to understand why the need for change is
important. Individuals must become emotionally connected to the new direction and must feel
that they are part of something large, and important. All must work collectively towards the new
direction or it will fail.
The leaders in the study were acutely aware of the importance of this phase of
implementing change. Today, library resources are becoming easier to navigate and many tools
are now available to assist library users to carry out research on their own. The role of the
librarian as intermediary for information is less important than in the past (Hawkins, 2012). Each
leader communicated to his or her followers that the skills they possess are still valuable; the
skills just need to be applied to new situations and refined to work with new library users.
Libraries and librarians will survive, but they will look very different in the future. As leaders
they believed that this was the time to act, and that redesigning services to include data
management was critical to the long-term success of the library and part of re-defining the future
library.

261

Implement Changes
Drucker (2007) noted, “The most effective way to manage change successfully is to
create it” (p. 203). The leaders in the study, working with their supporters, communicated the
need for change and translated that into an actionable plan for achieving the proposed future
state. Library staff were well prepared to participate in the development and implementation of
new programs and services.
The libraries studied started on a small scale by prototyping services. This was one way
to get the change under way incrementally and to allow for flexibility in responding to changing
conditions (Gilbert, n.d.). Library staff worked with a selected group of researchers who wanted
to partner with the library to develop customized services. From there the staff built a more
complete set of programs and services. This process allowed an opportunity to move more
slowly and to document the deployment of new processes and technologies. This also helped to
reinforce staff ownership of the change initiative.
Getting Results
For leaders in the middle of a long-term change effort, getting results is essential.
Leading a change effort without attention to performance is extremely risky due to the possibility
of going in the wrong direction and never looking back to evaluate progress. Working with key
team members, leaders in the study identified major milestones that could happen between six
and eighteen months into the change. Getting these results helped ensure the overall change
initiatives would continue. Companies that experience important short-term wins (within 14 to
26 months) after the change initiative begins are much more likely to complete the
transformation (Kotter, 2005b).

262

To ensure success, the results must be both visible and unambiguous (Kotter, 1990), and
related to the change effort. For example, the librarians at site C worked initially to help a
selected number of researchers with their data needs (e.g., applying metadata, publishing past
reports to the web, and developing custom portals for researchers to share data) and the librarians
starting to have so much work that the library administrators recruited additional staff to help
support the new programs and services. Once the librarians saw that the new services were
needed, there was an increased sense of urgency and a surge of optimism encouraging those
making the effort to change. Over time they gained an awareness of the potential for growth and
for the ability to contribute in a meaningful way to the work of those in the research community.
These short-term wins served to reward the change agents by providing positive feedback that
boosted morale and motivation and also served the practical purpose of helping to fine tune the
goals, objectives, and strategies and cement the change initiative (Kotter, 1996b). The need for
results adds pressure to an organization in the midst of a transformation effort. However, the
need to create results can actually increase the sense of urgency, and accomplishing these goals
does much to cement the change initiative. A Focus Group Participant at site C spoke of the
growth in demand and the effect that had on the library:
there is a slow build up where it was hard to have a success because we didn’t
have the services in place but we were risk taking and trying to get out there
first to be leaders and so I think, in terms of being the leader, being the risk
taker, I think as a reputation for … [the university] as a whole, I think that’s
great.

263

Assessing Progress
Transformational change takes time to implement and becomes apparent over time. One
librarian (site B) commented, “Would we see a transformational change? The answer might be
yes but we aren’t there yet. … Or we are in the middle of it and we don’t know it.” This makes
evaluating progress challenging. Having set goals and an implementation plan is helpful. The
library administrators at the study sites addressed a series of critical issues to evaluate progress
on implementation of the new vision for e-science services, such as the staff skills,
accomplishment of work, and alignment of goals. These concerns get at the concrete aspects of
implementation. But issues such as staff attitude, culture, and commitment are more difficult for
any leader to evaluate.
Motivating and Inspiring
Leaders energize people to overcome major obstacles when trying to bring about the
desired vision (Kotter, 1990), and provide the tools needed to cope with the changing
environment. This is done by satisfying basic human needs for achievement, belonging,
recognition, self-esteem, a sense of control over one’s life, and living up to one’s ideals. Kotter
(1990) suggest doing this by (1) communicating repeatedly the vision in a way that stresses the
key values of the people being addressed; (2) involving those people in determining how to
achieve that vision or some portion of it; (3) supporting their efforts with coaching, feedback,
role modeling, and enthusiasm; and (4) publicly acknowledging and rewarding all their
accomplishments. The leaders in the libraries studied made extra effort to communicate the need
to embrace e-science, provided staff who were interested in the opportunity to experiment with
services, and rewarded successes through recognition programs and increased responsibility.

264

Inspire and Energize
Inspiring people over a longer period of time is difficult (Kotter, 1990). One strategy that
all the leaders used was to send key library staff into the research community to spent time
talking with and observing researchers to understand their workflow better and see where the
library could offer support. They gathered stories and examples of what their local community
needed and compared that with services offered at peer institutions. They shared their findings
through informative presentations open to anyone on staff who was interested in learning more
about data management and e-science.
Empower Subordinates
According to Goldsmith (2010), it is not possible for a leader to empower someone to be
accountable and make good decisions. “People have to empower themselves. … [The leader’s]
role is to encourage and support the decision-making environment and to give employees the
tools and knowledge they need to make and act upon their own decisions” (para. 4). By doing
this, leaders help employees to achieve an empowered state.
Building an empowering environment is in part contingent on the ability of a managerial
leader to provide resources and support to those implementing the required changes, or in the
case of the libraries studied, those developing the new programs and services. The managerial
leaders created an environment in which they encouraged innovation and risk. The leaders also
ensured that there were communication channels in place for the ongoing discussion of needs,
opportunities, tasks, obstacles, projects, as well as what was and what was not working. In
addition, each leader empowered those individuals who demonstrated the capacity to handle the
responsibility, encouraging them to develop their skill set. The leaders gave people discretion

265

and autonomy over their tasks and resources and did not interfere with others' decisions and
ideas unless it was absolutely necessary.
Maintaining
Companies and organizations cannot thrive today without learning to adapt their attitudes
and practices (Senge, 1999b). Organizations that establish change initiatives discover, after
initial success, that even the most promising efforts to transform or revitalize organizations can
fail to sustain themselves over time despite interest, resources, and results. That is because
organizations have complex, well-developed immune systems, aimed at preserving the status quo
(Senge, 1999b). Until new changes are rooted in social norms and shared values, they are subject
to derision as soon as the pressure for change is removed (Kotter, 1995).
All of the leaders in the study addressed the issue of resistance by communicating
frequently how the new approaches, behaviors, and attitudes were critical to the future of the
library and the library profession. In addition, they took long-term administrative actions to
ensure the success of the new e-science based programs by securing resources, such as additional
staff, new spaces to work, and ongoing training opportunities.
Learning Organization
The investigator observed the concept and principles of a learning organization as
described by Senge (1990). A learning organization is one in which all systems, processes, and
structures, at all levels (individual, group, department, and system-as-a-whole), constantly seek
data on system performance and uses the data to make the organization more productive and
creative. The organization seeks to position itself as best it can to ensure success in an uncertain
future and in an uncertain environment (Corlett, n.d.). This type of organization is skilled at
acquiring, transferring, and building knowledge that enables it continuously to experiment,

266

improve, and increase its capability. The learning organization is based on equality, open
information, minimal hierarchy, and a shared culture that encourages adaptability and enables the
organization to seize opportunities and handle crises. Leaders in a learning organization
emphasize employee empowerment and encourage collaboration across departments and with
other organizations. A key value is problem solving, in contrast to the traditional organization,
which is designed for efficient performance (Daft & Lane, 2005). Senge (1990) argues that there
are five core characteristics of a learning organization: (1) personal mastery, (2) mental models,
(3) shared visions, (4) team learning, and (5) systems thinking (see Table 8.4 for the relationship
among the characteristics). The principal element is systems thinking. Senge and his colleagues
define a good systems thinker in an organizational setting as "someone who can see four levels
operating simultaneously: events, patterns of behavior, systems, and mental models” (Roberts,
Ross, Senge, Smith, & Kleiner, 1994, p. 97).
Systems thinking. Organizations, including libraries, are systems, bound by interrelated
actions. Often major change in one area can affect another area, but the ramifications may not be
evident until long after the change takes place. During times of profound change, since everyone
is affected, it is difficult to see the whole pattern of change. Instead, individuals tend to focus on
isolated parts of the system (those that have a direct impact on their assigned work), and
speculate why some difficulties are never addressed. Systems thinking is a conceptual
framework of knowledge and tools which helps to make the patterns of interaction clearer, and
can assist organizations in seeing how to change these relationships effectively.

Shared vision. Within the libraries studied, managerial leaders who worked to bring
about a transformational change also put into place the components of a learning organization. A
central piece of the learning organization is the concept of shared vision — when everyone works
together to create a vision, and then continues to work to incorporate that vision into each unit or
part of the system. All members of the library understand and shape the vision. “The resulting
vision is a creative synthesis (note, not convergence) of all that has emerged. … Every member
had heard his or her own aspirations reflected somewhere” (Roberts et al., 1994, p. 312). With a
shared change vision in place it was easier for library staff to understand the need to incorporate
e-science programs and services into the library’s offering and to bring commitment to the new
direction the library was actively choosing.
Self-mastery. To develop and implement e-science services and programs required a
personal commitment by library staff to learn new skills. In the learning organization this is
known as personal mastery, the discipline of continually clarifying and deepening personal goals,

269

of focusing energy, developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively. There is an emphasis
on results and on seeing the connectedness between individual learning and the commitment of
both the individual and the library to bring about a new future. In each of the libraries
interviewed, librarians commented on the need for self-study and consciously seeking out
training opportunities to gain new skills and feel more competent when dealing with researchers.
A Focus Group Participant at site B stated, “You learn from each new project you work on.
Initially, that can be overwhelming but then you are like, I did it!”
Team learning. Much of the skill building was done as team learning, not to be confused
with the concept of team building or functional teams8 (Roberts et al., 1994). Team learning is
described as people learning to think together, wherein thoughts, emotions, and resulting actions
belong to all members together. The group then starts to work as a unit and the tedious process of
planning and decision making becomes unnecessary (Roberts et al., 1994).
Team learning starts with dialogue, the capacity of members of a team to suspend
assumptions and enter into a genuine state of thinking together (Senge, 1990). There are three
key components of team learning: (1) teams must probe and explore complex issues, drawing on
the talents, knowledge, and experiences of one another; (2) teams must work in concert,
coordinating their efforts and communicating openly and closely; and (3) teams must interact
with each other so that they can share what they learn.
At the sites studied several individuals were assigned to developd e-science programs and
services. No one person could take on the responsibility alone due to the range of skills needed.
In each of the sites a new department was formed and members worked together, learning from
each other, to identify strategies, goals, and services. Throughout the process the information

8

A functional team is a unit of two or more people who interact and coordinate their work to accomplish a shared
goal or purpose; the team is a group of people, but they are not equal (Daft & Lane, 2005).

270

gleaned during the learning process was filtered back to library leaders to help inform future
directions.
Mental models. The extent to which individuals can participate in team learning and the
other elements of the learning organization depends on the mental models from which they
operate. Mental models are powerful thoughts and images that shape perceptions, and determine
how individuals make sense of the world and shape how we act (Senge, 1992). They are
embedded deeply in the mind and can be either simple or complex. Mental models explain how
two people can see the exact same thing, yet describe it differently (Senge, 1990).
Vestal, Fralicx, and Spreier (1997) believe that, unless the culture of an organization is
congruent with the new way of doing business, it will be difficult to obtain sustainable
transformation. In the case of libraries that are actively moving away from a traditional past to
define a new future, a change deeper than culture is necessary. Unless an organizational
paradigm shift occurs the transformational change will not take hold. As discussed in Chapter 7,
transformational change is defined as those periods in an organization’s life cycle when there is a
major shift in the overarching paradigm that guides the organization. Every change in the
paradigm will necessitate changes in culture, mission and purpose, and processes (Levy &
Merry, 1986).
Conclusion
The ultimate goal of change management is to engage employees and encourage their
adoption of a new way of thinking about and doing their jobs. Leading a transformation change
is “an art that is pursued by highly effective leaders that want to continuously achieve
extraordinary results for the organization they lead” (Ayars, 2009, p. 3). The library
administrators in the case studies sought to implement transformational change. They did so by

271

taking the lead and establishing direction. They then ensured that staff had the necessary
resources available to them and aligned everyone so all were working towards a new future for
the library. There were clear goals, defined roles, and a conscious choice to make a change. In
the libraries studied, administrators led people through the transformation process by involving
them in planning and motivating them to work together to make the changes. In addition, they
implemented a long-term maintenance program by fostering a culture that encouraged learning
and team work.
The concluding chapter brings together the findings related to the research questions, as
well as the additional conclusions that emerged in the various thematic chapters. The investigator
draws conclusions about the cases overall, explores the implications of these conclusions for
university libraries for the future, and suggests areas for further research.

Chapter 9
CONCLUSION
Interest in providing programs and services related to e-science and data management is
growing rapidly among university research libraries. This study documents how four libraries
experienced comprehensive and radical changes in beliefs, values, attitudes, perceptions, and
behaviors at the individual and group level in the process of initiating and engaging in e-science
and data management programs and services. Throughout the transformation process a number
of important themes emerged. These themes, reviewed in previous chapters, include the forces
for change, the process of change, the types of change in terms of organizational structure and
the roles of librarians, and the role of library administration in bringing about transformational
change. This concluding chapter integrates these themes, focusing on the relevance and
implications for those working in and leading university research libraries.
Transformation in the Case Studies
Libraries that defend the status quo and place their worth and value in past successes will
soon find that they have lost their standing in the minds of many of those whom they purport to
serve. R. Miller (2012) believes that the academic library will survive in some form as part of the
university. Yet, he says “the real issue and challenge is to keep libraries relevant to the learning
and research enterprise. The danger is that without major transformational change libraries will
become less and less relevant” (p. 5). He argues that “change … in academic libraries cannot
continue to be incremental, but must be transformative” (p. 5). Incremental change, although
easier to implement, will no longer sufficient to sustain libraries. While the literature about
change in academic libraries often mentions the concept of transformational change (Association

277

of Research Libraries, 2010; Jaguszewski & Williams, 2013; Lowry, Adler, Hahn, & Stuart,
2009; R. Miller, 2012; Simmons-Welburn, Donovan, & Bender, 2008), relatively few scholars
(Cuillier, 2012; Michalak, 2012) offer suggestions as to how to engage library staff and bring
about transformational change. This study fills that void by using the framework of first- and
second-order change established by Levy and Merry (1986) to document the processes of
libraries that have gone through a transformational change.
First-order change occurs naturally as organizations grow and develop, and supports
continuity and order; it is often consistent with current values and norms, is readily accepted, and
can be incorporated into daily activities using people’s existing knowledge and skills. Such
change consists of minor improvements and adjustments in systems, processes, or structures, but
it does not involve a fundamental change in strategy, core values, or identity (Levy & Merry,
1986). Second-order change (referred to henceforth as transformational change) involves not
only developing the organization, but also transforming the core of the organization. It is
“multidimensional, multi-level, qualitative, discontinuous, radical organizational change
involving a paradigmatic shift” (Levy & Merry, 1986, p. 5). Second-order change challenges or
conflicts with prevailing values and norms, and is a break from the previous way of thinking and
doing.
The four cases in this dissertation demonstrate that a transformational change, as called
for by the Association of Research Libraries (2010), Jaguszewski and Williams (2013), Lowry et
al. (2009), R. Miller (2012), and Simmons-Welburn et al. (2008), occurred as a result of
implementing e-science programs and services. In achieving this degree of change, the libraries
studied underwent a number of common experiences which have been organized into the forces
leading to transformation, the process of transformation, and the content of transformational

278

change. These experiences may provide insight for other university research libraries as to the
range of issues they may encounter when engaging the research community and implementing escience support and services.
Forces Leading to Transformation
The first step in bringing about a transformational change is to respond to the forces for
change that are emerging. Throughout this research, these forces are described in terms of
enabling, permitting, pre-existing conditions, and triggering events (Lundberg, 1984). Enabling
conditions are the external and environmental circumstances that influence research libraries,
such as Web 2.0 technologies, reconceptualization of collections in all formats, and changes in
undergraduate education to accommodate research-based curricula (Lowry et al., 2009). The
enabling conditions described at the case sites focus on the amount of data being generated, the
value placed on these data, the emphasis on collaboration within and without the institution, the
formation of large international institutes, and in the effort to achieve institutional efficiencies,
the provision of a comprehensive solution. The enabling conditions identified in the case studies
are environmental factors that are affecting all research libraries. Kaufman (2012) sums up how
these factors are associated with e-science and e-research: “growing demand for new services,
such as those required by many research faculty who don’t know how to manage … data …
compel academic librarians to look urgently both to other libraries and to other campus units for
new ways in which to collaborate to deliver them” (p. 55). In the four case studies, university
administrators looked to the library to play an important role and to contribute valuable
experience, and the library administration, having helped to identify the problem, wanted to be
part of the solution.

279

The university administrations’ view that the library has an important role to play is
fostered by the permitting conditions within the library, such as the willingness by library
administration to get involved, transferable skills and expertise (e.g., cataloging, archives, and
digital humanities), and pre-existing services (institutional repository services, liaison programs,
special collections, and archives programs) on which to build. Other elements which are present
in the libraries studied include a core group of interested staff, established partnerships with
information services and the office of research, and stability in the library leadership team. These
elements are the building blocks for going forward. Library administrators are willing to use
permitting conditions to move beyond the parameters of earlier behaviors in order to pursue new
services for aiding their institution, knowing that, if the libraries want to remain indispensable,
they need to define and fulfill a new set of staff roles.
The libraries in the study turned these permitting conditions into actionable items because
of pre-existing or precipitating conditions. According to Lundberg (1984), this includes the
predisposition of an organization to grow and/or decline, to perform above or below
expectations, to cope with the frustration experienced by organization members at the emergence
of new unmet needs, to withstand external pressure from stakeholders who have a vested interest,
and to meet a real or perceived crisis. The combination of past organizational experiences and
the historical response to those experiences influence future changes. In the case study libraries,
a number of past experiences were mentioned as foundational work applicable to taking a lead
role in data management. One is a history of advocating for information policy and management,
such as for copyright and open access. A second is having successfully responded to new
initiatives in the past, such as developing historical collections and digitizing archival materials.
Third, the librarians in the study believe that their strong history of teaching, demonstrating, and

280

incorporating new technologies into their own workflow and serving as a resource to others
within the academic community was valuable experience on which to build. Finally, the strong
desire and willingness to collaborate made the library an ideal partner. Library administrators
also knew that if the library did not proactively seek to be involved in data management, it would
be left out; they believed that the strong service focus of the library and its mission to support
research were critical to the future success of the library in meeting the university’s mission.
Those library administrators advocated for library involvement through participating on
university committees and meeting with university administrators, and worked collaboratively to
solve the pressing issues related to data management.
One of two major triggering events consistently mentioned that propelled the libraries
participating in the study into action was federal funder requirements for data management plans.
This first occurred when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created a policy for data sharing
(National Institute of Health, 2003), which states NIH's position that “all data should be
considered for data sharing” and “data should be made as widely and freely available as possible
while safeguarding the privacy of participants, and protecting confidential and proprietary data”
(National Institute of Health, 2003, Goals). At each of the study sites, library administrators and
librarians took an active role in discussing the implications for their local research community.
It was in 2011, when the National Science Foundation (NSF) went a step further and
mandated that researchers include a two-page data management plan as a supplementary
document with any proposal for funding (National Science Foundation, n.d.), that libraries
servicing research communities of all sizes started to take greater notice. However, the libraries
in this study were ready to build on their previous experience with the NIH policy when
approaching NFS researchers for the first time. As the librarians participating in the study talked

281

with members of the research community it became evident that the need for data services went
beyond helping researchers write plans to meet NIH and NFS proposal requirements.
Researchers were beginning to ask for help organizing their data and requesting advice on longterm preservation.
The librarians in the study viewed funder data management requirements as an excellent
opportunity to engage the research community. The NIH Public Access Policy and the NFS data
management plan requirement helped establish that alerting researchers and keeping campus
administrators well-informed about trends in data management were roles for librarians. As
meeting the federal mandates becomes part of the researcher’s workflow, so too does the demand
for data-specific reference and instruction services beyond the focus of data plans. These include
such activities as data citation, data preservation, and the computation of alternative metrics that
take data production and reuse into account.
The second triggering event which each of the study sites mentioned occurred when a
researcher in the university received a large data-intensive research grant. This was the catalyst
for the university to start thinking more seriously about data management issues at the macro
level. In one instance the researcher incorporated the library into the project at the planning and
writing phases (library at site D). Being included at the planning phase offers the greatest
flexibility and is the most cost effective, as the data management plan can be set ahead of time
and data can be managed as they are created throughout the project. At sites A and C, researchers
asked the library to lend assistance in managing data at some point after the projects began,
especially towards the end of research, when publications and continued research funding place
high pressure on a researcher’s time.

282

In the case of library at site B, the library started getting involved in data management
when a member of a research team, having just completed a project, determined that there would
be value in preserving the data for the long term and approached the library for assistance. “At
that moment in the research cycle, the cost of implementing late data management and sharing
measures can be prohibitively high. Implementing data management measures during the
planning and development stages of research will avoid later panic and frustration” (Van den
Eynden, Corti, Woollard, Bishop, & Horton, 2009, p. 6). Although getting involved at the
completion of a research project is not the most ideal situation, the library at site B, wanting to
get more involved in data management, took on the project at its own expense. According to J.
Wilson et al. (2010), good data management requires the input of the data creators, as they are
usually the only ones in a position to document their methods and outputs accurately.
Process of Transformation
Once the directors of the case study libraries decided to take an active role, the second
step in bringing about a transformational change was to conceive an implementation plan to
transition librarians into the new roles of data management consultant, embedded librarian, or
informationist.1 This required the library to dismantle processes and emotionally let go of old
ways of operating while the staff deal with the changes and embrace the new culture. This
transitional phase was project focused and was supported effectively with traditional change
management tools (Anderson & Anderson, n.d.). Examples from the case studies include
1

An informationist (or information specialist in context) provides research and knowledge management services in
the context of clinical care or biomedical research. The term was first coined by Davidoff and Florance (2000) and
has been gaining momentum since 2010 when the National Library of Medicine (NLM) launched a support program
at the National Institutes of Health: NLM Administrative Supplements for Informationist Services in NIH-funded
Research Projects. Rather than offering support to an individual for coursework, an immersion experience and
research project, this program seeks applications from NIH-funded extramural scientists who wished to add an
informationist to their research teams. The launch of this grant supplement program was made possible with
participation of various organizations; seven of the 23 Institutes and Centers at the National Institute of Health that
fund extramural research participated, including NLM. Eight awards were made, bringing 15 librarians at six
different universities into existing research teams at their organizations (Florance, 2013).

283

reorganizations, creation of new products or services that replace programs in lower demand, and
the implementation of new technologies that did not radically impact people’s work (e.g., an
institutional repository) or require a significant shift in culture or behavior to be effective.
According to Anderson and Anderson (n.d.), there are two indicators that define this
transitional period, and both are applicable to the case studies. The first indicator is linked to
managing change. While in the transitional phase, library administrators determine the goals of
the change initiative before it begins, and can, therefore, manage the process. In the case studies,
library administration closely monitored the process of change and provided support and
guidance throughout. The second indicator identified by (Anderson & Anderson, n.d.) focuses on
what is happening to employees during the transition. The librarians in the case studies were
asked to do many things throughout the transition, such as seek new relationships in the research
community and partner on research grants, but primarily in preparation for their new role they
were asked to learn new skills and take on new duties related to data management.
This dissertation research outlines a common process2 used by the libraries participating
in the study and compares that process with other change models. This common process may be
of some use to other libraries. The fact that a common process could be identified indicates that
there are identifiable specific issues that libraries must address, or at a minimum acknowledge.
Yet, one problem with proposing a change process to engage in e-science is that one can
misinterpret the process as being the only way to bring about such a change successfully.
Librarians and library administrators contemplating participating in e-science activities as a
result of external pressures need to be aware of the local environment and any unique needs and
policies that could affect how such a change is implemented and received within the community

2

Common steps used by the study sites are: (1) identify the need, (2) decision to act, (3) resources assigned, (4)
partnerships formed, (5) paradigm shift, (6) demand increases, and (7) institutionalization of the changes.

284

the library serves. Additionally, implementing change in a set or planned approach is based on
the assumptions that organizations (e.g., libraries) operate under constant conditions, and that
they can move in a pre-planned manner from one stable state to another. Several authors
(Burnes, 1996, 2009; D. Wilson, 2000) writing in the corporate world suggest that the current
fast-changing environment increasingly weakens the likelihood of success if flexibility is not
incorporated into the change process.
Content of Transformational Change
The third and final step to bringing about a transformational change, and also the most
difficult, involves changing organizational culture and individuals’ views of what it means to be
part of a library. Using the theory outlined by Levy and Merry (1986) that transformational
change deals with radical, fundamental, and total change in which an inner shift in people's
values, aspirations, and behaviors combines with outer shifts in processes, strategies, practices,
and systems, this study suggests that a transformational change occurred in the four libraries that
participated in the study. The context in which this change transpires is providing e-science
programs and services; “While libraries may have little immediate engagement in these
processes, clearly e-science has the potential to be transformational within research libraries by
impacting their operations, functions, and possibly even mission” (Joint Task Force on Library
Support for E-Science, 2007, p. 13). Levy and Merry (1986) maintain that the content of
transformational change occurs in four dimensions: functional processes, mission and purpose,
culture, and finally the organization’s world view or paradigm.
Functional Processes. There were common changes in process across the four case
studies, such as forming new departments, creating new positions, offering new services,
reaching new groups, and staff assuming new responsibilities. These types of changes, referred

285

to as functional or first-order changes, are general enough that they can apply to many initiatives
in university research libraries. For example, shifting from a print-based journal collection to an
electronic collection results in creating new positions and reorganization of technical services
staff, but does not require a change in culture or organizational paradigm. The Association of
Research Libraries (2010) calls for more than first-order change when addressing issues related
to data management, making it clear that the mandate for transformation is both broad and deep.
Mission and Purpose. The directors participating in the study do not see e-science
programs and services as changing the mission of the library; in fact, all of them said that
supporting e-science is part of their existing mission. What does change, or a better word may be
expand, are the roles the library staff are willing to assume to fulfill the mission. For libraries
debating whether or not to start offering e-science services such as data management, and others
who are already involved and considering expanding services, it is important to address the
question of mission alignment; straying from the core mission may cause problems. Some issues
that may cause libraries to stray from their core mission include data storage, data mining, and
supporting the technical infrastructure to facilitate data exchange. Only individual librarians and
their directors can determine whether the library has a role in such services and if there is a local
need that is not being fulfilled elsewhere in the university. Halbert (2013) confirms the need for
communication across the institution to identify roles in this area: “effective research data
management practices will require close working relationships between divisions of the
university, sometimes to the point of blurring boundaries in uncomfortable ways” (p. 5).
Despite the environmental differences present in each of the libraries, the directors set a
common goal to make a change to the underlying metarules, that is to say the underlying
assumptions, world view, or what is defined by Levy and Merry (1986) as a paradigm. Second,

286

they all ultimately sought to create visions, choices, ideas, and directions that went beyond the
confines of the current paradigm. Third, they all focused on the organization’s members’
perception of reality, considered what shaped this perception, and finally challenged this
perception with something new. In the end, the library recast its role in the university in relation
to the changing needs of the academic community it serves.
Changing Organizational Culture. Organizational culture consists of group norms of
behavior and the underlying shared values that help keep those norms in place; it characterizes
the way people work together. It also includes symbolic actions and components such as myths,
rituals, ceremonies, the layout of the physical setting, and the style of management and
relationships. In order for transformative change to be implemented successfully, the
organization’s culture needs to be aligned with the proposed change. This involves evaluating
how the existing organization’s culture might positively or negatively influence the change that
needs to take place and then working to adjust the culture, as needed, so that it supports the
change.
Discovering a way to confront the old culture in order to align it with rapidly occurring
change requires a deep understanding of the historical context in which the library operates in the
local environment. Varner (1996) noted:
[When] the change in academic libraries entails more than the addition of new
technologies [a first-order change] – it encompasses a transformation of
organizational culture. A culture founded on unquestioned assumptions about
the nature of library work must give away to a culture whose members
continually seek to disconfirm long-held assumptions and to change as
needed. (p. 2)

287

The directors and associate directors at each of the study sites indicated that it took time
and effort to align staff and for everyone to understand the importance of the changes and
support them. The leaders believed that bringing about change was imperative to remaining
effective, yet different subcultures within the library surfaced and were not sure how offering escience programs and services and taking a lead in data management related to them. R. Miller
(2012) describes this situation:
Others have avoided new digital initiatives to concentrate on traditional core
activities such as reference or bibliographic instruction or preservation or …
binding. In other words, they are retrenching so that essentially they are
maintaining their traditional mission and identity, instead of engaging in
activities that might define a future different from the past. (p. 7)
It poses a challenge for both the administration and the staff to understand these
subcultures and to help all staff members, even those that resist change, to pull together to create
new organizational values that help the library operate in the new environment. R. Miller (2012)
argues that library leaders cannot continue to keep all of the traditional assumptions of what a
library is and continue to add new programs and services. He believes, “We must question old
assumptions, even values-based ones that we have not questioned in the past, and push hard
toward our vision of the future role and mission of the library” (R. Miller, 2012, p. 7).
Library administrators in the study are among those committed to broadening the scope
of library engagement and working closely with the research community. They sought
participation and collaboration as they worked to change the underlying culture, knowing the
new actions will be successful when staff acknowledge the need for change and feel that they
have a role in shaping the new culture rather than simply having a cultural change imposed on

288

them. Librarians at site C commented that the director promotes the library’s data management
services across campus. The director modeled the behavior expected from his librarians; “Most
people won’t change their behaviors until they observe the role models in their organization
acting differently and when they see this new behavior positively recognized and rewarded”
(Bridgespan Group, 2011, p. 1). In addition, each of the library administrators sought
participation from key library personnel to help define the scope of the new services. By letting
librarians participate in formulating the implementation of new services, they were providing an
opportunity not only for librarians to be a part of the change, but to also redefine their personal
role in the library and see how they contribute to bringing about a new culture. One important
aspect of this change is the way in which the employees are willing to embrace risk, flexibility,
and adaptability. As these new actions produced results, the outcomes were communicated and
celebrated, new norms were formed and new shared values began to take hold.
Changing the Organizational Paradigm. An organizational paradigm is defined as a
world view, a frame of reference, or a set of assumptions, usually implicit, about what sorts of
things make up the world, how they act, how they fit together, and how they are interpreted
(Levy & Merry, 1986). Armenakis and Harris (2002) indicate that presenting a new paradigm is
only possible after those effected are aware of the transformation process that is taking place
within the organization and after they have accepted the need for a major change. This was the
case within the libraries in the study. Comments such as “rapid little steps,” “everything is
processed,” and “hurry up and wait” are indicators that the paradigm shift came in stages,
beginning with incorporating functional changes that did not challenge the original paradigm.
Some examples of functional changes that are represented in the case studies include purchasing
datasets for users and storing small datasets in the local institutional repository.

289

At the study sites, over time, as the amount of data being generated across the institution
multiplies and funders start implementing data management and sharing requirements, the simple
requests to store small datasets turn into substantial requests to develop data management plans
and manage large amounts of data. This is referred to, throughout the present research, as the
tipping point and brings the issue of data management into the forefront of library administrators,
who view this as a critical point, or the proverbial fork in the road, in which a new state of being
could emerge if managed properly. Levy and Merry (1986) describe this as the “letting go” and
“holding on” process (p. 294) and involves formalizing the new paradigm within the library and
within the larger context of the organization.
As the paradigm began to change at the study sites, librarians experienced a shift in the
way they conceptualized the library and viewed its purpose in the institution. By engaging with
the research community and taking an active role in research data management, the librarians
were reshaping themselves into research partners with skills that are valued throughout the entire
research process.
The call for a paradigm change is designed to bring the university and the external
environment into the library’s planning and program development, creating an opportunity to
change the thinking of what it means to be a university research library. This is done by inviting
provocative thinkers to engage and discus on issues relevant to e-science and data management.
With the open exchange of opinions, librarians, staff, and leaders alike are able to speak up, ask
questions, and contribute to the new view. As well, library staff are engaged and take part in a
purposeful dialogue which allows new ideas about the role of the library to take firm root in the
organizational culture.

290

A change in a paradigm does not occur rapidly and may incorporate elements of the old
paradigm (while redefining its meaning) rather than fully rejecting it. In the case of the libraries
participating in the study, there was a sense of growth and forward movement, as if engaging in
e-science programs and services was the next major step forward, and that it incorporated
existing skills and provided opportunities for new development. The beginning and end of a
paradigm shift are hard to identify. It may be, as suggested by a librarian at site B, that the full
extent of the change in world view can only be understood after it has been in place and is
functioning as the new norm.
Leading Transformational Change
This research refers to library administrators as managerial leaders, because as leaders
they influence others, create a vision for constructive change, and develop mutual purposes,
while at the same time serving as managers involved in the effective planning, organizing,
staffing, and controlling the organizations (Lim, 2012). As directors and associate directors,
these managerial leaders lead a major change initiative and guide the library staff through a
process of reinvention and rejuvenation.
It is important to note that not all changes represent the same order of change for each
individual or stakeholder group. Change that some experience as first-order change may be
transformational change for others. Using practices that might be appropriate for first-order
change when transformational change is actually desired will likely result in a negative impact.
Thus, it is important that managerial leaders be aware of how staff are reacting to change and
tailor their own leadership practices based on the order of change they are leading and where
they are, and the staff are, in that process.

291

Role of Library Administration
For managerial leaders, the role of director and associate director in the libraries studied
involves many aspects, such as providing direction, formulating strategy, helping others grow,
eliminating obstacles, inspiring and motivating, acting as a coach and mentor, and listening to
constituents. Some of the roles they mentioned can be grouped based on the direction or focus of
their efforts, that is, whether they are internal or external to the library. One external role in
which directors and associate directors participated was influencing dialog at the university level
on data policies and procedures and making recommendations for long-term preservation of data.
Further, as managerial leaders, the directors represented the library at the university level and
promoted the librarians as research partners. Finally, managerial leaders secured funding from
the university administration to support the library as it transitions into a role in which the work
and support that the library offers to the researchers can be funded by grants.
These roles were not new to the directors and associate directors, but were a critical part
of the library’s continued involvement in e-science, and specifically data management. By
participating in the dialogue at the university level, they continually advocated for the library’s
involvement and offered the skills and expertise of the library staff to assist in developing lasting
solutions. This visibility also served as a forum in which to develop and solidify the working
partnerships among the library, the office of research, and information technology services. Each
of the participants at the four study sites commented on the need to have these three
organizations working together in order to provide comprehensive solutions to the issues
associated with data management.
Internally, the director and associate director assumed roles such as providing the
framework for the development of the new e-science based programs and services and

292

highlighting the importance of forming partnerships within the research community. They had
the responsibility for communicating how e-science is an important component of the library
mission. In addition, they showed librarians and other staff members how they fit into the change
process, and they ensured that everyone shares a common focus by creating buy-in and
communicating the importance of transitioning into new roles. They also ensured that the
librarians were equipped to do the new work.
Role of Vision
To determine strategic direction for the future, managerial leaders look inward, outward,
and forward. They scan both the internal and external environment to identify trends, threats, and
opportunities. The result should be both a broad and inspiring vision and an underlying plan for
how to achieve it. The managerial leaders in the case studies used a change vision, a picture of
what the organization will look like after significant changes are achieved. In communicating the
change vision, managerial leaders outlined the opportunities that would be available to the
organization once change was fully realized.
The change vision which each of the library administrators put forward served as the
inspiration and motivation for the transformational change. It provided focus and encouraged
workers to take risks and find new uses for existing skills. Most importantly, the change vision
was able to link the present to the future. The directors in the study communicated a sense of
urgency and the danger of being left behind if the library, as an organization, did not rethink its
role in the university. The change vision challenged the library staff to expand their thinking on
how the library operated in the university environment and how their individual roles would
change. At each of the sites, the director was able to identify a core group of librarians that were
ready to take up the challenge.

293

Team Leadership
Library administrators at all four sites participating in the study formed a new department
or team to implement the change initiative. A team is a specific group composed of members
who are interdependent yet share common goals; the members must coordinate their activities to
accomplish these goals. In the libraries participating in the study, teams included members with a
variety of skills, experiences, and authority, and were led by either the director or associate
director. This composition of members had sufficient authority to eliminate barriers. The teams
were given access to resources such as training, financial resources, and the freedom to take
risks. The teams were empowered with decision-making authority, which gave them the
autonomy to solve problems and make critical choices about the future of the team.
Team leadership is “individuals’ purposeful efforts to influence their team and its
members toward the achievement of objectives and goals” (Ziegert, 2005, p. 4). In the teams
formed in the case study libraries, the director or associate director provided the leadership and
kept the teams moving in the desired direction, yet within the teams, leadership was shared.
Shared team leadership exists when multiple team members exert downward, upward, and lateral
influence on their fellow teammates in an effort to realize team goals (Ziegert, 2005). In shared
team leadership, the formal leader can still perform leadership behaviors; however, this
individual is just one of the many potential team members leading the team. Leadership is not
confined to director and/or associate director; others may serve as leaders when appropriate and
then revert to being team members or followers. For example, in the library at site C there were
times when the individual with the most technical experience led the effort for a period of time
when issues of infrastructure and technology were most pressing, and at the library at site B the
librarian who best understood the NSF data management plan requirements would take the lead.

294

Even if the managerial leader was sharing leadership responsibilities, the library administrators
communicated to the teams they formed an important underlying assumption, that the members
were willing to accept the world view (organizational paradigm). All members, leaders included,
had to be willing to change themselves first. They were asked to let go of many of the
assumptions that guided their behavior in the past. One example of an assumption that needed to
change was expressed by a member of the library at site C: “librarians only support research;
they don’t conduct research.”
The Library as a Learning Organization
A learning organization facilitates the learning of its members and transforms itself in
order to meet its strategic goals (Haley, 2010). Employees, teams, and leaders continually adapt
in response to ongoing changes as they occur. Employees should not be passive recipients of
knowledge and skills perceived by others to be necessary; they identify what they already know
and how that knowledge can serve as a platform or structure for further learning and
development (Haley, 2010). Thus, learning organizations learn and adapt continually in order to
survive and grow.
In the libraries participating in the study, the investigator observed a cycle of action,
feedback, and synthesis. As librarians interacted with the research community and formed
partnerships, they gathered feedback on those experiences from everyone who was involved,
reported back, and worked with library administrators to discuss the process. All of this
information was considered and adjustments were made going forward, so that the next time
librarians had an opportunity to forge new relationships or assume embedded roles; they were
better prepared.

295

The investigator also observed that during the time of transition, library administrators
made themselves available. Strict hierarchical structures were set aside. Rather, structure was
based on workflows and processes; the goal was to create mechanisms that allowed for easy
communication, coordination of efforts, and sharing of knowledge. At site A, the library director
commented on how the flat organizational structure facilitates her involvement and keeps her
close to the day-to-day operations of the e-science and data management initiatives. The library
director at site D told how each year he forms a new management team, not based on position
but rather on skills that are relevant to the annual goals and objectives.
In this way the librarians were shifting from task-based3 assignments to assuming open
roles in the newly defined paradigm of the library. When a librarian assumed a role, there was
discretion and freedom to make decisions and react quickly to changes. Throughout this process,
librarians were constantly learning. Within the learning organization, new skills are acquired,
transferred, and shared as new knowledge enables the library to experiment, improve, and
increase its capabilities.
Staffing and Skills
The Institute of Museum and Library Services has supported a number of initiatives to
develop the skills and tools used in data management. These include the Information: Curate,
Archive, Manage, Preserve (iCAMP)4 project at the University of Northern Texas and the New
England Collaborative Data Management Curriculum (NECDMC )5 led by the Lamar Soutter
Library at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Even so, one common statement

3

A task is a narrowly defined piece of assigned work (Daft & Lane, 2005).
The iCAMP Project is a three-year effort (2011-2014) to build capacity for educating librarians and researchers for
digital curation and data management. This end result will be a set of graduate level courses offered at the
University of North Texas.

The NECDMC project is an instructional tool for librarians to assist in teaching data management best practices to
undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers in the health sciences, sciences, and engineering disciplines.

made by those library directors at the study sites when they considered getting involved in escience and data management is that they did not have staff with the appropriate skills;
“Currently librarians lack the technical skills needed to manage and curate terabytes of digital
data” (Creamer et al., 2012, p. 22). The same can be said for others in the academic community;
“almost no one within the academic community receives systematic professional training and
certification in the management of research data … librarians may be the closest to
understanding their role” (Halbert, 2013, p. 6) .
The library administrators and librarians in the libraries studied made similar comments,
but they did not let the apparent lack of skills stop them from moving forward. Specifically, the
directors said they needed staff who had technical expertise and project management skills,
understood the research process, and had some domain knowledge. All of the skills related to escience, they suggested, could be learned. “Most stakeholders (including libraries) also
acknowledge that libraries cannot manage research data alone” (Halbert, 2013, p. 6). It will
require cross-campus collaboration with researchers, information technology, and offices of
research. The directors in the study identified the need for librarians to possess excellent
interpersonal communication, self-confidence, and willingness to approach new people in order
to be effective team members. They sought people who possess initiative and the ability to
advocate for the library and themselves. If these skills were not present among the current library
staff, they sought to hire a new librarian to help with the change initiative.
Barriers to Implementing Transformational Change
Even well-conceived and well-supported change efforts, like those of the libraries
participating in the study, run into problems and impediments, particularly when there is no
prevailing model among their peer libraries to offer guidance as they undergo their

297

groundbreaking efforts. The contributors to the study have been forthcoming about the barriers to
getting started.
Many of the barriers identified in this study relate to the time it takes to implement a
transformational change. The library administrators and librarians in the study knew it would
take a while to implement e-science based programs and services and to incorporate these
services into the larger workings of the library. One reason is the effort it takes to develop and
communicate the need for change. Within the small groups of people assigned to work on escience initiatives, there was a common desire to move forward and develop services. Yet, it was
also important to ensure that the personnel outside of the planning groups in all of the libraries
understood and bought into the significance of how this new role moved the traditional academic
library into a new direction with regard to services and programs.
It also takes time to develop an implementation plan for change. Setting up new
departments, shifting personnel, writing new job descriptions, and hiring additional staff require
organization and working with within the university structure. The library director at site D
specifically commented on the difficulty of working with the Human Resources department to
explain the changes in job description, qualifications, and appropriate salary ranges.
Awareness of the need to obtain new skills, not to mention translating the new
knowledge, skills and abilities into practice, is also a slow process; “Training is a starting point
… there has to be follow-through, reflection, feedback, and practice over a long period of time
for real change to take root” (Diaz & Phipps, 1998, p. 410). Although the library administrators
in the case study libraries had been thinking and planning for e-science for more than 10 years
they indicated that, as members of ARL, they continue to be actively involved in the programs

298

and training sessions being offered by ARL, such as the E-Science Institute.6 Organized
activities like the E-Science Institute help librarians to learn from one another and build peer
networks. These types of opportunities also serve as an outlet for ideas to be exchanged and best
practices to be shared.
Two additional issues related to time are the process of building lasting working
relationships with the research community, and funding cycles. An important milestone for the
librarians in the study was partnering with a researcher on a data-intensive project from start to
finish. Forming a working relationship in which the librarian is welcomed into a research team as
a full partner requires a combination of the technical and non-technical skills previously
mentioned, and a number of other factors which also need to align. Some of the most critical
points are:
•

the time period of the grant;

•

how well the librarian fits with the research team;

•

the availability of a mentor for the librarian;

•

the proposed role of the librarian; and

•

the availability of funding to pay for the librarian.

Addressing these issues requires a strong working relationship between the researcher and
librarian.
Organizational change is more of an open-ended and continuous process than a set of predetermined separate and self-contained actions (Burnes, 1996, 2009). Attempts to dictate

6

The E-Science Institute is designed to help research libraries develop a strategic agenda for supporting research in
the sciences. Its scope is not limited to the types of scientific research requiring very large scale computing (i.e.,
computational science or high performance computing) but includes all aspects and types of computer supported
research including data production and curation, social interaction (e.g., virtual research environments), online
publishing and scholarly communication, and the use of physical space for computer-based group activities
(Association of Research Libraries, 2011).

299

timetables, objectives, and methods in advance, results in the process of change becoming
dependent on administration, moving away from engaging other stakeholders in the process, and
failing to take into account the fast pace of change (D. Wilson, 2000).
Recommendations for Future Research
E-science and its effect on libraries are in the beginning stages of development, study,
and research. This research represents the start of an exploration of the changes occurring in
university research libraries and the leadership issues associated with those changes. A number
of elements are worthy of particular attention, and some of these are explored below.
Evolving Role of the Library and the Librarian
This study identifies numerous library staff roles related to data management education,
information policy, research, and service offering. Additional studies that examine roles beyond
these categories would benefit the library community as librarians look to expand the programs
and services currently offered. Similarly, studies that focus on outcomes and the impact of
library involvement in e-science and data management projects will contribute useful
information to those libraries debating whether or not to get involved.
This study confirms that librarians working in the area of e-science need both technical
and non-technical competencies (as suggested by Creamer et al. (2012)). An analysis of how
librarians are acquiring these skills (e.g., continuing education in library and information science
master’s programs or offerings of professional associations, or on the job training), and whether
the educational goals match what is needed in practice will help those who are considering
seeking additional education, as well as those who are designing and offering educational and
training programs.

300

It is worthwhile to learn more about librarians who assume roles as embedded librarians
or informationists. A better understanding of their experiences, how their role has evolved over
time, and the hurdles they faced will benefit managers and leaders who are encouraging
librarians to move in this direction. As these librarians move out of the physical library building
and partner with researchers, it is useful to explore how they maintain professional identity and
whether they start to identify more with the research team and less with the library (as indicated,
for example, by professional memberships and affiliations).
As librarian roles evolve and the culture of the library embraces change as a normal state,
the ramifications for librarians and library staff working in unionized environments needs to be
examined. A study that investigated the process and issues associated with bringing about
transformational change in unionized library environments will be of value to workers and
leaders in such settings. This would build on the research by Lim (2012).
Concepts of e-Research/e-Scholarship
This study, focused on four libraries that are members of ARL, approaches e-science as a
subset of e-research; e-humanities and e-social sciences make up the balance of e-research. As
research continues to grow and become more multi-disciplinary and interprofessional education7
becomes more popular, the distinctions among humanities, social sciences, and the sciences blur.
One effect on university research libraries is the closing of departmental libraries. How well
these libraries are incorporated back into the main library is not known, especially if one of the
libraries is moving away from traditional library services and embracing transformational
change. Scenarios that look beyond libraries that are members of ARL and extend library e7

“Interprofessional education involves educators and learners from 2 or more health professions and their
foundational disciplines who jointly create and foster a collaborative learning environment. The goal of these efforts
is to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes that result in interprofessional team behaviors and competence. Ideally,
interprofessional education is incorporated throughout the entire curriculum in a vertically and horizontally
integrated fashion” (Buring et al., 2009, p. 1).

301

science and e-research services into the future could help libraries facing the challenge of
merging services.
International Comparisons
Although data curation and management are principal components of e-science support
and services in U.S. university research libraries, in the United Kingdom, national data centers
are more active in developing these services (L. Molloy, 2013). Comparative studies involving
the United States, United Kingdom, and other countries such as Australia, Germany, and Canada,
would be useful. These countries have promoted the use of national data centers as part of
national information policy. Studies that seek to understand the advantages and disadvantages of
this type of approach, implementation issues, and final outcomes will be useful for all involved
in implementing data management and curation programs, especially those who are overseeing
implementation in the United States.
One characteristic of e-science is its collaborative approach to data collection, especially
in trying to answer global questions such as those posed in meteorology, astronomy, and human
genomics. As researchers form national and international partnerships questions arise as to how
libraries support such research teams, and about how librarians collaborate and work together to
meet researcher needs.
Strategic Partner and Institutional Perspective
Cooperation and collaboration are not new concepts in academic librarianship (Kaufman,
2012). A closer examination of the working relationships among the library, university
administration, and strategic partners on campus in regard to data management and e-science will
inform planning efforts involving collaboration. Answering questions about how collaborators

302

are identified and what each partner brings to the relationship could provide meaningful data and
useful information for libraries that want to form new partnerships across the university campus.
Transformational Change in Systems verses Subsystems
One of the main questions about transformational change is the relationship between a
transformational change in a system and a change in one of its subsystems. This study asks if a
transformational change has occurred, but a closer examination as to whether the
transformational change occurred at the systems level or within a subsystem could be helpful.
Does a transformational change in a subsystem necessarily lead to a first-order change in the
system? The effect of change in the subsystem on the entire system probably depends on the
centrality of the subsystem and how closely it is tied with other parts of the system. It is possible
that in organizations, a transformational change cannot come about through transformational
change in a subsystem. Perhaps transformational change can occur only by a change in
dimensions (core processes, mission, culture, or paradigm) that affects all subsystems. This
concept deserves further study.
Transformational Change and Environmental Support
Another area for further study is the degree of dependence of a transformational change
on the support of the university environment; transformational change is difficult if there is
strong resistance from within that community. Holloway (2004) observes that “implementing a
new structural organization within a university is not for the faint-hearted. It takes courage of
conviction as well as support from university administrators” (p. 8). In this instance, if the
university is against the library assuming a role in e-science, is it still possible for the library to
experience a transformation? What factors affect this? These questions need further research.

303

Sustainability of Transformational Change
Kotter (2013) wrote that 70 percent of change efforts fail and only 5 percent of change
efforts achieve all of their stated objectives. But what happens to an organization that is able to
achieve a transformational change? Is it sustainable? Senge (1999a) states:
This failure to sustain significant change recurs again and again despite
substantial resources committed to the change effort (many are bankrolled by
top management), talented and committed people "driving the change", and
high stakes. In fact, executives feeling an urgent need for change are right;
companies that fail to sustain significant change end up facing crises. By then,
their options are greatly reduced, and even after heroic efforts they often
decline. (p. 6)
A follow-up study that examines long-term stability of transformational change in
academic libraries will benefit the library profession as a whole, since library managerial leaders
address issues of change and how to sustain change for the long-term on a daily basis regardless
of the context and type of library. How do libraries that are successful in implementing a
transformational change continue to move forward, so that transformational change is a
continuous process and is embedded into the library culture?
It will also be of value to examine the role of teams in bringing about and sustaining
transformational change. Martin (2004) was the first to examine the role of teams in academic
libraries using Hackman’s (2002) criteria for team effectiveness. The libraries in the four case
studies formed working teams to initiate and implement their desired changes. How do the
outcomes of these teams measure against Hackman’s (2002) and Martin’s (2004) application of
those criteria in libraries?

304

Conclusion
The massive amounts of data being generated as a result of computationally-intensive
research and funders’ requirements to preserve and share data have propelled research
universities and their libraries to become engaged in e-science. Librarians have transferable skills
and experiences which allow them to assume critical roles in e-science initiatives at department
and institutional levels. The functions these skills support include data management education,
information policy, research, and service development; all are applicable to data management. A
number of structural and programmatic changes are occurring in libraries to provide e-science
services and programs; these include re-defining the role of the librarian and the transformation
of the library into a learning organization. These changes are more than incremental or
functional; they involve culture, organization paradigm, and vision. Embedding librarians
throughout the entire research process challenges the traditional view and purpose of the library,
redefining the role of librarians. The result is a transformational change.

E-Mail Message to library directors from dissertation committee chair
Dear ___________,
I am writing on behalf of Mary Piorun, who is one of the students in the PhD program in
Managerial Leadership in the Information Professions. She is seeking a greater understanding of
why libraries are getting involved in e-science, the role they are assuming in this area, how
libraries are partnering with other campus organizations, and the effect on the library.
We would like to request your participation in the study. This involves Mary visiting your
campus for approximately two days at a time that is most convenient for you in order to conduct
interviews and review any relevant documents that you are able to supply. The interviews would
be both internal and external to the library. Internally, she would conduct a personal interview
with you, the associate university librarian responsible for overseeing e-science programming
and services, and a librarian who is providing the services. Externally, we request your
assistance in arranging personal interviews with those you consider relevant. They might include
the Vice Provost for Research or a designee, and one to three personal interviews, as you think
appropriate, with those departments or organizations on campus with which the library is
partnering. Mary would also like to obtain any documents that you can share related to
implementing e-science programs and services at your library and at the institution. These
documents can be anything related to strategic planning, setting priorities, progress reports, and
visioning exercises, as well as any memos and meeting minutes that detail your work in escience.
A separate invitation to participate in this study will be sent via the US Postal Service. I
sincerely hope that you will be able to take part in this study. I am happy to address any
questions you may have about participating in this study, and would like to thank you on behalf

Invitation to participate
Dear ___,
In today’s highly collaborative, data-driven research environment, a number of libraries serving
research universities with membership in the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) have
moved beyond the traditional roles of providing access, organizing, and ensuring preservation of
information. They have been showcasing their value and relevance by identifying new roles and
seizing opportunities to partner with researchers as they become more involved in e-science. This
study is investigating why research institutions and libraries became engaged in e-science, their
future directions, and which strategic partners are critical for success. The study is also exploring
the changes occurring in libraries in order to provide e-science services and programs and the
role of leadership in bringing about those changes.
Will you participate in this study? If so, I would like to plan to visit your campus for
approximately two days, at a time that is most convenient for you, hopefully this summer or
early fall, in order to conduct interviews and review any relevant documents that you may be
able to supply. Any data I gather will be kept in the strictest confidence and my dissertation will
not allude to you personally in any way that an outsider could identify.
The interviews I am planning would be both internal and external to the library. Internally, I plan
to conduct a personal interview with you, the associate university librarian responsible for
overseeing e-science programming and services, and a librarian who is providing the services.
External to the library, I would request your assistance in arranging a personal interview with the
Vice Provost for Research or their designee, and one to three personal interviews with those
departments or organizations on campus with which the library is partnering.
I would also like to obtain any documents that you can share related to implementing e-science
programs and services at your library and at the institution. These documents can be anything
related to strategic planning, setting priorities, progress reports, and visioning exercises, as well
as any memos and meeting minutes that detail your work in e-science.
I would like to call you to share more information on my research study, provide you with
specifics regarding the interviews, and answer any questions you may have for me. If you can
suggest some times for a phone call in the next week or so, I would be happy to accommodate
your schedule.
Thank you in advance for any assistance you can offer.

Invitation to Take Part and Introduction: Mary Piorun, a doctoral student at Simmons
College in Boston, Massachusetts, is conducting a research study under the direction of Dr. Peter
Hernon and her dissertation committee at Simmons College. The study will explore how and
why research institutions and their libraries became engaged in e-science, how e-science is
conceived and implemented, and also investigate the changes occurring in libraries in order to
provide e-science services and programs and the role of leadership in bringing about those
changes. You are invited to participate in an interview because you have been involved in escience activities at your institution.
Purpose of Research: To explore how and why research institutions and their libraries became
engaged in e-science, how e-science was conceived and implemented, and also to investigate the
changes occurring in libraries in order to provide e-science services and programs, and the role
of leadership in bringing about those changes.
Your Rights: It is important for you to know that your participation is entirely voluntary. You
may decide to not take part in or decide to quit the study at any time, without any penalty. You
may decide to make comments off-the-record, and the moderator will turn the tape recorder off
for that part of the conversation. You will be told about any new information or changes in the
study that might affect your participation.
Procedures: Your participation in the project will last between approximately between 30 and
60 minutes. Individual interviews will be conducted in a place of your choice. All interviews will
be tape recorded and transcribed by an independent transcriber experienced in qualitative
research. Information shared in this study will be used as the main data collection. The data will
