Dedication
This dissertation is dedicated to my mother, who had a life-long curiosity about
the world around her, and who encouraged me to pursue a doctoral degree. Her love of
reading and learning gave me the passion to continue my education throughout my life.
Although she is no longer with us, I’m sure she knows I’ve finished. It is also dedicated
to my husband and my son. They helped with the house chores and many other tasks to
give me the time to devote to my studies and my writing. Their encouragement and
interest in my study helped me see this long journey to an end.
I could not have completed this degree without the encouragement and friendship
o f Sue Black, Patti Myers, and all the West Shore librarians I have worked with during
the past thirty plus years. Your faith in me helped me find the strength to continue when
I was not sure I could reach the end!
And, finally, I dedicate this dissertation to all of the K-12 school librarians in
Pennsylvania. They are an essential part of each school. They work very diligently to
help students become excited about reading and learning. While the numbers o f school
librarians are falling due to school budget deficits, it is my hope that all students will
have access to a school librarian who inspires within each child a love of literature and
reading.

Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my dissertation committee chair, Dr. Kathleen Bowes. She
always had the right words to say to keep me moving forward. I thank Dr. Thurlow for
his willingness to help whenever needed, and to Dr. Staulters for her attention to detail.
Together they helped me produce the best study possible.
I would also like to thank the school librarians of Pennsylvania who responded to
my request for assistance. Their willingness to participate was essential to my ability to
conduct this study. Additional thanks go to Commonwealth Libraries and the
Pennsylvania School Librarians Association for allowing me to use their listservs to
advertise this study and for all of the support they give to school librarians across
Pennsylvania.
And I acknowledge all of the wonderful school librarians who work tirelessly to
promote reading, learning, and research to students in all grades and who are always
ready to support the teachers in their schools.

Abstract
This qualitative study examined the perceptions of Pennsylvania school librarians
about the role they play in providing copyright guidance to the students, teachers, and
administrators in their school during the 2011-2012 school year. Using two electronic
mailing lists for Pennsylvania school librarians, the researcher posted an email asking
librarians to complete an online survey about copyright. The e-mail contained the link to
the survey instrument.
The 29 question survey, completed by 184 librarians, consisted o f questions about
the professional qualifications of the school librarians, the type of school in which the
librarians work, and the librarians’ perceptions about their role in providing copyright
advice to students, teachers, and administrators. Finally, the survey contained a quiz with
ten questions about common copyright situations encountered in K-12 schools. At the
end of the survey, librarians were asked if they were willing to participate in a telephone
interview to provide more information. Ten librarians were interviewed by phone.
More than 80% of the librarians who participated in the study indicated that they
provided copyright advice and/or instruction to students, teachers, and administrators in
their school, indicating they saw themselves as a copyright resource for their school.
Librarians reported they used many resources to leam about changes in copyright laws
including books, listservs, web sites, colleagues, and conference workshops. It was not
clear whether librarians with more experience knew more about copyright than their less
experienced colleagues as evidenced by their scores on the copyright quiz. When asked
about the resources that librarians used to answer copyright questions, they named people

(professors, public librarians, and school technologists), copyright guides (books), and
web sites, with most librarians indicating they used several different resources.
As digital and print resources are easily created and duplicated, it is important that
educators have a local resource they can use to get accurate information about classroom
use of copyrighted material under the fair use doctrine. Teachers have a responsibility to
model ethical and legal use of copyrighted materials and to help their students do the
same. While this study shows that school librarians can and do serve as local copyright
experts, more research is needed to confirm these results on a larger scale.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Students and teachers today make frequent use o f digital materials in their
teaching and learning (Jukes, McCain and Crockett, 2010; Prensky, 2010; Rosen, 2010).
These digital materials come from information providers such as Discovery Education,
EBSCO, Proquest, SAFARI Montage, and from the public internet. Students grow up
immersed in video gaming, cable and satellite television, and the internet (Prensky,
2001a). It is clear that instructional methods must reach students using a variety of
modalities that mesh with student learning styles and acknowledge student real-world
experience with interactive, digital multi-media (Jukes et al. 2010; Prensky, 2010; Rosen,
2010). Educational technology standards for students, published by the International
Society of Technology in Education (ISTE), delineate the importance of technology use
by students (International Society of Technology in Education, 2007). The standards for
students, NETS-S (National Educational Technology Standards for Students), include the
exposure of students to models and simulations, collaboration with others in digital
environments, the location and use of information from a variety o f sources, and the use
of digital tools in learning and problem-solving.
To harness student interest and familiarity with digital resources, digital
instructional materials are built into textbook publishers’ course content and sold to
school districts. Educational publishers supply these resources as CDs, DVDs, and/or
content located on secure, password-protected websites. Publishers’ resources are not the

2

only materials used by teachers and students; the public internet contains vast educational
resources. Materials available on web sites often have copyright restrictions that must be
examined to make sure the use by teachers and students is permitted without payment of
fees.
Problem Statement
With few exceptions, written works, works o f art, computer software, digital
audio, digital still photographs, and digital video are copyrighted. The owners of
copyrighted works are afforded protections under the law, including the right of the
owners to charge fees for the use o f their copyrighted materials. Copyright laws were
amended in 1976 to allow copyrighted materials to be used for educational purposes
without the payment of fees (Maddox, 1995). Known as the Fair Use Doctrine, use of
materials for educational purposes was allowed if the use met the four factors of fair use:
purpose and character of the use, the nature of the work, the amount of the work used,
and the effect on the market of the work. For each copyrighted resource used for
education, teachers and students must determine if their use of the material was permitted
under the Fair Use Doctrine. The importance of giving serious consideration to deciding
if using a resource for education was fair use is shown in the NETS-S by the inclusion of
a standard that indicates students must understand and practice the legal and ethical use
of information (ISTE, 2007).
Hobbs (2010) believes that fair use can be asserted for most uses of copyrighted
materials, and that litigation of educators or students for copyright infringement is of little
concern. Other researchers (Abruzzi, 2010; Mawdsley, 2009) point to efforts of content

3

owners to enforce copyright over fair use, and caution that litigation of copyright holders’
rights and intellectual property rights are increasing.
While librarians have assumed the responsibility of understanding copyright and
providing advice on fair use to students, teachers, and administrators within their school,
the wide variety of digital resources that are available on the internet has added many
layers of complexity to the process of determining if the use of materials for teaching and
learning is fair use. Many published copyright guides have been written specifically for
librarians (Crews, 2006; Lipinski, 2006; Russell, 2004; Wherry, 2008), and librarians
study copyright as part of their educational training (Harris, 2011). Professional journals
for K-12 school librarians including School Library Journal, Teacher Librarian, Library
Media Connection, and American Libraries frequently contain articles about copyright,
fair use, and intellectual property.
Copyright legislation is changing in response to the new digital mediums used to
create and disseminate works (Crews, 2010; Dames, 2005; Lyons, 2010). Speak Up
(2009) found that students are using technology including blogs, wikis, twitter,
videoconferences, online communities, email, texts, podcasts, online gaming, and digital
video to enhance their learning. A variety o f electronic devices are used by students for
personal productivity (Speak Up, 2009). These devices include ipods, smart phones,
digital readers, digital cameras, laptops, and tablets. The vast array of new mediums
being used by students and teachers make it important that someone serve as a local
resource on the legal and ethical aspects that must be considered before using
copyrighted materials for educational purposes (Prensky, 2010, p. 102).

4

Some studies have indicated that teachers are unsure of how to determine if their
instructional use of copyrighted materials is fair use (Bell, 2010; Hobbs, 2010). While
librarians have traditionally held the role of copyright advisor, little research has been
done in the digital age to examine the capability and the willingness of today’s school
librarians to embrace the role o f providing copyright and fair use advice to students,
teachers, and administrators.
Purpose of the Study
With the ready availability and ubiquitous use of digital resources in education,
copyright holders are able to more easily to detect copyright infringement (Lipinski,
2006, p. xiii). While educators can claim fair use of some copyrighted digital materials
that are used for teaching and learning, Lipinski (2006) believes that “copyright liability
is strongest in the digital environment” (p. xiv). Someone in the school community
should assume the role of copyright advisor to aid administrators, teachers and students in
the legal and ethical use of these digital copyrighted materials. Librarians serve as
copyright advisors in many schools, but may not have the broad knowledge base needed
to provide accurate information to staff and students. This study was conducted to
examine the perceptions of K-12 school librarians in regard to their knowledge of
copyright and fair use and to examine librarians’ perceptions about their role in providing
administrators, teachers, and students with copyright guidance. The study investigated
where librarians obtained their knowledge about copyright law and fair use. Finally,
librarian knowledge about fair use of copyrighted materials in common educational
scenarios was examined.

5

Significance of the Study
Court cases involving music piracy have been filed against students over the past
decade as the music industry faces declining revenue (RIAA, 2009; Smith and Fowler,
2011). The theft of video games and movies has become easy using one o f the many
video converter programs available on the internet. While copying digital intellectual
property is illegal, many students are not aware that they are breaking the law when they
make copies of their favorite songs and movies (Bender & Wang, 2009). Teachers do not
always understand that while using digital resources within their classroom is likely
considered fair use, posting the same resources on their web site is likely not fair use.
Teachers also do not always understand the difference between using copyrighted
materials for instruction and using these materials for other non-instructional purposes
such as showing a movie to students as a reward (Maddox, 1995).
School leaders must ascertain that teachers are obeying all laws when they select
and use instructional materials (Simpson, 1994). Using resources legally is important as
teachers must model legal and ethical behavior for their students. Teachers must also
teach students how to legally and ethically use copyrighted materials (ISTE, 2007).
Pennsylvania school board policies include a specific policy about copyright that details
how a school district will comply with copyright law. All of these factors make it
essential that one or more school district employees are capable of giving accurate
copyright advice to administrators and teachers (Simpson, 1994).
Because the Fair Use Doctrine is nebulous, someone within a school district needs
to study copyright law and determine how to apply fair use for educational purposes

6

within their organization. Do these educational purposes include professional
development for teachers? How is fair use applied to instructional materials posted on
wikis, blogs, Web 2.0 sites, and teacher pages on the district’s web site? How does fair
use apply to student projects that are displayed at conferences, entered into competitions,
or used by organizations outside the school district? These are the types of questions that
commonly arise in schools (Russell, 2004). Little research has been done on how
educators decide which copyrighted materials to use in their classroom and how teachers
determine if their use of copyrighted resources is fair use.
Whether librarians possess the knowledge and the willingness to help schools
determine how to interpret copyright and fair use is important to examine (Simpson,
1994). Pressman (2008) believes librarians have a legal obligation to follow copyright
law but do not have a direct legal duty “to their users to help them follow the law o f fair
use” (Pressman, 2008, p. 101). Some experts espouse a liberal interpretation of fair use
to declare that almost any educational use of any copyrighted material is fair use (Hobbs,
2010). Other experts take a more conservative view (Russell, 2004; Simpson, 2005a;
Simpson, 2005b). Both liberals and conservatives can make a plausible argument that
their interpretation is correct. Crews (2006) believes that each institution should develop
their own policy defining how fair use will be determined, a position that is also held by
Maddox (1995) and Simpson (2004).
This study will examine how librarians perceive their role in providing copyright
advice to teachers, and how knowledgeable librarians consider themselves about
copyright and fair use. The results of this study will help school leaders to understand the

7

role their librarians can assume in providing teachers with advice on the fair use of
copyrighted materials for instruction.
Ultimately, teacher use of instructional materials should serve as a model of legal
and ethical propriety, providing students with an understanding of copyright, fair use, and
intellectual property that will prepare them to enter the 21st century work force. It is
important that students gain these skills to ethically navigate and use the vast amount of
information available on the internet so they are prepared for their future personal and
business information needs. The ease of copying and modifying digital resources makes
it essential that students understand their rights and responsibilities.
Research Questions
1. What are Pennsylvania school librarians’ perceptions about their role in
providing copyright and fair use advice to students, teachers, and
administrators
2. How do school librarians leam about current laws and trends in the use of
copyrighted materials for education?
3. Is there a pattern between the number of years of experience of a school
librarian and their knowledge about basic copyright situations that occur in
schools?
4. What resources do librarians use to answer copyright questions posed by
students, teachers, and administrators?

8

Assumptions
The following assumptions are made about the participants in this study and about
the policies of school districts within the state of Pennsylvania. The certification process
and requirements for library media specialists in Pennsylvania is described below as it
may vary from the requirements of other states.
1. School librarians have completed a college-level program in library science
and/or possess a Library Media Specialist certificate issued by the
Pennsylvania Department of Education. School librarian certification in
Pennsylvania may be awarded to a certified teacher who is able to pass the
Library Media Specialist Praxis Exam. There is not a requirement that a
teacher must have a degree in library science or any library course work in
addition to obtaining as a passing score on the Praxis.
2. School district policy does not name anyone other than the school librarian as
the source of information on copyright and fair use within the school.
3. Almost all Pennsylvania school librarians belong to the state electronic
mailing list named “Schools”. This electronic mailing list is devoted to
providing a digital discussion forum for K-12 librarians in public and private
schools across the state.
4. Most Pennsylvania school librarians are members of PSLA (Pennsylvania
School Librarians Association) and have provided their e-mail address to
PSLA so they are members of the PSLA electronic mailing list.

9

5. School librarians are able to navigate to an online survey tool and complete a
digital survey.
6. Librarians who respond to the survey will answer all questions accurately and
honestly.
Definitions
Comfort level - Bing Dictionary (Bing, 2009) defines comfort level as the
“condition or degree of comfort: the set of physical or psychological circumstances in
which somebody feels most at ease and free from physical discomfort or stress
(informal)”
Digital citizenship - The term Digital Citizenship is used to designate a set of
skills including the ability to understand fair use and copyright infringement (Baker,
2008). Digital citizenship is the respectful and ethical use of information (Baker, 2008;
ISTE, 2007), including a commitment to lifelong learning, and a positive attitude toward
collaboration and production of resources.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act - The Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA) was enacted to provide copyright protections to digital materials. The DMCA
made it illegal to circumvent anti-theft programs or devices that protected digital
materials. This gave copyright holders of digital materials such as movies and computer
software legal redress from piracy. The impact on fair use was significant as educators
were then unable to show short video clips of protected materials for instructional
purposes (Band, 2004).

10

Digital Native - A term used by Marc Prensky in 2001, Digital Native is the term
used to designate the first generation o f children who have grown up having cell phones,
video games, digital music players, digital video players and recorders, computers and
other technology readily available (Prensky, 2001a).
Fair Use - A part of United States copyright law that was added in 1976, the fair
use statute allows the use of copyrighted materials for educational purposes without
compensation to the copyright holder. The most common defense against copyright
infringement is fair use (Wilson, 2005, pp. 67-69). The fair use statute is also referred to
as the fair use doctrine.
Fair Use Guidelines - Various documents, called fair use guidelines, have been
developed over time to quantify the copyrighted material that may be used under the fair
use doctrine. None of the various guidelines have the force o f law. Each of the various
guidelines was adopted by only a portion of the copyright holders whose works might be
used by educators (Hobbs, 2010, pp. 26-28).
NETS-S - The National Technology Standards for Students, commonly referred
to as NETS-S, were last updated and adopted by the International Society for Technology
in Education in 2007. These standards specify the technology skills and experiences that
should be a part of each student’s education. Separate technology standards exist for
teachers and administrators (ISTE, 2007).
Public Domain - Public domain materials are those materials that are not
protected under copyright. While many materials in the public domain are either

11

produced by the government or are older works whose copyright has expired, each work
must be investigated to verify its copyright status (Wilson, 2005).
Safe Harbor - Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act included a
provision that provided immunity from prosecution for any internet company that agreed
to remove pirated digital materials from their web site upon notification from the legal
owner of that material of copyright infringement. This created a ‘safe harbor” that
allowed Web 2.0 providers such as YouTube, Twitter, and Flickr to exist (Band and
Schruers, 2002).
TEACH Act - The Technology, Education and Copyright Harmonization Act of
2002, also known as The TEACH Act, is copyright legislation that was adopted in 2002
to provide clarification of how fair use should be applied to distance learning. The
TEACH Act is one of the most important 21st century changes in copyright that impacts
education. The TEACH Act is sometimes applied to face to face instruction, although
face to face instruction is not included within the scope of the TEACH Act (Crews,
2010 ).

Technology - Also known as digital technology, digital resources, technology
resources, and technology tools (Prensky, 2010, pp. 98-100), technology refers to the
devices and media available in society today. Technology includes the internet,
computers, email, IM, chat, cell phones, texting, video games, music, and television
(Rosen, 2010, p.29).

Chapter 2
Review of the Literature
Introduction
The review of the literature begins with a look at today’s students and how they
differ from previous generations. Topics in this chapter include how students are using
digital resources for learning and how copyright law has been crafted to provide a legal
way for students to build on the copyrighted works of others through a provision o f the
law called the fair use doctrine. The evolution of copyright law to include digital
resources will be examined as will the need for educators to help students use digital
materials legally and ethically.
Students of the 21st Century
The exposure of children to technology begins shortly after birth, with
preschoolers using technology to play online games, send emails to family members and
watch movies (Rosen, 2010, p. 26). By the time they begin school, today’s children have
mastered the use of video games and digital video. They can e-mail their grandparents,
Google a topic on the internet, play online games, and watch movies (Rosen, 2010, p.
26). Prensky (2001a) has named today’s children Digital Natives. They have never
known a world without the internet, cell phones, television, and pervasive digital video
and digital audio recordings.
Digital Natives have different learning styles and exhibit differences in brain
function from the generations before them (Prensky, 2001b; Rosen, 2010). Jukes et al.
(2010, p. 13) discovered that the evolution in brain function permits today’s students to

13

multitask, and to immerse themselves in digital worlds that are as real to them as the real
world is to older adults. Scientists have found that more students today are visual or
visual kinesthetic learners, the learning modalities that mesh best with digital content
(Jukes et al. 2010, p. 28).
In addition to accessing digital content created by others, Lenhart (2007) found
that 64 % of students between the ages of twelve and seventeen are content creators,
using social network sites like Facebook and MySpace to post this new content. Rosen
(2010 p. 39) found that teenagers visit social web sites to blog, post digital photos, play
music, join groups, and talk with people. These differences in students today in
comparison to previous generations are causing a “gap in understanding that is a huge
problem for educators” (Jukes et al. 2010, p. 10).
Changes in how students learn.
Speak Up 2009’s survey results (2009, p. 2) show that students are taking
responsibility for their own education. Students are finding and using the digital
resources they feel best meet their needs. No longer are teachers and school-supplied
textbooks enough for today’s students. Instead, students leverage technology tools and
resources to supplement or replace learning experiences at school (Jukes et al. 2010,
pp.36-37; Rosen, 2010, pp.16-17). Students are using technological devices to exchange
ideas and to explore subjects of personal and curricular interest (Jukes et al. 2010, pp. 1314). As an extension of learning at school, students use digital resources to test their
knowledge on a topic being studied in school. When students need additional help to
understand a topic or concept, they turn to digital tools to connect with other students and

14

experts who can help them. Raine (2007) found that “The young access information and
media different ways and they are more in control of their media and search experiences”
(p. 13). Students use podcasts and digital videos to assist with school work or to develop
a knowledge base about topics of personal interest.
Recent studies have affirmed the changes in the way students learn in the digital
age (Prensky, 2010; Jukes et al., 2010; Rosen, 2010). Students today demand to be active
learners, engaged in and shaping how and what they learn (Prensky 2010, p. 4). This is
perhaps the most important shift in instructional roles, and one which teachers should
keep firmly in mind. Prensky (2001a) reports that college graduates today have played
video games for more than 10,000 hours, but have spent less than 5,000 hours reading.
Further, Prensky (2001a) states that “today’s students think and process information
fundamentally differently from their predecessors”. In the past, printed text provided the
basis of classroom instruction, with images and movies used to reinforce the text. Today,
most students begin with visual learning as they watch live TV feeds from around the
globe or check out YouTube for the latest video postings about current events (Jukes et
al., 2010, p.l 14). Today’s students are frequently teaching themselves using different
techniques and nontraditional materials.
Students now process information in a hypertext-like fashion, are able to easily
multi-task ( Rosen, 2010, p.91), have the ability to visualize multi-dimensional space, and
use inductive discovery, all skills that are a different blend o f developed mental abilities
than those of past students (Prensky, 2001b). These are physiological differences in brain

15

function that need to be considered when developing teaching materials and instructional
strategies for students (Jukes et al., 2010, p. 37).
Teachers now need to look much farther than traditional textbooks to teach
students in ways that will maximize student learning. Most textbooks put the content
first rather than questions about the content (Prensky, 2010, p. 16). This is a reversal of
the learning process when teachers use constructivist or problem-based instructional
techniques.
Technology Standards
The development of technology standards for students is one necessary
component of educational reform to change teaching practice to meet the needs of
today’s students. The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) released
its current student technology standards (NETS-S) in 2007 (ISTE, 2007). ISTE
technology standards for students include collaboration and communication with others;
creation of new knowledge, products and processes; the ability to research, evaluate
information, and apply the results of the research to solve problems and make informed
decisions; and the ethical and legal use of digital resources.
The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) also developed
teacher technology standards (ISTE, 2008) and administrator technology standards
(ISTE, 2009). Teacher technology standards were first released by ISTE in 2000, with
refreshed teacher standards released in 2008. Administrator technology standards were
first released by ISTE in 2002 and refreshed in 2009. To help students meet ISTE’s
technology standards for students, school leaders, principals, and teachers should also

16

meet their respective ISTE technology standards. The rather short technology standards
refresh cycle for education professionals emphasizes the importance of technology
literacies to our students. The need for educators to model the ethical and legal use o f
digital resources is prominent in ISTE standards, indicating that knowledge about or
access to a librarian who is knowledgeable about copyright, fair use and intellectual
property is useful to all educators.
The NETs for Teachers (ISTE, 2008) promote the inclusion of digital resources
for both instruction to students and assessment of student learning. Digital resources
allow teachers to provide content in different ways to reach students who learn best in
different modalities, and to provide opportunities for students to use authentic
assessments to display their understanding of course content
Use of digital content by students
The conclusions from Speak Up 2009 include the use of digitally rich content
constructed by students for learning and assessment, the rise o f social-based learning to
work collaboratively with others, and un-tethered learning to move beyond the traditional
classroom (Speak Up, 2009, p. 3). Students today are demanding to be in charge o f their
own learning. When questioned about how they learn on their own, students report that
they use technology tools that they select to communicate and collaborate with others
(Speak Up, 2009). Students reveal they are using digital resources for school to complete
writing assignments, create slideshows, videos, and web pages, as well as playing
educational games, and uploading assignments to a school portal. Students also indicate
their non-school use of technology tools includes uploading and downloading internet

17

content, participating in online games, creating and modifying digital media, sharing
resources, and contributing to a wiki (Speak Up, 2009). This reinforces the importance
of teaching students about copyright so they understand how to ethically and legally use
content they discover online. Not surprisingly, when parents were polled about their
concerns regarding their child’s internet use, only 22 percent indicated they were
concerned about copyright issues (Speak Up 2009, p. 13).
The inclusion of digital multi-media as instructional resources is useful in every
subject area. The rapid changes in accepted knowledge in many subject areas are first
reported and recorded in digital formats, with most available on the internet or through
online databases. Using these online resources to ensure that students are being taught
with the most recent information available is paramount. Google is scanning out of print
and orphan works to make historical works available digitally that otherwise may
disappear (Boyle, 2009). These historical resources add to the volume of digital works
available to educators and students. And the key to legally using these resources for
education is having an understanding of copyright and of the fair use doctrine.
Baker (2008) noted that students who create projects without understanding
copyright and fair use often pay a price. One student who created a public service
announcement using a copyrighted image in the project won a contest. Even though that
project won first place, it could not be used publicly and the second place winner’s
project was used instead. Blue (2009) found that many companies and photographers use
digital watermarks in their images that allow them to track unauthorized users. In some

18

cases, copyright holders of these images find it more profitable to sue unauthorized users
for infringement than to sell rights to legally use the images.
Applying fair use guidelines.
Pike (2008) discussed the uncertainty about making copies o f copyrighted
materials for classroom use. While in most cases teachers are permitted to make one
copy for teaching, there is no firm rule for when it is permissible to make multiple copies
for students. Some of the guidelines developed to interpret fair use favor using the
number of words in a document as a determinant. Pike says of this practice:
Are the guidelines a “floor,” meaning that all uses within the guidelines are
fair, but that uses beyond the guidelines may also be fair, depending on the
circumstances? Or are they a ceiling, meaning that only those uses within
the guidelines are fair, and other uses are not? (Pike, 2008, p.56)
The practice of assembling a variety of sources for use in a course is murkier. Is
it fair use to assemble a digital packet of materials rather than photocopy the materials for
each student (Pike, 2008)? Pike (2008) views the emergence of the Copyright Clearance
Center and similar organizations as a way for copyright holders to collect fees even for
digital usage of materials used by students in courses.
Another important reason for understanding fair use comes from Barry Britt,
president of Soundzabound (Britt, n.d.). Soundzabound creates and licenses royalty-free
digital music to schools to provide students with a legal way to include digital music in
their projects. Britt says:

19

If you are working in education and you’re a teacher or an educator, we have a
responsibility to teach copyright from a legal perspective and from an ethical
perspective. I think it is a real shame whenever someone who works in a
particular field has violations in that field (Britt, n.d.).
Hobbs, Jaszi, and Aufderheide (2007) found that while teachers did seek out the
school librarian for advice about copyright, they sometimes felt that librarians were the
“copyright police”. Other teachers reported that librarians and other educators who
provided guidance about copyright and fair use were seen as placing barriers to fair use.
Librarians reported that they did not like to be viewed as enforcers of copyright law,
which may tend to limit librarian willingness to serve as a copyright resource within the
school community.
Harris (2009) offered some options for paying in advance for the ability to use
movies through Movie Licensing USA, which offers a variety of educational licensing
options. For digital music, he suggests licensing music from Soundzabound, a company
that provides affordable, royalty- free music tailored for use in educational projects. For
graphics, Harris (2009) suggests using Morguefile, which has thousands of free pictures.
The History of Copyright and Fair Use
The earliest United States copyright law appeared in 1790 (Crews, 2006), with
many additions and changes made to the law over time. To be copyrighted, a work must
be tangible such as a book, periodical, DVD, CD, computer program or similar work. A
work must meet three conditions to be granted a copyright:

20

the work must be original; it must be a work of authorship (including literary,
musical, dramatic, choreographic, pictorial, graphic, sculptural, and architectural
works, motion pictures and other audiovisual works, and sound recordings); and it
must be fixed in a tangible medium (Lipinski, 2006, p. xxviii).
Copyright gave six basic rights to the copyright holder (Russell, 2004). These
included the right to reproduce the work, to create derivative works, to distribute the
works (rental, lease or sale), to perform the works publicly, to display the works publicly,
and, for sound recordings, to perform the work via digital audio transmission.
First sale doctrine.
Henderson (2006) clarified the relationship between librarians and copyright:
“Libraries are creatures of the historical and statutory balance in copyright law. Libraries
lend materials based on the first sale doctrine, which limits the rights of a copyright
holder to control how a copyrighted work is used after the initial legal purchase o f the
work (Lipinski, 2006, p. 323). Libraries share materials and archive works under specific
provisions for libraries. This need to understand copyright is fundamental to the role that
librarians play in obtaining and lending materials to library patrons. Henderson (2006)
elaborated on this relationship: “Because of their institutional roles, librarians and their
associations pay close attention to that balance and to the need to promote users' rights as
well as creators' rights”. This close relationship with copyright law makes school
librarians a logical choice to provide copyright guidance to students, teachers, and
administrators (Pressman, 2008).

21

Fair use amendment.
The fair use amendment, a change to United States Copyright Law, provided a
legal venue for the use of copyrighted materials for the purpose of education. Developed
in 1976, fair use is intentionally vague in describing specifically what is considered fair
use (Lee, 2006). Instead, the law included four factors that must be considered to
determine whether use of copyrighted material is fair use: purpose of the use, nature o f
the material, the amount of the material used, and the effect on the market (American
Library Association, 2006). These factors are examined by courts when deciding a claim
for copyright infringement. Lyons (2010) reported that some literature describes a fifth
factor, good faith, as an additional factor that should be used to determine if an
educational use of copyrighted material is fair use. Good faith refers to the attempts
made to acquire permission for the use and the worthy or honorable use of the
copyrighted materials in the minds o f judges deciding fair use cases. Nebulous to
provide flexibility, the only true measure of whether an educational use of copyrighted
material is fair use, is a court of law.
Fair use guidelines.
Russell (2004) and Pike (2008) cautioned that fair use and fair use guidelines are
two very different things. Guidelines are an interpretation that is not part o f the law, but
instead how someone or a group of people interpret copyright law, and as such,
guidelines do not have the force of law. There have been several sets of guidelines
produced in the twentieth century by various groups, none of which had widespread
consensus by copyright holders or found wide-spread use by educators.

22

Hobbs, Jaszi, and Aufderheide (2007) traced the origins of the various fair use
guidelines to the 1976 revision to the Copyright Act. Congressman Robert Kastenmeier
brought together publishers and educators to develop a policy to cover photocopying of
copyrighted materials for classroom use. Called the “Agreement on Guidelines for
Classroom Photocopying in Not-For-Profit Educational Institutions”, these guidelines
were included in the legislative history. While these guidelines were largely written by
publishers and were protested by educators and lawyers, the fact that these guidelines
were included in legislative history continues to give them some weight in the present
day (Hobbs et al., 2007).
Public domain materials.
Exceptions to copyright exist through materials in the public domain (Wilson,
2005, pp. 12-13). Materials in the public domain are not covered by copyright. Some
public domain materials are older, with expired copyrights, and other materials were
never copyrighted. The largest body o f public domain materials includes materials
created by employees of the United States government (Wilson, 2005, pp. 43-48).
Intellectual property.
Copyrighted works are part o f the larger family o f works called intellectual
property. In the late 1960’s, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) was
one of the first groups to use the term intellectual property to refer to “creations o f the
mind” (Dames, 2009). WIPO included inventions, literary and artistic works, and
symbols, names, images and designs used in commerce in the term “creations of the
mind” and divided intellectual property into two distinct groups: industrial property

23

(patents, trademarks, and industrial designs) and copyright (literary, artistic, creative and
aesthetic works). Dames (2009) reported that there are five forms of intellectual
property: copyright, patent, trademark, trade secrets, and licensing.
Throughout history there has been debate about whether copyrighted works
should be treated the same as tangible property (those works defined by WIPO as
“industrial property”). As the digital age arrived, the treatment of copyrighted digital
works was in question (Strickland, 2003). Treating copyrighted digital works as tangible
property would make them largely inaccessible for educators but would preserve the
rights of copyright holders (Strickland, 2003, p. 8). While this issue may never be
completely resolved, today’s copyright laws have evolved to support the concept of fair
use but to also preserve many of the rights o f the copyright holder (Dames, 2009; ALA,
2006).
Changes to copyright law.
Additional changes to copyright law have extended the length of copyright and
tried to provide copyright protection to the new mediums of the digital age (American
Library Association, 2011). The Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act of 1998 extended
copyright protections to life of the creator plus seventy additional years. The Digital
Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA) attempted to update copyright law for
digital resources. The DMCA made it illegal to circumvent, disable, or remove copy
protection measures of digital media, significantly increased penalties for copyright
infringement on the internet, and, possibly most importantly, created a safe harbor for

24

internet sites that unknowingly have third parties post works containing copyrighted
materials without permission from the copyright holder (Band and Schruers, 2002).
While very little of the DMCA directly impacted education, the safe harbor
provision provided the protection necessary for the rise o f Web 2.0 providers such as
Flickr, WordPress, and YouTube. If Web 2.0 companies actively monitor their sites and
have policies in place that promptly remove copyrighted materials after a claim of
infringement by a copyright holder, the companies themselves cannot be held liable for
the infringement (Band and Schruers, 2002).
Seidenberg (2009) reported that The Prioritizing Resources and Organization for
intellectual Property Act of 2008 (PRO-IP) made the government partly responsible for
copyright enforcement. PRO-IP also provided funds for investigating copyright
infringement to local, state, and federal authorities. Empowering law enforcement with
the right to seize property that might be engaged in some aspect of copyright
infringement, PRO-IP was a powerful tool that could serve to tip the balance of power in
favor of copyright holders.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has been very active in
the enforcement of copyright for digital music (Bender & Wang, 2009; Strickland, 2003,
pp. 8-11). Early litigation for copyright infringement was directed at individuals, often
the result of individuals downloading music from file sharing web sites (Smith & Fowler,
2011, Strickland, 2003, p 10). More recently, The RIAA has been working with Internet
Service Providers to locate individuals illegally downloading and sharing digital music
(RIAA, 2009). Madden and Lenhart (2003, p. 4) found that students were more likely to

25

download music than other groups and that four out of five full-time students say they are
unconcerned about copyright (Madden, 2003, p. 6).
The law with the most impact on education in the 21st century is the Technology,
Education, and Copyright Harmonization Act of 2002 (Dames, 2005, Strickland, 2004,
pp. 22-23). Also known as the TEACH Act, this legislation sets in place the ability of
teachers to use copyrighted materials in distance education on web sites that are secured
with access limited to students enrolled in the course and only available for the period of
time that students needed access to the materials. By following the stipulations o f the
law, educators could use copyrighted works much like they would in a physical
classroom. The TEACH Act did not, however, extend to web sites used by teachers to
post materials when the teacher was only engaged in face-to-face instruction with
students (Dames, 2005, pp. 27-28).
The Development of Fair Use Guidelines
There have been numerous attempts to develop a set o f limits or guidelines to help
educators determine what constitutes the fair use of materials in their classroom. One list
of guidelines came out of the Conference on Fair Use (CONFU) in 1998. CONFU first
brought together stakeholders in 1994 (copyright holders of music, art, software, movies,
etc.) with the purpose of developing a guide that provides standards of use for digital
resources (Lehman, 1998, p. 6). It is important to note that not every organization or
company that owns and/or sells copyrighted works attended CONFU nor does every
organization agree with the standards developed by CONFU. Noted by the group was the
historical practice of considering the amount of the item used as a basis for fair use. The

26

amount of the copyrighted material used for education is only one o f the four factors
examined when determining if an educational use is fair use. At its conclusion three
years later, CONFU’s final report included fair use guidelines for use o f digital
multimedia and a proposal for fair use guidelines for digital images and some aspects of
distance learning. At most, CONFU brought more attention, if not wide-spread
agreement, to the issue of fair use.
Several sets of guidelines have been developed and widely circulated in
educational circles over the years. One set of guidelines that can be found in many
classrooms was published in Technology and Learning in 2002 (Davidson, 2002). These
guidelines rely heavily on using only part of a material as the basis for fair use.
The most recent attempt at providing a set of fair use guidelines for educators
came about through the Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Media Literacy Education
(Center for Social Media, 2008). Developed through meetings in ten cities, this effort
brought together educators to discuss specific situations in which copyrighted materials
were used by teachers and/or students (Center for Social Media, 2008). The participants
then discussed the situation and decided if the use of materials was fair use. The data
from these meetings was then reviewed by a group of legal experts and finally was
adopted by several organizations that represent musicians, artists, writers, teachers,
librarians and other stakeholders.
Differing from CONFU by the inclusion of focus groups that began the discussion
of fair use, the Code of Best Practices (Center for Social Media, 2008) identified five
principles that represent the media literacy education community’s current consensus

27

about acceptable practices for the fair use of copyrighted materials. Rather than using the
amount of the original copyrighted work as a basis for determining fair use, The Code of
Best Practices examines how and why the material is being used in determining if the use
is fair use. Those five principles include:
1. Employing copyrighted material in media literacy lessons.
2. Employing copyrighted materials in preparing curriculum materials.
3. Sharing media literacy curriculum materials.
4. Student use of copyrighted materials in their own academic and creative work.
5. Developing audiences for student work.
Applying Fair Use to Teaching and Learning
There is much at stake as educators and the business communities debate the
meaning of fair use. Crews (2006) argued that any guidelines developed for fair use tend
to misinterpret fair use, define narrow confines o f use that may be more restrictive than
the law provides, and lack the flexibility that is inherent in copyright law. Hobbs (2009)
believed that the key to fair use is transformation of the copyrighted material into some
new, changed material. Books and articles published to help educators navigate through
the complex fair use provisions often specify some percentage of a work, or use a similar
test to help educators determine fair use. All of these tests or percentages o f use are not
part of the law, but interpretation o f the law or guidelines. In addition to educational
uses, the use of copyrighted works for critique, commentary, or news reporting is also
fair use. The only point on which all copyright experts agree is that the only real test of

28

fair use is decided by a judge in a courtroom when a copyright holder contests the use of
their work as fair use.
Some educators, afraid o f the ramifications and possible legal action that misuse
of copyrighted materials can bring, avoid using copyrighted resources in their teaching
other than those purchased by their employer. The complexity of applying fair use is
perceived as so burdensome that some teachers chose to avoid the inclusion of
supplemental materials that would require them to determine whether their use is fair use
(Hobbs, 2010, p. 7). One infringement claim involved the use of copyrighted videos on
UCLA’s online courses (Laster, 2010). As a result of the claim, the University has
stopped posting videos on its course sites, a significant loss to students at that university.
Crews (2006) indicated that good faith attempts at making a studied decision that a
specific educational use of a copyrighted work is fair use will be helpful if a fair use is
ever challenged. Band (2007) believed that the courts are in support of fair use, and
discusses three 21st century court cases in which fair use was upheld. Russell (2004)
encouraged librarians to actively apply fair use and to practice determining if a particular
use is fair use. This practice may prove helpful for school librarians who constantly work
with teachers and students.
Teacher understanding of copyright law.
Hobbs, Jaszi, and Aufderheide (2007) found that teachers had a wide range of
understanding about copyright. Teacher sources of information about copyright included
other educators, peers, professional conferences, films and documentaries, web sites, and
copyright books. While educators were aware of fair use guidelines, most did not

29

understand that guidelines were not part of the law, how guidelines were developed or
their limited applicability. Educators had even less of an understanding of the concept of
fair use (Hobbs et al., 2007), often confusing it with citing information. Some educators
apply restrictions to fair use that are not evident in the law. Others interpret fair use too
expansively, believing there are no restrictions on materials used in their classroom and
not attempting to justify fair use by consideration of the four factors.
Works considered in the public domain are those which were never copyrighted
(most government works and facts), or those works whose copyrights have expired.
Public domain works are not subject to copyright and can be freely used by anyone for
any reason. Determining if copyright has expired or has been renewed can also be
complicated, although guides and web sites exist to help educators and librarians
determine if a work is in the public domain. Much as they have difficulty determining
fair use, teachers also have difficulty determining if a work is in the public domain.
Open source movement.
A growing trend in the software industry is the open source movement. Open
source software is available to everyone to use, modify, and improve (Garcia-Penalvo,
Garcia de Figuerola, & Merlo, 2010, p. 523). One significant application, OpenOffice, is
an open source version of Microsoft Office. The open source movement is a backlash
from the exorbitant licensing fees charged by many commercial software companies for
their programs. Garcia-Penalvo et al. (2010) report that the OpenCourseWare (OCW)
Initiative was designed to make the materials used in some online courses available to

30

anyone for free. MIT has made available through OCW courses on almost every subject
taught at MIT (Garcia-Penalvo, 2010, p. 526).
Copyleft, a type of licensing used in the GNU General Public License (GNU
GPL), is a way of regulating the redistribution, modification and development of
computer software outside the realm of traditional copyright protections (GNU, 2010).
Copyleft software cannot be copyrighted and made private. Anyone using GNU GPL
code to improve commercial software applications must make their improved version of
the commercial software available to the other developers as free, open source software.
The impact of GNU GPL is evident in such products as the Linux operating system, and
provides a means for students to develop or modify software by building on the existing
open source code.
Copyright permissions.
Asking permission to use copyrighted works is an additional choice for educators.
But that can become problematic. Brooks (2009) described two copyrights that apply to
sound recordings. One applies to the music (or text) and another to the actual, specific
recording itself. Recordings made before 1923 are in the public domain, but those
created beginning in 1923 are almost certainly copyrighted. Depending on the specific
recording, up to four separate permissions might be needed in order to use the work.
Frankel (2009) provided educators with easily understood copyright concepts that are
relevant to the use of music in education. Especially helpful was Frankel’s (2009)
discussion of how to use new musical technologies in the classroom without violating
copyright. The practice of file sharing to share music with others has led to expensive

31

litigation for those who illegally share music. The Recording Industry Association of
America has been very active in locating and suing those who use music file sharing
services (Bender & Wang, 2009). This makes it essential that teachers educate their
students about how to legally manage personal music libraries.
The use of digital multimedia for education can be limited by technology
protection measures. While a teacher may cue a videotape to the spot they wished to use
with a class, the same feature is not available for DVD. Kasprowski (2010) noted that
digital rights management (DRM) can restrict the ability to copy, email, view remotely,
break a whole work into smaller segments, print, or save content. While legislation has
been introduced to allow educational entities the right to break technology protection
measures to use portions o f digital multimedia in the classrooms, no legal means exists
for K-12 educators to do so (Kasprowski, 2010). Abah (2004) compares fair use of print
materials with fair use of digital materials. While reproduction of printed materials is
allowed for purposes such as critique, comment, research, and teaching, there is no
uniform or legal way to copy all digital materials. The inability to duplicate digital
materials for educational use may become a serious problem for educators and
researchers.
Written works created by authors are often copyrighted by a publisher rather than
the author. If a second person created cover art and/or illustrations for the work, the artist
could conceivably hold a second copyright for the work, or the publisher could be the
copyright holder of the art works. Determining who to approach for permission to use

32

copyrighted works can be difficult to impossible. However, if the request for permission
is not answered, the copyrighted work cannot be used unless fair use can be claimed.
Alternatives to copyright.
Much as the open source movement provides an alternative to sharing software
outside of traditional copyright, there are organizations which offer an alternative to
copyright. Creative Commons is one of the most well-known. Russell (2004) has
published a copyright manual under a Creative Commons license. Creative Commons
licensing offers several levels of licensing that an author or creator can use. The least
restrictive license is “Attribution”, which allows others to copy, display, distribute, or
perform the original work and to create derivative works based on the original by giving
credit to the copyright holder in the manner requested. “Share Alike” licensing requires
that derivative works must be shared under the same license as the original work. “NonCommercial” licensing allows others to copy, display, distribute, or perform the original
work and to create derivative works based on the original only for non-commercial uses.
And, finally, “No Derivative Works”, means that others can copy, display, distribute, or
perform the original work but only exactly as it was originally created.
Conservative and liberal copyright advice.
Three copyright specialists who write columns and articles in school librarian
journals provide very conservative copyright advice based on fair use guidelines.
Simpson’s copyright guide (2005) is widely used by school librarians and provides
advice that follows copyright guidelines created by Davidson. Her advice includes using
only specified portions of copyrighted materials. Russell’s (2004) copyright guide is also

33

based on fair use guidelines rather than relying on the vague fair use doctrine as the basis
of copyright advice she provides for school librarians. Butler (2009) has also written a
guide that leans heavily on fair use guidelines. Copyright scholar Crews believes that
guidelines provide restrictions that may become de facto law if they are widely used.
Crews (2006) encourages educational institutions to develop their own copyright policies.
Hobbs (2010) believes that there are very few educational uses of copyrighted materials
that are not fair use.
Hobbs (2010) contended that media publishers have an interest in creating
restrictive guidelines that severely limit the educational fair use of commercial media in
the classroom and work to the financial advantage of the publishers. Because a great deal
of confusion exists about what specifically constitutes fair use, many educators either do
not use copyrighted materials or severely restrict the use of copyrighted materials in their
classrooms. Hobbs (2010) believes one key to fair use is transforming copyrighted
materials into something new. What is not clear, however, is exactly what must be
changed to transform a copyrighted material into a new work.
The School Librarian Role in Providing Copyright Advice
Simpson (2005a) wrote Copyright Catechism to help librarians answer copyright
questions and to “convince reluctant educators that their erroneous assumptions about
common educational practices are incorrect”. Containing questions sent to Simpson from
practicing school librarians, Copyright Catechism was designed to serve as a “starting
point for discussion and consideration” (Simpson, 2005a, p viii) but not the final answer
for each question. Simpson (2005a), Crews (2006), and Russell (2004) made note that

34

their works do not contain legal advice and that librarians with specific concerns should
consult with the school district solicitor for legal advice if necessary.
Russell (2004) said that because librarians help patrons locate and use
information, they need to understand copyright law and fair use. Copyright laws also
help define the role of libraries in providing information. The acts of loaning library
books, making photocopies of information, and the archiving of information are all
possible because of copyright law (Russell, 2004; p. xiii). Russell acknowledged that
copyright law is complex, a reason why librarians may choose to avoid dealing with
copyright and fair use if at all possible. Simpson (2005b) pointed out that because
copyright and intellectual property courses are not required in law school, some school
district solicitors give copyright advice that is inaccurate even when considering the
broadest application of copyright law.
Butler (2009) acknowledged that while the ease o f duplication gives some
educators the belief that what they are doing is legal, it is likely a librarian or another
teacher who will become aware of copyright violations. Over the years, Butler (2009)
found that a concern most frequently expressed by educators is that they do not wish to
become the copyright police. Indeed, Butler indicated it can be an uncomfortable
experience to correct a colleague or administrator who violates copyright. As a member
o f the instructional team, the school librarian often gives copyright advice that is not
welcome. Tom between providing the resources needed by teachers and preventing
teachers from violating copyright, the librarian can be seen as “not having the best
interests of the school and students at heart” (Butler, 2009, p. 2).

35

Summary
While copyright laws are complicated and continually evolving, educators have
been granted significant rights to use copyrighted material under fair use. The shift to
digital resources makes exponentially more resources available to teachers than were
available in the years before the internet. While some educators and some schools are
reluctant to test the bounds of fair use, not using a variety of copyrighted materials
deprives teachers o f resources to use while teaching and deprives students of additional
resources to help them learn. What is essential to school leaders, principals, teachers, and
students is accurate, local, and readily available advice on copyright and fair use. School
librarians have traditionally provided this advice, but there is an absence of research
about copyright and fair use compliance in K-12 education. This study sought to
determine if school librarians today perceive this advisory role as one of their
professional responsibilities and if they have the knowledge base to provide accurate
advice to their students, teachers, and administrators.

Chapter Three
Methodology
Introduction
This study investigated the perceptions of Pennsylvania school librarians in regard
to their role in advising students, teachers, and administrators about copyright,
intellectual property, and the fair use o f copyrighted materials for teaching and learning.
The study examined the characteristics of librarians in regard to their educational
background, work experience, type of schools served, and their current knowledge of
common K-12 school copyright scenarios. How frequently librarians were asked about
copyright was investigated as was whether or not librarians taught students and faculty
about copyright. The self-rated comfort levels of librarians in providing copyright
guidance to various members of the school were also examined.
In this chapter, the research design, the study participants, the procedures used in
the study, and data analysis will be discussed. An overview of the study design and why
it was selected will be presented. How participants for the study were recruited will be
discussed in depth, and the instrumentation used to collect data will be described in
detail. The questions asked in this study are:
1. What are Pennsylvania school librarians’ perceptions about their role in
providing copyright and fair use advice to students, teachers, and
administrators?
2. How do school librarians learn about current laws and trends in the use of
copyrighted materials for education?

37

3. Is there a pattern between the number of years o f experience of a school
librarian and their knowledge about basic copyright situations that occur in
schools?
4. What resources do librarians use to answer copyright questions posed by
students, teachers, and administrators?
Research Design
This study used a qualitative research model to collect and analyze data.
Qualitative research can be used to obtain a complete picture of a process or situation
(Fraenkal & Wallen, 2009, p. 421). Qualitative research allows the researcher to collect
data directly from study participants (Ayiro, 2012, p. 19). Beginning with a social or
human problem, qualitative research involves the study of a problem, the collection o f
data, and the discovery o f themes of patterns in the data (Creswell, 2007, p. 37). Using
inductive data analysis techniques, a researcher using a qualitative research model can
discover patterns and themes in the data that emerges through study (Ayiro, 2012 p. 20).
This study provided evidence o f how many librarians were asked questions about
copyright, and how often they had answers for those questions. But this was only a part
of the complete picture. Exactly where librarians found the knowledge they needed about
copyright and how they discovered the resources that provided them with the best basic
information as well as continual updates as copyright law changes were also of interest.
To delve into these topics, interviews were used to reveal the specific resources librarians
used to answer copyright questions. A qualitative study allowed the questions for this
research study to be thoroughly investigated.

38

Cross-sectional survey.
A cross-sectional survey was used to collect data from Pennsylvania K-12 school
librarians. Survey research is useful when the data needed should come directly from
members of the group being studied (Fink, 2009). Survey research is used to gather
information about a large group o f people on a specific topic and to determine how the
members of this group of people are distributed around one or more variables (Fraenkel
and Wallen, 2009). Barribeau et al. (2005) say that survey research is the best research
method to use when seeking to describe a particular population. Further, Barribeau et al.
(2005) indicate that electronic surveys have a higher return rate than either paper surveys
or interviews.
Babbie (1990) asserts that in addition to describing a population, a survey can be
useful in explaining differences within the population. When used to explain differences
in a population, survey data requires multivariate analysis to examine two or more
variables. Fink (2009) indicates that surveys can be used to gather data about people’s
beliefs and perceptions. Survey data can also be used to evaluate programs and to decide
on policy (Fink, 2009). Patton (2002) indicates that researchers use qualitative research
methods such as interviews of research subjects to discover things that cannot be
observed in real-time.
Telephone interview.
For this study ten librarians were interviewed via phone. The phone interviews
provided additional details about how librarians learned about copyright and fair use.
While it isn’t possible to observe the in-service activities of school librarians, we can,

39

through interview, determine what types of professional development activities were
devoted to learning about copyright and fair use as well as how effective librarians found
these professional development activities in providing the information librarians needed
to feel comfortable answering copyright questions. School librarians must attend many
professional development sessions throughout their professional career to maintain their
Pennsylvania teaching certificate. Who provides the professional development and
whether much of the professional development deals with copyright and fair use are o f
interest to the researcher as the providers of copyright advice are not always copyright
experts. Also of interest were the resources commonly used by librarians to answer
copyright questions. Did librarians use up-to-date printed manuals or online resources?
Did librarians count on professional organizations such as the American Library
Association (ALA) to provide resources for answering questions about copyright and fair
use?
Participants
This study surveyed K-12 school librarians throughout the entire state of
Pennsylvania to gather their perceptions about their role in assisting all members of their
school in compliance with copyright law. Participants who were included in the study
were certified as highly-qualified Library Media Specialists who held a Pennsylvania
Library Media Specialist certificate issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Education
(PDE). The online survey was completed by 184 librarians.
School librarians in Pennsylvania may hold an undergraduate and/or a graduate
degree in library science. A large number o f school librarians hold an undergraduate

40

degree in either elementary education or a subject area such as English, mathematics or
science as well as a graduate degree in library science. Pennsylvania has two state
universities that have Master’s degree programs geared specifically for teachers who
already possess a teaching certificate. Two universities have undergraduate and graduate
degree programs in library science. Three additional universities offer graduate degrees
in library science or information science. Three universities offer certificate programs for
K-12 library media specialists.

During the past decade, a number of Pennsylvania educators have entered the
field of school librarianship by passing the subject area PRAXIS® exam for library
science. Any person who holds a Pennsylvania teaching certificate may obtain a library
media specialist certificate simply by taking and passing the Library Media Specialist
PRAXIS® exam. By default, anyone who has a Pennsylvania Library Media Specialist

41

Certificate and does not have a degree or a certificate in library science has entered the
profession through passing the PRAXIS® exam. The degrees held by Pennsylvania
librarians who participated in the study are shown in Table 1.

Grade levels served by librarians

Librarians may serve more than one school and more than one level (elementary,
middle, or high school). Less common are librarians who serve as both a school librarian
and a public librarian in a facility that is both part of the school district and a community
library. The vast majority of librarians who participated in this study, 155, work in only
one school. Twenty two librarians reported they work in two schools, two librarians
reported they work in three schools, and five librarians work in more than three schools.
The grade levels of students served by librarians in the study varied, with 4 librarians

42

serving students in grades K-12 and two librarians served both elementary and high
school students. Over sixty percent of the librarians reported they served secondary
students. The grade levels served are shown in Table 2.
Participants included school librarians who served public, parochial, and other K12 day schools, as well as school librarians who served K-12 boarding schools, and
charter schools. All participants worked in K-12 schools that were physically located

Procedure
The researcher reviewed several digital survey tools and selected SurveyMonkey
to be used for this study because it provided a great deal of flexibility in developing
questions and provided some data analysis tools. The researcher constructed the survey
for this study using SurveyMonkey and asked three non-librarian colleagues to proof the
survey for accuracy of spelling and readability.
Next, the researcher recruited several school librarian leaders from across the
country at the 2011 ISTE conference. These librarians agreed to pilot the survey to
ensure that the questions were clear and focused on the research area. Intentionally, the
librarians completing the pilot survey only included librarians from outside Pennsylvania
who could not be a part of the research group. O f the selected pilot group, five librarians
completed the survey and provided feedback to the researcher. The research instrument
was then reviewed by the researcher and edited to finalize the content and survey
directions. A copy of the survey instrument is included in Appendix E.
The researcher obtained permission from the President of PSLA and the Director
of the Bureau of Library Development in the Pennsylvania Department of Education to
post an e-mail on the PSLA and the Schools electronic mailing lists advertising the study
and including a link to the survey. Emails granting permission are included in
Appendices C and D. Because this study uses human subjects, the next step was the
completion of the Widener University Institutional Review Board Application to obtain
approval to conduct the study. Approval for the study was granted on April 15, 2012.
The approval letter is shown in Appendix A.

44

Pennsylvania school librarians learned about the study through their membership
in one or both electronic mailing lists devoted to Pennsylvania school librarians and
school librarianship. The Schools electronic mailing list is provided by the Pennsylvania
Department of Education. Every Pennsylvania K-12 school librarian is invited to join the
Schools electronic mailing list. Susan Pannebaker, the Director of Library Development,
Pennsylvania Department of Education, estimates that about 650 librarians are members
of the Schools electronic mailing list (Pannebaker, 2011). The other electronic mailing
list is provided by the Pennsylvania School Librarians Association (PSLA). Any school
librarian who joins PSLA is automatically added to the electronic mailing list if they
provide an e-mail address on their membership application. PSLA leadership estimates
that about 700 librarians are part of the PSLA electronic mailing list. While there is
overlap between the two electronic mailing lists, the membership is not identical.
The researcher prepared an e-mail announcement explaining the study and asking
for participants (see Appendix B). The researcher posted the first e-mail advertising the
study on April 23, 2012, a Monday. Two follow-up reminders were sent on April 30,
2012, and May 7, 2012, the two subsequent Mondays. The survey closed three weeks
after it was first advertised, on May 14, 2012.
Instrumentation
Online survey.
The main instrument used in this study was an online survey containing 29
questions designed by the researcher. A copy of the survey is shown in Appendix E. The
researcher utilized question formats including multiple choice and true or false in this

45

study’s copyright survey. Before beginning the online survey, librarians were shown the
informed consent document. They were given the opportunity to read and print (if they
desired) the informed consent document. Librarians had to agree to the terms of
informed consent before they were given access to the online survey questions. Two
hundred and twelve librarians viewed the informed consent document and 210 of those
librarians agreed to the terms and advanced to the survey questions. O f those 210
librarians who started the survey, 184 completed the entire survey. Librarians completing
the online survey were anonymous.
Survey questions.
The survey included questions about professional certifications held, college
degrees earned, years of experience, and types of school populations served by
Pennsylvania’s school librarians. Questions about the librarians’ perceptions regarding
their role and their comfort level with providing copyright advice to the various members
o f their school were included. The final section of the survey consisted of a series of ten
questions designed to measure the extent of the school librarian’s knowledge about
copyright and fair use, and about applying fair use to specific situations commonly
encountered in the K-12 school setting. A comment box following each questions
allowed librarians to elaborate on their answers to the quiz. The comment data was also
reviewed by the researcher.
Survey quiz questions.
The quiz questions reflected common topics covered in several prominent
educational copyright guides (Simpson, 2005B; Russell, 2004), and on educational

46

copyright web sites (Crews, 2011; Hoon, 2007). Copyright questions featured in
professional journals for school librarians were also analyzed, and key topics were
incorporated into the researcher’s copyright quiz. Simpson (2005) divides copyright
topics into chapters that provide insight into the areas of copyright and fair use that are of
particular interest to school librarians. Russell (2004) similarly covers topics of
importance to school librarians. Russell, in her position as Copyright Specialist for the
American Library Association, has met and talked to thousands of librarians about
copyright to help her understand the copyright needs and concerns o f librarians.
Technology guru Davidson (2002) compiled a survey about copyright and fair use that
provides additional expertise in determining the areas of great importance in educational
copyright. Crews (2011) and Hoon (2007) provided an academic view of copyright
topics of interest to higher education faculty members and students.
Invitation to participate in interview.
At the conclusion of the online survey, librarians were asked to e-mail the
researcher if they were willing to be interviewed by phone. Those librarians who were
willing to be interviewed by phone were asked to send an e-mail to the researcher
indicating they were willing to be interviewed, their name and phone number, and the
best time for them to receive a call for the interview.
Interviewee selection.
Sixteen librarians sent an e-mail to the researcher and agreed to participate in a
phone interview. An informed consent form for the telephone interview was sent to those
sixteen respondents. The first ten who returned the consent form were interviewed

47

through a phone call during May and June 2012. Librarians who participated in the
phone survey were asked questions to provide greater detail about their copyright
knowledge including which resources the librarians used to keep current with changes in
copyright law and how they selected those resources. Next librarians were asked about
the resources they used to help answer copyright questions including the age and cost of
these resources. Additional questions focused on how librarians learned about changes in
copyright law and if they had preferences for specific types o f professional development
about copyright. Finally librarians were asked which resources they used to answer
copyright questions. Phone interviews were audiotaped by the researcher and transcribed
for accuracy. The researcher constructed a coding system that was used to analyze the
phone interview data. A copy of the informed consent for the phone interviews is
included in Appendix F, the phone interview questions are contained in Appendix G and
the preliminary coding schema is contained in Appendix H.
Interview process.
These qualitative interviews contained questions to further delve into the
resources librarians use to learn about current trends and practices in the use of
copyrighted materials in teaching and learning. These resources included printed and
digital information sources along with professional development sessions. Professional
development today includes many different options for educators. Webinars, digital
video, blogs, podcasts, and other technological tools allow educators to design their own
professional development activities, and to develop a professional learning network
composed of colleagues, subject experts, and teachers from around the world. Crews

48

(2006) believes that, with study, librarians can make sense o f copyright and fair use and
thus provide support to teachers. ISTE provides a framework from which librarians can
select resources that meet their needs. Professional organizations including the
Pennsylvania School Librarians Association, the American Association of School
Librarians, and the American Library Association also provide professional development
activities and experiences that are tailored to the specific professional development needs
of school librarians. Many reference works geared to educational copyright are readily
available and may be of use to school librarians.
The authors of school librarian copyright guides, Russell (2004) and Simpson
(2005a), admit that the topic of copyright is complex and they are in support of librarians
who are helping library patrons to legally and ethically use information. As well, the
professional organizations to which school librarians belong also provide online forums,
conferences, printed books, journals, and other online content that may be used by
librarians to learn about copyright and fair use. Discovering where school librarians get
their information about copyright and which resources they tapped to find the answers to
library patrons’ questions helped determine whether librarians were using trustworthy
sources.
Data Analysis
Data was collected both through the online survey and through phone interviews.
The first two questions of the survey pertained to the informed consent document. If
librarians did not wish to participate in the study after reading the informed consent
document, the second question allowed them to exit the survey. Descriptive statistics

49

were used to analyze questions three through eleven, which asked librarians to provide
information about their professional qualifications and the type of school(s) in which they
worked. Frequencies were calculated from the responses to these questions which placed
the responses into categories. Frequency distributions were also calculated for the
responses to questions 14 through 19. These questions asked about librarian perceptions
regarding their role in providing copyright advice to the various groups within their
school(s). Frequencies were calculated for question 26, which asked who the librarian
believed was responsible for providing copyright advice within the school.
The final portion of the online survey consisted of a series of ten quiz questions
that were designed to gauge librarian knowledge about basic copyright questions that are
typically asked in K-12 schools. The number of correct responses for each respondent
was calculated along with the mean score for each group.
Data collected during the phone interviews consisted o f five open-ended
questions. The interviews were conducted using a speaker phone and were recorded with
the permission of the study participants. Those interviews were then transcribed so the
data could be more readily studied and analyzed. The interview data was analyzed using
inductive analysis. Frankel (2009, p. 424) says inductive analysis allows the researcher
to become “immersed in the details and specifics of the data to discover important
categories”. In this study, the researcher studied the interview transcripts and discovered
categories which were used to construct a coding schema. The interview data was then
separated into categories using this coding schema, which included the resources
librarians used to learn about copyright and fair use. Those resources included journals,

50

books, web sites, conferences, webinars, blogs, wikis, and colleagues as well as several
other resources. The data coding schema can be found in Appendix H.

Results
Introduction
This study examined the perceptions of Pennsylvania K-12 school librarians
regarding their role in providing copyright advice to their school’s students, teachers and
administrators and the resources they use to provide advice. Data was collected through
an anonymous online survey. Librarians who completed the survey could also volunteer
to participate in a follow-up phone interview. The study was advertised through two
electronic mailing lists devoted to K-12 school librarians in Pennsylvania during April
and May 2012. Data was gathered from 184 librarians who completed the online survey
during April and May 2012. The online survey questions can be found in Appendix E.
Additional data was gathered from ten librarians who were interviewed by phone in May
and June 2012. The interview questions can be found in Appendix G. A complete
description of the data collection methods can be found in chapter 3. The research
questions this study attempted to answer are:
1. What are Pennsylvania school librarians’ perceptions about their role in
providing copyright and fair use advice to students, teachers, and
administrators?
2. How do school librarians learn about current laws and trends in the use of
copyrighted materials for education?

52

3. Is there a pattern between the number o f years o f experience of a school
librarian and their knowledge about basic copyright situations that occur in
schools?
4. What resources do librarians use to answer copyright questions posed by
students, teachers, and administrators?
The online survey contained a series of questions designed to capture data
regarding the respondents’ perceptions about their role in providing copyright and fair
use advice to students, teachers, and administrators. These questions are grouped into
three categories: frequency of requests for copyright information, whether or not
librarians provided informational documents or conducted instruction about copyright
and fair use, and whether librarians believed it was their responsibility to provide
copyright advice to students, teachers, and administrators.
Requests for Copyright Information
Survey questions 14 through 16 were designed to examine the frequency with
which students, teachers, and administrators asked the school librarian questions about
copyright and fair use. Questions 17 through 19 were designed to gather information
about how librarians taught students and faculty about copyright and fair use. Question
26 asks librarians to identify who they believe is responsible for providing copyright
advice to students, teachers, and administrators.
R equ ests for Copyright Inform ation

Over half of the librarians (52.1%) reported they were asked for copyright
information by students at least one or two times per semester, and 78.7% of librarians

53

reported that students asked for copyright information at some time over the course o f an
entire school year. However, 21.2% of librarians reported they were never asked about
copyright by students. Student requests for copyright information are shown in Table 4.

Copyright Instruction
While it is clear that students and teachers ask the school librarian for copyright
information on an individual basis, it is also useful to determine if librarians provide
instruction about copyright to students. The Model Curriculum for PA School Library
Programs (2013) contains competencies for students in grades K-12 that include the
ethical and legal use of information, which indicates librarians should be teaching
students about copyright. When asked if they provide instruction about copyright to
students, 157 librarians (85.3%) answered yes. Also of interest is whether librarians
provide instruction or copyright information to teachers. While 30.4% of librarians (56)

55

reported they taught faculty about copyright and fair use, 141 librarians (76.6%) reported
that they provided their faculty with information about copyright and fair use.
Librarian Job Responsibility for Copyright
When asked about whether librarians believed they or some other person in their
school or school district had the responsibility for providing copyright advice, 153
librarians (83.2%) indicated that it was their job responsibility to provide copyright
advice. Four librarians (2.2%) indicated it was the responsibility of the library

reporting that providing copyright advice was a job responsibility of someone who held a

solicitor who had the responsibility of providing copyright advice, five librarians said it
was the responsibility of the building principal to provide copyright advice, and two

56

librarians said it was the job of the computer teacher to provide copyright advice. These
results are shown in Table 7.
How Librarians Learn about Copyright
How librarians keep up with current laws and trends in the educational use of
copyrighted materials was explored by looking at the professional development activities
of librarians. Questions about professional development activities were asked in the
survey as well as in the telephone interviews. Survey respondents were asked how often
they attended librarian conferences, workshops, or other trainings including webinars in
the past five years. The continual evolution of digital resources means that librarians

must keep up with copyright considerations in using even the most recent information
formats and sources. Almost all librarians had attended some professional development
activities during the past five years, with just over one percent of librarians indicating
they attended no librarian conferences, workshops, webinars or trainings. The librarian
responses are shown in Table 8.

57

Next, librarians were asked how often they attended professional development
sessions on the topic of copyright in the past five years. Professional development
activities included conferences, and workshops. Professional organizations for librarians

frequently offer webinars or trainings on the topic of copyright. And finally, there are
numerous online communities that provide professional development on the topic of
copyright. Librarians have the ability to choose from a variety of sources of professional
development about copyright, reflected in the fact that over 75% of librarians report they
have attended at least one or two professional development sessions on the topic of
copyright during the past five years. Table 9 shows the breakdown of self-reported
librarian attendance at copyright professional development sessions.

58

The ten librarians who were interviewed by telephone provided further insight
into how school librarians keep current in their knowledge about educational copyright
Six of the librarians who were interviewed reported using at least three different
sources to learn about changes in copyright law, and all but one librarian reported using
more than one information source. The most common resource used, reported by seven
librarians, was School Library Journal, the traditional journal resource for K-12
librarians. The type of resources used was typified by Participant One who stated:
“I try to read whatever is put out by the school library association [Pennsylvania
School Librarians Association], SLJ [School Library Journal] and School and
Library Media [School Library Media Quarterly] —whatever articles are in there
about copyright I try to read about copyright. I’ve been blowing them off
recently, because things are changing so rapidly. It seems like things are
changing so rapidly”.
The use of more than one source of information for changes in educational
copyright law was also noted in the response of Participant Three:
“I took classes in Wilkes in online teaching and one o f my emphases was to have
put together a little program on copyright law. I haven’t updated since then, but
most of what I used was things I got through ALA [American Library
Association], I also used things from Temple [Media Education Lab now located
at the University of Rhode Island]”.
The role of electronic mailing lists in helping librarians keep current on
educational copyright law was confirmed by five interview participants who said they use

59

these electronic mailing lists as a source of information about current copyright laws.
L MNET, an electronic mailing list used by school librarians from around the world, was
given as a resource by three librarians. Three librarians mentioned the Schools electronic
mailing list as a source of their information about current copyright law, and one librarian
mentioned the PSLA electronic mailing list as a resource. Two librarians reported using
two separate electronic mailing lists.
Two other interview participants used a less formal method of learning about
changes to educational copyright law. Participant Eight said she used the internet as her
main source of information:
Of course, you probably want to know what I look at on the internet, right? I
don’t seek it out, but I do belong to the State School Librarians’ listserv [Schools]
and anything that comes in over the listserv about copyright, I follow all the links
just because I’m interested. I also subscribe to a few newsletters and when they
mention anything about copyright, again, I follow all the links. It isn’t like I’m
actually seeking out this information, but it is something I pick up on whenever it
comes across my eyesight. I definitely received a couple of things from SLJ
[School Library Journal] and Education Week and I cannot remember what the
other one is.
Participant Seven used the most informal approach “Honestly I go on to the
internet and it only comes up if it comes up. I read SLJ [School Library Journal],
Things are in there occasionally, but other than that I just look them up”.

60

Four of the interview participants mentioned conferences as a source of
information about changes in copyright law. “I’ve attended workshops on copyright at
AASL and PSLA”, said Participant Ten. Another librarian, Participant Seven, said she
“attended a workshop at a PSLA conference a few years back. I think it was Renee
Hobbs [Founding Director of the Harrington School of Communication and Media at the
University o f Rhode Island and the Media Education Lab]”.
Print resources also play a role in helping librarians keep current on educational
copyright, with three interview participants reporting they use copyright books to learn
about educational copyright. Participant Four noted “I try to keep an eye out in case
Carol Simpson has a new copyright book”, and Participant Seven reported “purchasing
books but it has been a number of years”. Participant Ten noted “I do use [Carol]
Simpson’s book and the one from ALA [written by Carrie Russell]. I also have
[Kenneth] Crews’ book”. Both School Library Media Quarterly and School Library
Journal were mentioned as journals used by participants to leam about copyright law.
Because of the changes in copyright law in the digital age, interview participants
were asked how current a reference must be to be helpful in keeping current on
educational copyright law. Participant Seven said, “Current means a year or two old”.
Other interview participants added “It is a lot like the wild, wild West with changes,”
(Participant One) and “every couple of years I try to keep current, especially with
technology issues the way they are” (Participant Three). Participant Three also said:
“The print resources can’t be more than a few years old. I think I rely more heavily on
online resources just because they are a little more current usually. I do have things in

61

print because I think that is important”. Participant four said: “It probably depends on the
format of the item we are questioning the copyright on. There are too many things that
change that you just kind of have to figure out how to apply recommendations and fair
use guidelines”.
Interview participants were asked what types of professional development were
best to help them understand copyright law. Participant One prefers “live situations
where I can ask questions. I am anxious to get away from the computer at the end o f the
day. I prefer a lecture or a workshop”. Participant Two believes “conversations with
other people with real situations are most helpful”. Participant Five prefers “Face to face
workshops where there can be interaction”. Participant Six said:
“For me, personally, it would be the PSLA work sessions we had this last April
[at the PSLA annual conference]. They take the things that we librarians deal
with day in and day out and they are going to deal with them specifically not the
entire universe in general... you know what I’m saying?”
Participant Eight reported watching some videos over the past several years but “I
could not tell you who produced them or what they were. One was from a college library
but I don’t remember which college”. Further explaining how she learned about these
videos, Participant Eight added, “You understand this is a very casual thing. Like I say,
somehow these links show up in my e-mail and I follow every link because it is
something I want to keep abreast o f ’. While she could not remember who, specifically,
produced the videos because she did not save the links, Participant Eight did remember
that the videos online “were produced by various college libraries for the most part and

62

some from high school libraries”. Participant Three used a professional development
workshop developed by the Pennsylvania School Librarians Association to help her learn
more about copyright:
There was a course put together several years ago by PSLA that helped a lot.
Maria Cartig put it together. She was, at that time, working with ALA and the
interesting thing was that things coming out of Temple [Media Education Lab
now located at the University o f Rhode Island], which challenged or appeared to
challenge some o f what ALA was saying. You really dig deep enough it isn’t as
big a challenge as it first appears. I think that when you get back to the nature of
the law itself, they do let you build on other people’s works it is not so totally
hands off that you can’t do anything.
L ibrarian Knowledge about Copyright
Exactly what librarians know about copyright was measured using a quiz as part
o f the online survey. This quiz consisted of ten questions on topics that are typically
asked to K-12 school librarians by students, teachers, and administrators. The lowest
score on the quiz was five correct responses, with six librarians answering five of the ten
questions correctly. The highest score on the quiz was 10, with 19 librarians answering
all ten questions correctly. The breakdown of scores is shown in Table 10.

The researcher was interested in whether there was a pattern between the number
of years o f experience of a school librarians and their knowledge about basic copyright

Two groups tied for the lowest mean score of 7.79. Librarians with two to five years of
experience and librarians with more than thirty years o f experience had the lowest mean

Resources Used to Answer Copyright Questions
In addition to the resources that librarians use to keep current on educational
copyright law, they also require resources to help them answer specific copyright
questions they are posed by students, teachers and administrators. Exactly which
resources, including people, librarians use to answer copyright questions can provide
insight into how librarians arrive at decisions of fair use and copyright infringement.
People as a copyright resource
Librarians who were interviewed mentioned a number of people they would turn
to for help in answering copyright questions. Participant One recalled a professor who
taught a class she took at Slippery Rock University a few years ago who “gave us a
refresher on things that were happening in the classroom and outside as well as
plagiarism are concerned”. Participant Five named Dr. Renee Hobbs [Founding Director
of the Harrington School of Communication and Media at the University o f Rhode Island
and the Media Education Lab] as a person she would consult: “I went to one of her
workshops a few years ago and it really influenced my thinking about it a lot. The
workshop convinced me I needed to make this part of my teaching”. Participant Nine
uses the local public librarians as a resource: “I would call our local public library and
talk to them. We have a fairly good relationship with our local community library”.

65

Four interview participants named someone within their school or school district
associated with technology as one of their copyright resources. One librarian, Participant
Ten, mentioned that "our District’s Technology Coordinator knows a lot about copyright.
He can often answer questions for me. Most teachers don’t ask - they just do what they
think is right which often means they don’t consider copyright as an issue. It seems like
everyone thinks if something is posted on the internet it is available for anyone else to
use”. The role instructional advisors and technology integrators can play in helping
provide information about copyright and fair use was explained by Participant Two who
said “We have some technology integrators who are learning more about copyright”.
Another librarian, Participant Three, describes a close relationship with her technology
integrator:
I think my technology integrator stays pretty current. She and I discuss it a lot, so
I think she must be. And she does belong to some tech organizations that I think
have looked at copyright so and she also taught English for a number of years and
we work well together. We trade emails back and forth between us. Sometimes
I’ll forward things to her and she will forward to me and they include copyright.
It is one of those areas that I think a lot of librarians would like to pursue; it is just
a matter of time. I think a lot of librarians, when the teacher comes in and they
don’t know the answer, they just say I don’t know. It’s not that they don’t want to
help them or they don’t want to find it. I just don’t think they have the time to
pursue that. I know at one time there were cute little sliding things at ALA. If
there was one good place to send them ...

66

Participant Four does not have anyone else in her District to use as a copyright
resource and says:
I don’t think anyone asks too many copyright questions to be perfectly honest.
They don’t know what they don’t know. I think that many o f our teachers think if
they ignore it and don’t get caught, it is fine. When I worked outside of PA there
was mandatory training and reminders about copyright annually in each building
in South Carolina. I think encouraging something like that to happen in
individual districts and buildings would be a wise thing to do. If I notice
somebody doing something that is a violation, I make a point of telling them that I
don’t believe they are complying with copyright laws. I’ve had administrators
forward newsletters that they subscribe to as an individual that specifically say on
them that you may not forward or print and I’ve sent them emails letting them
know, but I don’t believe it changes their practice. But again, I feel it is my duty
to remind them to model ethical use for the rest of the faculty.
One librarian, Participant Six, described the lack o f additional staff members to
provide copyright expertise in the School District: “We have gotten directives from our
downtown administration and every so often the secretaries will come around and put up
the fair use copyright law things over all of our copiers, but I would not call them down
there to find out anything about copyright unless I was not of sound mind and I was out
of whatever mind I have”. Participant Two relies on other librarians in her District: “We
really don’t have many questions about copyright. We ask each other in our department”.
Another librarian, Participant Nine, reports she is the only source of copyright advice: “I

67

am the go to person and most times people would prefer to avoid asking me. They know
what I’m going to say so they don’t ask”.
When looking for answers to copyright questions posed by students, teachers or
administrators, two librarians mentioned they are never asked questions they cannot
answer. Participant Two said: “Especially being at the elementary level, there are very
few questions asked about copyright at all. What is brought up is what I bring to their
attention as opposed to someone having a question about it”. Participant Three indicated:
“Most of the questions I get are fairly simple. I am more often than not surprised
at their simplicity. It goes both ways. Sometimes people are overly cautious and
other ones it’s like I can’t believe you have been doing this for this long.
Recently, a senior teacher wanted to copy a book and I said no you can’t
photocopy a book because you can buy it. And it was actually a book that was
old enough to be in the Guttenberg project and I got it straightened out that way.
But it wasn’t a translation she liked. But you are either going to have to live with
it or fund it and buy it.
In addition to using local people as copyright resources, some school librarians
also turn to their professional electronic mailing lists: “I would probably start posting on
my listservs and see if somebody could steer me in the right direction. I’d like to tell you
I had time to go the Carnegie [Library] and start digging around myself, but I don’t”
(Participant Three).

68

Online material as a copyright resource
Four librarians reported using online resources to answer questions. Participant
One said: “When I have one, I basically look it up on the internet on library sites. ALA’s
web site. Anything that is printed, in five years it is out of date. Even MLA is constantly
changing. It is changing so much that it is difficult to keep up”. Participant Six uses a
mix of print and online resources: “If it is one I can’t answer, I have resources for that.
They are older but they are still useful. I have print resources that I purchased years ago
when copyright awareness became more politically correct. I will go to them if there is
something I can’t answer or I will go out to the PSLA website or the ALA website and
see what kind of links I can find to help. Participant seven mentioned a college web site
as a source: “I have a university source that I use. Typically when I’ve got a question it
is my go to place.. .Stanford University copyright and fair use is my go to place”. Two
librarians mentioned using the United States Government’s copyright site, copyright.gov.
And one librarian, Participant Five, turns to Google for help in answering difficult
copyright questions, saying she would “Google it and read the different sides”.
Printed material as a Copyright Resource
Books on educational copyright written by Kenneth Crews, Carrie Russell, and
Carol Simpson were mentioned by four librarians who said they used these print
resources to help answer specific copyright questions. All of these books are cited in this
study.

69

Copyright Questions not Posed to Librarians
The concept of students, teachers and administrators “not knowing what they
don’t know” about copyright was repeated by five librarians during their interviews:
“They don’t know what they don’t know. They don’t realize they should stop and think
about it first”, said Participant Seven. One librarian, Participant Eight, related a story
about a faculty meeting:
No they don’t have a clue. At one of our last staff meetings, the principal
was telling us about how much had been cut from the budget and how he might
have to make up for it by copying whole textbooks. And I raised my hand and
said don’t ever say that out loud because it is a federal crime to do that. I said I
can’t stop you from doing it, but I can tell you that you are not permitted to do
that. It is illegal and I know it is but you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do. He
said it is probably cheaper to copy the books to use the paper and the toner rather
than buy the book itself so he may end up doing that. I can’t stop him - he’s the
principal - but you know this is what we have come to.
Participant Eight is never asked about copyright: “I never have that situation.
Nobody ever asks me about copyright. I stick my nose in and say you realize it is illegal
to copy that whole book right? And they never do, so nobody ever asks me about
copyright. Nobody even thinks about it”. Participant Ten said, “Most teachers don’t ask
- they just do what they think is right which often means they don’t consider copyright as
an issue. It seems like everyone thinks if something is posted on the internet it is
available for anyone else to use”.

70

Summary
Over 75% of the 184 school librarians who participated in the survey indicated
that they were asked for copyright advice by students. More librarians (83.2%) were
asked for copyright advice by teachers. Almost half of the librarians surveyed they were
not asked for copyright advice by administrators. A majority of the school librarians
(83.2%) surveyed believe that it is their responsibility to provide copyright advice to
students, teachers, and administrators.
Librarians learn about changes to copyright law and trends in fair use in a variety
of ways including journal articles, books, web sites of professional organizations,
conferences, webinars, and from colleagues. Ten librarians who were interviewed use
make use of a variety of resources to answer copyright questions that they are posed, a
practice that enables them to choose the resources that are most appropriate to answer the
questions they are posed.
When asked to answer ten survey questions about copyright situations commonly
found in schools, librarians correctly answered between five and ten questions. There
was no discemable pattern to indicate that librarians with a number of years of experience
were more knowledgeable that librarians with more or less experience as a librarian.

Chapter 5
Discussion
Introduction
This study was conducted to determine the perceptions of Pennsylvania librarians
working in K-12 schools regarding their role as a copyright resource within their schools.
While the literature review showed that there is a need for K-12 educators to understand
and apply the doctrine of fair use to their use of copyrighted materials in the classroom
(ISTE, 2007; Speak Up, 2009), there has been very little research conducted on this topic
to date.
The research questions this study attempted to answer are:
1. What are Pennsylvania school librarians’ perceptions about their role in
providing copyright and fair use advice to students, teachers, and
administrators?
2. How do school librarians learn about current laws and trends in the use of
copyrighted materials for education?
3. Is there a pattern between the number of years of experience of a school
librarian and their knowledge about basic copyright situations that occur in
schools?
4. What resources do librarians use to answer copyright questions posed by
students, teachers, and administrators?
This chapter summarizes the study’s findings for each of the four research
questions this study attempted to answer, and places the findings within the context o f the

72

current philosophies regarding the concept of fair use by K-12 teachers for teaching and
by students for learning. The limitations of the study and the ability to generalize the
findings to k-12 education throughout the United States will be examined. Implications
of the study findings for higher education instructors and K-12 educational leaders will
be discussed. Finally, recommendations for school districts and implications for future
research are introduced.
Limitations of this Study
While this researcher used two listservs devoted to school librarians in
Pennsylvania to solicit participants for this study, not every school librarian in the state
belongs to one of these listservs. Two groups that are least likely to belong to the
listservs were represented by small numbers of librarians in this study. The first group
includes librarians that are new to the profession. Eleven librarians with less than two
years of service participated in the survey. Unless these librarians are mentored by
experienced librarians, they may not be aware that these two listservs exist. The second
group encompasses those librarians who obtained their library media specialist certificate
by passing a PRAXIS® exam. Fourteen librarians who obtained their certificate through
a PRAXIS® exam participated in this study. Most school librarians who gained their
certificate through a degree program are not particularly welcoming to “PRAXIS®
librarians”, and thus may not share with them the availability of the two listservs.
Other limitations included the possibility that librarians may have chosen not to
participate in the survey. Those librarians who responded to the survey might not have

73

been representative of the entire group. Librarians who volunteered to be interviewed
after completing the survey might not have been representative of the entire group.
Research Question 1: What are Pennsylvania school librarians’ perceptions about
their role in providing copyright and fair use advice to students, teachers, and
administrators?
The online survey included several questions that were designed to provide
information to help answer this research question. One measurement of school librarian
perception of their role was their self-reported frequency of requests for copyright advice
by students, teachers, and administrators. Almost 80% of librarians reported they were
asked by students to provide copyright advice during the course of a school year. Even
more librarians (83.2%) were asked by teachers to provide copyright advice during the
course of a school year. Requests for copyright advice by administrators were reported
by slightly over 50% of the librarians surveyed in this study. While being asked for
copyright advice is a factor not directly influenced by the librarians, this shows that they
are regarded by at least some students, teachers, and administrators as an appropriate
resource for copyright guidance.
Copyright Instruction to Students
Providing instruction about copyright to students was reported by 85.3% of
librarians, indicating the vast majority of librarians felt it was their responsibility to teach
their students about copyright. Considering that students surveyed in 2009 (Speak Up
2009) indicate they are using digital resources for school to complete writing
assignments, create slideshows, videos, and web pages, all students should be receiving

74

instruction in copyright and fair use. Guidance provided by the school librarian will also
be useful to students outside of school.
Non-school use of technology tools by students includes uploading and
downloading internet content, participating in online games, and creating and modifying
digital media (Speak Up, 2009). Even young students will benefit from learning about
copyright. Lenhart (2007) found that over half o f students between twelve and seventeen
create content that they then post to the internet. The number of students creating and
posting content will almost certainly continue to rise as more and more web sites provide
opportunities for students to upload content.
Providing Copyright Information to Faculty
Additionally, 76.6% of librarians provided their faculty with information about
copyright and fair use, while 30.4% of librarians reported they taught faculty members
about copyright and fair use. These efforts by librarians to provide information and/or
instruction to their faculty clearly indicate that a majority of librarians perceive in-service
of faculty members about copyright to be one of their professional responsibilities. As
ISTE indicates in their standards for teachers (2008), it is important for educators to
include digital resources in their teaching practice and to provide assessment
opportunities for students that include digital resources.
Some librarians may be hesitant to provide copyright advice to faculty because
they fear being labeled “the copyright police” (Hobbs, Jaszi, and Aufderheide, 2007).
The possibility of getting advice that would require them to rework lessons may make
some teachers reluctant to ask their school librarian about copyright and fair use.

75

Copyright Advice as a Job Responsibility
When asked directly if they believed it was their responsibility to provide
copyright advice, 85.4% of librarians reported it was their responsibility or their library
department chair’s responsibility to provide copyright advice. Bolstering this belief is a
number of professional guides that have been written specifically for K-12 school
librarians on the topic of copyright.
Copyright Guides Written for Librarians
The American Library Association’s copyright expert, Russell, published a guide
specifically designed for school librarians in 2004 titled Complete copyright: an everyday
guide for librarians followed by another book in 2012 titled Complete copyright fo r K 12 librarians and educators. Crews, a copyright expert at Columbia University and
founding director of the Copyright Advisory Office, has also written several copyright
books for librarians published by the American Library Association including Copyright
law for librarians and educators: creative strategies and practical solutions, which is the
third edition of this popular title. A search o f the American Library Association’s online
book store returns 46 distinct titles on the topic of copyright including the titles listed
above. Simpson, a nationally recognized copyright expert, has written five books about
copyright which were published by Linworth/Libraries Unlimited, a publisher of
professional resources for librarians. A search of the ISTE online book store, however,
does not find any books published on the topic of copyright. ISTE, an international
organization dedicated to the use of technology education may include a standard for
students that indicates that students should “practice safe, legal, and responsible use of

76

information and technology” (ISTE, 2007), but it does not include in its book store
offerings even one book dedicated to copyright and fair use, the legal premise that allows
the use of copyrighted materials in teaching and learning.
Interestingly, the titles of some of these copyright books indicate the books are
designed for librarians and “educators”. Simpson (2008) has even written a book
specifically for school administrators titled Copyright fo r administrators. However, the
fact that the titles are published by publishing houses that provide professional resources
for librarians means that most teachers and administrators would not discover these titles
on their own.
Research Question 2: How do school librarians learn about current laws and trends
in the use of copyrighted materials for education?
Both the online survey and the telephone interviews gathered information about
how librarians learn about current laws and trends in the use of copyrighted materials for
education. Each Pennsylvania K-12 educator and administrator must complete either six
credits of Pennsylvania Department of Education approved continuing professional
education courses or 180 hours of continuing professional education programs, activities
or learning experiences every five years to keep their professional certificate active.
Librarian Professional Development
When asked through the online survey about their professional development
activities, over three quarters of the librarians surveyed (77.2%) indicated they had
attended at least one professional development session, workshop, webinar, or other type
of training on the subject of copyright during the previous five years. Over 20% o f the

77

librarians surveyed indicated they attended three or more copyright professional
development activities during the previous five years. Workshops on copyright for
librarians are presented at most librarian conferences, with prolific authors of copyright
guides and journal articles often providing updated information at conference workshops.
Learning about Current Laws and Trends
Additional data about how librarians learn about current laws and trends in the
use of copyrighted materials for education was gathered during ten telephone interviews.
Librarians were asked to respond to the following question: What resources do you use
to keep current with changes in copyright law? While seven librarians reported they read
articles about copyright in School Library Journal, a popular professional journal for
school librarians, and other journals designed for both librarians and other educators,
information in published journals lags behind current news and changes in laws as well as
changes in common practice.
Online Resources about Copyright Law
While five librarians used electronic mailing lists to keep current with copyright
laws, the fact that anyone belonging to the listserv can post information makes it a less
than an authoritative source of information in some cases. As well, librarians mentioned
using the internet. The specific web sites that were mentioned included ALA’s web site,
PSLA’s web site, and Temple’s web site (referring to the Media Education Lab now
located at the University of Rhode Island) as a source for information about copyright.
However, when asked specifically where the librarians looked at on the internet, specific
sites, publications or organizations were not always mentioned. Four of the ten librarians

78

mentioned they had attended conference sessions about copyright, indicating both PSLA
and AASL as organizations sponsoring the conferences.
Printed Resources about Copyright Law
Using books as sources of copyright information was mentioned by three
librarians. However, books are only updated after substantial changes in copyright law or
common educational practice have occurred. This means that librarians that rely mainly
on printed books are likely not providing the most current and accurate information about
copyright to their students, teachers, and administrators. Even the authors of books about
copyright include additional resources that can be consulted for updates to copyright law.
Simpson (2005) includes a variety of organizations and their web sites that can be
consulted for updates on copyright law, a practice also followed by other copyright
authors.
The variety of resources and mediums used by school librarians to gather
information about copyright indicates that librarians make a conscious effort to educate
themselves about copyright law and to keep up with new laws and changes in the
interpretation of the fair use of copyrighted materials for educational purposes. Having
access to a listserv that is specifically geared to Pennsylvania school librarians (schools),
and another listserv subscribed to by school librarians from around the world (LM NET)
allows librarians to ask questions about copyright to their peers, some of which are
nationally recognized copyright experts. The volume of professional books about
copyright that are available through specialized library publishing houses along with the
articles and columns in journals devoted to librarians indicates that understanding and

79

providing advice on copyright is seen by the library profession as one critical aspect o f
their job responsibilities.
Applying Fair Use
While learning about changes to copyright law is important, perhaps even more
important is understanding how to apply fair use to instructional uses of copyrighted
materials (Russell, 2004). Some educators find it easier to just avoid using copyrighted
materials in their teaching practice (Hobbs, 2010, p. 7) than to determine if their intended
use is fair use. Undoubtedly, some librarians are just as leery of proclaiming educational
uses to be fair use, finding the process of determining if a specific situation is a fair use to
be overwhelming.
Research Question 3: Is there a pattern between the number of years of experience
of a school librarian and their knowledge about basic copyright situations that
occur in schools?
The online survey asked librarians to indicate the number of years of experience
they had as school librarians. Librarians completing the survey ranged from less than
two years of experience to more than thirty years of experience. To determine their
knowledge about copyright situations commonly encountered in schools, librarians
completing the survey were asked ten multiple choice questions. These questions can be
found in the survey shown in appendix E. The quizzes were scored and analyzed with
the number of years of experience of the librarians completing the quiz.
Mean Scores of Librarians by Group

80

Librarians with less than two years of experience scored highest with a mean
score of 8, although this was the smallest group with only 11 librarians completing the
survey. The second highest group was librarians with five to ten years o f experience with
a mean score of 8.09, followed by librarians with twenty one to thirty years of experience
with a mean score of 8.02. Librarians with between ten and twenty years o f experience
had a mean score o f 7.93. Two groups tied for the lowest mean score of 7.79. Librarians
with two to five years of experience and librarians with more than thirty years of
experience had the lowest mean scores. The group o f librarians with more than thirty
years of experience contained only 14 librarians, making that group size the second
smallest after librarians with less than two years of experiences. Because the mean
scores were so closely grouped, it isn’t apparent that any group had a strong advantage
through the number of years of work experience. A bigger sample size including more
librarians in each group may have given a clearer picture.
Teacher Knowledge about Copyright
Interestingly, Hobbs, Jaszi, and Aufderheide (2007) found that teachers had a
wide range of understanding about copyright. Whether this applies to school librarians as
a group isn’t clear, but certainly the results of the copyright quiz indicate there isn’t a
uniform understanding about copyright on the part of school librarians. While educators
were aware of fair use guidelines, Hobbs et al. (2007) found that most did not understand
that guidelines were not part of the law, how guidelines were developed or their limited
applicability. Educators had even less of an understanding o f the concept of fair use
often confusing it with citing information. Certainly some librarians are equally

81

confused, although how many librarians are confused about guidelines that were
developed to apply to fair use is unknown.
Quiz Score Analysis
Lower quiz scores by librarians may have been caused by them misunderstanding
one or more of the quiz questions, leading them to select a wrong answer. As well, some
librarians may be part of the sample group that are never asked copyright questions,
causing them to devote little time to keeping up on copyright laws and fair use trends.
During an interview, one elementary librarian mentioned that copyright is very seldom
brought up at her school. Fifteen o f the librarians completing the survey entered the field
o f librarianship through passing a PRAXIS exam. This group of librarians may have had
little or no training in educational copyright and fair use. Further research would be
necessary to determine if there is a relationship between the years of experience of the
librarian and their knowledge about copyright. This study did not find a strong
relationship between years of experience and knowledge about copyright.
When looking at the quiz scores achieved by librarians (Table 11), it is
concerning that only 10.32% of librarians achieved a perfect score and 23.91% answered
9 of the ten questions correctly. This means that those who are providing in-service and
continuing education for librarians would do well to incorporate discussion and activities
about copyright and fair use into their workshops and courses. School leaders should
also take note and provide opportunities for librarians to attend conferences and
workshops that include discussion of copyright and fair use. Absent the ability to send
librarians to conferences and trainings, it is important that funds are made available to

82

purchase professional journals and copyright reference books for use by librarians and
others in schools. With the economic downturn across the United States, funds for
library materials have been cut in many schools. And while it may be deemed more
important to purchasing new materials for students, it is nonetheless important to provide
current references that librarians and teachers can use to determine if a particular use of
copyrighted works can be claimed fair use.
Research Question 4: What resources do librarians use to answer copyright
questions posed by students, teachers, and administrators?
The telephone interviews with ten school librarians included a question about
which resources the librarian used to help answer questions about copyright. The
resources used by librarians to answer copyright questions included people, web sites,
and printed resources. Professors, public librarians, and school or school district
technologists were all mentioned as sources of copyright advice by school librarians.
One librarian mentioned Dr. Renee Hobbs, Director of Media Education Lab at the
University of Rhode Island, as a source for advice. Another librarian referred to a college
professor as a copyright resource.
People as a Copyright Resource
Technologists encounter copyright and fair use issues through their use and
teaching with software, music, video, and audio files. They may also have learned about
copyright through their technology coursework. It is not surprising that they are seen as
copyright experts by some librarians considering that technologists work with technology
that inevitably includes video, music, audio files, web pages, and other digital materials

83

as part of their job. In many schools, librarians are also viewed as one of the technology
leaders in their schools. This dual role held by some librarians makes it even more
important that they have a number of resources they can use to answer questions about
copyright and determine if an educational use o f copyrighted material may be considered
fair use. ISTE provides the NETs for teachers (ISTE, 2008), which includes digital
citizenship and the need to model the ethical and legal use o f resources for education.
This shows the importance of having staff within each school to serve as a resource for
copyright and fair use advice.
Web Sites as a Copyright Resource
Among the web sites used by librarians to answer copyright questions were the
United States Government’s copyright web site, PSLA and ALA’s web sites, Stanford
University’s Copyright and Fair Use Website, librarylaw.com, and the Media Education
Lab at the University of Rhode Island.

Printed resources mentioned by librarians

included books by Carol Simpson, Kenneth Crews, and Carrie Russell, all prominent
copyright scholars and authors of works about copyright and fair use.
All of the librarians interviewed mentioned multiple sources for information about
copyright. This widens the types and the currency o f information available to them and
allows them to select the best resource to answer a specific question or concern about
copyright and fair use. While librarians are in the business o f knowing how to answer
questions, it is still reassuring to know that they apply the basics of quality research to
seek out and locate a variety of authoritative sources about copyright. Modeling the use
of digital as well as print information for the students and the teachers that they advise

84

allows librarians to affirm the need to look online for the most current information and
demonstrates to students the need to use inductive discovery (Prensky, 2001b) to
determine fair use of copyrighted materials for class papers and projects.
Determining Fair Use
Experts who write about copyright and fair use provide advice to librarians about
the practical application of fair use for teachers and students. Crews (2006) encourages
educators to go beyond the restrictive guidelines that have been developed and look at the
four factors to make their own determination of whether a specific educational use is fair
use. Hobbs (2010) believes that transforming a copyrighted work into a new work is key
to applying fair use.
Finding authoritative sources of information and applying that information to
specific situations in schools are two different tasks. The application of the four factors
that must be considered before declaring a specific educational use o f copyrighted
materials to be fair use can be complicated. As Pike (2008) discussed, there are no firm
rules for photocopying materials for use in the classroom, and different educators apply
fair use differently when considering what is permissible to copy. While many believe
that the answer to what is allowed is to follow a specific set of guidelines, Crews (2006)
believes that any guidelines narrowly define fair use in ways that were not desired when
the fair use doctrine was established in 1976. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of
determining fair use is caused by the fluidity of the fair use doctrine itself.

85

Suggestions for Further Research
Because the study was limited to librarians in the state of Pennsylvania, it is
unclear if the results would be the same in other states. In Pennsylvania, a professional
development workshop was developed in the early 2000’s to help school librarians in the
state learn about copyright. That workshop was available to any school librarian who
was willing to attend, and workshops were held in across the State over a period of
several months. This type of training may not have been available to librarians in other
states.
Many computer teachers and technologists have a sizable knowledge base about
copyright and fair use. One of this researcher’s doctoral courses included a unit on
copyright and fair use. There may be a number o f teacher training programs that include
instruction on copyright and fair use. As well, technologists are very likely to learn about
copyright and fair use in their college courses. This may mean that other educators
within a school know as much or more about copyright than the school librarian. More
research would be needed to investigate.
Finally, budget shortfalls have caused school districts in some states to reduce or
eliminate librarians. In Pennsylvania, Philadelphia City schools have eliminated almost
all librarian positions. In the researcher’s school district, the number of librarians was
reduced from twelve to six in fall 2012. When school libraries are non-existent or staffed
by someone other than a librarian, that person may not have an understanding of
copyright and fair use. It is critical for school leaders to know that someone in their
school district can provide accurate advice on the fair use of copyrighted materials for

86

teaching and learning. This study only encompassed a sample of 184 librarians within
Pennsylvania. Further research is needed to see if school librarians are available, trained,
and willing to provide copyright advice within the majority o f our schools. For schools
lacking a librarian, school leaders need to know who can serve as a copyright expert for
teachers and students.
During the interviews, several librarians indicated that many teachers “don’t
know what they don’t know” about copyright. Further research is needed to test that
theory. Lack of knowledge about copyright that results in illegal use of copyrighted
materials can cause schools to become enmeshed in legal battles. Only by realizing that
teachers need to learn about copyright and fair use can school leaders take steps to
educate their professional staff about copyright and fair use.
Hobbs, Jaszi, and Aufderheide (2007) found that some teachers considered
librarians to be the copyright police. This researcher has been called ‘the copyright
police” many times over the years. Thus even with an extensive knowledge base about
copyright and fair use, some librarians may be hesitant to speak up when they learn o f
copyright violations within their schools because they are providing unwelcome
information. More research is needed to see if this is a significant problem that prevents
some librarians (or other professional staff members) from being willing to assume the
role of a copyright advisor for teachers.
Summary
The materials used for instruction are central to the education of all students in all
subject areas. The ease by which materials can be duplicated today either by

87

photocopying or by making digital copies o f digital files is unparalleled in the history of
the world. The internet has provided a vast repository of information for anyone with a
computer and a connection to the internet. With this vast store of information comes the
need to use it legally and ethically for teaching and learning.
In her book, Copyright Clarity (2010), Hobbs maintains that “the effective use of
copyrighted materials enhances the teaching and learning process” (p. 5). Avoiding the
use of copyrighted materials in teaching and learning is clearly not an option. With or
without the assistance of teachers, students will seek out digital resources to allow them
to learn in alternate method rather than in just the traditional classroom lecture method
(Rosen 2010, p. 39) and to create their own digital works (Lenhart, 2007). What is clear
is that it is important to for all educators to have a basic understanding of copyright and
fair use so they can model appropriate use o f copyrighted materials in their teaching
practice. And it is also important for someone or several people within each school to
have a deeper understanding of copyright and fair use so they can assist teachers with
lesser knowledge.
Preparing students for the legal and ethical use o f information in their lives
begins while they are in school. Researchers tell us that the differences in the way our
students learn today (Raine, 2007; Prensky, 2010) are profound. Students are deeply
entrenched in the digital world that provides them with options and control over their
learning that they are not always seeing in school. Educators must provide students with
the ability to recognize and practice the legal and ethical use of information they
encounter in school and throughout their lives.

Appendix B
E-mail to Schools and PSLA Electronic mailing lists
To the School Librarians of Pennsylvania,
I am sending you this email to request your assistance in a research study. I am
investigating the perceptions of school librarians pertaining to their role as a copyright
advisor for the administrators, teachers, and students in their school(s). Your assistance
in completing the survey will help me accurately portray how Pennsylvania school
librarians view their role as a copyright advisor. If you are willing to participate in the
study, please follow the link at the bottom of this email to access the survey. I only ask
that you complete the following survey to the best of your ability. The responses will be
collected anonymously unless you share contact information (your name and phone
number) at the end of the survey. Several librarians who supply a phone number will be
contacted and asked five additional questions.
The information supplied by you will become part of my research study. This
study is being conducted as a requirement for my doctoral degree. No participant will be
identified in the published study results even if that participant is interviewed by phone.
By participating in the survey, you agree to allow me to use your responses in my study.
The responses from the survey will only be available to me, the researcher. Survey
responses will not be available online to any survey participant. A participant who
provides contact information for the phone interview and later decides not to participate
in a phone interview may email me at sekell@ptd.net and request that I delete their
contact information from the survey. I will immediate delete contact information upon

100

receiving a request from a survey respondent who provides me with their contact
information including their name and the phone number they supplied in response to the
last survey question.
The survey is hosted on the SurveyMonkey web site. SurveyMonkey’s security
policy outlines the procedures they follow to keep survey data secure. SurveyMonkey’s
policies can be viewed at: http://www.surveymonkey.com/Monkey_Security.aspx
The first section of the survey collects basic information about professional
certificate(s), college degree(s) held, the college or university that granted the degree(s),
professional development activities, the number of years o f experience completed, and
the school population(s) served.
The next section of the survey asks for your professional experiences in providing
copyright guidance to your school community (students, teachers, and administrators).
The last section of the survey includes some questions about copyright to test your
knowledge about how copyright law applies to education. Use your present knowledge
to answer the questions. Select the answer you believe is correct, but do not look up the
answers to any questions on the survey. The survey is designed to gather information
about your current knowledge about copyright.
The final question on the survey asks if you are willing to answer five additional
questions about copyright during a phone interview. Your responses to the survey will be
used whether or not you supply contact information and agree to a phone interview. Only
a small, randomly picked number of respondents will be chosen to be interviewed by

101

phone. Those librarians interviewed by phone will not be identified by name in the study
itself. Only answers to survey questions will be reported in the study.

Copyright Survey

INVESTIGATOR(S) NAME: Susan E. Kell, doctoral candidate
STUDY TITLE: Perceptions of Pennsylvania School Librarians Regarding their Role in Providing
Copyright Advice to Students, Teachers, and Administrators in their School
PURPOSE: The purpose of this research staidly is to examine the school librarian knowledge about
copyright, to determine how often the librarian is asked questions about copyright and whether tie
librarian views herselt/himself as a school copyright consultant
I am being asked to be a participant in the study because I belong to an electronic mailing list
dedrcated to school librarians
DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY
If I decide to participate, I will be asked to complete an online survey about copyright that will take
about ten minutes to complete At the end of the survey, I will be asked to participate in a phone
interview to provide more information about how I learn about copyright I do not need to participate
in the phone interview to complete the survey. The survey is anonymous. There is no cost to
participate in the online survey
RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS
As a participant in this study, I may be uncomfortable, experience self-doubt or experience
depression when answering the quiz questions if I am uncertain of the answers If I am
uncomfortable during the survey, I can skip questions or I can exit from the survey without
completing all questions
BENEFITS
There may be no direct benefits of participating in this study; however, the knowledge received may
be of value to help school leaders insure that someone within the school is able to provide
copyright and fair use guidance to teachers. School leaders may find some factors that indicate
their librarian has the knowledge to accurately guide students and teachers in the ethical and legal
use of copyrighted materials for teaching and learning Alternately, school leaders may find that
school librarians are not likely to have a knowledge base that allows them to accurately guide
teachers and students in the ethical and legal use of copyrighted materials.
ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES
The alternative would be to not participate.
