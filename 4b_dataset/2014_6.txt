ABSTRACT
A CHILD-DRIVEN METADATA SCHEMA: A HOLISTIC ANALYSIS OF
CHILDREN’S COGNITIVE PROCESSES DURING BOOK SELECTION

by
Jihee Beak

The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 2014
Under the Supervision of Professor Hope A. Olson, and Professor Richard P. Smiraglia

The purpose of this study was to construct a child-driven metadata schema by
understanding children’s cognitive processes and behaviors during book selection.
Existing knowledge organization systems including metadata schemas and previous
literature in the metadata domain have shown that there is a no specialized metadata
schema that describes children’s resources that also is developed by children. It is clear
that children require a new or alternative child-driven metadata schema. Child-driven
metadata elements reflected the children’s cognitive perceptions that could allow children
to intuitively and easily find books in an online cataloging system. The literature of
development of literacy skills claims that the positive experiences of selecting books
empower children’s motivation for developing literacy skills. Therefore, creating a childdriven metadata schema not only contributes to the improvement of knowledge
organization systems reflecting children’s information behavior and cognitive process,
but also improves children’s literacy and reading skills.

ii

Broader research questions included what metadata elements do children like to use?
What elements should a child-driven metadata schema include? In order to answer these
research questions, a triangulated qualitative research design consisting of questionnaires,
paired think-aloud, interview, and diaries were used with 22 child participants between
the ages of 6 and 9. A holistic understanding of the children’s cognitive processes during
book selection as a foundation of a child-driven metadata schema displays an early stage
of an ontological contour for a children’s knowledge organization system. A child-driven
metadata schema constructed in this study is apt to include different metadata elements
from those metadata elements existing in current cataloging standards. A child-driven
metadata schema includes five classes such as story/subject, character, illustration,
physical characteristics, and understandability, and thirty three metadata elements such as
character’s names and images, book cover’s color, shape, textured materials, engagement
element, and tone. In addition, the analysis of the relationship between emergent
emotional vocabularies and cognitive factors and facets illustrated the important role of
emotion and attention in children’s information processing and seeking behaviors.

Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1. An anecdotal motivation for the study
I remembered the first time when I visited a children’s room in a public library at my
hometown in South Korea. The children’s room consisted of two-tier bookshelves along
the walls and there were many children’s books scattered around the room. Children’s
books were arranged by authors’ last names. However, children did not seem to care
about the author’s name. Therefore, they had to pull books out to look for other
information in the books. This classification system did not seem to work for a children’s
library in a chaotic situation. Ten years after my first experience of a children’s library, I
am still going to children’s libraries. The difference is that now I visit children’s libraries
in the United States. However, when it comes to a classification system for a children’s
library, it seems little has changed. Children’s libraries, regardless of whether they are in
South Korea or in the United States, still use the same knowledge organization systems
such as the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC).

Nowadays children are living in the internet world. They try to find information through
a library catalog system or a web portal. How do children find information in an online
environment? Is it as difficult as finding books in a physical library? Is there any childappropriate knowledge organization system such as a metadata schema for children in the
online environment? While observing children’s information seeking and searching
behavior in physical and digital libraries, I have been able to find some research gaps and
research problems in metadata schemas for children’s resources. Children’s information

2

needs call for a new metadata schema that describes children’s resources from children’s
perspectives and that provides child-appropriate access points.

1.2. Background: The current situation with metadata schemas for children
Children have become a significant user group in both physical and digital library
environment. To keep pace with the growing information needs from a children’s user
group, Library and Information Science (LIS) has developed child-friendly search
interfaces, web portals, or digital libraries. Behind these products, a great number of
studies on children’s information behavior have been conducted. A body of literature in
children’s information behaviors shows that children have different information seeking
and searching behaviors from those of adults. Due to lack of cognitive abilities including
limited vocabularies and concepts, or lack of capacity to understand Boolean logic, etc.
children have difficulties searching for information with keywords (Borgman et al., 1995;
Busey & Doerr, 1993; Hirsh, 1997; Hutchinson et al., 2005; Pejtersen, 1986; 1989;
Sandlian, 1994; Solomon, 1993; Walter, Borgman & Hirsh, 1996). Instead, children
prefer finding information through a browse search (Beheshti et al., 2010; Bilal, 2000;
2001; 2002b; Borgman et al., 1995; Borgman, Chignell, & Valdez, 1989; Large, Beheshit,
& Rahman, 2002; Pejtersen, 1986; Sandlian, 1994; Walter, Borgman, & Hirsh, 1996).
Moreover, in order to motivate children’s interest or attention to find information, digital
libraries or web portals for children are concerned about aesthetic aspects (Reuter, 2007a).
Interfaces become more colorful and use graphical icons and images. These changes
encourage children to engage in information seeking and searching activities.

3

Despite a huge amount of effort and research regarding improving information retrieval
systems for children, children still complain about using library cataloging systems and
finding information in an online environment. It is because of the disconnection between
information retrieval and information organization. Information retrieval and information
organization are often considered as two sides of the same coin. Without having wellconstructed information organization systems, it is hard to develop effective information
retrieval systems. Even well-designed interfaces, if they fail to consider an information
organizational perspective, cannot fully function to meet children’s information seeking
behaviors and needs. Given this relationship between information retrieval and
information organization, there has been lack of consideration in information
organization systems for children’s libraries or children’s resources.

Current knowledge organization systems (KOS) used in school or public libraries for
children are not specialized for children. For instance, many school and public libraries in
the United States still use the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd ed, (AACR2),
MARC21, DDC, Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), etc. These KOS were
not originally developed for representing children’s resources, but rather designed for
representing general resources for adult audiences. There are two components in
information organization: users and resources. Information organization tends to
emphasize more how to represent the characteristics or the nature of resources than how
to reflect users’ perspectives in KOS (Beak & Olson, 2011a; 2011b). It is very important
to understand who the end users are when new information retrieval systems or
knowledge organization systems are developed. However, in the case of developing an

4

information retrieval systems or interfaces, they are developed for children, but not
developed by children. Adult developers or experts often believe that they can represent
children’s information seeking behaviors and cognitive processes. This belief might be
partially true and might work. By considering children’s information behaviors on behalf
of children’s user groups, these adult experts might develop a “user-centered” metadata
schema. However, it is not as effective as a “user-driven” metadata schema, based on
studies about children’s information seeking behaviors and cognitive processes from
actual children. Two terms, user-centered and user-driven, may be interchangeable.
However, strictly speaking, a user-driven approach requires empirical data from targeted
end users, whereas a user-centered approach simply considers users’ perspectives more
than technical issues. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a user-driven metadata schema
to describe and provide information in a user-friendly or user-appropriate way.

Existing KOS including metadata schemas and previous literature from the metadata
domain, have shown a research gap leading to this study’s research problem. There is a
no specialized metadata schema that describes children’s resources that also developed
by children. It is clear that children require a new or alternative child-driven metadata
schema. LIS has employed grounded theory (e.g., Seldén, 2005) often to study
information seeking behaviors. This study uses a grounded theory to reveal children’s
information seeking behaviors. Mansourian (2006, p. 390) describes the value of
grounded theory:

5

The most important issue in using GT [Grounded Theory] is to remember
the value of the GT’s essence in developing a theory, which is essentially
grounded in the real data without any effects of bias towards a specific
direction or considering any per-convinced assumption in data analysis.
Therefore, the essence of GT is remaining open and unbiased towards
what data suggest to build up the theory based only on the data and
nothing else.
The value of using grounded theory in this study is that I am able to understand what and
how children’s cognitive processes occur during book selection without pre-conceived
assumptions. In other words, I do not predict participants’ information seeking behaviors,
but rather I observe phenomena with an open mind. In this sense, a grounded theory
approach is useful to discover the holistic ontological contour of children’s cognitive
processes and information seeking behaviors as a foundation for developing a childdriven metadata schema.

A child-driven metadata schema enables children to readily find and select information
by themselves with child-appropriate access points. The literature of development of
literacy skills claims that the positive experiences of selecting books empower children’s
motivations for developing literacy skills. Therefore, creating a child-driven metadata
schema not only contributes to the improvement of KOS reflecting children’s information
behavior and cognitive process, but also improves children’s literacy and reading skills.

6

Chapter 2: Literature review and conceptual framework
The aim of this study is to develop a child-driven metadata schema describing children’s
resources and targeting children’s user groups through a study of children’s information
seeking behavior and cognitive processes during book selection. In this aspect, this
chapter reviews the literature in children’s information behavior and metadata schemas
for children’s resources. The body of LIS literature regarding children’s information
behavior has grown. The literature influences other research such as interface or OPAC
design, digital libraries for children, or information organization for children. There are
few studies emphasizing information organization related to children. However, there are
many studies that deal with the aspect of children’s information retrieval. Given that
information retrieval and information organization are two sides of the same coin, the
scope of the literature reviewed includes both information retrieval and information
organization.

The first part of this chapter is focused on several topics such as children’s information
seeking behavior, interface design, categorization, terminology, and metadata. The
second part of this chapter develops working definitions for the key concepts by
reviewing literature. The key concepts include children, metadata, information, and
context. Last, this chapter identifies dominant interpretations embedded in the literature
along with some other interpretations that have been ignored or less considered. The
research gaps emergent in the literature are also addressed throughout the literature
review.

7

2.1. Children’s information behavior
Information behavior refers to human interactions with information including creating,
organizing, searching, and utilizing activities. “Early on, studies on information behavior
were called ‘use studies’[,] studies of ‘information seeking and gathering,’ or studies of
‘information needs and uses’” (Bates, 2010, p. 2383). Children’s information behavior
has been studied in three main research streams: 1) children’s information
seeking/searching behavior, 2) interface design for children’s web portals or digital
libraries, and 3) some aspects of information organization such as categorization, naming,
and metadata for children.

2.1.1. Children’s information seeking/searching behavior
Information seeking and information searching are sometimes distinguished. Bates (2010)
briefly describes the differences between information seeking behavior and searching
behavior (p. 2384). Studies on information searching behavior specifically deal with “the
act of searching itself” (Bates, 2010, p. 2384). However, this study considers information
searching as a type of information seeking behavior. Therefore, information seeking and
searching behavior are interchangeable in this literature review.

2.1.1.1. Main projects of retrieval systems for children
Studies about children’s information seeking behavior tend to focus on children’s
different behavior or cognitive abilities in contrast to adults’ information seeking

8

behavior. Several projects such as Book House, the Science Library Catalog (SLC)
project, and the Kid’s Cataloging project conducted early studies of children’s
information searching behavior with the purpose of developing child-friendly information
retrieval systems. A recent project is the International Children’s Digital Library (ICDL).
These projects are developed based on children’s information seeking behavior.
Therefore, their interfaces or information retrieval systems reflect children’s perspectives.

Book House is a Danish system for information retrieval in fiction, developed by
Annelise Mark Pejtersen (Pejtersen, 1986; 1989). Book House reflects a user’s cognitive
perspective, noting that “the retrieval process then involves a mapping between these
multi-level descriptions – i.e. between collection characteristics and user needs values,
abilities” (Pejtersen, 1989, p. 41). Book House offers a browsing interface based on icons.
Icons are generated by a multi-faceted or multi-dimensional classification schema. Main
facets of the classification include author’s intention, frame/setting, subject matter, and
accessibility (Pejtersen, 1986; 1989, p. 41). These facets reflect different aspects from
traditional bibliographical information. They are associated with user’s reading needs by
cognitive work analysis.

The Science Library Catalog (SLC) project was conducted by a team of researchers
(mainly Christine L. Borgman) at UCLA's Department of Library and Information
Science from 1988-1995. The SLC’s interface displays graphic bookshelves, representing
subjects by Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC). “The Science Library Catalog […]

9

provided access to bibliographic records on science topics through a graphical interface
and utilized a bookshelf metaphor to correspond to children’s mental models of a library
catalog” (Hirsh, 1997, p. 726).

The Kid's Catalog was developed by a research team from the Denver Public Library and
CARL (Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries) Systems, Inc., which is the vendor of
the Denver Public Library’s OPAC system. It creates a colorful and visual point-andclick browsing search interface (Busey & Doerr, 1993; Sandlian, 1994). The Kid’s
Catalog focuses on a browsing search. Its browse search consists of three sections:
Explore, Find it!, and Best Stories. Compared to SLC’s DDC-based subject hierarchy
structure, the Kid’s Catalog Explore section has fifteen major classes. “The divisions and
subdivisions of the fifteen major classes were constructed using curriculum guides and by
literally browsing the entire children’s library collection at the Denver Public Library”
(Busey & Doerr, 1993, p. 81). Now the Kid’s Catalog has been changed to Secret
WonderWeb (http://kids.denverlibrary.org/catalogs/index.html), which is used at Denver
Public Libraries.

The ICDL was developed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers from fields
including library and information science, computer science, education, along with
classroom teachers, graphic designers, etc. at the University of Maryland. The ICDL
consists of intergenerational research group teams as well. ICDL project teams create a
kids’ team, consisting of six children from 7 years old to 11 years old. A cooperative

10

inquiry approach encourages the kids’ team to be involved in the project and to
“minimize the existing power structures (e.g., adults in charge, children follow
directions)” (Druin, 2005, p. 25). ICDL considers children’s perspectives more than other
previous projects regarding children’s searching and browsing behaviors and childfriendly interface design (Hutchinson, Bederson, & Druin, 2007).

2.1.1.2. Common findings: Keyword search vs. Browsing search
The common findings from these projects show that children have difficulties in keyword
searching such as spelling, typing skills, and formulating a search query (Borgman et al.,
1995; Busey & Doerr, 1993; Hirsh, 1997; Hutchinson et al., 2005; Pejtersen, 1986; 1989;
Sandlian, 1994; Solomon, 1993; Walter, Borgman & Hirsh, 1996). Children’s language
acquisition or intellectual ability to spell and type keywords is related to children’s
information seeking behavior. Keyword searches demand that users type exact words,
although recent search engines have a spelling correction function. Children’s intellectual
levels are not developed enough to compose and spell their own search queries (Borgman
et al., 1995). Sandlian (1994, p. 139) points out several of children’s weaknesses in a
keyword search:
These mechanical functions [keyword search functions] hinder the access
of information to a large pre-literate population. While many children
have large verbal vocabularies, their writing, spelling, and typing skills lag
behind their oral skills . … Another problem, linked to children’s

11

cognitive abilities, is their difficulty in shifting search strategies once their
initial option fails.
As Sandlian (1994) mentions, children might prefer typing verb-based search terms rather
than noun-based terms. Additionally, children are less able to switch the form of words or
to find similar terms when they have zero hits.

Keyword search requires users to generate their own search queries. Sometimes, users
have difficulty finding proper keyword terms, or even though they have proper terms, the
terms might not coincide with the terms assigned by indexers (Solomon, 1993). These
problems are challenging even for adults. Therefore, formulating a search query is the
most difficult information searching activity for children.

The other problem caused by a keyword search is associated with understanding Boolean
logic (Borgman et al., 1995; Hirsh, 1997; Sandlian, 1994; Walter, Borgman, & Hirsh,
1996). Because children do not know how to use the connectives AND, OR, and NOT,
children input many keywords within a query, so that the number of results retrieved is
usually null or too small. It makes children frustrated while searching for information.

The problems in performing a keyword search by children demand alternative search
systems. Previous projects and literature assert that a browse search brings better
effectiveness than a keyword search (Borgman et al., 1995; Busey & Doerr, 1993; Hirsh,

12

1997; Pejtersen, 1986; 1989; Sandlian, 1994; Walter, Borgman, & Hirsh, 1996). The SLC
search is based on browsing “to minimize the known difficulties children have with
existing online catalog (e.g., spelling, typing/keyboarding, alphabetizing, Boolean logic)
and to build on their skills and abilities (e.g., browsing, recognizing relevant topics,
navigating hierarchical displays, using a mouse)” (Hirsh, 1997, p. 726).

Given that cognitive ability plays a crucial role in searching, a browse search requires
less cognitive effort (Beheshti et al., 2010; Bilal, 2000; 2001; 2002b; Borgman et al.,
1995; Borgman, Chignell, & Valdez, 1989; Large, Beheshit, & Rahman, 2002; Pejtersen,
1986; Sandlian, 1994; Walter, Borgman, & Hirsh, 1996). The other cognitive advantage
of a browse search is related to children’s limited knowledge (Walter, Borgman, & Hirsh,
1996). Not only for children, but also even for adults, when people do not have enough
knowledge about certain domains, they want and need to navigate the domain rather than
perform keyword searches. Martens (2012) asserts that “Models such as Erdelez’s
(1999)[1] ‘information encountering’ in which users find information serendipitously, or
Bates’ (2005)[2] ‘berrypicking’, which describes an evolving search, might best describe
children’s searching behaviors” (p. 164). Serendipity might be a good description for
children’s information seeking behavior. Often, their information needs are vague. It is
because of children’s lack of knowledge or lack of experiences in a certain domain. In
this case, recalling memory to formulate possible keywords for searching is not effective.

Rather recognizing given concepts helps children seek information. In this sense, a
browse search supports children’s cognitive processes better.

2.1.1.3. Children’s information seeking behavior related to book selection
Another research stream in children’s information behavior research is related to book
selection. Interest in children’s book selection is usually studied under the umbrella of
literacy or in school library services (Reuter, 2007b). Their foci are different from what
the studies on information retrieval pay attention to. However, the reason why this
literature review includes the studies related to children’s book selection behavior is that
this literature provides important understandings of children’s perceptions of books.
Factors that make children choose a book can be applied for creating metadata elements
or organizing information (Beak, 2012; Beak & Olson, 2011a; 2011b). There are a couple
of studies regarding children’s book selection.

Beak and Olson (2011a; 2011b) analyze five pieces of literature (Kragler & Nolley, 1996;
Moore, 1988; Pejtersen, 1986; Robinson et al., 1997; Wendelin & Zinck, 1983) in
children’s book selection. Through meta-analysis of the five pieces of literature, Beak
and Olson (2011a) identify nine unique characteristics of children’s book selection (see
Table 2-1).

Reuter’s study (2007b) and Beak’s study (2012) are the most recent research studies in
children’s book selection behavior. The findings of these two studies show similar facets
and factors related to children’s book selecting behavior. Children tend to select books by
contents, reading experience or emotional interest, or familiarity. Since Reuter’s study
(2007b) focuses more on the aspect of children’s literacy rather than the aspects of
information retrieval or information organization, her study might be beyond the scope of

15

this dissertation. However, this type of study provides an important foundation for
developing metadata schemas for children. In other words, understanding children’s book
selection behavior suggests which metadata elements should be created to provide more
effective access points for children. Later, I discuss the relation between children’s book
selection behavior and the creation of metadata elements.

2.1.2. Interface design
Studies about children’s information seeking behavior have many implications for
designing interfaces or information retrieval systems. As the previous section shows, a
browse search is more effective for children. Consequently, the studies of interface
design for children’s libraries or web portals are concerned with how to improve browse
search interfaces. This section addresses several foci of interface design studies.

Graphical aspects regarding interface design related to aesthetic displays of information
can motivate child users to use a search interface. Colors or images are used to improve
aesthetic aspects of interfaces. For example, many school libraries’ OPAC systems
provide subject-based browsing categories such as Animals, Science, People, etc. These
subjects are represented in text format with associated images or icons, so that children
can recognize the subjects readily. Cooper (2005, p. 296) notes physical considerations
relating to interface design response:

16

The use of larger font and readable font style as well as inclusion of less
text and/or images on a page makes it easier for children to address the
information on the screen . … Use of color to help young children
distinguish objects from each other on a screen, and uncomplicated shapes
that are recognizable, also support the child viewer.
The ICDL also concerns itself with graphical and visual aspects of the interface. Its
interface is not only colorful and visual, but also includes dynamic factors. For instance,
the ICDL provides two dynamic book viewer interfaces: comic and spiral. These options
motivate children to read books.

Graphical displays are not only helpful to increase children’s interest and motivation, but
also are effective in understanding classification systems or structures of subject domains.
For instance, the SLC tries to take advantages of the browsing function and visual
interface design. Browse search functions are likely to consist of hierarchical structures.
To help understand the classification/structure of the science domain, SLC displays
subjects using graphical metaphor of bookshelves (Borgman et al., 1995). The ICDL is
also dedicated to improve the search interface, not only for the visual design, but also for
the search function. The ICDL’s a simple browse search does not require a top-down and
hierarchical approach. One of shortcomings in browse search is that children are less
likely to understand hierarchical structures. In addition, if hierarchical structures require
children to navigate more than three levels, children might give up searching or feel
frustrated searching. The ICDL allows children to search/browse books without limiting

17

navigation and without understanding Boolean logic by making the browse search
interface flat (Druin, 2005; Hutchinson et al., 2005).

The other focus of interface design for children’s libraries is related to children’s physical
ability. Inkpen (2001) and Hourcade et al. (2004) examine children’s motor skills that
could impact the design of children’s information system interfaces. Inkpen (2001)
compares two interaction styles, drag-and-drop versus point-and-click, of children using a
mouse. His findings show that children solve a problem faster and make fewer errors
when they interact with the interface by using a point-and-click style rather than when
they use a drag-and-drop style. Hourcade et al. (2004) show that children have more
difficulties using a mouse than adults do in point-and-click tasks. Compared to adults’
performance, preschool children use a mouse with less accuracy. It illustrates that age
affects information searching behavior regarding accuracy, target reentry, and efficiency
(p. 1). These motor abilities of children should be considered in order to design childfriendly interfaces.

Relatively recent studies focus on the visualization of vocabularies like taxonomies for
children. The studies about visualization for children’s subject headings or taxonomy
have been done by Andrew Large and Jamshid Beheshti from the School of Library and
Information Studies at McGill University (Beheshti et al., 2010; Large et al., 2009a;
2009b). Their interest is in how to display a taxonomy in a three dimensional (3D)
interface rather than to examine the taxonomy structure itself. Beheshti and his

18

colleagues (2010) perform a comparison of a conventional taxonomy interface with a
Cone interface representing the taxonomy in 3D. They use a T-test to compare list-based
conventional interface and a cone-based visual 3D interface. Although the T-test shows
that there is no significant difference between the two interfaces, they also find out the
differences regarding the preferences of the interfaces by using a post-questionnaire.
Children are intrigued by a visual 3D interface, but they find information faster in a
conventional interface. To explain these different results, Beheshti et al. (2010, p. 7)
assume two possibilities:
One interesting finding is that those students who played video games
frequently seem to dislike the 3D visualization interface more than those
who are infrequent or non-users. We found a similar negative correlation
in our previous study on the 2D visualization, and speculated that two
possible rationalizations could explain this finding. First, the gamers tend
to move and click at faster speeds than less frequent players, which may
result in failure to spot relevant terms that flash on and off the screen as
the cursor travels on its way. A second possible explanation is that gamers
had higher expectations of visual and navigational features that were not
met in the non-gaming environment of the Cone.
As Beheshti et al. (2010) interpret children’s information behavior considering children’s
gaming culture, studies on children’s information seeking behavior are required to
understand a broader context of children’s social and cultural interaction with
information.

19

Not only studies of visualization, but also studies of interface design are apt not to
consider the contents or the structures of information. Beheshti et al. (2010) point out that
students were not sure about the taxonomy structure or the terminology (p. 6). However,
their explanation does not associate those factors to the efficiency of visualized interfaces.
So far, the literature illuminates the advantages of a browsing search interface by
discussing the visual and functional aspects. These aspects are more likely to be
associated with information retrieval. Given that information organization supports
information retrieval systems, studies linked to information organization such as
categorization, terminology, or metadata are necessary to holistically view children’s
information seeking behavior and to find fundamental improvements in interfaces and
information retrieval systems.

2.1.3. Information organization for children
Compared to the number of studies about children’s information behavior regarding
information retrieval, including searching systems and interface designs, there are
relatively few studies focusing on information organization. Abbas (2005b) asserts that
“the effect of using an inappropriate representation scheme, such as a metadata scheme or
a controlled vocabulary that is not age appropriate for children or young adults, is an area
that has been largely neglected in the research” (p. 1513). In other words, studies about
interface designs based on children’s information seeking or searching behavior overlook
the representation issues including the contents of the information displayed in a search
interface.

20

A browse search interface tends to provide subject-based information access points in
hierarchical structures. Users narrow down search results by going through hierarchical
subject structures. Indeed, a browse search interface tends to have a limited space to
display information. For example, a school library OPAC system, Destiny by Follett,
provides a visual search interface. The visual search interface provides only 9 main
subject-based categories. Why do most browse search interfaces provide subject-based
information access points? Why are certain subjects displayed in a browse search
interface as access points, while other subjects are limited or ignored? How do children
categorize concepts in a certain domain? How do children construct relationships among
concepts? Information organization is concerned with these questions related to the
relationship or representation of information. Abbas (2005b) claims that it is necessary to
understand the contents or representation of users’ expression and information needs
rather than being concerned with the interface or systemic improvement in children’s
digital libraries. In this sense, studies about children’s information organization deal with
information representation including categorization, classification, naming, subject
headings or vocabularies, and metadata. However, since information organization and
information retrieval are two sides of the same coin, the following literature review
covers both information organization and information retrieval literatures.

2.1.3.1. Categorization / subject hierarchies
The studies about children’s categorization examine how children structure subject
hierarchies (Bar-Ilan & Belous, 2007; Bilal & Wang, 2005; Cooper, 2002a; 2002b; 2002c;

21

2004; Large et al., 2007). The studies addressing categorization are helpful to design
classifications, taxonomies, thesauri, or browsing search interfaces. Bar-Ilan and Belous
(2007) examine how children create structures of subject categories for web directories
by using a card-sorting method and an enveloping system. Elementary school children
(4th- and 5th-grade graduates) are asked to categorize 61 subject terms extracted from
two popular web directories, Walla (www.walla.co.il) and Yahooligans. Terms are
written on cards and given to children without any structure. Children restructure these
terms by using different sizes of envelops as they perceive the structure to be. Different
sizes of envelop equate to hierarchical levels. The findings of this study show how
children construct different subject hierarchies from two existing web directories’
structures. For instance, some terms such as MP3, artists & bands, and Mozart are not
even considered by children (p. 903). In terms of structures, two web directories provide
“leisure & entertainment” as the top-level category covering music, cinema, and TV,
whereas children are not able to perceive the concept of “leisure & entertainment.”
Instead, children put the concepts of music, cinema, and TV each into the top-level
categories (p. 905).

Bilal and Wang (2005) also study middle school children’s conceptual structures of
subject hierarchies in the science domain employed by two web directories: Yahooligans!
and KidsClick! Children are required to sort deconstructed concepts from the web
directories and to create new concept maps. Concept mapping reflects mental
representation of the concepts, and it is an effective method for examining children’s
conceptual classification (p. 1305). The findings show that children create less depth of

22

categorization, meaning “the number of levels from the top level to the lowest end of the
trees” (p. 1308), and more breadth of categorization, meaning “the number of parallel
subordinate categories that are derived from a superordinate category at each level of the
hierarchy” (p. 1308). In addition, constructing relationships among concepts for children
is challenging because they categorize concepts based on “situational, perceptional, and
experiential rather than conceptual” factors (p. 1311).

Cooper (2002c) asks children to suggest what information a library should include,
without providing any given concepts. This approach is different from the studies of BarIlan and Belous (2007), and Bilal and Wang (2005), in which children are given specific
concepts selected by researchers and the children are allowed to construct the subject
hierarchies. Cooper’s approach helps understand “what the children typified as important
in their concept of a library” (Cooper, 2002c, p. 1225). Children in Cooper’s study
(2002c) include just words such as cat, Harry the Dirty Dog, dictionary, etc. As the
suggested words show, children at this level do not consider the classification of concepts.
In addition, Cooper’s study (2002c) might contributes to the design of access points or
contents for a browse search interface. The importance and effectiveness of a browse
search for children is also associated with issues of metadata elements or access points.
The information provided in a main browse search interface influences children’s
information seeking behavior, because it is hard for children to think of other possible
subjects that are not displayed in the browse search interface. When it comes to
developing a browse search interface, it should be considered what contents and aspects
of information children prefer to access. Therefore, Cooper’s study (2002c) suggests

23

what subjects or topics should be represented in the limited space of a browse search
interface.

Most studies of children’s categorization suggest a similar implication for designing web
search interfaces for children. Children should be included in “the design process of the
content side of the development of Web search tools for children” (Bar-Ilan & Belous,
2007, p. 906). “Children’s browsing on the Web, especially their traversal behavior of
hierarchies, can be much improved. The organization of concepts in a Web directory is
important because successful traversal to a specific concept depends on a match between
a child’s conceptual structure of the hierarchy and the structure employed in the directory”
(Bilal & Wang, 2005, p. 1311). When it comes to the implementation of these studies for
a browse search interface, the studies of Bilal and Wang (2005) and Bar-Ilan and Belous
(2007) suggest how to construct hierarchical relationships among concepts and how
deeply or how broadly information should be provided in a browse search.

Lastly, school libraries nowadays call for a child-friendly classification system. Metis
(http://www.metisinnovations.com/) is a categorization system newly developed for
school library practice. Because Metis is a new classification system, there are only a
couple of articles in support of Metis (Kaplan et al., 2013; Kaplan et al., 2012). Its
website and an online blog (http://eye-fours.blogspot.com/search/label/metis) provide
venues for discussion about Metis’s advantages. Metis basically criticizes DDC’s
ineffectiveness for children. According to Kaplan et al. (2012), using DDC in school

24

libraries has three problems: 1) division by discipline, 2) bias by Western perspectives
and cultures, and 3) numerical code. In order to overcome these problems, the Metis uses
visually compelling signs and different classification including 26 broad main categories
(see Table 2-2).

Metis classification is developed based on children’s information seeking behaviors that
have been observed by school librarians. Kaplan et al. (2012) “asked our fourth and fifth
graders to brainstorm the contents of their ideal library in terms of categories or topics.”
They adopted Cooper’s methodology (2002c). Given that DDC was not originally
developed for children whereas Metis reflects real voices from children, the movement
toward using the Metis classification seems natural.

25

2.1.3.2. Naming
Children not only perceive concepts at different levels of hierarchical classification, but
also use different terms to express information needs. Studies of naming or labeling
concepts by children have not been paid sufficient attention. Although there are many
studies about the extent of match between users’ terms and subject headings by using
transaction log analysis (Carlyle, 1989; Greenberg, 2001; Taylor, 1984) or recently
through tagging studies (Kipp, 2005; Lu, Park, & Hu, 2010; Rolla, 2009; Yi, 2010), there
are very few studies addressing children’s naming behavior (Abbas, 2005b; Brown, 1994,
1995). The studies about naming examine how children label or name certain concepts by
analyzing terms from keyword search terms from a linguistic viewpoint.

Brown (1995) conducts a cross-sectional study consisting of 3rd grade, 7th grade, 11th
grade, and college students to examine how well subject search terms generated by
participants match with subject headings. This study does not concentrate on children’s
naming behavior, but rather on finding out the reasons of match-failure of subject search
terms. However, Brown (1995, p. 375) exhibits a good understanding of the
characteristics of children’s terms:
For example, a child may have concept of astronomy as a field of study
but lack in his or her vocabulary the word “astronomy” and, therefore,
may name the category, “stars and planets.” Likewise, the child may
encounter a collection of previously unrelated things and, in trying to
group them, sue the description of a common attribute or use for the

26

category name, such as “things to take on a boat trip.” It might be
expected that younger children would have a more limited vocabulary and
fewer or more limited conceptual categories than older students and, as a
consequence, would name labels that are more descriptive (i.e., “things
you take on a camping trip”) than analytic (“camping equipment”).
Children tend to use concrete, simple, and descriptive terms, which is similar to the
findings from Bilal and Wang’s study (2005).

The findings show that simple, concrete, and associative subject search terms are more
likely to bring a higher match with a subject heading. Brown (1995, p. 377) suggests
training metacognitive labeling skills in children in order to obtain better match search
results:
Training and experience might improve the match-success rate of subject
searches by deterring development trends that work against match-success.
We suggest two interventions:
•

Incremental training in metacognitive labeling skills, that is,
training the student to think about the label-naming process; and

•

Incremental situated learning experiences with subject descriptions
and terms used to name them.

Metacognitive labeling skills refer to the ability to think about how subject headings are
created (named or labeled). The conclusion from the study of training metacognitive

27

labeling skills is that it requires cognitive work in children to switch their thought
processes to indexing processes for subject headings. It does not seem to be a
fundamental solution to increase matches between children’s search terms and subject
headings. Rather, changing subject headings to child-friendly terms is more effective, so
that children do not need to go through unnecessary cognitive processes like a
metacognitive labeling process.

Abbas’ study (2005b) focuses on terms generated by children. She analyzes to what
extent children’s expression of information needs are matched with the representations of
resources. Children’s expression of information needs can be found at two levels: driving
questions and search terms. Before creating search terms, children have questions or
information needs. She calls them driving questions (DQ)s. She claims that examining
“children’s DQs enables us [the researchers] to see a little about how they think and the
process they undertake to solve their information need” (p. 1515). After comparing these
two expressions, Abbas (2005b) lastly compares them to the representation of resources
using controlled vocabulary (system terms). Findings from the comparison between
search terms and system terms illustrate that the controlled vocabulary is inadequate to
represent children’s information needs. Terms generated by children tend to be
representative in a more age-appropriate way. The findings are not surprising. However,
Abbas’ study (2005b) cannot explain why terms from three levels do not match each
other or what patterns are among terms from each level. For instance, a student in her
study has a question, “What would happen if you put a Furby in space?” and the student’s
search term is Space travel, while controlled vocabularies such as Astronomy, Space

28

exploration, or Orbits are suggested for the question. Abbas’ study (2005b) especially
cannot explain why children having DQs select/use search terms. Why does the student
use the search term, Space travel? It might be because of lack of knowledge of a domain,
lack of languages/vocabularies, or a different cognitive view, etc. Therefore, it suggests
that it is necessary to understand in depth how children think about concepts and express
them.

2.1.3.3. Metadata schemas
The UK Office for Library and Information Networking (UKOLN)’s formal definition of
metadata is “data associated with objects which relieves their potential users of having to
have full advance knowledge of their existence or characteristics” (Dempsey & Heery,
1997, p. 5). Caplan (2003) also explains that metadata plays a mediate role in resource
discovery, access, and in sharing resources between users and information. In addition,
the development of metadata schemas is one of the most important tasks in initiating
digital libraries. Some libraries create a new metadata schema for their own purposes, and
others create metadata application profiles by combining several metadata standards. The
main criteria in selecting a metadata schema, as answered by cataloging and metadata
professionals, are types of resources and target users/audiences (Park & Tosaka, 2010).
As many definitions of metadata and metadata creations practices show, metadata
schemas need to reflect both users’ information behavior and characteristics of resources
per se.

29

User studies in various context and subject domains have been conducted and have
influenced the domain of metadata. There are two dimensions in user studies and
metadata: 1) metadata evaluation, and 2) metadata development. The first dimension
tends to evaluate how effective or useful existing metadata elements are. Metadata
quality evaluation by users’ reviews covers usefulness, understandability, effectiveness,
or users’ satisfaction (Zhang & Li, 2008; Liddy et al., 2002; Liddy, Allen, & Finneran,
2003). In addition, metadata evaluation is apt to be conducted after a metadata schema is
implemented in practice rather than during the process of developing metadata standards.
On the other hand, the second dimension, metadata development, means that studies of
user’s needs and information seeking behaviors have been used as a foundation of
creating metadata elements (Lee et al, 2013a; Lee et al., 2013b; Lee & Downie, 2004;).
There are relatively fewer user studies for metadata development than there are user
studies for metadata evaluation. Moreover, there is no children’s information seeking
behavior study in order to develop a child-driven metadata schema.

The development of metadata schemas for children has not considered children as a user
group apart or different from adults, with children having specific information behavior
and information needs. Abbas (2005b) points out that the “development of indexing
languages and controlled vocabularies or subject headings lists has focused on the users
as either a homogeneous group with no age specified or on a specific discipline or
domain” (p. 1513). This situation also applies to the development of metadata schemas.
When it comes to metadata studies, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) has
played a pivotal role in developing and nurturing a metadata domain. Beak and Smiraglia

30

(2013) analyze the DCMI conference proceedings from 2001 to 2012 in order to discover
the patterns of emergent research themes. However, the findings show that user groups
are missing from the domain’s definition as it emerges in the domain analysis. For
instance, there is no single study addressing metadata for children’s resources (which is
not the same as K-12 educational resources or Learning Object Metadata).

There are very few studies about children’s metadata schemas (Abbas, 2005a; Beak, 2012;
Beak & Olson, 2011a; 2011b; Druin, 2005; Druin et al., 2001). Abbas (2005a) addresses
examples of metadata schemas for children’s resources, issues related to creating
metadata for children’s resources, and age-appropriate controlled vocabularies. Abbas
(2005a, p. 310) is concerned about the values of metadata like subject headings, and its
consistence and interoperability:
While there is a wide variety of metadata scheme available, content
creation guidelines / rules are not as prevalent in the Web environment
(Sutton, 2004)[3], which can make representation inconsistent and present
many problems to metadata creators who wish to share metadata or who
are concerned with interoperability between their system and other online
systems.
Because these concerns about the values of metadata related to naming were discussed in
the previous section, here I emphasize a different scope of metadata schemas. The

31

meaning of metadata schemas in this study is limited to metadata properties or elements,
and not the values of metadata like controlled vocabularies. In this aspect, there are fewer
studies focusing on the creation of metadata elements.

To create child-appropriate and child-friendly metadata elements, it is necessary to
understand children’s information seeking behavior. The reason why the ICDL has been
used as a good example of a children’s digital library is not only because of its colorful
interface, but also because of the different metadata elements or access points associated
with children’s perspectives. Hutchinson et al. (2005) apply different book selection
criteria to the ICDL’s browsing interface. Considering that book selection criteria is
related to metadata elements, the ICDL creates their own metadata schema including
non-traditional metadata elements such as book cover’s colors, characters, and feeling.
Although there is no specific research article about the ICDL’s metadata schema, Druin
(2005) briefly presents how the ICDL’s metadata schema was created. Druin and ICDL’s
research team interacted with children, and the use of observations and interviews helped
to get a better picture of new metadata elements that reflect children’s thinking and
behavior in the metadata schema (Druin, 2005, p. 30; Hutchinson et al., 2005, Reuter &
Druin, 2004). Beak and Olson (2011a; 2011b) compare two metadata schemas between
AACR2+ (mainly AACR2 and other complementary cataloging and encoding standards)
and the ICDL’s metadata schema in light of children’s information seeking behavior. The
findings show that the ICDL’s metadata schema has more child-appropriate metadata
elements such as book cover’s colors, characters, and feelings. Therefore, the ICDL’s

32

metadata schema seems to more effectively represent children’s unique information
seeking behavior than AACR2+ (see Table 2-3).

Beak (2012) analyzes children’s cognitive processes during book selection through
interviews and observations with six children. Reuter (2007b) also studies children’s
book selection behavior, and identifies many factors and facets related to children’s book
selection. Reuter (2007b) does not associate children’s behavioral factors in relation to
book selection with metadata elements. However, Beak (2012) asserts that the findings
from Reuter’s study (2007b) can play an important role in conveying evidence or reasons
why certain metadata elements should be created for users. Therefore, Beak (2012) reexamines Reuter’s study (2007b) within a context of knowledge organization,
specifically the creation of metadata elements. The findings of Beak’s study (2012) show
results similar to Reuter’s study (2007b) in general. The facets and factors reinforcing
Reuter’s findings are content, genres, familiarity, difficulty, and emotional interest or
arousal. Given that there are two components in knowledge organization: resources and
users, Beak (2012) categorizes the perceptual cognitive factors into three parts: resourcecentered, user-centered, and a combination of resource and user (see Table 2-4).

The categorization shows which factors are more related to resources or users. By
distinguishing these categories, current metadata schemas can be evaluated by how well
the metadata schemas represent both resources and users.

2.2. Key concepts to this research from the literature
Several key concepts such as children, metadata, information, and context need to be
defined for this research. The following section discusses these key concepts within this
research scope by deriving the concepts from the literature.

2.2.1. Children
Children are considered as a different user group from adult users (or even from
adolescent users) in a library setting. The age makes a difference between children and
adults due to different cognitive abilities. Cooper (2005) emphasizes that children are
going through the processes of cognitive, physical, social, and emotional development
that affects interaction with digital technology. Due to children’s developmental
characteristics or abilities, choosing children’s ages for research is an important
procedure for studying children’s information behaviors. The age group of children in the
literature varies. By referring to the Association for Library Services to Children’s 2004

35

fact sheet, Gross (2006) identified children as individuals of fourteen and under (p. 3).
When the age groups of children in the literature of children’s information behavior are
briefly considered, although few studies include children over 11 years old or preschool
children, generally speaking children the term “children” refers to the age between 5 and
11 or between grades first and sixth. Children’s cognitive development has been
considered to select the age of child participants or to interpret children’s information
seeking behaviors (Bilal, 2007; Borgman et al., 1995; Cooper, 2002a; 2002c; Kuhlthau,
1988; Walter, 1994; Yu, 2012).

36

The most commonly used cognitive development theory in the literature is Piaget’s
developmental stage model. Piaget divides children’s cognitive development into four
stages (see Table 2-5). Children in each stage show different cognitive behaviors.
Children in the first two stages are not able to think logically. After the concrete
operational stage, children begin to think logically. In addition, there is a significant
difference between concrete operations and formal operations. Children at the concrete
operational stage can think logically, but their cognitive ability is limited by concrete and
observable objects and events. However, children at the formal operational stage start to
apply their thinking to abstract concepts. In other words, children at the formal
operational stage may be able to use OPAC systems designed for adults through library
literacy skill education. However, children at the concrete operational stage require
different information organization systems like metadata schemas, specifically designed
for them. Piaget’s theory has been criticized due to a lack of consideration of
sociocultural influence and individual variations regarding time periods of each
developmental stage. Nevertheless, Piaget’s theory provides good theoretical support in
terms of selecting the ages of children for research. Based on the characteristics of
cognitive development suggested by Piaget, researchers can obtain broad ideas about
certain age groups. Therefore, Piaget’s theory can assist in defining participants’ ages and
in creating proper experimental tasks.

Piaget’s theory also brings concerns about the terminological representation of subjects.
Children at the concrete operational stage cannot think about an abstract concept. In other
words, children may not be able to understand subject headings described in an abstract

37

term such as “husbandry,” “animal rights,” or “world hunger.” These concepts and terms
can be understood by children at least from the formal operational stage. For instance,
subject headings for elementary school libraries may need to be described in a more
concrete way like “taking care of animals” or “having a pet” instead of “husbandry.” In
this point of view, Piaget’s theory can be used to evaluate children’s subject headings.

Therefore, Piaget’s theory is applied to this study not only for defining children, but also
interpreting children’s information seeking behaviors. Given that much of the previous
literature purposely or randomly chose child participants between ages 5 and 11,
children’s ages in this research may range between 6 to 11 years old. More specific
information about selecting participants will be addressed in Chapter 3 Methodology.

2.2.2. Metadata
Abbas (2005a) generally discusses some issues in metadata schemes development by
introducing OPAC interfaces and digital libraries. Through the overall reviews of
examples of OPAC interfaces and digital libraries for children, Abbas (2005a, p. 313)
reveals the research gaps in developing child-centered systems:
What we do not know much about is (1) children’s understanding of or
mental models of systems or how they work; (2) how this lack of
understanding affects their information seeking; (3) if the new childcentered systems have had a positive effect on their information retrieval,
and (4) how the use of age-appropriate metadata schemes and metadata

38

will alleviate some of the information retrieval obstacles children
encounter.
Previous literature has not studied metadata schemas for children. In addition, there is no
single metadata schema designed by children or specifically targeted for children’s user
groups. This research plays a role in filling the research gaps that Abbas (2005a) points
out above. However, Abbas’ focus of metadata means a different scope of metadata
schema that that of in this study (Beak, 2012; Beak & Olson, 2011a; 2011b). The focus
about metadata in this study pays attention to metadata’s properties or elements, whereas
Abbas (2005a) examines the gaps of research in metadata for children through the values
of metadata such as controlled vocabularies.

As the particular focus of metadata between Abbas (2005a) and this study differ, there
has been no clear definition among metadata scheme(s), schema, and schemata. This
could cause confusion in understanding the concept of metadata in this research. To
clarify the scope of metadata schema(s) in this study, a concept of metadata schema for
this study is defined based on two studies by Greenberg (2005) and Tennis (2007).

Greenberg (2005) reviews the definition of metadata and the conceptualization of a
metadata scheme. She defines a metadata scheme by its functions. A metadata schema is
(Greenberg, 2005, p. 24):

39

1. A collection of metadata elements gathered to support a function, or a
series of functions (e.g., resource discovery, administration, use, etc.),
for an information object.
2. A collection of metadata elements, forming a structured container, to
which data values are added. Data values may be uncontrolled or
controlled (e.g., taken from a source such as LCSH or a standardized
list of values).
3. A collection of data elements, with their attributes formalized in a
specification (or a data dictionary). Examples of element attributes
include the metadata element’s “name,” “identifier,” “label,”
“definition,” and the “date the element was declared.”

According to Tennis’ study about a scheme versioning (Tennis, 2007, p. 87):
Schemas are the total set of assertions that can be made about a resource .
… Schemes are the range of values that can be provided for an assertion
about a resource (date-time format, authority list, controlled vocabulary,
etc.) … schemas allow us to say that a resource has an attribute (a subject),
and a scheme allows us to make explicit what that subject is (the value of
that attribute).

These two studies use the term, metadata scheme, slightly differently. However, based on
the two articles, it is clear to see there are at least two aspects of metadata standards:

40

structural design of metadata elements, and data values or contents of metadata elements.
Since Tennis’ study (2007) distinguishes two terms, this study refers to metadata
schema(s) as a set of metadata elements and metadata scheme(s) as the values or the
contents of individual metadata elements.

2.2.3. Information
The concept of information in the literature of children’s information seeking behaviors
tends to be defined by subjects, genres, or situation. Much of the literature on children’s
information seeking behaviors is from experimental studies in a certain domain. The
science domain has been most frequently studied for children’s information seeking
behaviors (Borgman, Chignell, & Valdez, 1989; Borgman et al., 1995; Bilal, 2000; Bilal
& Wang, 2005; Revelle et al., 2002) and other subject domains such as history (Beheshti
et al., 2010; Large et al., 2009b) are also studied. Without referring to specific subject
domains, general information meant by many studies includes non-fiction and fiction.
Some studies specifically focus on picture books as a type of children’s book (Robinson
et al., 1997; Yu, 2012). Compared to non-fiction, studies about children’s fiction
information seeking behaviors have not been widely studied. Pejtersen’s Book House
OPAC project examines users’ information needs for fiction retrieval (Pejtersen, 1986;
1989). Last, task-based experimental studies are likely to be subject-related or educationrelated information, whereas studies in a natural setting often observe children’s
information behaviors for leisure purpose or fictional information (Reuter, 2007b). Based

41

on these concerns, a working definition of information for this study includes non-fiction,
fiction, and picture books without a certain subject domain.

2.2.4. Context
Context in a study is important to understand children’s information seeking behaviors.
For instance, a place for an interview or observation does matter for children’s behaviors.
Gross (2006, p.8) specifically mentions about issues related to children in context.
In any research setting, the importance of making the research situation
relevant to child participants cannot be enough. When child participants
do not understand and share the researcher’s goals, are bored, or are taken
away from a preferred activity in order to participate in the research, the
potential for validity problems increase . … Understanding children,
attitudes about children, and the context within which they are observed
and studies all contribute to an increased ability to make sense of research
data and to evaluate the impact of the environment on the children and the
children on their environment.

Context may consider physical and social aspects of the environment “such as gender,
culture, and age as well as understanding the environment in terms of the norms for
behavior in that place” (Gross, 2006, p. 8). For example, Beak (2012) explains the
limitation of the study by physical aspects of book shelving. Since the children in her

42

research interact with books that are already shelved, the information that the children
first face may be limited to the titles of book spines or author’s names. Describing a
physical context enables audiences to understand children’s information behavior in a
situation of a research environment, so that it brings more reasonable interpretation about
children’s information behavior.

Given that this study aims to understand children’s intuitive cognitive processes during
book selection, a natural setting will be more effective than a task-based study. A taskbased study means that child participants are required to solve certain problems or to
perform given tasks. For instance, finding resources about a subject for an assignment is a
task. However, a study in a natural setting refers that there is a no given task. Instead,
child participants are asked to interact with books. Child participants can simply browse
books or find books for fun reading.

The distinction between a task-based study and a study in a natural setting can be
addressed by contexts of information needs and information wants. Walter (1994, p. 112)
points out the difference between children’s information needs and wants by citing
Andrew Green (1990): “The element, however, that most clearly distinguishes a need
from a want or a demands is that there is no necessary self-awareness of a need.” Walter
(1994) asserts that children’s information needs tend to occur without being aware of
needs, but by necessity. On the contrary, information wants are likely to be generated by
“self-awareness of a need.” For instance, children need information for school

43

assignments, but children want a book for fun reading. Children’s information needs tend
to be imposed by school teachers or other adults. “Children surely have self-identified
information needs and wants, but much of the information that is provided to them is
information they never asked for” (Walter, 1994, p. 112). Since the concepts of
information needs and wants are different, this difference may influence not only
children’s information seeking behaviors, but also the information organization. Children
with information needs might have certain information or ideas regarding how to find
information. Studies of information needs tend to be conducted in a tasked-based setting.
Task characteristics influence children’s information behaviors. When children know a
subject that they need to find, they directly look for the subject. In this case, a subject is
the best and most obvious access point for find resource. However, when children look
for books that they want to read for fun, various access points such as genres, characters,
or illustration can exist. Information organization also needs to understand the differences
that can be caused by information needs and information wants. Therefore, this research
is more likely to be concerned with information wants rather than information needs.
Studying information wants in a natural setting seems more effective to understand
children’s natural cognitive processes and information seeking behaviors.

2.3. Dominant and alternative perspectives in the discourse
So far this chapter has reviewed literature in children’s information seeking behaviors,
interface design, and several topics related to children’s information organization. After

44

reviewing the literature, the dominant aspects and minor aspects of the literature emerge
in the discourse.

First of all, the most dominant view of the discourse in children’s information seeking
behaviors seems to take a cognitive constructivist stance. In addition to the cognitive
constructivism, the dominant assumption about children agrees that children have
different cognitive processes, so that their information seeking behaviors differ from
adults. “Cognitive constructivism in IS [information science] starts from the assumption
that the individual mind generates knowledge by creating knowledge structures and
mental models which represent world and mediate – or filter – information” (Talja,
Tuominen, & Savolainen, 2005, p. 83). There are many researchers taking into account
cognitive constructivism, studying user’s information seeking behaviors, and developing
information processing or seeking models; these include Dervin’s sense-making model,
Bates’s berry-picking model, Belkin’s ASK (Anomalous States of knowledge) model,
and other information processing models by Saracevic, Kuhlthau, and Ingwersen.
Cognitive constructivism is introduced when LIS moves from a system-oriented to a
user-oriented paradigm. Dervin and Nilan (1986) call for a paradigm shift in information
needs and uses research, identifying six aspects of the paradigm shift (p. 12-16). One
aspect of the paradigm shift is the research focus’s movement from external behavior to
internal cognition. “Traditionally, research has focused on externals (e.g., contacts with
sources and uses of systems as indicators of needs) rather than internals (e.g., cognitive
assessments)” (Dervin & Nilan, 1986, p. 15). “System-centred research that focuses on
the system aspects of information retrieval including retrieval algorithms, indexing,

45

interface design, and so on, and user-centred research that focuses on the human
information behavior (HIB), and user-centred or cognitive approaches to the design of
information retrieval system” (Chowdhury, 2004, p. 216).
As the focus of research in the user-oriented paradigm shows, the user-centered
perspective considers users as active information seekers and cognitive processers.
Bowler et al. (2011) assert that user-centered design “places users at the center of the
design so that the outcome of a design – the artifact- can be easily used by the people for
whom it was created” (Bowler et al., 2011, p. 724). A user-centered design paradigm also
brings different methods or strategies such as participatory design (Bilal, 2002a),
cooperative inquiry (Druin, 2002; 2005), or bonded design (Large et al., 2007) for
developing user-centered interface design for children (Bowler et al., 2011 p. 732-734).

Beak and Olson (2011a) take into account a user-centered approach and a systemcentered approach in relation to information retrieval and two aspects of information
organization; expression of users’ information needs and representation of information
(see Figure 2-1). In terms of research focus, it is clear that a user-centered approach
dominantly influences children’s information behavior studies. However, what does the
discourse of children’s information behaviors with user-centered approach suggest for
implementation? As figure 1 shows, there are two ways of improving information
retrieval systems: 1) reflecting users’ perspectives and information needs into retrieval
systems and 2) developing searching algorithms, indexing, or other knowledge
representation systems.

46

Figure 2-1. IR and two aspects of IO (Beak & Olson, 2011a, p. 3)

So far, current discourses of children’s information behaviors tend to combine both usercentered approach and system-centered approach only for the sake of information
retrieval. The dominant implementations by the discourses of children’s information
behaviors suggest the changes of information retrieval systems or the changes of
interfaces rather than information organization. Information organization, at least in
developing metadata schemas for children, hardly takes into account user-centered
perspectives or users’ information seeking behaviors. Given that information organization
plays a fundamental role in supporting information retrieval, current discourse shows a
paucity of studies about knowledge organization systems reflecting users’ perspectives
and information seeking behaviors.

Compared to dominant implementations for information retrieval purposes, there are very
few studies interpreting or using the results of children’s information seeking behaviors

47

in order to improve KOS. Children’s perspectives or information seeking behaviors are
associated with three types of knowledge representations. Beak (2012, p. 2) addresses the
theoretical relationships of two components of information organization; representation
of information and expression of users (see Figure 2-2):
The representation of information consists of various KOS, e.g., metadata
schemes, classification, thesaurus, controlled vocabularies, and taxonomy.
On the other side, users express their information needs. As pointed out
above, users’ expression takes place in three types of cognitive processes.
When it comes to the relationship between representation of information
and expression of users, metadata elements correspond to conceptual
aspects of information. Existing metadata elements tend to represent facets
of information, that implies that metadata elements are able to reflect users’
cognition related to perception. Secondly, results of categorization in
cognitive processes can be depicted by classification, thesaurus, taxonomy,
etc. Lastly, a naming process suggests that, to some extent, controlled
vocabularies like Sears subject headings use child-friendly terminology.

48

Figure 2-2. Relationship between representation of information and expression of users
(Beak, 2012, p.2)

Within an information organization domain, current literature has paid relatively less
attention to the creation of metadata schemas for children than any other discourse
associated with cognitive processes of categorizing and naming. It is surprising that there
has been no single metadata schema describing children’s resources and targeting
children as a user group. Although the ICDL created its own metadata schema, because
of limited information access about its metadata schema, there are problems with its
examination or evaluation as well as questions about interoperability. As a matter of fact,
there is a no metadata schema for children. Therefore, I aim to develop a child-driven
metadata schema describing children’s resources and targeting children’s user group
through a study of children’s information seeking behavior and cognitive processes
during book selection.

49

Chapter 3: Methodology
This chapter describes an overview of the research design including research questions,
data collection and analysis. The aim of this study is to understand children’s perceptual
cognitive factors related to book selection in multiple dimensions in order to develop a
child-driven, child-appropriate metadata schema for children’s resources. Previously,
Reuter (2007b) examined children’s book selection behavior in a recreational setting.
This study proposes different research topics and points of view. Given that both Reuter’s
study and this study focus on children’s information behavior in a broad sense, this study
has been methodologically influenced by Reuter’s study. The methods of the two studies,
however, are not identical. Based on experience gained from a pilot study (Beak, 2012),
this study modifies data collection components. It uses triangulated qualitative research
methods consisting of questionnaire, observation, interview, and anecdotal diary.

3.1. Research questions
This study addresses the following research questions. The first research question (RQ 1)
is a broader question regarding the purpose of the study. Research question 2, 3, and 4
represent sequential and specific goals during development of a child-driven metadata
schema (see Figure 3-1).

50

Figure 3-1. Research questions

RQ 1) What metadata elements do children like to use? What elements should a childdriven metadata schema include?
In order to create a metadata schema that is driven from children’ cognitive processes and
behaviors, the broader research questions are designed to understand what metadata
elements children like to use when they select and browse books. The focus of this
research question is related to a child-driven approach. In other words, while various
existing metadata schemas tend to be designed by a resource-centered approach, the main
research question represents a general epistemological stance of this study, which is userdriven.

51

RQ 2) What perceptual cognitive factors and facets do children use to select books?
This research question is designed to explore and discover children’s cognitive processes
during book selection. In other words, what components or aspects of books do children
perceive when they interact with books? There are many components in books such as
titles, authors, pictures, publishers, texts, or book shapes. Among these various
components of books, children might perceive certain components and aspects more than
others. Concrete and sensible components of books can be interpreted as cognitive factors
that children perceive by looking or touching, while abstract and conceptual aspects can
correspond to cognitive facets that children aim to perceive by perceiving factors. Thus
this research question is intended to identify children’s cognitive factors and facets during
book selection.

RQ 3) What roles do the cognitive factors and facets play in a context of metadata
schema?
This research question is designed to reinterpret the cognitive factors and facets that
children perceive during book selection for the sake of the development of a child-driven
metadata schema. This study consists of two main parts in terms of data analysis. The
first part is related to children’s cognitive processes and information seeking behaviors,
which is answered by the second research questions. The second part of data analysis is
based on the first stage of data analysis. In other words, children’s cognitive factors and
facets are used as a foundation for developing a child-driven metadata schema. Therefore,

52

the third research question enables me to translate the meaning and functions of
children’s cognitive factors and facets into a metadata context.

RQ 4) How can child-driven metadata elements be defined?
The last research question is designed to provide clear and concise definitions for each
metadata element. A child-driven metadata schema consists of several attributes such as
element name, definition, comment, refinement, and value type.

3.2. Research design
3.2.1. Recruitment
A snowball sampling strategy was employed for this study. Recruitment occurred onsite
and online. First, I contacted branch library directors in the Milwaukee Public Library
(MPL) and other city library systems in the Milwaukee area in order to distribute
information fliers for recruitment and to obtain permission for conducting the study (see
Appendix A). Recruitment fliers (see Appendix B) were also distributed at a summer
concert at Washington Park, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The concert was open to the public,
and there were many parents with their children at the park. Therefore, I visited a public
park and met many parents and children. In addition, information fliers were also posted
on a social network, Facebook, to advertise the study. Social network sites not only
allowed information about this study to be available online, but people on the social
network site played a role in advertising the study, so that participants were recruited by

53

snowball sampling. Once children decided to participate in the study, parents were
required to complete a registration form (see Appendix C), which asked for demographic
information such as age, grade, gender, library use, language, contact information, a
friend’s name, and so on. This online registration form was one of two questionnaires
used in this study.

Participants were recruited in pairs. When a child wanted to participate in the study, he or
she was asked to invite a friend. Instead of matching children assigned by me,
participants recruited their friends. This type of the recruitment allowed participants to
encourage thinking aloud in a more comfortable setting. More than 22 children registered
for the study, but budget constrained the number of participants. Basically, a first-come
first-served method was applied for participants. However, some pairs were selected
based on recommendations of librarians or parents. As an incentive, I provided $50 book
store gift cards to participants at the end of data collection.

3.2.2. Participants
This section summarizes data from a demographic questionnaire used for recruitment.
The questionnaire was completed by participants’ parents in order to obtain sociodemographic information, education level, family information, library usage, etc. (see
Appendix C). This questionnaire was available online and in hard copy. Table 3-1 shows
children’s demographic information, including academic achievement level. Table 3-2
shows demographic information about parents and family information.

3.2.2.1. Age and Grades
The range of children is very broad. “The Association for Library Service to Children
defines ‘children’ as individuals age fourteen and under” (Gross, 2006, p. 3). This scope
is made based on Jean Piaget’s four stages of children’s cognitive development (Piaget,
1960). Piaget divided children’s cognitive development into four stages: 1) sensorimotor,
2) preoperations, 3) concrete operations, and 4) formal operations. Children at each stage
show different characteristics in cognitive development. Section 2.2.1 in Chapter 2

58

defines a concept of children in this study by using Piaget’s cognitive development (see
Table 2-5). Given that children in the formal operational stage tend to think like adults,
cognitive ability of children in the formal operational stage is able to learn how to use
current OPAC systems. In order to design a metadata schema for children younger than
those in the formal operational stage, this study was focused on children in the concrete
operational stage. Therefore, the term “children” in this research refers to early
elementary school students, aged 6 to 9 or in 1st to 3rd grade.
Figure 3-2. Participants’ ages and grades

Among 22 children (or 11 pairs), there were nine participants age 6, nine participants age
7, and four participants age 8. In terms of grades, eleven were in the first graders, six
were the second graders, and five were the third graders (see Figure 3-2).

3.2.3. IRB and Confidentiality
The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved
the study involving child subjects (see Appendix E). To protect their privacy, participants’
names were replaced by letters of the alphabet. All data, including video files,
questionnaire (online and hard-copy), and transcriptions have been securely stored.

3.3. Data collection
3.3.1. Data collection methods
When research deals with child subjects, there are some questions of data validity or
relevance. Gross (2006) points out that children tend to provide answers in a way that
they think a researcher or an adult wants to hear rather than disclosing what they are

60

really thinking. In addition, children sometimes provide irrelevant answers so they can
finish the interview (Gross, 2006, p. 15). This kind of interview data cannot provide a
good understanding of participants’ perspectives or experiences. To understand data
generated by children, triangulated mixed methods are useful. For instance, observation
or other methods like diaries can complement interview data. By combining multiple
methods, I was able to gain an in-depth understanding of participants’ perspectives and
behaviors. Therefore, this study used triangulated mixed methods consisting of
questionnaires, observation, interview, and diary. All these different methods
complemented each other. Figure 3-4 shows the data collection procedures. The
following section describes the specific procedure of each data collection method.
Figure 3-4. Data collection procedures

3.3.1.1. Questionnaires: Demographic questionnaire and Background questionnaire
There were two types of questionnaires: one for participants’ parents in order to obtain
socio-demographic information, educational level, family information, library usages, etc.

61

(see Appendix C), and the other one is for child participants to obtain information on
prior reading or multi-media experiences, hobbies, current activities, etc. (see Appendix
D). The first questionnaire was used during the recruitment phase; the second
questionnaire was used after recruiting child participants and during the initial meeting.
While most participants filled out the questionnaire in written format, some children were
not proficient in writing. Therefore, the second questionnaire was partially audio
recorded.

According to Reuter’s study (2007b), reading attitude, media-use, or reading habits
influence cognitive processes during book selection. Understanding participants’ reading
habits, activities, or hobbies provides more holistic insights of children’s information
seeking behaviors. Therefore, the second questionnaire was designed to obtain
background information such as prior reading experiences, knowledge, hobbies, current
activities, and so on. The questions used in the second questionnaire were influenced by
Reuter’s study (2007b). Data collected from the second questionnaire is described in
Chapter 4, Findings.

3.3.1.2. Observation of children’s interaction with books: Paired think aloud
method
Think aloud method has been developed in psychological research (Ericsson & Simon,
1984) and has been widely used in various research areas such as cognitive science,
education, human computer interaction, psychology, sociology, etc. Think aloud

62

generates data of verbal reports. Therefore, think aloud is often referred to as verbal
protocol analysis. The verbal protocol analysis method is very useful in studying
cognitive processes. Think aloud asks subjects in a study to verbalize their thought
processes while solving a problem or performing a task. The use of the think aloud
method enables researchers to develop mental models or models of cognitive processes
(Van Someren, Barnard, & Sandberg, 1994).

The LIS discipline also adopts a think aloud method. As a qualitative research method,
think aloud has been used to provide rich and in-depth data about human information
behavior including information seeking and searching behavior, usability, and user
evaluation studies (Xie & Benoit III, 2013; Lemieux, 2013; Lucassen et al., 2013; Xie &
Joo, 2012; Bauer & Peterson-Hart, 2012; Branch, 2000; 2001; Williamson et al., 2012;
Beak, 2012). Reuter (2007b) studied children’s book selection behaviors in a recreational
setting with a perspective on literacy development. Although Reuter (2007b, p. 148)
didn’t use a think aloud method while examining children’s book selection behavior and
thought process, she suggested a think aloud method to make sense of children’s behavior
through the though process:
Because children mentioned the factors that influenced their selections
retrospectively, the actions observed do not always coincide with the
factors mentioned. As a result, this aspect of the model is currently
hypothetical. Future research is needed to explore the relationship between
the behavioral and cognitive processes of book selection. Think-aloud

63

protocols might be used to align children’s behaviors and thought
processes more comprehensively.

Although the think aloud method has been popularized in LIS, most studies using think
aloud methods were conducted with adults or young adults. There are few studies that
apply a think aloud method for children or adolescents (Branch, 2000; 2001; Beak, 2012).
A think aloud method requires participants to describe information occurring in a
working memory. In other words, participants need to report whatever they are currently
thinking, feeling, looking at, or hearing. All of these kinds of conscious and concurrent
information are temporarily held in working memory. Adult participants not only have
more working memory, they also have better cognitive ability to report their working
memory, whereas children have comparatively limited space in working memory, limited
vocabularies and cognitive abilities to verbalize their thoughts. Van Someren, Barnard,
and Sandberg (1994) also briefly mentioned some difficulties in think aloud by children.
They suggested possible reasons why children have difficulty with think aloud: “due to
their verbalization skills, to the content of their thought processes or to the general
difficulty of concentrating on a problem-solving task” (p. 36). Therefore, in order to
apply a think aloud method to child participants, previous training is required or child
participants needs some type of assistance to think aloud.

This study modified a traditional think aloud method to a paired think aloud method.
Paired think aloud is not a novelty. Lemieux (2013) used it to analyze archivists’ thought

64

processes while they conducted archival procedures. As a cognitive task analysis, this
study used a verbal protocol and visual analytics. The interesting fact on Lemieux’s study
is modification of a verbal protocol. A think aloud method in this study has been
combined with pair analytics (Arias-Hernández et al., 2011). Before explaining pair
analytics, it is necessary to address some shortcomings of a think aloud. Van Someren,
Barnard, and Sandberg (1994) identified five issues related to validity of data generated
by a think aloud method (p. 32-33).
•

Invalidity due to disturbance of the cognitive process

•

Invalidity and incompleteness due to memory errors

•

Invalidity due to interpretation by the subject

•

Incompleteness due to synchronization problems

•

Invalidity due to problems with working memory

A common problematic situation in a think aloud method is that participants tend to
verbalize their thoughts less frequently as they are engaged in a task. This is related to
invalidity due to disturbance of the cognitive process and synchronization problems.
Lemieux (2013) attempted to overcome the weakness of a think aloud method by
allowing participants to work in pairs of two (p. 469). Working as a pair enables
participants to encourage thinking aloud while performing a task. This seems to work for
child participants as well. Before conducting this study, a pilot study was conducted with
6 children using interview and observation (Beak, 2012). This pilot study also faced
similar problems, including lack of verbalization of the subjects’ thought processes. After
engaging in playing with or selecting books, participants tended to forget about thinking
aloud. Although the researcher tried not to interrupt the children’s thought process, which

65

is related to “invalidity due to disturbance of the cognitive process” (Van Someren,
Barnard, & Sandberg, 1994, p. 32), intervention was required during the children’s
interactions with books in order to encourage them to think aloud. Based on this previous
experience, for this study I tried to adopt a pair analytics method to a think aloud method.

Participants in this study were recruited as a pair. Each pair was trained in how to think
aloud in an initial meeting. Children have difficulty thinking aloud without my assistance.
However, interaction between me and a child participant can introduce bias into the
participant’s thought process. Therefore, it might be more effective to observe
interactions between two child participants rather than an interaction between me and a
child participant. By interacting with a peer, a participant feels more comfortable and
active. This setting, of a paired think aloud, not only makes participants feel interested in
the study, but also allows them to think aloud in more natural way.

During a paired think aloud, I observed participants’ conversation and interactions with
books by positioning herself near bookshelves where the participants browsed, in order to
hear their voices. All activities were video and audio recorded. Observation included
participants’ movement and monologue in interactions with books, and interactions with
their friends, parents, other people at the library, and me. I tried to be involved as little as
possible in participants’ interaction with books. However, when a pair of participants did
not make any comments or conversations to explain why they picked up or looked at a
book, I intervened by asking questions such as “Why are you looking at this book?,”

66

“Why did you put down this book?,” or “What kind of books are you looking for?.” By
asking these questions in the moment rather than in a later interview, participants not
only required fewer cognitive work processes for recalling memories, but also their
responses were more genuine and intuitive.

3.3.1.3. Interview with children: Think after
There are two types of verbal protocol analysis: Think aloud and Think after or
concurrent verbal reports and retrospective verbal reports. Think aloud or concurrent
verbal reports generate data about cognitive processes, while a subject is conducting a
task, whereas think after or retrospective verbal reports occur after task completion.
Interview in this study refers to a think after method. From a paired think aloud,
participants were observed and generated their thought processes while interacting with
books. However, participants might not have provided clear verbal reports or might not
have completely reported their thought process. Moreover, I might interpret children’s
behaviors differently than what the children really meant. To reduce these
misunderstandings and obtain better understandings of participants’ book selection
behaviors and their thought processes, a think after method was used. In the think after
interview, I asked questions focusing on “why” participants selected books. The
following are some examples of think after questions.
•

How did you choose this book? Why did you look at this book?

•

What was important to you when choosing this book?

•

What kinds of things did you look for when choosing a book?

67

•

What was the most important thing about choosing a book?

•

What do you like about this one? What made you choose this book?

•

Why did you put down this book?

3.3.1.4. Diaries
A diary method provided supplementary data on children’s book selection behaviors and
cognitive processes. Participants were given a diary consisting of semi-structured
questions (See Appendix F). Participants were required to keep an anecdotal diary about
what they read a couple times a week.

The semi-structured questions include the

following questions:
•

What did you read today?

•

Why did you select this book to read? Or what made you choose this book?

•

How do you describe this book?

•

Did you like this book or not? Why?

•

How do you think you can find other books like this one?

Instead of asking a question such as “What is the title of a book that you read?,” a semistructured question in a diary asked “What did you read today?.” Asking for the title of a
book might influence participants’ cognitive perception. By allowing participants to
describe a book that they read in any narrative style, I tried not to bias their responses by
providing any cues related to books.

68

Given participants’ writing proficiency, it was determined that writing a diary might be
challenging for participants. Therefore, a Skype meeting was offered. Instead of writing a
diary, participants could meet me through Skype and discuss what they read using diary
questions. However, none of participants chose to use the Skype option. The other
alternative was dictation. Parents were asked not to force children to answer in certain
ways. Instead, parents helped participants keep a diary by dictating what the children said.

3.4. Data collection procedures
3.4.1. Initial meeting and background questionnaires
An initial meeting was designed to understand participant’s background information
using questionnaires. In addition, I explained the data collection procedures during
participants’ library visits.

Two participants, as a pair, attended an initial meeting.

Locations for the initial meeting were chosen for participant convenience. During the
initial meeting, participants were also trained in how to think aloud. By practicing think
aloud with favorite books, the participants became accustomed to the think aloud process.

It is important to build trust between researcher and participant at the initial meeting. The
relationship might influence a participants’ cognitive thought process. For example, if
participants feel that they are observed, their thought process may be changed and they
may answer with what they believe I want to hear instead of what they truly think. To

69

reduce this risk, it is necessary to spend a good amount of time with participants before
the actual data collection in order to build comfortable and trust-based relationship.

3.4.2. Library visits
Participants visited a library three times. Each visit took between 30 minutes and an hour.
Libraries were chosen based on participant convenience. During the library visit,
observation for paired think aloud, interview for think after, and diary review were
conducted. All activities during the library visits were recorded using a digital video
camera (Canon Vixia HFS21) and digital audio recorder (Canon DM-100).

3.4.3. Library Settings
This section describes the physical settings of each of the four local public libraries in
Metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Brown Deer Public Library, Greendale Public
Library, Wauwatosa Public Library, and Zablocki Public Library were visited for this
study. All libraries have similar arrangements for children’s materials. Library settings
influence children’s book selection behaviors. Since this study took a place in physical
library setting, it is necessary to provide information about unique library settings in
order to understand participants’ book selection behaviors better.

Among four libraries, only the Wauwatosa Public Library has a separate room for
children’s materials. Children’s materials were generally organized by easy readers,

70

picture books, chapter books, graphic novels, juvenile fiction, non-fiction books, and
special collections like new books, Spanish books, Christmas, or Mysteries. Within each
section, children’s materials tend to be alphabetically organized by author’s last name.
Appendix G shows photographs of libraries.

The

Greendale

Public

Library

organizes

children’s picture books differently than do other
libraries. It uses yellow shelf markers showing
character’s images (see Photo 3-1). First, picture
books are organized by author’s last name. When
picture books by the same author have unique
characters, such as Clifford (a dog character in
Photo 3-1), yellow shelf makers are used to
indicate the characters. Picture books are sort of
organized by characters, but not by character’s
names. This organization system is not novel, Photo 3-2. Shelf markers of characters

given a basic organization is author’s last name.
However, adding character’s shelf markers in picture book section allows children to
easily recognize characters more than other factors like author’s name. Character’s shelf
markers also influence children’s book selection behaviors. The detailed description
about children’s book selection behavior related to character’s shelf markers is discussed
in Chapter 4, Findings.

71

3.5. Data analysis
This section describes data analysis procedures. After completing video and audio
recordings and collecting diaries, video data were transcribed. For the sake of participants’
privacy, participants’ names were replaced by letters of the alphabet. In addition, my
name was also replaced by the letter Z throughout all transcriptions. Transcribing
processes consisted of two steps. For the first draft transcriptions, two undergraduate
students were hired to transcribe data. Once this was done, I edited the transcriptions by
adding field notes. In sum, 34 transcripts were generated in Word document format.
Other data, including written data of questionnaires and diaries, were scanned and created
as PDF files.

Figure 3-5. Data analysis process: Grounded theory approach

To analyze the data, I used a grounded theory approach (see Figure 3-5). Grounded
theory has been used in LIS and its applicability, opportunity, and challenges have been
discussed in a LIS context (Seldén, 2005; Mansourian, 2006; Tan, 2010). According to
Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss who are the creators of grounded theory, grounded
theory is “the discovery of theory from data” (Glaser & Strauss, 1976, p. 1). After the

72

book, The Discovery of the Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research,
written in 1967, Glaser and Strauss suggested different approaches of grounded theory,
thereafter there have been many divergences in grounded theory. However, Haig (1995)
notes a general and comprehensive definition of grounded theory:
The general goal of grounded theory research is to construct theories in
order to understand phenomena. A good grounded theory is one that is: (1)
inductively derived from data, (2) subjected to theoretical elaboration, and
(3) judged adequate to its domain with respect to a number of evaluative
criteria.

A benefit of using grounded theory tends to be more highlighted when a phenomenon has
not been explored, therefore, when a researcher aims to discover new core concepts or
theory out of empirical data. From the literature review in Chapter 2, I see that there has
not been a study about children’s cognitive processes and information seeking behaviors
during book selection in relation to the development of a child-driven metadata schema.
In that respect, a grounded theory approach enables me not only to explore and
understand children’s cognitive processes and information seeking behaviors through
empirical data with an open mind, but also to generate a child-driven metadata schema
through the interpretation of emergence of new concepts and their interrelationship.

Mansourian (2006, p. 388) notes that the divergence in grounded theory is due to
different methodological procedures:

73

In fact, the later divergence in GT [Grounded Theory] and disagreements
between the originators is not about the ontological and epistemological
aspects of the GT, but it mainly arises from their differences about the
details of methodological procedures, such as how to code the data and
how develop the categories.

Tan (2010, p. 102-106) and Mansourian (2006, p. 391-392) contrast the different coding
strategies in grounded theory (see Table 3-3):

Glaser and Strauss (1967) explained a constant comparative method regarding how to
code data. The basic idea of a constant comparative method is to code each incident and
to compare a code with the previous codes by checking whether they are similar or
different to integrate and create categories. Later, Glaser (1978, 1992) suggested two
levels of coding, substantive coding and theoretical coding, while Strauss and Corbin
(1990, 1998) expended to three levels, open coding, axial coding, and selective coding.
Because there are so many divergences in grounded theory, it is hard to follow a specific
notion of grounded theory. Therefore, I quoted Creswell’s words (2007, p. 106):

74

Grounded theory provides a procedure for developing categories of
information (open coding), interconnecting the categories (axial coding),
building a story that connects the categories (selective coding), and ending
with a discursive set of theoretical propositions.

All transcripts were transferred to qualitative data analysis software, QSR Nvivo 10. At
the open coding stage, codings (or nodes in a term of Nvivo) were created based on
findings of the pilot study (Beak, 2012). At the axial coding stage, coding was
categorized by cognitive facets. Cognitive factors are referents often directly mentioned
or pointed out by participants or observable children’s behaviors noticed by me.
Cognitive facets emerge from these factors by representing certain aspects of the
children’s perceptions. Chapter 4 identifies and explains the cognitive facets and factors
with examples of the children’s accounts. After identifying cognitive factors and facets, I
interpret the meaning of the cognitive factors and facets in a context of development of a
child-driven metadata schema. Through the selective coding process, a child-driven
metadata schema is developed in Chapter 5. As the last step of the data analysis, I provide
a holistic understanding of the children’s cognitive processes during book selection in
Chapter 6. In addition, Chapter 6 discusses the findings by reviewing the literature in
order to look at how previous literature such as topics in information process theory,
attention, and emotion could interpret the children’s cognitive processes.

75

3.6. Limitations
There are four explicit limitations of this study. First, this was a qualitative study with no
attempt to generalize results from the sample participants to a larger population. That said,
there were 22 children in 11 pairs recruited for this study, which was larger than that
participant group used by Reuter (2007b), who recruited 20 children (p. 42). Still, it is
likley that the small group of 22 participants here have not represented all possible
children’s book selection behavior and cognitive behavior.

A second limitation was that the study was conducted in a library setting and participants
were interacting with physical books, not with an OPAC systems or e-books. Section
3.4.3 describes unique arrangements of the books in these libraries. These physical
settings might influence children’s cognitive processes and book selection behaviors. It
might also cause cognitive processes different from those used when children find books
with an OPAC system or e-books.

Third, the participants visited a library three times for this study. Each library visit took
between 30 minutes and an hour. Although diaries generated supplemental data outside
of the library settings, the limited library visits and diaries together might not cover the
full range of children’s book selection behaviors.

76

Finally, think aloud data generated by child participants might not be as profound and
natural as think aloud data generated by adults. During the initial meeting, participants
learned how to think aloud. Moreover, a think after interview and diaries were used to
complement the think aloud method in this study. Possibly, the lone one time practice of
thinking aloud might not have been enough training for child participants.

77

Chapter 4: Findings
This chapter discusses the findings of the child participants’ book selection behaviors.
The first section of this chapter describes the child participants’ background information
asked during the initial meeting. The second section describes cognitive factors and
facets occurring while the children interacted with and selected books at libraries. The
last section of this chapter discusses emergent vocabularies representing emotion and
how emotion is associated with the cognitive factors and facets.

4.1. Initial meeting and background questionnaire
4.1.1. Description of the children
This section describes the background information of child participants in each pair,
which was asked during the initial meeting. The purpose of the initial meeting was not
only to understand information that might influence the children’s book selection
behaviors, but also to create trust between me and the two children in each pair in order
to ensure that the children felt comfortable participating in the study. The semi-structured
questionnaires helped me lead the conversation for the initial meeting. However,
sometimes the children did not have an answer for some of the questions. In these cases, I
let the conversation flow, so the children were able to share whatever they wanted to talk
about regarding their reading and other personal activities. For this reason, some of the
descriptions of the children’s background information are not consistent with the
sequential order of the questions. The data in tables of this section were either transcribed
from participant’s writings or transcribed from audio recordings. Italics mean titles of

78

books, TV shows, or movies. Quotation marks mean accounts from participants, either in
a written format or in an audio format. Descriptions in brackets indicate a summary of the
children’s answers by me or when I added information for the sake of clarification.

Child A did not talk about a particular topic that she wanted to read about. Child A tends
to browse bookshelves to see whether there are any books she might be interested in
rather than finding books by specific topics or subjects. An interesting answer by child A
regarding how to select books was to look at a back of a book in order to know what it is
about. This implies that child A considers subjects or topics.

79

Both children said that they sometimes found books related to their hobbies. For instance,
child B was interested in baseball, so he asked his mom where to find books about
baseball. In this instance, child B usually asked a librarian when he needed to select
books on a specific topic. In addition, child B mentioned using an online catalog, but he
did not explain how to search books in an online catalog.

Children C and D were sisters. Child C was the oldest. They have a younger brother.
They usually read books together or child C often reads to her younger sister, child D.
(“Sometimes, I [Child C] read ‘Hop on Pop’ or Dr. Seuss’s books to D.”) Therefore,
they shared many common experiences in terms of reading. Child C was good at writing,
but child D has just started to learn how to read and write. However, child D’s reading
skill is better than writing. Child C mentioned that her favorite author was Bruce Coville.
She also remembered titles of Bruce Coville’s books like My Teacher Is an Alien. It was
interesting that child C remembered a specific author’s name. While child D had less
experience finding books by herself, child C explained that she usually looked at a book
cover or the back of a book to see whether it was funny. Child C described funny books
as books having an alien or three kids on a book cover.

Participants in pair 3 were not able to answer the written questionnaire. Therefore, the
initial meeting was casual conversation to get to know each other. The general finding of

81

the initial meeting was that neither child E and child F understood the difference between
fiction and non-fiction. Instead, they answered that they liked to read picture books and
fairytales. In addition, they were not able to recall any book title as their favorite. Child F
described her favorite book with a subject; Animal.

Child E did not have any siblings. She liked movies with characters of a ballerina or a
princess. Her favorite characters were in the “Elephant and Piggie series.” The
character’s names are Gerald, an elephant, and Piggie, a pig. However, she referred their
names as “piggie, and elephant.” She liked to read about dogs, cats, fish, or other
animals. She mentioned that she liked reading in her free time. Because she was learning
how to read, reading itself seemed to be the most important when she selected books. She
answered that she usually found books by looking at books or pages.

Child F had a hard time articulating the answers for the questionnaire. Therefore, I tried
to focus on developing a relationship between us rather than forcing her to answer
questions. Based on the data from the initial meeting, she liked books about animals. Her
favorite character is Peppa Pig, a main character in a British Children’s animated TV
series, “Peppa Pig.” She usually read books her mom selected for her.

Child G said that he liked a robot movie, but didn’t mention a specific movie title or a
name of a robot. Instead, he described his favorite character as a blue robot. It shows that
child G perceived the color of character more strongly than other aspects of a character,
such as the name of a character. Child H described her favorite book as Gerald and Piggie.
Gerald and Piggie is not a book title, but rather the names of characters in the Elephant
and Piggie series. It shows that child H perceived characters more importantly and series
title or individual titles of the series.

Child H was able to distinguish fiction and non-fiction (“non-fiction book is non-believe
book, and fiction book is believe book, that is real.”), whereas child G didn’t know the
difference. However, child G answered that he liked to read chapter books and picture

83

books, not fairytales. While child G generally described that he selected books by picking
favorite books from a shelf, child H answered that she found books by using an online
catalog to find where the books in located.

Children I and J mentioned that their favorite books were snakes, reptiles, crystal, and
gem. These were not particular books’ titles; they represented subjects. Children I and J
not only did many activities together, such as playing on the same soccer team and doing
tae kwon do together, they shared the same reading experiences. Neither had knowledge

84

about fiction and non-fiction. However, in general, both liked non-fiction books, and
child I seemed to like reading fiction books as well. Child I showed much knowledge
about characters. In terms of how to select or find books, child I was not able to answer.
However, child J mentioned that he picked a book from where he usually found books. It
means that he likes to read certain topics that he usually finds books in a specific location.
In addition, child J also noted that he read the front of the book to see what the book says
it is about. The front of a book means a book cover.

Child L’s favorite book was the Harry Potter series. She said that she liked the book
because all her friends read it. However, her reading level was not advanced enough to
read the series, as she said that her dad or mom read it to her. Another one of her favorite
books was one of The Magic Tree series. Instead of saying the name of the title of series,
she described the book as the Jack and Annie book. Like child H, child L also perceived
series by the characters’ names. When child L talked about TV shows and movies, she
used titles. Child K noted specific books title like Tacky the Penguin, but she was not
able to recall her favorite character’s name. She said that she liked girl characters, not
boy characters, although one of her favorite characters was a boy (“I like girls, not boys.
Boys are mean. […] I don’t remember his name. But he is boy. That boy is nice.”).

Child K wanted to read Harry Potter because her older brother read it. She liked to pick
books for her younger brother. Both children seemed to ask their parents to pick books
for them, or they asked parents whether the books were good or not. Since child L was
read books by her parents, when she picked books, she asked her parents if the books
were too long or not. Child K also described that first she picked her favorite books by a
subject like snakes, and then looked at a book cover and looked inside to see whether she
liked it or not.

Child N described her favorite books as funny books and animal books. She liked four
animals, dolphin, reptile, cheetah, and pony. Child M also liked to read funny books and
water books. Water books as meant by child M were books about undersea animals like
dolphins (“water books are like how dolphin swims like stuff”). Child N could not
identify her favorite character. Instead, she mentioned that she liked a character that did
what child N liked to do. Child N and M knew about genres, but child N did not
understand a word title. Child M also confused titles with authors (“words that are on the
covers that tell you whom made the story”), and then corrected her answer to “a title is
what the story is.”

Both children seemed to be told by their parents how to select books. Child M said that
her mom told her to pick out chapter books that were hard for her to read (“My mom said
that I usually pick out the chapter books that are hard for me to learn new books”). Child
N also said that her mom told her to pick books from a reading level section that

87

indicated reading levels by yellow and orange colors (“My mom tells me to pick yellow
and orange ones”). When the children picked books by themselves, they liked to look at
a cover to see if the cover had something that they liked (Child M: “It has a favorite
thing on it that I like. [on a book cover] like pinkish”). In addition, child N liked to look
at a book for the story.

Child O mentioned two different books’ titles and their volume numbers from The Magic
Tree House series. Given that other participants did not remember specific volume
numbers and titles of each volume in a series, it was interesting that child O remembered

88

individual titles from a series. On the other hand, child P did not mention her favorite
books by different titles in a series. Instead, she remembered a series title like Harry
Potter. Moreover, child P described her favorite book with a character’s name like Julie
and Molly who were from the American Girl series.

Child O showed strong interest in Star Wars. He seemed to have various prior
experiences with Star Wars books and movies. After child O mentioned Star Wars, child
P also talked about Star Wars. Child P’s favorite character was R2-D2 who was from Star
Wars. However, child P could not remember a name of the character, but described R2D2. Child O helped her remember the character’s name.

Both children showed advanced reading skills and knowledge about genre. However,
child P seemed to have hard time writing. Child P tended to focus on reading letters.
Once she started to read words in a book, she wanted to finish reading an entire book. It
also related to how child P selected books. Child P explained that she looked at names or
alphabets when she selected books. Child O usually selected books by looking at a
book’s front and inside to see whether the book had something that he liked.

so that we could develop a friendly relationship. However, child R answered most
questions with “I don’t know,” whereas child Q talked about his favorite movie and a
character. Both children did not want to read fairytales.

Both children said that they looked for characters when they picked books. It was
because of the organization of picture books in the library they usually visited. This
library (Greendale Public Library, see a section of library setting in Chapter 3) organized
picture books by characters. It seemed to influence the children’s book selection behavior.

Child S and child T were siblings. Child S was a younger brother and child T was the
older sister. Child T had very advanced reading skills, whereas child S was learning how
to read. Therefore, child S read with his mom, and his sister, child T, helped him read too.

Child S liked a character called Ted, but he said he could not remember a book’s name.
Also child S tended to name books by himself. For instance, Donut shop was not an
accurate title, but he called a book Donut shop. It shows that remembering titles might be
challenging for child S. As other children remembered books through characters’ names,
child S also described the Magic Tree House by Jack and Annie who were the main

91

characters. Child T liked to read series or chapter books. When she selected chapter
books or series, she wanted to read something that her friends read or liked. On the other
hand, since child S was younger and had a lower reading level, he looked for more covers
and pictures to find books.

Child U was starting to learn German, although her first language is English. During the
initial meeting, child U often kept looking at a paper sheet of child V’s questionnaire. It

92

implied that reading and writing in English for child U seemed to be little bit challenging.
However, she was able to verbally answer questions and think aloud.

Child U did not talk about specific topics or subjects to read. For child U, the library
where pair 11 visited was not familiar. Child U said that when she visited for the initial
meeting, it was the second time she has been at this local library. Child U found books to
read by browsing books on a table or bookshelves, whereas child V went to a bookshelf
where she usually found books because she was very familiar with the library. This could
mean that child V found books by bookshelves’ locations or by subjects, genres, or types
such as picture books, chapter books, and movies (“I am just be here [library] so much, I
know where books are like where chapter books”).

4.1.2. When I go to libraries or bookstores...?
One of the questions in the questionnaire was when they go to libraries or bookstores,
how they select books. This question provided five options:
1) I love to select books by myself.
2) I love to select books that my mom or dad picks for me.
3) I love to select books that my brother/sister likes.
4) I love to select books that my friends like.
5) I love to select books that my teacher picks for me.

Many participants liked to select books by themselves. Only two children did not answer
that they liked to select books by themselves. It was related to their reading level. Those
two kids were still learning how to read, therefore, their parents often picked books for
them. The second most influential people were friends. Participants liked to read what
their friends read or recommended.

94

4.2. Emergent factors and facets in children’s book selection
The transcripts of video recording data and field notes were analyzed by open coding
with QSR Nvivo 10, in order to identify cognitive factors that children perceived during
book selection. This section shows the list of cognitive factors and facets with
descriptions of each facet and quotes from transcriptions. This section also includes
pictures of book covers, and descriptions of library catalog, called County Cat, a catalog
system of public libraries in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin.

4.2.1. Distinction between factors and facets
There is a subtle difference between cognitive factors and facets. Factors are referents
often directly mentioned or pointed by participants or observable children’s behaviors by
me. On the other hand, facets emerge from these factors. Facets mean certain aspects that
participants aim to perceive by perceiving factors. Facets are not often directly addressed
by participants. Rather I categorize factors based on similar facets. For instance, a child
participant checked a number of words in a book. In this case, the aspect that a child
participant tried to perceive was whether a book was easy or difficult to read. Although a
factor of cognitive perception was a number of words, the factor was perceived in order
to a judge a facet of difficulty. Therefore, many factors can refer to a same facet. A
number of words, pages, or reading levels are various factors for a facet of a difficulty.
However, factors and facets are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many factors and facets

95

are intertwined. Some factors are used or mentioned several times to perceive different
facets.

4.2.2. Main cognitive factors and facets
The findings of children’s cognitive factors and facets show results similar to a pilot
study by Beak (2012) and Reuter’s (2007b) study in general. Table 4-2 shows factors of
book selections and facets categorizing the factors. Factors are alphabetically ordered
first, and then factors in each facet are also alphabetically ordered. Figure 4-1 visually
represents the relationships between factors and facets. Again few factors were used to
perceive different facets. In addition, some facets were used to perceive other facets. The
relationships between facets were visually represented by dashed-line.

4.2.3. Stories (Picture books or fiction)
When participants browsed and selected picture books or fiction, a story was an
important facet perceived by participants. Stories were perceived by several factors such
as plots, pictures on book covers, or narrative style/rhyme. An interesting finding was
that participants tended to perceive not only actual stories, but also imaginary stories. If
participants had read a book or heard about a book before, they seemed to recognize
actual stories. However, when participants had not read a book yet, they depended on
pictures of books in order to guess or perceive stories. Transcript 4-1 shows some
accounts related to a facet of stories from the participants.

Transcript 4-1. Stories (Picture books or fiction)
N: I like the pictures and the colors and the title because it tells you about the story. And
then it’s going to be more interesting for you because you know a little bit about the story
even if you haven’t read it yet. And then you’ll like the book.
M: You can figure out what you’re interesting in. Because pretend this is a different book
like this book. [Holds “Stories of Gilbert and Sullivan Operas”, then picks up “A is for
Artist”] This book is about art. And art is sometimes it can be people’s favorites and can
be interested for them. And so in like a different day you can sometimes you don’t have
time to read books so you can read it a different day and figure out what happens in the
story in about like. [From Pair7_1]

4.2.4. Subjects (Non-fiction)
Subjects are a little bit different from stories in fiction or picture books. Subjects mean
topics of non-fiction books. While stories in fiction or picture books are likely to show
plots or themes, subjects tend to deal with specific topics such as sharks, math, or football.
Participants perceived subjects through titles, pictures on book covers, contents by

100

looking inside of books, table of content, or summary or review from back of books.
Titles, contents, table of contents, and summary are straightforward indications
representing subjects. However, pictures on book covers were sometimes misperceived
by participants. Transcript 4-2 shows how child D perceived a subject through pictures on
a book cover.

Transcript 4-2. Subjects (Non-fiction)
C: What's this [“Cell Biology”] about?
D: I think it’s about underwater sea life, or something [This book is not about
underwater sea life. D is interpreting a book’s subject based on a picture on a cover. The
picture has some red cells on a gray background.]
[…]
Z: Why are you interested in this book?
C: I like this one [“Cell Biology”] because it has red things [in a book cover] [From
Pair2_1]

For instance, participants C and D were browsing the topic of biology section. They were
not aware of the topic. While pulling books out from a shelf and looking at a book cover,
child C selected a book titled “Cell Biology,” showing it to child D. By looking at the
book cover, D guessed that the topic of the book was about underwater sea life, not cell
biology. The book’s cover illustrated red cells on a gray background. This case shows
that child D perceived pictures on a book cover, while the title of a book was not
perceived.

4.2.5. Series or Chapter books
Participants in this study were beginning or intermediate readers. Beginning readers tend
to select picture books more often than do intermediate readers. Intermediate readers also
looked for picture books, but series and chapter books are also popular for them. When
participants selected series or chapter books, titles of series or chapter books (rather than
different titles of each volume), main characters, themes of series, illustrational patterns
on a book cover, and volume numbers were perceived. Participants remembered titles of
series such as Rainbow Magic, Magic Tree (the full title of the series is The Magic Tree
House), and A to Z Mysteries. However, participants did not remember titles of each
volume in a series or chapter book.

The other interesting finding is that children’s series or chapter books tend to have a main
character. A character’s name is also used as a title of the series or for chapter books,
such as Arthur, Madeline, Nancy Drew, Junie B. Jones, and Captain Underpants. In these
cases, it is hard to clearly distinguish whether participants perceive titles of series or
characters’ names. However, it is obvious that characters’ names influence participants’
perceptions in book selection. For instance, a chapter book, The Magic Tree House, does
not include characters’ names in a title. However, child S described the chapter book with
the main characters’ names, Jack and Annie (see Transcript 4-3.).

102

Transcript 4-3. Series or chapter books
S: I like this book [“Magic Tree House: Leprechaun in Late Winter”] because I like Jack
and Annie books and I have a lot of them at my house. But I never read this one and I
think I stopped at 33 [volume number of series]. I might get this book in book orders but I
don’t have it right now so I think I’m going to read it at home some time. [From Pair
4_2]

Most of the time, participants had prior experience reading series or chapter books.
Therefore, they already knew about themes or stories of series. By recalling their
memories of reading experiences, participants selected series or chapter books.

In

addition to themes in series, their prior experiences of reading series also allowed
participants to recognize books by the illustrational patterns on a book cover. Transcript
4-4 shows that a child perceived a chapter book through consistent illustrations.

Transcript 4-4. Series or chapter books
Z: Let's- can we talk about something else now? Why did you pick this book, B?
B: Because I don't have it and I like Annie and Jack [“The Magic Tree House”]
Z: Can you show it to me? Is Annie and Jack books?
B: It's called “Magic Tree house” and I have a lot of them at my house.
Z: How do you recognize this as magic tree book?
B: Because the pictures of Jack and Annie look the same. [From Pair 1_2]
L: And then I like “Nancy Drew” Because it's super good book.
Z: Have you ever read the Nancy Drew books before?
L: Yes.
Z: Okay, so how do you recognize Nancy Drew?
L: Because I really like Nancy Drew, and when I look at it, it's like, I know that side!
Because it's always yellow, almost of the time. [From Pair 6_3]

103

An example from Pair 1_2 showed that child B recognized a series of “The Magic Tree
House” by the consistent illustration of characters. Child B not only perceived illustration
patterns, but also recognized the characters.

4.2.6. Characters
Characters in stories or illustrations are an important aspect that participants perceived
during book selection. The importance of characters in children’s literature is also
observed by an organization system for picture books in the Greendale Public Library
(see a section of Library Settings in Chapter 3). A facet of characters was perceived by
participants through titles, series, illustrations, or familiarity. In addition, participants
considered various factors related to characters such as names, appearance, or gender (see
Transcript 4-5.).

Transcript 4-5. Characters
Names: [Pair 11_3]
U: I want this book [“Katie Kazoo”] because I really like Katie Kazoo books and they’re
really funny and take turns and everything each time. And I never know and every single
one has Heffer in it. And he’s the dog, he’s really weird.
Appearance: [Pair 4_1]
H: She's ugly, he's weird, and the giant is ugly too. He looks like a hairy lion king.
[looking at a book cover]
H: He's hideous, right?
G: Yeah.
Gender: [Pair 6_3]
K: Let me check this one. Doesn't look really cool, let's see. No, just a boy.

104

4.2.7. Genres
Participants often talked about genres such as chapter books, picture books, fairy tales, or
mystery. However, in general, participants showed a lack of knowledge between fiction
and non-fiction. Transcript 4-6 shows examples of participant’s perception in genres.
Transcript 4-6. Genres
T: I like mysteries a lot so A-Z Mysteries are books so mysteries sort of make me excited.
[…]
T: The section is over there, but here are some of the ones mom picked out.
S: I want to look at the picture books over there. [while randomly pulling books]
Z: S, it is good.
[they move to picture book sections]
T: Yeah. These are the picture books? [From Pair 10_1]
V: I don’t like this book [“Henry and Mudge”] because I like read it one time and I
didn’t really like but I like mysteries. So I wanted to try it one more time, and then I
looked through it and then I decided when I was here that I don’t really want it. [From
Pair 11_3]

Based on observations in a physical library setting, participants seem to use locations of
bookshelves to perceive genres rather than using the knowledge of genres. For instance,
child S said “I know were the Junie B. Jones books are. And they’re way over there by
the Magic Tree House books.” Child S doesn’t seem to know about a genre of Junie B.
Jones or the Magic Tree House. However, child S was able to perceive these two chapter
books as similar because they are on the same bookshelf.

Another way of perceiving genres was through illustration and subject (see Transcript 47). Table 4-3 summarize brief descriptions of each book that child J mentioned, and the

105

differences between a library catalog and child J’s perception. Child J perceived
differences between fiction and non-fiction though subject and illustration. A subject
about fish for child J needed to be presented with real photos because a subject, fish, is
non-fiction. Therefore, when child J perceived a book, “What's It Like to Be a Fish?”
because of the illustration and comparing with a non-fiction book, “Trout”, he thought
that “What's It Like to Be a Fish?” was fiction. In this case, he perceived the format of
illustrations as more important than the subject. On the other hand, child J thought that a
subject of art was non-fiction. Although a format illustration on a book cover, “Art” was
similar to “What's It Like to Be a Fish?” and “Mahjong All Day Long,” because of the
nature of the subject (art), he thought that the book was non-fiction. In this case, he
perceived a subject more importantly than a format of illustration.

Transcript 4-7. Genres
Z: Do you remember this book [“What's It Like to Be a Fish”]? You picked this book.
J: Yeah.
Z: You said this book looks like fiction, right?
J: Yeah.
Z: Why do you think this book looks like fiction? What makes you think it is a fiction
books?
J: Well, it doesn't look real like this one [“Trout” in series of “Nature’s Children”]. I
like the real ones, or like that one [“Art” by Patrick McDonnell], that one's actually nonfiction. [A book, “Art” is a picture book.]
Z: This one is non-fiction?
J: Yeah! Art. It’s art. Real.
Z: Okay. I was just wondering.
J: And plus this one kind of looks like that one [pointing out a picture book, “Mahjong
All Day Long”]. [From Pair 5_3]

Although child J had an incorrect understanding of genres, his example showed that the
children’s perception of genre was complex and occurred by taking into account a
combination of subject and illustration. In addition, it also demonstrated that illustration
counts in children’s perceptions during book selection.

4.2.8. Illustrations
Illustrations are the most frequently perceived factors by participants during book
selection. This participant perceptual behavior corresponds to the characteristics of the
concrete operational stage in Piaget’s cognitive development (see Table 2-5 in Chapter 2).
Cognitive ability of participants in this study corresponded to the concrete operational
stage, in which children are able to understand concrete, but not abstract realities.
Illustrations are concrete objects, therefore it is easier for participants to perceive pictures
rather than subjects or themes. Participants considered various aspects of illustrations
such as colors, characters, objects, or formats of illustrations (see Transcript 4-8).

108

Transcript 4-8. Illustrations
D: “Ancient China”
C: Oh, I want this one!
Z: Why?
D: It is about China. “China and It's Influence on Modern Times” [subtitle]
C: I like the picture!
D: I think there might be a lot of pictures in here. Yeah, but they're black and white.
C: I don't care
Z: You don't care?
D: I guess as long as it has pictures in it, you don't care. [From Pair 2_1]
M: I like this [“Skinned Knee”] because all of the different colors. I like all the different
colors because blue is my favorite color because I like to go swimming. And I see all
these blue water touched colors. [From Pair 7_1]
V: I picked only these books because they look like [Gorilla].) This one looks like it
would have lots of facts about gorillas. [“Gorilla Walk”] and the other one would have
almost everything about monkeys. So I picked both of them to get extra facts just in case.
Z: Why do you think this book has just some facts?
V: Because it has a gorilla picture and when I looked through it, it had real stuff in it
and I wanted to read it. [From Pair 11_3]
H: “Big Words for Little People”
Z: Okay, why did you select this book?
H: Because there's a cat.
Z: There's a cat on the cover! So did you like this book?
H: No.
Z: Why don't you like this book?
H: Well it's a drawing, it's not a coloring book, I like books that look real and it doesn't
look real.
Z: So you like books that have a real picture?
H: Yeah, like my “Survivalpedia” does. [From Pair 4_1]

Illustrations on book covers were the most frequently perceived factor. Perceiving
illustrations on book covers was related to how books were arranged. Many picture books
were displayed on a bookshelf. Displayed books allowed participants to easily perceive

109

illustrations on book covers and the inside of books. When books were shelved,
participants were often observed pulling book half out to quickly see its cover. This
behavior also implied that the children wanted to perceive illustration on book covers.

Participants mentioned colors and objects in illustrations. When an object was a wellknown character, participants used the character’s name, such as Arthur. Otherwise,
participants perceived general objects in illustrations, describing books as a doggy book,
a kitty book, or a ducky book.

Another factor in illustration was format. Format of illustration refers to whether an
illustration is a picture or a real photo. Picture books, chapter books, and many fiction
books include pictures or drawings, whereas non-fiction books contain photos. For
instance, a non-fiction book about a shark shows actual photos of sharks. Illustration
format also influenced the children’s perception of genres (see Transcript 4-8). Although
a book that child J picked was non-fiction due to the illustration format, child J thought
that the book did not belong on non-fiction bookshelf.

110

4.2.9. Physical characteristics
Physical characteristics were perceived through books’ shapes or texture components in a
book. Pair 8 provided a good example of participants’ perceptions of physical
characteristics (see Transcript 4-9). During the second library visit, two participants in
pair 8 were looking for a book, “My Dog” written by
Angela Joy, and illustrated by Nicola Slater. Children Q

Figure 4-2.
Book cover of My Dog

and R had seen this book during the first library visit.
However, they could not remember its title or author.
What they remembered were three things: 1) the book
had a dog that child R called Mr. Doggy, 2) the book
had fur that they could touch, and 3) the book was
shaped like a dog house. In addition to the main
character in a book, physical characteristics were
perceived by participants as more important than basic bibliographic information such as
title, author, or illustrator.

Transcript 4-9. Physical characteristics
Q: I want Doggy.
Z: You want a Doggy book? Oka, Let’s find one.
Q: No, that was the one he [R] had last time. That was all furry.
Z: Oh, but you [R] didn’t bring it?
Q: He [R] did bring it, but it’s probably still over there [a book cart].
Z: Oh, Okay.
Q: But she [a librarian] might have put it back.
[…]
Q: Hey, where’d you find it last time?

111

R: Last time I found it here. It’s not here. It’s not here. It’s like that big.
Q: As big as all those?
R: Yeah.
Q: No, it’s not.
R: It’s pretty wide.
[…]
[They are looking at other books]
Z: Okay, do we have enough books now?
Q: No.
R: Doggy.
Q: I’m still going to look.
Z: Do you want to ask a librarian?
Q: I’m afraid to.
Z: You’re afraid to?
Q: I don’t know what the book is called.
Z: How do you describe the book?
[Going to a librarian and asking]
Q: Oh, Excuse me. Do you have any book where it’s like a dog on it, but you can
actually feel the fur on it?
Librarian: Is it a specific book or do you want any book where you can touch?
Q: It is like a certain book. It was over there.
Librarian: Like the board books?
Q: Right over here in this area. I was looking, and it was red. It’s not this one. On the
cover it had like a little dog house. You could feel on it.
Librarian: You know… I don’t know which one you are talking about. And if you don’t
know the name of the character, maybe they can look it up down at the information desk.
R: Really?
Librarian: Do you want to go down there and she can look on the computer?
R: yeah. I’ll take a look on this computer.
Z: Good job. Not here, I think she means by.
Librarian: You want to go down by Sammy, she’s all the way down there.
Q: Should we do that?
R: Yeah.
Z: But down run.
R: I’ll look for it.
Q: You know how to work the computer?
R: Yeah.
Q: Why don’t we just ask her where it is?
Z: Not here I think. Maybe there I think. They can help you guys.Do you want to ask her?
Q: You do it, R! Ask her!

112

Q: Dog house book that we can like feel the dogs fur on it.
Librarian 2: Oh, that would be with the board books. Against the wall.
Q: Yeah, we saw them but it’s not really there. And he put it in here [return box]. And the
person took it out.
Librarian 2: Oh, you just returned it.
Q: Yeah.
Librarian 2: You know what? It might be on the cart that the lady’s putting the books
away on.
R: A book dropped down there.
Librarian 2: I know I saw it. I’m going to get it in a minute, thank you.
R: Okay. Let’s find the cart.
Q: Where’s that girl anyway? Where’s the cart? She might have out it back. Where was
it? Over here? Nope. It’s not back.
Z: Are you sure that it was there?
Q: Yeah, I’m looking and I can’t find that book.
R: It was in that one, that one, or that one.
Q: And I’m looking at them.
R: No, Q! It had a point and it was pointing up.
Q: It had a point up?
R: Yeah it was the book was just like a dog house. Look for a point pointing up.
Z: R, what do you mean point up?
R: Like the book is shaped the same as.
Z: Oh, the book shaped like different.
Q: Yeah! More like a dog house.
R: Yeah! It is like a little on top. Like dog houses.
Q: It’s not there right now.
Z: Ah. I see.
Q: Why don’t you tell the lady that, the one over there? Tell her.
Z: Do you mean that book? I think I saw something there?
Q: Where?
Z: Over there.
Q: Yes, Doggy. [“My Dog”]
R: We found it.
Q: Doggy.
R: We found it.

113

4.2.10. Difficulty
Difficulty or reading level is one of the facets that participants perceived during book
selection. Children’s libraries often organize books by reading levels. Moreover, some
children’s books indicate reading level on the book’s cover. Participants judged difficulty
or reading levels by perceiving the number of pages, reading level indication, font size,
titles, or words inside books. These factors helped participants select books. Many
participants in this study were still learning how to read. Therefore, whether participants
could understand the words in the books or titles mattered.

Transcript 4-10. Difficulty
T: Are you reader one or a reader two yet? [On picture bookshelves for reading level
sections, there are signs of reading levels like Reading 1, 2, 3.]
S: I can do some reader two.
T: Okay. This is reader two and that’s reader one.
S: What about reader three? I want to see what that’s like.
T: Oh we already read that one, I read it to you. These, I think you’d be able to read S.
S: Oh yeah, I already read that. This is where mommy always looks. [From Pair 10_1]
V: are there like different ones?
U: That ones American Girl too. They’ll look really long, don’t they? Are mom’s might
not like it.
Z: Oh you think it’s too long?
U: Maybe our mom’s might not like it or our dads.
[…]
[V is looking at a displayed book and puts it back.]
Z: No? Why?
V: Because it’s too long. [From Pair 11_3]
Z: You think this book is for the older kids?
F: Yeah, for the big kids.
Z: How do you know this book is for big kids?
F: Because I have good eyes and I’m very smart and I know everything, but really

114

everything, and this looks like a big kid book to me actually.
Z: Because why? Because it has a lot of pages?
F: Yeah, well some books that can be for kids that have lots of pages, right?
Z: That’s true, why do you think this book is for big kids?
F: Because the pages really look like for big kids and stuff, and it’s really like you know,
a little, not like, it looks a little weird to me, becauseZ: Because it has lots of, what?
F: Lots of like stuff
Z: Letters?
A; yeah, that stuff.
Z: Lots of words, right?
F: Yeah. [From Pair 3_1]

4.2.11. Familiarity
A facet of familiarity is associated with prior experience. Prior experience played a role
as a trigger or a token to bring memories related to books, so that participants felt familiar
with them. Since prior experience varies from one to another, it is very individual and
personalized. However, when it came to analyzing the patterns of prior experience, some
factors such as associated media, characters, book covers, series, contents or story, or
bookshelves’ location in the library were used to recall participant’s memory. For
instance, a child might have watched a movie or TV series, or had experience with other
media involving the same character, such as American Girls, Scooby Doo, or Mary-Kate
and Ashley Olsen.

Transcript 4-11. Familiarity
A: “Mary-Kate and Ashley”? Oh! I know who Mary-Kate is. You know these two
people? Have you seen “Full House”? [“Full House” is a TV series. Child A recognizes
two characters by looking at pictures on a cover]
B: No.

115

A: The show?
B: I don’t know.
A: These two people play that girl. I have to show my mom!

4.2.12. Novelty
Novelty was perceived when books were newly published or participants had not yet read
them. Some libraries had a separate book section for books. In addition, new books were
identifiable by a colorful sticker on the spine. However, participants hardly perceived
stickers on a book spine or a sign pointing at new book. Instead, they showed more
interest in novelty by finding books that they had not yet read or by looking for new
volumes in familiar series. For instance, series or chapter books include several volumes.
Although participants had read some volumes of series, if they found a new or previously
unread volume, they wanted to select the books. In this case, participants were usually
looking at series’ volume numbers.

Transcript 4-12. Novelty
H: That [“A Dragon Christmas”] looks cool.
G: We both got the same book.
H: But we never read it before.
G: Maybe we should read it!
H: Yeah.
Z: Why do you like this book?
G: We've never read it before!
H: The dragons look funny.
G: Yeah, they do.
H: Look at him [a dragon character]! He has a lot of presents.
G: It says, “A Dragon Christmas: Things to Make and Do by Loreen Leedy.”
H: There's a little dragon Santa! [They are looking at a cover and talking about the
illustration]

116

G: That's so cute!
H: A kitty cat!
G: That has nothing to do with Christmas, that's spring!
H: That's not Christmas, That's not Christmas, That's not Christmas, That's not
Christmas.
G: That's not Christmas, That's not Christmas.
H: That's Christmas, that's not Christmas.
G: There's no such thing as a dragon Santa! [From Pair 4_1]

M: [“The Princess who had Almost Everything”] I Like this book because it looks
delicious and um I like all the colors on here. And something’s you can try new things in
here. [From Pair 7_1]
L: See? And then I really like “Tinker Bell” Because I watched the two movies, and these
are like new ones, so I really want to watch them.[From Pair 6_3]

4.2.13. Recommendation and Award
Recommendation by peers or siblings influenced participants’ perceptions of books.
Since participants in each pair were either friends or siblings, both participants knew
what kinds of books his or her friend or siblings liked. Therefore, they often picked books
for their friends or siblings. Also some participants wanted to read a book that his or her
friend picked first. For instance, whenever child R picked a book, his friend, child Q,
wanted the same book. In another case, child G and child H in pair 4 often picked two
books if the books were same and shelved next to each other. As a part of a
recommendation, participants seemed to consider the number of copies so they could
share the same reading experience. Another type of recommendation is awards. An
award book was also perceived as good by participants. Child Q and R pointed out a gold
medal on a book cover of “Kitten’s First Full Moon”, saying the book must be a good

117

book because of the medal. A book, “Kitten’s First Full Moon” has several awards
including in the ALA Notable Children's Books - Younger Readers Category.
Transcript 4-13. Award
Q: Okay. It’s a gold medal. [“Kitten’s First Full Moon”
has a gold medal in a book cover. A gold medal indicates
an award.]
R: Yeah.
[…]
Q: I like this one and one reason is it must be a good book.
Z: Oh because of the gold medal on the book?
Q: Yeah, cause it won that.
[From Pair 9_2]

4.2.14. Engaging elements
Engaging elements are interactive materials or components in a book. Some books
included folded or over-layered pages or pictures (like in Eric Carle’s picture books),
textual materials (like fur in “My Dog”, see Transcript 4-9 for physical characteristics),
hidden objects in illustrations (as in “A to Z Mystery Series” or “I Spy Series”), or
rhythmical or rhyming narrative styles (like Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari
Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo in “Tikitiktembo”). Transcript 4-14 shows examples of rhyming or
rhythmical elements in titles, so that participants engaged in singing the titles. These
elements enabled participants to engage in reading (see Transcripts 4-14-16). Some
engaging elements were related to physical characteristics, whereas other elements were
embedded in illustrations or the contents. Physically engaging elements were perceived
without prior experience with books, but embedded elements were often recognized due
to participants’ prior experience.

118

Transcript 4-14. Rhyme and rhythm in title
T: Yeah. Oh I love Tikki Tikki Tembo [They pick this book together. They recognize this
book.] Tikki Tikki Tembooh so Rambo [T is singing]
T: It is like, picture books have words but they have pictures on them. Tikki Tikki
Tembooh so Rambo. Ching ching ching.
S: Okay, I’ll ask if we can get this one. There are a lot a lot of picture books.
T: [Picks Tikki Tikki Tembo] I like this book because it has like a big rhyme in it.
Z: Oh. Have you ever read this book before?
T: Yeah. [From Pair 10_1]
S: [“Boom Boom Go Away!”] I picked this book because I think it looks interesting and
it has a person hitting a drum on the front of it.
Z: So when you picked this book, did you read the title?
S: Boom Boom Boom.
Z: Do you like.
S: Yeah. [gesturing drumming]
S: Boom Boom Go Away! [S reads a title rhythmically.] [From Pair 10_1]

Z: Are you touching? Feel weird?
D: I've seen pictures like this and it feels cool.
C: How do you make it go away? Go away Go away!
D: I think I would like this book
C: I want this one [From Pair 2_1]

E: Both those kind of like there stickers of fairies, and there stickers you can put on like
your wall. And the paints like all pink, and that means umm
F: I don’t really see stickers.
E: Umm no there not. Umm because those kind of stickers umm can like can like they
don’t rip the whole wall cause like in pieces cause those are why those are cool stickers.
Cause they really do not, and help the walls not fall apart. Those why those kind of

119

stickers help. [Pair 3_1]

4.2.15. Bibliographic Information
Bibliographic information is basic information that describes books, such as titles,
authors, languages, or call numbers. Most frequently, participants perceived book covers.
Book covers included much information, from a title and author(s) to pictures. While at
the same time perceiving much information from book covers, participants tended not to
notice author(s). However, when I asked participants how they thought they could find
another book similar to the one they picked, few participants answered that they would
look for authors. For the following question, when I asked participants whether they
knew who the author was, participants did not know or remember the author’s names.
The participant’s answer might be due to library user education; that is, participants
might have been taught to find books by author names. After completing every library
visit, I often had a casual conversation with parents. Through the conversation, I realized
that some parents have taught participants to find books using author’s names.

Language was also one factor that participants perceived during book selection. Many
participants could speak a second language, such as German, French, or Spanish. This
does not mean that participants specifically looked for books in other languages. Rather,
while randomly browsing bookshelves, participants recognized books written in
languages that they were able to read.

120

Call numbers were used to find locations of books. At a library, there were signs of call
numbers on each bookshelf. Participants used the information to perceive subjects rather
than call numbers. Participants did not know about the DDC system.

4.3. Emergent vocabularies of Emotion (EVE)
Beak (2012) briefly notes that there are two types of emotional interests: 1) emotional
interest from external stimuli, and 2) self-directed emotional interest. Emotional interest
also emerged in this study during the children’s book selection. Participants expressed
emotional interest while perceiving many factors related to book selection. Participant’s
emergent vocabularies of emotion (EVE) showed experience of feelings or psychological
states of emotional interest. Emotional vocabularies included words such as like (don’t
like), interesting, fun, cool, awesome, wow, happy, scary, etc. Transcript 4-17 shows
examples of EVE.

Transcript 4-17. Emergent vocabularies of Emotion
T: Oh, I know where I want to look! S.
S: Where?
[They move to a section where locates in front of an entrance. This section displays few
books]
S: Oh here, this looks good. [Picks “ Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star”]
T: Do you want to get that?
S: Yeah.

Beak’s pilot study (2012) does not show the relationships between EVE and other
cognitive factors and facets identified in previous sections. For this study we looked for
those emergent emotional vocabularies, and then analyzed what EVE referenced.
Referents of EVE were cognitive factors that participants perceived during book selection.

122

Table 4-4 shows the top thirty codes that co-occurred with emotional vocabularies. The
codes were used during the open coding stage in the data analysis process. The cooccurrence was analyzed and generated by a function of a matrix coding query in the
Nvivo 10. The list was ordered by the frequency of co-occurrence.

Pictures or pictures on a book cover were most strongly associated with emotional
vocabularies. Title, previous experience, characters, subjects, and series were also
perceived with emotional expression. A physical characteristic was relatively less
associated with emotional expression, but that might be attributed to the fact that few
books had such physical characteristics. In other words, during book selection throughout
the library visits, children did not find many books having unique physical characteristics,
such as a dog house shape. The number of the co-occurrence frequency between
cognitive factors and facets, which were based on codes in Table 4-4, and emotional
vocabularies, might not represent the importance of the cognitive factors and facets.

In order to understand the relationship among the cognitive factors, the codes cluster
analysis was used by Nvivo 10. For the codes cluster analysis, the codes in Table 4-4, and
an emotional vocabularies code were included. Figure 4-3 shows how emotional
vocabularies were associated with other cognitive factors in a multidimensional scaling
(MDS) plot. This plot was generated based on a dendrogram in Figure 4-4.

126

As an MDS plot shows, emotional vocabularies play a central role in the relationship
among the children’s cognitive factors and facets. A dendrogram shows that pictures are
most directly associated with emotional vocabularies. In addition, pictures from book
covers and titles were used to guess book subjects. Other factors such as book cover, title,
subject, characters, plot, series, genre, etc. were also connected with emotional
vocabularies. In other words, when participants perceived those factors, they experienced
emotional states.

Chapter 5: A child-driven metadata schema
This chapter introduces a child-driven metadata schema (CDM) based on the findings of
children’s cognitive processes during book selection reported in Chapter 4. First, this
chapter explains the scope and main terms of a CDM based on the Dublin Core Metadata
Initiative (DCMI). The format of a CDM is influenced by DCMI. The terms that structure

(http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/). In the second section, the ways in
which the cognitive factors and facets found in Chapter 4 were interpreted in order to
become child-driven metadata elements is described. The third section suggests childdriven metadata elements with definitions of each element. Lastly, two exemplary
metadata records were introduced by comparing the CDM with Dublin Core (DC)
version metadata records from the OCLC Connexion database.

5.1. Introduction
The purpose of this study is to create child-driven metadata elements with metadata
elements (or properties) that support description, access, and other functions. In other
words, a CDM focuses on the development and definition of various descriptive metadata
elements rather than suggesting values of elements. The terms such as elements
(properties), values, and terms, used in a CDM are defined by the DCMI Metadata Terms
and DCMI Abstract Model.

128

Figure 5-1. DCMI Resource Model

The DCMI Abstract Model explains the differences between elements and values. Figure
5-1 shows how a resource is described. A resource is a described resource and is a value.
A described resource is described by using a property-value pair. A property-value pair
contains at least one property and one value. Values can be either literal or non-literal. A
property-value pair is a basic concept of the DCMI resource model. The DCMI Abstract
Model defines property and values: Property is “a specific aspect, characteristic, attribute,
or relation used to describe resources” 4, which is interchangeable with Elements. Value
means that “the physical entity, conceptual entity or literal (a resource) that is associated
with a property when a property-value pair is used to describe a resource.” 5 In a context
of a CDM, a value associated with a property of a character is Scooby Doo (a physical
entity). Based on these definitions, this study focuses on developing properties reflecting
the children’s cognitive processes to describe children’s resources rather than developing
values or other encoding schemes. A format of a child-driven metadata schema consists
of the following attributes in Table 5-1. Furthermore, to be consistent with terms between
property and element, the term element will be used through the rest of the study.

Some attributes in a CDM such as an element name and its definition are required,
whereas other attributes are additional if applicable. The value type attribute is added in
order to help understand the nature of values in elements, but it does not suggest specific
languages or vocabularies for those elements. In other words, there are many standard
controlled vocabularies such as LCSH, Sears Subject Headings, or MeSH for a subject
element. However, CDM does not suggest what languages or vocabularies should be used
for elements.

5.2. Operationalizing cognitive factors for CDM
Child-driven metadata elements were developed based on the findings of the children’s
perceptual cognition during book selection. In addition to the findings reported in
Chapter 4, this study also referred to a pilot study of the current research with 6 children
(Beak, 2012). From two studies, many perceptual and cognitive factors and facets were
identified. However, not every factor and every facet were used to develop a CDM. Some
factors and facets such as personal goals, previous experience, or emotional experience
were different for all participants. Therefore, instead of directly adopting these factors

130

and facets to a CDM, the study modified the cognitive factors and facets for the sake of
the development of operational metadata elements. In other words, the children recalled
previous experiences to induce familiar feelings regarding a book. Previous experience
was perceived through more operational factors such as characters, pictures, or related
resources such as movies. Therefore, for this CDM I sought to use operational factors in
order to develop child-driven metadata elements rather than using the cognitive factors
and facets described in the previous chapter.

5.3. Child-driven metadata elements
Elements are introduced by a class, “a group containing members that have attributes,
behaviours, relationships or semantics in common.” 6 Classes are in bold, italic, and
uppercase, and elements are bold with sentence case. Elements not categorized by class
are alphabetically ordered at the end. Table 5-2 shows child-driven metadata elements
with definition and attributes.

Five classes and thirty three metadata elements were named and defined. Some elements
such as title, creator, and language are commonplace, and have already been defined by
currently existing metadata schemas such as DC, AACR2, and Resource Ddescription and
Access (RDA). Although we do not here consider the interoperability of a CDM with
other current schemas, other metadata schemas were referenced in order to define the
common elements.

In terms of naming elements, element names were created for the purpose of describing
children’s resources in light of a child’s point of view, not to be directly used as labels for
search interfaces for children. Selecting elements for a browsing searching interface and

135

labeling elements in the interface might need to be modified by a child-friendly
vocabularies and the purpose of a local library.

5.4. Metadata record example with child-driven metadata elements
This section shows two examples of metadata records for two books: 1) My Dog, and 2)
Locked in the library! Each book was described with two metadata records: One
metadata record described with child-driven metadata elements, and the other metadata
record described with DC elements. Two metadata records with DC elements from two
books were collected from the OCLC Connexion web interface in order to compare them
with metadata records described with the child-driven metadata elements. The metadata
records from OCLC Connexion were collected on March 13, 2014. The books used in the
following examples were selected in order to highlight the uniqueness of CDM. When it
comes to labeling metadata elements in a metadata record, two examples use the original
names of elements, without considering how CDM elements are labeled in the public
view of an OPAC interface.

5.4.1. Example 1: My Dog
The first example is the book My Dog written by Angela Joy and illustrated by Nicola
Slater. This book was mentioned in Chapter 4 to describe children’s cognitive facets of
physical characteristics and engagement elements. Unique characteristics are that the
book is shaped like a doghouse and includes fabric patches representing dog fur. By

136

using this book as an example, two metadata records are compared.

The record from OCLC Connexion used 10 different metadata elements with 9 different
refinements to describe My Dog. Information about doghouse shape and fabric patches
were described in a description element with a note refinement. A description element

137

cannot function as an access point in a browsing search. Beak (2011) pointed out the
limitation of the note field in AACR2+ in relation to children’s searching behavior and the
nature of a browsing search interface. In other words, information described in a
description element could be searched by keyword, but could not be functioned as
category-based browsing search.

CDM allows a metadata record to describe different aspects of the book. Although many
online catalogs provide the front book cover’s image along with bibliographic
information, they do not describe information listed on front book covers. Given that
children perceived many aspects of books through a front cover, simply displaying the
cover in an online catalog may not be sufficient to represent it. In this sense, CDM

138

provides more information associated with book covers through metadata elements such
as color, book shape, or object. In addition, one of the most memorable characteristics
that the children recalled about this book was fur, a textured material. While DC
describes the textured material information with a Description.note element, CDM
describes it with metadata elements of a textured material and an engagement element. It
allows books to be gathered by textured materials or whether or not a book includes an
engagement element.

5.4.2. Example 2: Locked in the library!
The second example shows a famous character for children,

several series of Arthur such as the Arthur chapter books series,
Arthur adventures series, and Arthur good sports chapter books
Series. As the series titles show, the character’s name is a part of
the title. Moreover, most titles of individual books in series have
the character’s name, but not always. The character, Arthur, is
usually illustrated wearing a yellow sweater, blue jeans, big
round glasses, and red-and-white sneakers. There is also a TV series, Arthur, based on
books of the Arthur book series and created by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).
PBS provides information about characters in the Arthur series and other educational
materials for children. The following examples describe a particular volume of the series,

As the two metadata records show, a CDM metadata record example is likely to describe
information related to the character, such as character’s name, gender, images, and
description of appearance. Some information references a Wiki website for the Arthur
TV series (http://arthur.wikia.com/wiki). A second main character, Francine Alice
Frensky, is also described in a CDM record. Therefore, a child might find a book having
two characters, Arthur and Francine. On the other hand, in the OCLC Connexion record,
a character’s name appears only in the Relation element (or Series entry in MARC21
format. It might allow users to search books containing the Arthur character through a

141

keyword search. However, using Relation.isPartOfSeries element does not gather all
books with the Arthur character. In addition, a specific place, a library, is a main setting,
so a CDM record provides a spatial setting. A spatial setting might be used as an
important cue when a child recalls a memory of the book and uses it as an access point
for searching. The OCLC Connexion record uses Subject.topical element to describe
spatial setting. However, libraries and schools are not topical subjects. Therefore, using
Subject.topical element does not disambiguate whether the book is about libraries or
whether the book takes place in a library. In conclusion, current cataloging standards like
DC or AACR2 focus on describing books with a more resource-centered perspective,
whereas CDM elements describe books with a more user-centered perspective.

Chapter 6: Discussion: Grounded theory of holistic understanding of children’s
cognitive processes during book selection
This chapter is the last stage of grounded theory, which grounds the emergent theory in
the existing literatures. Mansourian (2006, p. 388) describes this stage:
GT [Grounded Theory] is an inductive process because the theory emerges
through the dataset inductively. However, after emergence of the theory it
can be deductively examined with existing theories in the literature to find
out how compatible or different the emergent theory is with the literature
body.
In this chapter, I address the broader research questions, what metadata elements do
children like to use, and what elements should a child-driven metadata schema include,
by describing holistic understanding of the children’s perception and cognition during
book selection using three levels of cognitive processes: 1) psychological, 2) perceptual,
and 3) cognitive. Based on the phenomena of the children’s cognitive processes, the
purpose of this chapter is to discuss how the findings of this study are interpreted by the
literature in information processing theory, attention, and emotion.

6.1. Holistic understanding of children’s cognitive processes
Children’s cognitive processes during book selection can be interpreted on three different
levels: 1) psychological, 2) perceptional, and 3) cognitive (see Figure 6-1). The first level
is associated with the psychological state of emotion or affection. Psychological

143

experience includes attention, emotion, purpose, or intention that is consciously or
unconsciously perceived at the psychological level. These psychological experiences of
feeling influenced the children’s perception during book selection. In particular,
children’s previous experience and emotional interest often created a boundary of
perception like a lens to see a phenomenon. There are so many books and so much
information in a library. However, somehow previous experience allows the children to
look for certain books.

Figure 6-1. Three levels of the children’s cognitive processes during book selection

144

The second level of the children’s cognitive processes during book selection is a
perceptional process. When the children came to a library and interacted with books, they
started to perceive various aspects of the books, such as colors, characters, pictures, shape,
etc. that were identified in Chapter 4. The difference from the psychological level is that
the perceptional level focuses on the children’s physical interaction or reaction with
books rather than emotion or attention.

The third level of the children’s book selection behavior is the cognitive process. By
looking at books and perceiving factors of books, the children considered certain aspects
of books such as stories, subjects, characters, genres, series, difficulty, engagement
elements, etc. While at the second level the children perceived cognitive factors by
emotional interests or psychological experiences, in the third level the cognitive facets
were interpreted by me through observing what the children tried to consider and know
about books through factors. For instance, the children checked the number of pages of a
book or read a title or a few words inside of the book in order to perceive a level of
difficulty or reading level. A concrete factor the children perceived was the number of
pages, titles, or words. However, what they considered was an abstract facet of difficulty.

These levels in the children’s cognitive processes during book selection are not
independent; they are intertwined. Three different levels do not mean a linear process.
Rather, the cognitive processes are more dynamic. For instance, sometimes the children
perceived some factors first and then those factors evoked a psychological experience. Or

145

the children perceived abstract aspects of books, cognitive facets, like physical
characteristic first, so that they were describing a specific concrete aspect of the book, a
perceptional factor, such as the shape of a book.
Based on general and holistic understanding of the children’s cognitive processes during
book selection, the following sections discuss how previous literature in information
processing theory, attention, and emotion can be connected with the children’s cognitive
processes.

6.2. Information processing theory (IPT) and Attention
The field of cognitive psychology has developed many theories including Information
processing theory, learning theory, motivation theory, developmental theory, etc. LIS has
adopted many theories from Cognitive Psychology to interpret user’s information seeking
and searching behaviors, information retrieval, or human-computer interaction. IPT
examines the cognitive processes regarding the perception, storage, encoding, and
retrieval of information, focusing on how people perceive the stimuli around them, how
people store the stimuli in their memory, and how people recall the memory (Miller,
2011). As the scope of information processing theory explains, the cognitive processes in
an information processing theory are closely associated with memory systems. This
section briefly describes the three main components of IPT and the cognitive process
occurring during the information processing. It then discusses how IPT can be interpreted
in children’s book selection behaviors in a knowledge organization context.

146

IPT consists of three memory systems: sensory register, working (or short-term) memory,
and long-term memory. Figure 6-2 shows a basic model of information processing.

Figure 6-2. Basic model of cognitive processes (Ormrod, 2012)

Table 6-1 shows a summary of the characteristics of each memory system.

6.2.1. Sensory register
We interact with the environment surrounding us, and receive many inputs from that
environment. The sensory register is where incoming stimuli from a person’s
environment are temporarily held, which is the earliest cognitive process. The stimuli are
usually sensed visually or auditorily. At this point in the cognitive process, the stimuli are
raw pieces of information that have not been understood by or are not meaningful to the

147

individual. A good example of attention is the cocktail party phenomenon studied by
Colin Cherry (1953). People at a party hear noisy sounds and see many things. However,
people often can hear their names better than other sounds in a noisy party, while other
noise is ignored. This phenomenon is called the cocktail party phenomenon. These
sensory stimuli are received from the environment to the sensory register without making
in effort to obtain these pieces of information or stimuli. We might not even notice that
we are hearing, seeing, and smelling. Therefore, all stimuli do not have meaning to an
individual. The cognitive process at the sensory register occurs unintentionally and some
stimuli held in the sensory register selectively moves into the working memory.

6.2.2. Working memory
Working memory is the place where active thinking occurs. Information people are
currently using is held in the working memory. Because the working memory stores
information for a short time, it is also called the short-term memory. Working memory
can hold information from both the sensory register and long-term memory. Working
memory “identifies information in the sensory register that warrants attention, saves the
information for a longer period of time, and processes it further. It might also hold and
process information that it retrieves from long-term memory information that will help in
interpreting newly received environmental input” (Ormrod, 2012, p. 168). Information
traveling from the sensory register and information traveling from and to the long-term
memory are processed differently.

148

6.2.3. Long-term memory
The long-term memory stores information for a longer period (or permanently) and its
capacity is unlimited. The working memory stores information currently in use or in
consciousness. The long-term memory, in contrast, stores knowledge in organized
structures that allow information to be retrieved later. The long-term memory also
processes information in various ways to organize information and to make sense of it. In
this respect, meaningful learning is often considered as a cognitive activity to construct
knowledge in the long-term memory.

6.2.4. Attention in IPT
As figure 6.1.1 shows, information processing occurs differently between the sensory
register and the working memory or between the working memory and the long-term
memory. Put simply, between the sensory register and the working memory, attention
influences information processing. Between the working memory and the long-term
memory, there are two types of cognitive processes; encoding and retrieving. Encoding
refers to the cognitive process occurring when information is transferred from the
working memory to the long-term memory. In contrast, when information that has been
already stored in the long-term memory is recalled to the working memory, retrieval
processes occur.

149

The children paid attention to different aspects of books than that mainly described in
library catalogs. In other words, the children perceived some factors such as characters,
book cover’s colors, or physical characteristics more often than bibliographic information
such as titles, authors, or publishers, described in most current library catalogs. It shows
that attention influences the children’s perception. Therefore, in order to interpret the
children’s book selection behaviors in the context of IPT, this section focuses on
information processing between the sensory register and the working memory. This is
attention.

Attention, as an intuitive and initiative cognitive process, plays a vital role during
information processing. The influential American psychologist William James noted that
attention functions to decide what has to be processed (James, 1980). Although people
receive various stimuli (raw information) from the environment, only some information is
moved to the working memory by attention. This is because people pay attention to
certain information (James, 1980; Cowan, 1995).

In Chapter 2, I explained the relationship between representation of information and
expression of users in a knowledge organization context (see Figure 2-2). When it comes
to users’ expression, Beak (2012) describes three cognitive processes involved in users’
expressions: perception, categorization, and naming. Information processing theory
accounts for a series of information processing regarding how people perceive (attention),
organize (encoding), and retrieve information. The cognitive process in users’

150

expressions and the series of processing in information processing theory seem to share
some similar cognitive processes.

Perception is about what information is to be perceived and processed. In other words,
what aspects of books are perceived or processed by children? In this study I identified
the aspects of books that the children perceived and used the cognitive factors to develop
child-driven metadata elements. Now let’s look at the figure of a basic model of IPT
again (see Figure 6-3).

Figure 6-3. Attention and Emotion Factors in Information Processing

The children interacted with books at libraries (environment) and many data of books
such as title, author, publisher, book cover, pictures, and so on, were input to the sensory
register. However, only certain aspects of book information were processed and moved to
the working memory because of the influences of the children’s attention and emotion. In

151

addition, Ormrod (2012) notes that “even when people pay attention to a particular
stimulus, they don’t necessarily attend to its most important aspects” (p. 163). It means
that attention directs children and adults to perceive certain information when they are
looking at the same book, but information perceived might be different.

Generally speaking, there are several factors influencing attention, such as emotion,
personal significance, novelty, social cues, motion, size, intensity, or incongruity. Table
6-2 summarizes descriptions of each factor by quoting from Ormrod (2012, p. 165-167).

Table 6-2. Factors influencing attention (Adopted from Ormrod, 2012, p. 165-167)
Factors influencing
attention
Emotion
Personal significance
Novelty
Social cues
Motion
Size
Intensity
Incongruity

Description
“Stimuli with strong emotional associations attract attention”
“the meaning and relevance people find in an object or event”
“Stimuli that are novel or unusual in some way tend to draw
people’s attention”
“People are more likely to pay attention to thing they see others
looking at and reacting to.”
“Moving objects are more likely to capture attention than
stationery ones”
“Attention tends to be drawn to large objects”
“More intense stimuli-bright colors and loud noises, for
instance-attract attention”
“Objects that don’t make sense within their context”

These factors are also explained in the context of the children’s cognitive processes
during book selection. Children’s resources such as picture books tend to include
illustrations using bright colors or being emotionally appealing. For instance, many
participants mentioned that pictures were cute or interesting. In this case, emotion and

152

intensity factors cause the children to pay attention to pictures. Another example is social
cues. When one of the children in a pair picked a book, the other child wanted to read it
or at least wanted to check what it was. The factors influencing attention seem to overlap
with the cognitive factors and facets that this study identified in Chapter 4. It explains
that child-driven metadata elements created in Chapter 5 might play a role in capturing
children’s attention to browse and search for books.

6.2.5. Criticism of IPT in the children’s book selection behaviors
In spite of the advantages of using IPT for understanding children’s book selection
behaviors related to metadata elements, the theory has several weaknesses. First of all,
studies of information processing tend to be conducted in a task-based laboratory setting.
Miller (2011) considers a task analysis approach and quantitative measurement methods,
such as recording reaction time, as a merit of information processing studies.
“Information-processing researchers use stringent and precise experimental methods . …
Laboratory research on basic processing often makes precise measurements of processing
time . … by cleverly designing different types of problems, researchers have discovered
that young children are using simpler, less-complete rules, procedures, or strategies than
are older children” (Miller, 2011, p. 315). Although Miller (2011) considers a task
analysis approach more beneficial to understanding different sets of information
procedures, the tasks might influence outcomes by limiting various cognitive process
activities. For example, if the children were asked to find a book by using an online
cataloging system (as a task), children’s cognitive processes might be changed or limited

153

due to the limited functions of the online cataloging systems. Therefore, a task-based
laboratory study has difficulty capturing intuitive cognitive processes during information
processing.

Secondly, Johnston and Dark (1986) contend that many studies about attention focus on
only external sources, mentioning that there are two sources of information: internal
sources (memory and knowledge), and external sources (environmental objects and
events). Similarly to Johnston and Dark (1986), Beak (2012) also addresses resourcecentered factors/facets and user-centered factors/facets. Some factors/facets, such as a
physical characteristic, are directly associated with the resources, whereas others, such as
familiarity, come from users’ ideas or previous experiences. These two different types of
factors/facets are related to two different types of processes: PAL (Paying Attention by
Looking) and BAR (Being Aware by Recalling). The PAL process is likely to deal with
external sources, whereas the BAR process seems to be led by internal sources (Beak,
2012). The reason the children paid attention to different sources of information might be
due to the nature of the sources. In other words, external sources tend to be tangible,
concrete, and objective, whereas internal sources are likely to be abstract and subjective.
Therefore, in a task-based laboratory study, it is more convenient to control variables
with external sources rather than with internal sources. However, internal sources such as
prior knowledge or personal experience play an important role in attention. The children
in this study tended to re-read the same books or to read different books in the same
series. In this case, their prior knowledge or positive emotional experience about the
books were cues to pay attention to choose other books. In this sense, to understand

154

comprehensive cognitive processes, it is necessary to consider internal sources such as
personal experience, emotional state, and cognitive ability, as it is to consider external
sources.

The third weakness of IPT is the lack of consideration concerning social and cultural
influence. In other words, IPT claims that a basic simple model of IPT as illustrated in
Figure 6-2 is applicable to all people, without considering social or cultural influence.
Miller (2011) also criticizes neglecting the context of behavior in information processing
studies. As a member of a society or culture, a person might be educated or accustomed
to perceive and organize information in certain ways that the society or culture has
constructed. “[E]ven basic attention processes are culturally formed; when a culture
values children’s attending simultaneously to multiple events in the community around
them, cultural practices guide children in that direction” (Miller, 2011, p. 319). When this
study was designed, social and cultural influences were not considered. Therefore, simply
interpreting the children’s cognitive processes during book selection through IPT might
not provide deeper understanding of why the children perceived certain information. For
instance, even among group of children, gender differences or sociocultural backgrounds
might lead to different kinds of information processing. Therefore, it is important to keep
in mind the ways in which the society and culture influence information processing and
information organization.

155

6.3. Role of emotion and affection
Emotion is an especially important factor relating to cognition and perception because it
captures and maintains attention. Emotional appeal has been studied in many fields such
as advertising and political science in order to understand how emotion influences users’
information processing or selection and decision making. Norman (2004) notes that in
humans “the emotional system is also tightly coupled with behavior, preparing the body
to respond appropriately to a given situation” (p. 12). Nahl (2007) also emphasizes a
central role of the affective in information behavior, noting that “cognitive processes
cannot be understood without recognizing the mechanism by which feelings and
emotions control the parameters of every cognitive operation” (p.24). Although
Norman’s emotional system and Nahl’s affect control theory are not specifically
explained in the context of children, this study showed a common view point in the role
of emotion. It is obvious that emotional factors influence children’s book selection
behavior. There is a great volume of literature about emotion in psychology (including
cognitive psychology, social psychology, or neuropsychology). However, attention to
emotional and affective factors in LIS is relatively nascent. Since a user-centered
perspective has been introduced in LIS, attention has begun to be paid to affective or
emotional factors. Affective and emotional factors are considered in understanding user’s
information behaviors, including information seeking and searching behaviors or humancomputer interaction. While the terms affective and emotion are interchangeably used,
the scope of affection and emotion cover many aspects of user’s information behaviors.
Generally speaking, studies about emotional and affective factors in information behavior
use terms such as emotional or affective in order to represent factors relating to feeling,

156

motivation, satisfaction, uncertainty, anxiety, frustration, appealing, self-efficacy, etc.
Lopatovask and Arapakis (2011) grouped theories of emotion into two main categories:
cognitive and somatic. Emotion in relation to cognition “stresses the importance of
cognitive evaluation (appraisal) in establishing the meaning of stimuli and ways of
coping with it” (p. 588). On the other hand the emotion in relation to somatic factor
emphasizes “perception of emotional experiences in terms of bodily responses” (p. 588).
Emotion used in LIS, especially information retrieval and human-computer interaction,
seem to consider the first category of emotion, cognitive evaluation rather than somatic
emotion. Julien, McKechnie, and Hart (2005) analyzed to what extent affective issues
have been considered in articles about systems work in LIS. In this content analysis of
articles published between 1999 and 2003, the definition of affect is “emotion, mood,
preference, and evaluation” (Julien, McKechnie, & Hart, 2005, p.457). There has been no
further exhaustive content analysis study looking for affective issues in LIS in the last
decade. However, Dinet, Chevalier, and Tricot (2012) note that “since the early 2000s,
numerous studies have investigated causes and/or effects of various emotions during the
web search” (p. 57). A body of studies focusing on affective and emotional factors in
information behaviors has grown. One of comprehensive works on emotion in LIS is
published as a monograph titled “Information and emotion: The emergent affective
paradigm in information behavior research and theory” edited by Nahl and Bilal (2007).
This book consists of 17 chapters dealing with emotion in diverse contexts such as
children’s digital libraries, information literacy and reading, or library anxiety. In
addition to this work, emotional and affective factors are considered in other LIS research
streams such as usability (Khanum & Trivedi, 2012), information retrieval and searching

157

(Lopatovska & Arapakis, 2011; Dinet, Chevalier, & Tricot, 2012; Bronstein & Tzivian,
2013), health information behavior (Fourie, 2009), or social tagging (Kipp, 2008; Ding et
al., 2010).

Many studies on emotions in LIS use self-reporting methods including self-rating on a
satisfaction scale, think-aloud, interviews, questionnaires, or standardized tests for
measuring affect such as positive affect, negative affect scale (Lopatovska & Arapakis,
2011, p. 581-584). Using these methods assumes that users are able to report their
emotions, which assumes that emotion is a conscious cognitive response. However,
Albright (2011) recently introduced psychodynamic perspectives in information behavior.
The psychodynamic perspective focuses on the role of the unconscious “underlying
motivations and emotions that affect information behaviour in general, and specifically
information use,” rather than conscious interaction between users and information.
Although Albright (2011) does not suggest specific methods to understand and to
measure the role of unconsciousness, this new direction seems to bring richer
understanding of the role of motivation and emotion to studies in user’s information
behaviors.

Despite the growth of attention to emotion, Dinet, Chevalier, and Tricot (2012, p. 57)
point out that: “the disciplines that study HCI [Human Computer Interaction] and IR
[Information Retrieval] have only recently started to investigate this phenomenon and
gain understanding of its [emotion] causes and effects by collecting objective data.” Like

158

Dinet, Chevalier, and Tricot’s argument, the current point of view regarding
consideration of emotion in LIS is more likely to be descriptive rather than suggestive of
practical solutions to improve information systems. The following section discusses how
emotional factors are embodied in knowledge organization systems or information
retrieval systems.

6.3.1. Emotion in knowledge organization systems
I analyzed the relationship between emergent vocabularies of emotion and other
cognitive factors in Chapter 4. The analysis shows that emotional vocabularies have a
strong connection with pictures. In addition, other cognitive factors such as title, subject,
or characters are also closely clustered from a center of emotion. It implies that emotion
influences the child-driven metadata elements to be more child-friendly and appropriate,
so that emotional-based metadata elements play a role in capturing and maintaining
children’s attention.

In the context of knowledge organization for children’s resources, emotional factors are
also considered. However, it is not explicitly discussed in published articles. There are
few published articles addressing emotional perspectives. Articles tend to focus on the
development of interface design for children’s digital libraries (Liu et al., 2012; Reuter,
2007a; Druin et al., 2001; Druin, 2002; 2005; Hutchinson, Druin, & Bederson, 2007;
Hutchinson et al., 2005), rather than focusing on knowledge organization systems.

159

This section discusses how emotional factors are considered in knowledge organization
systems through an example of the NoveList K-8 (Plus) database. NoveList K-8 is a
leading database about fiction and non-fiction books for children and juveniles. Although
the NoveList website claims that the NoveList databases, specifically the NoveList K-8
(Plus), is for younger readers in order to help children find books for their reading level
and interest 7, it is questionable how effective it is and how often child users search for
books using the NoveList database. Rather, it is more often used by parents, teachers,
librarians, or researchers who search for books for children. Therefore, it is hard to
simply claim that a main target user group of the NoveList K-8 is children. However, the
reason this section uses the NoveList database as an example is because the NoveList
provides tools for finding books using four types of appeal factors: 1) storyline, 2) pace, 3)
tone, and 4) writing style. Recently, they added an illustration appeal factor. Regarding
the appeal factors in the NoveList databases, there is only one published article written by
Tarulli and Caplinger (2013). As a cataloging supervisor and reader’s advisory specialist
at NoveList, Tarulli and Caplinger (2013) explained the motivation and procedures of
developing appeal factors and terms. The following definitions of each factor were
quoted from Tarulli and Caplinger’s article (2013) and the information about “appeal
terms for ages 0-8” from the EBSCO website 8.
•

Storyline: “terms that help readers find books with the overall structure they are
looking for.”

8

•

Pace: “the rate at which the story unfolds for the reader.”

•

Tone: “the feeling that a book evokes in the reader.”

http://support.ebsco.com//help/?int=novp&ver=live&lang=en&feature_id=BabyAppeal

160

•

Writing style: “the language used in the book and the level of detail in the
background.”

•

Illustration: “a range of terms that cover everything from color and drawing style
to the mood evoked in the reader by the illustrations.”

Figure 6-3. Example of a search by the appeals (From NoveList handout information)

Figure 6-3 shows an example of finding books by appeal factors. 9 The five appeal factors
do not directly describe emotional information about a book. However, they seem to
consider emotional perspective in cataloging. In other words, the appeal factors play a
role in captivating users’ attention by connecting user’s emotional interests with
9

http://www.ebscohost.com/novelist/news-article/novelist-adds-tools-for-finding-visualappeal

161

information about storyline, pace, tone, writing style, and illustration. In particular, a tone
appeal factor deals with more emotional factors than the others. According to Tarulli and
Caplinger (2013), “tone is where we focused most of our initial energy, as this reaches
the emotional core of the book. This category also includes terms that talk about the
setting of the book, basing this decision on Joyce Saricks’ statement that ‘setting as an
element of appeal really means background and tone, not geographic place.’[10]” (p. 288).
These appeal factors, except a pace factor, are also found in this study, although the
interpretation and names of cognitive factors in this study are slightly different from
those of NoveList. Storyline and writing styles in NoveList can be matched with a
metadata element, story and sub-properties of story such as storyline, story setting: when
and where in CDM. Tone in NoveList is equal to a tone element in CDM, defining it as
the mood of the story in the resource. But while a tone appeal factor seems to deliver the
emotional statement about the story of a book, a tone element in CDM intends to convey
the emotional aspects that could be perceived through not only a story, but also
illustration and character in a book. Illustration appeal factor is similar to a book cover
and an illustration element in CDM. Appeal terms in illustration factors include abstract,
cartoony, colorful, photographic, realistic, and so on. These terms are also described in
CDM, but by several elements like color or format of illustration. For instance, a CDM
element, format of illustration, describes whether an illustration is photography or a
cartoon.

162

Appeal factors of NoveList and the analysis of the relationships between emergent
vocabularies of emotion and cognitive factors in this study share the similar idea that
providing emotionally appealing or interesting access points for searching is important.
Through this study, I learned that illustration, especially book cover, story and subject,
and characters caught children’s eyes or attention. It means that these factors need to be
provided as access points in book searches for child users. NoveList’s appeal factors and
terms seem to be the most practical application of emotional factors in cataloging for
children’s books. Given that NoveList calls these factors “appeal” factors, the term
appeal implies that storyline, pace, tone, writing style, and illustration play a role in
intriguing a user’s emotional interest. “Adding appeal to a book record augments
standard cataloging information on genres and subjects, and makes it possible for users to
conduct appeal-based searches” (Tarulli & Caplinger, 2013, p. 290).

Tarulli and

Caplinger also believe that a new approach to cataloging should be able to describe not
only the content of a book, but also “the experience of the book for the reader” (p. 290).
Descriptive and experiential cataloging noted by Tarulli and Caplinger (2013) are in
accord with Wilson’s two kinds of power in the bibliographical universe: 1) descriptive
and 2) exploitative power or control (Wilson, 1968). Descriptive power allows
information professionals to create “arbitrary order” (Wilson, 1968, p.25) of writings or
texts, whereas exploitative power is “the ability to make the best use of a body of writing”
(Wilson, 1968, p. 25). Smiraglia (2012) reinterprets Wilson’s two kinds of powers by
using the word, domains instead of power or control. “The descriptive domain is the
dimension where people labor to make indexes and catalogs of all of the texts of
knowledge that they know to be extant. The exploitative domain is where scholars toil to

163

create new knowledge by synthesizing that which is already known” (Smiraglia, 2012, p.
4). Another key concept in Wilson’s theory is efficacy. Smiraglia (2012) notes that
“anything descriptive that makes exploitation possible is efficacious” (p. 4). These ideas
suggest that simply describing bibliographical information or resource-centered
cataloging is not an effective mechanism by which to create new knowledgeencountering experiences for children. In order to emphasize the exploitative power in a
knowledge organization system for children’s resources, appeal-based searches and
emotion-based metadata elements provide a new direction for knowledge organization
systems.

6.4. Cognitive ability and Husserl’s ideas
As the findings of this study show and CDM suggests, the factors and facets that children
perceived to select books were different from the access points available in current online
cataloging systems. In other words, while the children perceived colors, characters, or
pictures more naturally or intuitively, current online cataloging systems tend to provide
bibliographic information access points such as title, authors, ISBN, or keywords for
users. Adult users might perceive similar factors. However, the difference between adult
and child users is cognitive ability. These differences in cognitive ability were introduced
through Piaget’s cognitive development stages in Chapter 2. Adult users might have been
educated in terms of how to use online cataloging systems, therefore, they are able to
adapt their thought processes in order to retrieve books by title, author, or ISBN.
However, children’s cognitive abilities are not developed enough to adjust their search

164

behaviors in this manner. Limiting access points to bibliographic information means that
cataloging systems force children to learn search strategies instead of supporting their
intuitive information searching behavior.

The cognitive processes are also interpreted by Husserl’s ideas about noesis, ego, and
epoche (bracketing). Smiraglia (2012, p. 12-13) concisely explains about Husserl’s ideas:
Essentially, Husserl suggested (in alignment with semiotic theory) that each
perception was subject to the interpretation of the individual. For Husserl the
process of perception was viewed through the lens of personal experiences.
Noesis was the Husserl’s perceptual component of analysis . … For Husserl, all
perception stemmed from the Ego, which is all that is. In the beginning of
perception, nothing is, except that which is perceived by the Ego. The method of
perception entails a sequence of epoche, brackets around specific entities in the
perception of the Ego.

Among the many aspects of books, what children perceive depends on the child’s ego,
which is created by and evolves from personal experience. Because the children in this
study did not have enough library education experience, they did not know how to use
library online cataloging systems or did not know what call numbers meant. In Husserl’s
language, the child’s noesis differs from an adult’s noesis. When the children interacted
with books and perceived information, they bracketed different entities in books. The
concept of bracketing is related to attention in IPT. In other words, Hursserl’s sequences

165

of perception can be reinterpreted by which of many aspects of books particularly
appealed to and were paid attention to by the children.

166

Chapter 7: Conclusion, contributions, and future research
One of Cutter’s cataloging objectives is “to assist in the choice of a book.” (1891, p. 12).
Cutter’s choice objective was likely to suggest narrower meanings of descriptions by
bibliographical information or literary or topical information. These descriptions were
more likely to emphasize the characteristics of resources, not the user’s perspective.
However, nowadays the scope of choice objective includes the reader’s advisory. It
means that cataloging or knowledge organization systems such as metadata schemas need
to consider how to reflect users’ information behaviors and represent users’ voices in
knowledge organization systems. In this sense, the purpose of this study was to
understand children’s cognitive processes during book selection and to develop a childdriven metadata schema based on the cognitive factors and facets. This chapter
summarizes the findings of this study through the research questions, and provides the
contributions and directions for future research.

7.1. Conclusion
Chapter 2 revealed the research problem through the literature review and provided a
theoretical framework for this study by defining key concepts such as children, metadata,
information, and context. The literature review focused on studies about children’s
information seeking and searching behaviors regarding information retrieval and
information organization. Through the literature review, I learned that there was a lack of
studies devoted to developing knowledge organization systems that reflect children’s
information seeking behaviors. This research gap fitted in the theoretical framework of

167

this study, which was the connection between two components of knowledge
organization; expression of users and representation of information. Based on the
research problem and theoretical framework, this study aimed to connect children’s
cognitive processes as an expression of users to metadata elements as a form of
representation of information.

Chapter 3 introduced research questions and the methodology designed to understand the
children’s cognitive processes during book selection as a foundation for the development
of a child-driven metadata schema. Broader research questions included what metadata
elements do children like to use? What elements should a child-driven metadata schema
include? In order to answer these research questions, a triangulated qualitative research
method consisting of questionnaires, paired think aloud, interview, and diaries were used
with 22 child participants between the ages of 6 and 9. In addition, the following
operational research questions were asked.
•

RQ 2) What perceptual cognitive factors and facets do children use to select
books?

•

RQ 3) What roles do the cognitive factors and facets play in a context of
metadata schema?

•

RQ 4) How can child-driven metadata elements be defined?

The following section summarizes the findings of this study by looking at each research
question.

168

RQ 2) What perceptual cognitive factors and facets do children use to select books?
Chapter 4 was devoted to identifying the perceptual cognitive factors and facets the
children perceived during book selection. Thirteen facets, basic bibliographical
information, character, difficulty, engaging elements, familiarity, genre, illustrations,
novelty, physical characteristics, recommendation and award, series or chapter books,
stories or themes in picture books or fiction, and subjects in non-fiction, were perceived
through various factors. Each cognitive facet was explained, accompanied by examples
of the children’s accounts. The cognitive factors were apt to be perceived directly from
books by the children through sensory inputs like looking at, browsing, or touching books.
The cognitive facets were created by concerning what conceptual aspects of information
the children’s cognition intended to perceive. Therefore, the cognitive facets tended to be
abstractly processed cognition, whereas the cognitive factors tended to sensibly processed
cognition.

RQ 3)

What roles do the cognitive factors and facets play in a context of metadata
schema?

RQ 4) How can child-driven metadata elements be defined?
The cognitive factors and facets were used as triggers to select books or cues to recall
books that the children had read before from their memory. In addition, some cognitive
factors and facets were associated with emotional interest. Chapter 4 showed the top 30
codings that co-occurred with emergent vocabularies of emotion, along with an MDS
cluster plot of the cognitive factors and facets from a center of emotional interest.
Triangulated data analysis demonstrated similar results, that illustrational information

169

was strongly connected with the children’s emotional interest. In Chapter 6, the
children’s cognitive factors and facets were also interpreted as attention influencing
information processing. In other words, the children tended to pay attention to certain
aspects of books, which were identified as cognitive factors and facets in Chapter 4,
during book selection processing.

The cognitive factors and facets were used as the foundation of the development of a
child-driven metadata schema. To become child-driven metadata elements, the cognitive
factors or facets needed to be considered with an eye toward operationalization. After
considering how to operationalize cognitive factors and facets, thirty three metadata
elements were developed and two examples of metadata records described with childdriven metadata elements were suggested in Chapter 5. The children’s cognitive factors
and facets provided important meaning in a context of the development of metadata
elements. The cognitive factors and facets were not only evidence of how the childdriven metadata elements were developed, but also illustrated the reasons the child-driven
metadata elements should be developed. In other words, child-driven metadata elements
reflected the children’s cognitive perception that could allow children to intuitively and
easily find books in an online cataloging system.

170

RQ 1) What metadata elements do children like to use? What elements should a childdriven metadata schema include?
The children liked to perceive five aspects of books in a broader sense; illustration,
character, title, and subject or stories. Overall the children tended to perceive more
concrete and visual information than abstract information. Illustration, character, and title
were visually or textually represented, whereas subjects and stories were more likely to
be embedded in visual or textual representation. However, the children often perceived
subjects or stories through illustration, character, and titles. Therefore, these five aspects
of books were interrelated.

Illustrational information included various aspects of books such as characters, objects,
colors, or format of illustration. Illustrational information was mostly perceived through a
front book cover. It means that an image of a front cover itself might function as a
surrogate, but providing description about characters, objects, colors, or format of
illustration is also important for the purpose of access and retrieval. Character(s) were
often perceived as illustrational representations or as a main access point of a story line.
In the case of perceiving chapter book series, characters played more important roles due
to the nature of chapter book series. A chapter book series usually included main
characters and consistent themes. In addition, character’s names are often a part of title of
a series or chapter books such as the Arthur chapter book series. Therefore, the
description of character information, including visual representation by an image of

171

characters, and character’s names and genders, might provide different access points for
finding books.

The children also used the information of title and subject or stories to perceive emotional
interest. Although the children perceived subjects or stories through illustration or
characters, it was obvious that the children were concerned about titles and subjects or
stories. Moreover, given that title and subjects or stories are basic bibliographical
information that has been described and provided as main entries in online cataloging
systems, a child-driven metadata schema also needs to include these elements to support
the children’s information seeking and searching behaviors.

Finally, from this study emerges a portrait of how the children perceived various aspects
of books. I have synthesized the results with a review of literature in information
processing theory, attention, emotional factors in knowledge organization, and Husserl’s
ideas about noesis, ego, and epoche (bracketing). Information processing theory and
attention explain what and why the children perceived certain aspects of books. In
addition, Husserl’s ideas also explain that the children also think and perceive
information based on their egos established by previous experiences.

Overall, a holistic understanding of the children’s cognitive processes during book
selection as a foundation of a child-driven metadata schema displays an early stage of an

172

ontological contour for a children’s knowledge organization systems. A child-driven
metadata schema constructed in this study is apt to include different metadata elements
from those metadata elements existing in current cataloging standards. The differences
results from a user-driven approach when a metadata schema is constructed. Current
existing cataloging standards tend to be developed by a resource-centered approach, not
user-centered or user-driven approaches. On the other hand, a child-driven metadata
schema reflects the children’s cognitive processes so that it might function more
intuitively for child user groups than adults. Given there are two components in
knowledge organization, a metadata schema for children is required considering both
children and children’s resources in order to represent both users and information.

7.2. Contributions
The purpose of this study is not to develop a “fully-functioning or complete” child-driven
metadata schema. Given that children’s information seeking behavior has not been
studied in light of any metadata schema, this study has meaning as the first about a childdriven metadata schema. However, this study contributes to improving knowledge
organization systems to better represent children’s perspectives. In addition, information
organization and information retrieval are often considered as two sides of one coin.
Therefore, a child-driven metadata schema will contribute to the design of browsing
search interfaces for child user groups. In other words, given that a browsing search is
more effective for children than a keyword search, providing child-appropriate access
points for a browsing search interface is important. Lastly, the influences of cataloging or

173

knowledge organization systems extend beyond simply describing resources. Knowledge
organization is a fundamental organism that intertwines with many aspects of library
services such as information retrieval, reference, literacy, and readers’ advisory.
Therefore, a child-driven metadata schema provides a positive experience of finding
books in online setting with children, so that it also ultimately contributes to the
enhancement of children’s literacy skills.

7.3. Future research
This study serves as a starting point for a research domain of metadata schemas for
children and children’s resources. In other words, this study provides a huge potential
area for future research. The following section discusses future research. First, future
research needs to reanalyze children’s cognitive processes during book selection in
multiple perspectives. The current study focused on attention and emotional factors
occurring between sensory register and working memory in information processing
theory. How the children’s cognitive processes differ when information is transferred
from working memory and long-term memory versus when information is recalled from
long-term memory to working memory has not been scrutinized. Data from the current
study shows slight evidence of differences. Therefore, future research should re-analyze
the data in relation to two different information processing styles; recalling memory
versus perceiving new information. It will contribute to a deeper understanding of
children’s cognitive processes.

174

One aspect of constructing a metadata schema is related to a domain analysis or a content
analysis about children’s resources. Children’s resources such picture books, board books,
or chapter books have unique characteristics, such as physical characteristic like covers
reminiscent of dog fur. These characteristics influence children’s cognitive processes and
book selection behaviors. Therefore, understanding of characteristics originating from
book itself should be also considered in order to develop a metadata schema reflecting
both sides of knowledge organization components; children and children’s resources.

Other future work on a child-driven metadata schema should include studying how to
implement the metadata elements in practice. The current study only theoretically
suggests descriptive metadata elements that might be used easily for children to search or
browse books. However, the study does not address how to use it in an OPAC system. In
order to implement the child-driven metadata schema in a practice, the metadata schema
needs to consider other factors such as interoperability, cost-benefit, objectivity, or
stability. In addition, user study for the evaluation should be conducted. Therefore, future
research requires operationalizing children’s perceptual cognitive factors in a metadata
schema and testing its effectiveness by children.

Finally, this study only focuses on developing metadata elements, not values. Chapter 5
defines the differences between elements (or properties) and values. However, in order to
provide a complete metadata schema, it is necessary to consider values for each element.
This might include developing a standardized vocabulary such as a name authority file

175

for characters in children’s resources. In this way, a child-driven metadata schema can be
more stable, functional, and applicable to practice.

Appendix A: Recruitment email
From: Jihee Beak [mailto:jbeak@uwm.edu]
Sent: Tuesday, August 06, 2013 4:02 PM
Subject: Request help for recruiting research participants from your library
Dear Director of library:
I am Jihee Beak, a doctoral candidate from the School of Information Studies, University
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM). I am writing this e-mail in behalf of asking your help
to recruit research participants and getting permission to use your library setting.

I plan to conduct a dissertation research about children's book selection behaviors. The
purpose of this study is to develop a child-appropriate metadata schema for children's
libraries. In the future, the ultimate goal of this study will provide different access points
for children and design a child-friendly OPAC system.
This study requires children to visit a library three times. Children will browse and select
books in a children’s section of your library, as they usually do in a library. Children will
be video and audio recorded with parents’ permission during the library visit. Each
library visit will take around an hour.
In order to conduct this study, I need to recruit 10 pairs of children - a child and his/her
friend - or 20 children in age of 6 to 9 (1st grade to 3rd grade). Can you please allow me
to promote this study for the recruitment in your library? If you agree, I will visit your
library during library programs for kids, and shortly introduce my study and leave fliers
in your library. In addition, I have noticed that your library has a Facebook webpage. Can
I also post a flier in your library’s Facebook webpage?
After recruiting, if children want to visit your library, can you please allow me to use
recording devices (a video camera and audio recorders) in your library? I try not to
distract other library users as much as possible. This study has been approved by the
Institutional Review Board at UWM (IRB#: 14.015). It means that there will be no risks
for children or participants.
Can you please allow me to recruit children from your library and conduct this study in
your library if there is any child user from your library? Your help for this study will
contribute to develop a better library OPAC system for child users.
If you want to meet me in person to get more information, I am happy to visit your

193

library anytime. Here is my contact information.
Cell Phone: 414-465-9362
Office Phone: 414-229-4707
E-mail: jbeak@uwm.edu

Thank you for reading a long email and your consideration. I will look forward to hearing
from you soon.
Sincerely,
Jihee Beak.
