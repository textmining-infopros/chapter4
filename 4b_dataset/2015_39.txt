THE EFFECTS OF MONEY, TIME AND PERSONAL DATA EXPENDITURES ON DOCUMENT
SELECTION: AN EXPERIMENAL ASSESSMENT OF THE VALUE OF INFORMATION
By Barbara Wolf Burton

Dissertation Director:
Daniel O’Connor, Ph.D.
Purpose: This study seeks to provide a better understanding of how, and in what ways,
consumers of digital information are willing to pay for, and thus express their finding of
value in, general interest information.
Design/Methods/Approach: The study was designed as an experiment with a control
group of 100 participants and three treatment groups of 100 participants each. All 400
participants were instructed to select documents from a standard set of ten documents on a
general interest topic. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four groups. The
control group viewed all documents as free. The three treatment groups were required to
expend money, time or personal data to select documents. The total number of documents
selected was calculated for each participant. Quantitative analysis was conducted to assess
whether and in what way the expenditures had an effect on the total number selected.
Participants were also instructed to select what they considered to be the best document
from the set of ten and to supply a short reason for their selection so that the impact of the
expenditures on this selection could be analyzed.
Findings: 1) There was a significant difference in the mean number of documents selected
by the four groups indicating that participants changed their selection patterns depending
on the expenditure required. 2) There were no significant correlations between the mean

ii

number of documents selected and consumer, demographic or research variables.
Consumer variables measured attitudes behavior relating to information and research
variables provided participant assessment of the study. This indicates that the treatments
were stronger than any tested individual attributes. 3) There were slight differences in the
document selected as “best” by the four groups, and the reasons given for the selection of
the best document varied slightly among treatment groups.
Value/Originality: A better understanding of how consumers value information and what
they will exchange for it provides a significant benefit to both producers and consumers.
Using different expenditures to test how consumers may change their document selections
provided a unique research setting. An interdisciplinary bridge between consumer
behavior and human information behavior was enhanced.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The completion of this degree is the culmination of a long held goal. I have had the
support of many people for many years in its ultimate realization.
Special recognition for his role in facilitating this is my advisor Dr. Daniel O’Connor. His
inspirational teaching of Collection Development while I was a student in the Masters’ program
all the way through to his recent guidance in the completion of Quantitative Research Methods in
the Doctoral program were essential contributions in the completion of this journey. I consider
him a mentor and a friend. The members of my Committee, Dr. Harty Mokros, Dr. Claire
McInherney and Dr. James Matarazzo have also provided excellent feedback and maintained high
academic standards which set and kept the effort going.
Many thanks and huzzahs must also be expressed to the members of my Ph.D cohort with
whom I have shared ideas, worries, concerns and successes over the five years we have been
together. It is colleagues such as these that make any experience more meaningful and more fun.
I also deeply appreciate the contributions of those who helped in the production of this
study by participating in the pilot study, providing data for intercoder reliability, giving
suggestions for research questions and for proofreading. A pound of highly caffeinated coffee for
each of you will represent a small measure of recognition for your efforts.
And finally, thanks to my wonderful family for all their love and encouragement. Deepest
gratitude goes to my husband Allen for his patience with my sometimes wondering theoretical
conversations about the definition and value of information and for his very concrete help with
page numbers when most needed. My children, Matt and Abby, although perhaps wondering why
I would undertake such an adventure, continue to be a constant source of joy and amazement as
they set and achieve their own goals in the world. My sister Judy, brother Russ, sister-in-law
Marty and brother-in-law Chuck and all my treasured nieces provided the needed mental and
emotional sustenance along with the vital gift of laughter that makes our shared journey so
fulfilling.
I end by dedicating this work to Helen and Frank Wolf, much loved parents and
grandparents, as their belief in the value of education and their love for each other and for us,
continues to set the tone for our entire family today and as we continue into the future.

Introduction

Problem Statement
“On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it’s so valuable. The right information
in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free…So you
have these two fighting against each other.” (Attributed to Futurist Stewart Brand, 1984)
Brand’s iconic statement has continued to resonate and to manifest itself in a multitude of
ways in recent decades, yet our understanding of the value of information continues to remain
remarkably opaque. As the ubiquity of free information on the Internet has disrupted traditional
distribution models, those providing information to consumers, including content creators,
publishers and librarians, have increasingly struggled with how to successfully express the value of
the information and information products they supply. The nexus where the desire of information
to be free meets its desire to be expensive is the setting for this research.
Nicholas, Huntington, Williams & Dombrowolski (2006) claim that the digital environment
has brought about fundamental changes in information behavior and that these have caused the
creation a digital information consumer who differs in several ways from information consumers
of the past. They state that the searching patterns of digital information consumers are shallow,
that they show a lack of loyalty to sources and that they typically use a searching behavior which is
wide and varied. They also note that digital consumers are also far less predictable than the users
who once inhabited the libraries of the 1980s and 1990s. These changes in behavior have had an
impact on suppliers. Empirical studies looking at consumers’ behavior as it relates to a
willingness to pay for online news and information (e.g. Donatello, 2002; and Dou, 2004) have
shown that consumers are generally quite unwilling to express the value they see in information
by using financial resources, the traditional mode of exchange between parties, as an exchange

2

mechanism for it. These studies support the concept that consumers have been conditioned to
expect free information and that such a mentality is difficult to dislodge. The financial realities of
organizations publishing newspapers and magazines reflect the changes. A 2014 Pew Research
Journalism Report stated that newspaper print advertising is now “just 41% of what it was in
2006”, that newsroom staffs continue to decline and that the drop in the value of newspapers
themselves is heavily impacted by recent sale prices. Pew notes that The New York Times
Company accepted an offer for $70 million from the Boston Red Sox’s principal owner to buy The
Boston Globe – a 95% decline in value from when The New York Times first bought the Globe in
1993 for $1.1 billion. Navasky & Lerner (2010) in a comprehensive report for the Columbia
Journalism Review found that only about 30% of magazine websites were profitable: unprofitable
enterprises cannot be long sustained in a competitive environment such as magazine publishing.
Explanation of this dramatic situation involves historical trends and technological shifts
that are complex and multi-faceted. One of the primary factors involved is the emergence of
accessible, participatory content production platforms that have provided agency to millions of
unpaid content creators including bloggers, micro-bloggers and encyclopedia editors. Changing
social norms have had equal impact on the acceleration of the identified trend towards the
democratization of information that arguably began before Guttenberg’s development of the
moveable type press in the mid-15th century. This democratization has in turn caused what Dede
(2008) has identified as a “seismic” shift in epistemology. Dede (p. 81) claims that the current
epistemological shift departs from the classic view of knowledge, which depended on trained
authorities, and focusses on a co- construction of knowledge by communities of contributors.
A second critical factor involved in distribution of the traditional model is the near zero
cost of content reproduction facilitated by the descendants of Guttenberg’s press as embodied by
the millions of computers connected to the Internet and able to communicate and share in a world
without political or temporal boundaries. This has resulted in what Samuelson & Nordhaus

3

(2001) have discussed as the inappropriability of information as producers cannot fully
appropriate for themselves the benefits that their productions create. Protective measures
created within the legal system, such as copyrights and patents, are efforts to reduce
inappropriability, yet these are also under pressure from multiple spheres in the contemporary
information environment.
A third factor providing barriers to the reification of value as it relates to information is
accessibility provided by the 21st century distribution platform. The ease with which consumers in
all domains can access information calls into play the Principle of Least Effort. Bierbaum (1990)
claims that this principle underlies much of library and information science and that it explains
varied phenomena including library staff resistance to many automated systems, the rapid
acceptance of CD-ROM technology as it replaced microfilm and the reliance of scientists on their
colleagues rather than professional colleagues to satisfy information needs. One could easily
extend Bierbaum’s examples to the use of web search engines over the use of traditional resources.
There is less effort involved in accessing free information on the Web than in almost any other
scenario that
can be depicted in a traditional library or information retrieval setting which makes it easily
understood how accessibility is able to play such a primary role in the information behavior of
today’s consumers.
Publishers have attempted to react to the changes in user behavior and to the technology
but the balance has clearly shifted towards the information consumer as shown in Figure 1. The
authoritative content that was providing the value in their offerings is not given sufficient weight
in the balance and publishers are seeking ways to remediate this.

Research Direction
Despite the current market chaos in the public sphere, both producers and consumers know
intrinsically that “right information in the right place” does have value. This can be quantified to a
degree in the ever expanding number of Internet searches and users. Statistic Brain (2015) reports
that in 2014, there were approximately 2,095,100,000,000 Google searches done with an average
of 5,740,000,000 per day so it appears empirically impossible to conclude that consumers are not
finding value in the information to which Google points them. With consumers often unwilling to
express value in monetary terms, producers have sought other means that consumers may use to
express value. That is the direction of this research.
Information producers are searching for relationships with consumers that can fairly
represent the value given by the information provided and the value received by the consumer for
that same information in the marketplace. A primary tenant of classical economics is that
consumers and producers meet in the market to buy and sell and that the “invisible hand” as

5

conceived by 18th century economist Adam Smith pushes the market price to equilibrium.
Publisher expenditures include salaries, materials and distribution systems among many other
inputs. Publishers must maintain profitability in order to satisfy obligations to shareholders and
make investments into infrastructure for future growth. Customer needs include relevant,
authoritative and easy to access information at a fair price among other related considerations.
Consumers must feel they are receiving fair value for the price they pay but, as Nicholas et al
(2006) have found that today’s digital consumers are also far less loyal now than in the past which
may make it more difficult for a publisher to retain them.
The advent of the Internet and the new digital model have disrupted much of the
marketplace balance that previously existed between publisher and information consumer. This has
caused some of the systemic organizational problems outlined in Section 1.1 and caused producers
to seek additional exchange mechanisms to stabilize the marketplace balance. This study examines
some of these mechanisms, including requiring consumers to use money, time and personal data as
expenditures to obtain information.

1.3

Theoretical Framework
This study is fundamentally one of human information behavior, specifically document
selection. It builds on an evolutionary theory of human information behavior. Spink & Currier
(2006) have attempted to build a strong case for the use of an evolutionary lens and noted that
“Information has chiefly been conceptualized as a secondary need…not a primary need like that of
food or shelter. An evolutionary approach may support the elevation of information as a primary
need.” (p. 28). This conceptualization is related to Bates’ berrypicking theory (1989) and the
related information foraging theory of Pirolli & Card (1999). These theories are based on an
evolutionary framework to understand information behavior and depict information consumers in
a natural environment, one which Bates likens to picking berries in various patches in a forest and
Pirolli and Card call “the information patch”. (p. 2). This study draws on this theoretical

6

foundation and seeks to better understand what causes certain documents to be selected or
rejected by providing an experimental situation that is as close to a real world setting as possible.
In this environment, consumers react to the items in the patch by evaluating their desirable
qualities but also face barriers to picking them in the form of expenditures that they may be
required to spend in order for them to select the desired fruits.
Figure 2 is Bates’ Berrypicking model as depicted in her 1989 work. The black line
illustrates the path of the consumer through the patches with the queries represented by number,
documents collected represented by the pages outside the queries and “T” representing thought
that the consumer put into the search process at various points.

Figure 3 is a version of Bates’ 1989 model with the concepts being tested in this study
added to it. The black line illustrates the path of the consumer through the patches but
in this version patches have been modified to show that expenditures are required to
select documents from a patch and to reflect what individuals may encounter in the
online world of 2015. Consumers continue to collect documents but the number and
type may be influenced by the expenditure.

Research Questions
The present study seeks to understand how the requirement that consumers expend time,
money and personal data impacts their information behavior, specifically their document
selection behavior. The following issues and corresponding research questions provide the
structure for soliciting the data needed to better understand the problem.
Issue One: As consumers have increasingly subscribed to Brand’s assertion that
“information wants to be free”, their behavior and attitudes have changed. Publishers can
no longer count on the same willingness to pay for information as in the past and they seek
alternative ways to re-balance the market transaction. This issue results in Research
Question 1, as follows:
RQ1 What impact on document selection behavior occurs when information consumers are
faced with expenditures of money, time or personal data to select documents compared to
document selection when all documents are free?

9

Issue Two: Individual consumers express wide variation in the ways in which they expend
money, time and personal data to acquire both tangible and intangible items. From the
spendthrift to the tightwad, the constantly time-pressed consumer to those with time to
spare and from those expressing little concern or great worry about revealing personal
data, it is possible that these individual differences may correlate to document selection
behavior. This results in Research Question 2, as follows:
RQ2 Do consumer variables, including those measuring attitudes and behavior about
money, time and privacy, impact document selection when the expenditures of money, time
and personal data are placed on documents?
Issue Three: The ubiquity of information means that all individuals are touched by the
changes in the information environment but the impact of personal characteristics may
cause variation in the ways they react to it. Socioeconomic characteristics and status are
known to have wide impacts on individual behavior. These conditions result in Research
Question 3, as follows:
RQ3 Do demographic variables, including age, gender and educational level, impact
document selection when the expenditures of money, time and personal data are placed on
documents?
Issue Four: There is wide variety in the manner in which participants in a research study
such as the one presented here may react to the research and how that attitude may affect
the behavior they exhibit in document selection. This results in Research Question 4, as
follows:
RQ4 Do the variables involved in assessment of the research study impact document
selection when the expenditures of money, time and personal data are placed on
documents?

10

Issue Five: It is known that consumers value certain documents more highly than others
when viewing document sets but it is not known how different types of expenditures may
impact that assessment. This results in Research Question 5, as follows:
RQ5 Does the selection of a “best document” from a document set vary when the
expenditures of money, time and personal data are placed on documents?
Issue Six: Individual consumers may express a variety of reasons for selecting a best
document from a document set but it is not known how different types of expenditures may
impact those reasons. This results in Research Question 6, as follows:
RQ6 Does the reason individuals provide when asked to select one “best document” from a
document set vary when the expenditures of money, time and personal data are placed on
documents?

1.5

Objectives and Scope of the Study
This study is designed to provide a better understanding of how, and in what ways,
consumers of digital information are willing to pay for, and so to express their finding of
value in, general interest information in an experimental setting. It seeks to discover how
different methods of payments, or expenditures by a consumer, will impact which
documents and how many documents they select. The study views the digital information
user as a consumer and attempts to bring together the scholarly perspectives of information
behavior and consumer behavior. It employs a research setting designed to focus on the
aspects of information that would categorize it as a commodity to be consumed in much the
same way as a physical product is consumed.
The findings should prove useful and be of interest to all those involved in creating,
disseminating and consuming information. It is recognized that there are other ways of

11

measuring consumer value in addition to those studied here; however, the three
expenditures used were chosen primarily for their popularity, durability and ability to be
measured. As the Internet continues on its seemingly inexorable course to become the
dominant distributor of popular, scholarly and business information for individual
consumers, academics and those in all types of corporations, there will be continuing efforts
by publishers to better understand the new digital consumer and to seek the optimum path
to recreate marketplace equilibrium. Brand’s described “fight” between free and expensive.

Chapter 2 Literature Review
2.1

Introduction
This study seeks to gather data about information consumers’ selection of documents
from a defined set to better understand what they value in those documents given different
expenditures required to acquire them. It builds on previous scholarly research from several
areas. The inclusion of some popular articles from authoritative sources was required due to
the nature of the research with its emphasis on current news and information and its
dynamic nature.
The scholarly fields found in this literature review include Library and Information
Science, Consumer Behavior, Economics, Decision Making and Philosophy. Several
fundamental questions needed to be addressed using existing literature and research in order
to frame this study including:


What is information? What are some accepted definitions of information? Is
information a commodity? It is a public or private good?



What is value, specifically as it relates to the value of information?



Which theories of human information behavior and decision making are most
applicable to the behavior being studied?



How does research about the economics of information and expenditures to acquire it,
including money, time and personal data, inform this research?



How do previous studies of document selection behavior and relevance inform this
research? Which other factors inform document selection decisions?



In what ways can consumer behavior studies inform information behavior as it
relates to this research?



What do empirical studies about information behavior on the Internet reveal about
the direction of this research?

13

An examination of the definition of information and its characterization as a commodity is
addressed in Section 2.1 along with a brief discussion of its status as a public or private good.
A discussion of value in general and as it applies to information in specifics appears in Section
2.2. Literature on decision making as it intersects with relevant human information behavior
theories is reviewed in Section 2.3. In Section 2.4 there is an examination of literature related
to the economics of information and a look at different ways individuals may pay for it. A
review of previous studies of document selection behavior and relevance and newer aspects
of document selection inform this research appears in Section 2.5. The ways in which
theories of consumer behavior may help elucidate information behavior and help to
illuminate the behavior of this study’s participants appears in Section 2.6. The final section of
the literature review, Section 2.7, looks at empirical studies about information behavior,
specifically on the Internet and outlines how this study builds on their work.

2.2

What is information? What are some accepted definitions of information?
Is information a commodity? It is a public or private good?
Despite the magnitude of information’s importance in our current world, there is
ongoing debate about what constitutes information. Schement (2001) reports that “the word
English speakers recognize as ‘information’ has its origins in the Latin word informare…to
shape, to form an idea of, or even to describe…that is, to inform” (p. 3). In that original
definition, information appears to take the form of a verb, it does something. In many current
definitions, information appears as a noun, it is something. These lead us to the current
environment in which some scholars view information as “process” and some see it as
“thing.” Buckland (1991) added a third meaning which is information as “knowledge” by
virtue of the fact it can reduce uncertainty.
Floridi (2010) states that “over the past decades, it has become common to adopt a
General Definition of Information (GDI) in terms of data + meaning” (p. 20). This definition is
related to the “information “or DIKW hierarchy, discussed in detail by Rowley (2007). Rowley

14

outlines the diverse origins of the hierarchy with particular emphasis on the contributions of
organizational theorist R. Ackoff, educator M. Zeleny and engineer M. Cooley among others (p.
166). The hierarchy in its most basic form appears as below as Figure 4.

Figure 4 The DIKW Hierarchy
This research is concerned only with level two (information) of the hierarchy but level one
(data) can help elucidate a definition that may prove useful. Floridi (2010) states that
according to the GDI, information is created from “well formed data” (p. 21). From a
linguistic interpretation, it would be easy to see how “well formed data” is indeed “information” as in military troops properly aligned. Floridi expands that by stating that well
formed “means that the data are rightly put together, according to the rules (syntax) that
govern the chosen system, code or language being used” (p. 21). This definition seems to
have a relationship to the concept of “patterns” (p. 5) as elaborated by Bates (2005). Bates
cites a 1974 statement by Edwin Parker in which he stated that “Information is the patternof
organization of matter and energy” (p. 5). The search for patterns, which Bates places in an
evolutionary framework, is very much the focus of much of data mining and other new types
of analysis that seek to create information from data.
Floridi (2010) describes various types of information; with the types most relevant to
this research being 1) mathematical and 2) semantic. Mathematical information is a direct

15

product of the work of mathematician and engineer Claude Shannon in trying to reduce the
noise transmitted along with telephone messages in the 1940s. Shannon & Weaver published
The Mathematical Theory of Communication in 1949 from which sprung information theory
and, to a large degree, created the digital age. Shannon and Weaver (1949) presented the
following as a model:

Figure 5 The Communication System (Shannon &Weaver, 1949)
Floridi notes that the Mathematical Theory of Communication (MTC) is concerned with
the efficient use of the resources used in the model above. In a telephone conversation, the
human voice (the information source) is transmitted into electronic signals. The signals are
data. The system does not know what data will be transmitted and so has a “data
deficit” which Shannon referred to as “uncertainty.” As Floridi notes, “the basic idea is that
information can be quantified in terms of a decrease in data deficit” (p. 42) He continues that
“MTC quantifies information by considering the number of yes/no questions required to
determine what the source is communicating” (p. 43.) One question is sufficient to determine
the answer to a yes/no question because if the answer is yes, nothing more needs to be
learned. This is the basis of binary code with 1 and 0 replacing yes and no. The work of
Shannon and Weaver made information quantifiable and measurable in a way that had not
before been realizable before this point. Gleick (2011) notes that Shannon’s work meant a

16

“new unit of measure was needed…Shannon said ‘The resulting units may be called binary
digits, or more briefly, bits” (p. 229).
But is a bit actually information or is it data? Schement (2002) states that it cannot
“be easily determined when one has more or less information…because information is
symbolic, not physical.” (p. 2) Yet every day we talk about filling up a hard drive (with bits)
or having trouble sending a file because it is too large, giving dimensions to what most would
call information. The only way to find validity in both positions is to term the ‘bit’ a measure
of data and to acknowledge the necessity of human intervention to turn it into information.
Floridi (2010) addresses this issue by noting that the mathematical theory of communication
should more properly be described as the “mathematical theory of data communication” (p.
46) because information has a semantic content lacking in Shannon and Weaver’s work.
Floridi’s discussion of semantic information makes a distinction between content
that is instructional and that which is factual (p. 49). Instructional content tells people how
to proceed in a given situation while Floridi defines factual semantic content in the following
way “p qualifies as factual semantic information if and only if p is (constituted by) wellformed, meaningful and veridical data” (p. 50).
Mokros & Ruben also (1991) explore the communication-information relationship.
They propose three distinct conceptions of information as follows:


Informatione which is environmental data and stimuli



Informationi which is information that has been internalized for use by a
living system and



Informations which is information that is socially or culturally created.

Mokros & Ruben create six propositions that provide a basis for the communicationinformation relationship stating not only that the two are “inextricably linked” (p. 377). It
appears that Informatione, Informationi and Informations are comparable to data,

17

information and knowledge in the DIKW hierarchy. This means that information, certainly as
Informatione (such as a fossil underground) can have some physical properties. The
understanding that information has a physical nature is in alignment with the view of
information as a commodity. or information as thing (Buckland, 1991). This view often
appears in the scholarship of economics and also in the law.
Allen (1990) explores information as a commodity from an economic viewpoint defining a
commodity as a "category of items that are traded for a price (or, more generally, that can be
acquired at some resource cost)" (p 268). Allen also looks at some peculiarities of
information including:


Economic agents decide whether to acquire information before they can learn the
outcome conveyed by the information.



The value of information exhibits continuous dependence on its type.



The demand for information is a "derived" demand such as traders desiring
information to make a trade.



Identical copies of the same information are worthless unless the duplicates can be
sold.

Allen notes that the inclusion of information as an economic commodity violates many of
the standard assumptions in microeconomic theory (p. 268-270).
Mowshowitz (1992), in his discussion of information commodities, notes that
business people have been turning information into a commodity tradable on the
marketplace by incorporating it into something that has both appropriability and valuability,
and that “books, computer programs, and databases are traded in the marketplace.” (p.
231). Hassett & Shapiro (2011) have provided extensive analysis of the economic
importance of information and, using Federal Reserve data, show that since the mid-1990s a

18

majority of U.S. business investments have gone into intangible assets rather than traditional
physical assets. These intangible assets include the traditional intellectual property of
patents and copyrights; the broader intellectual capital of databases, general business
methods, and research and development (R&D); and the firm-specific and task- specific
knowledge and practices of managers and workers, or their “economic competencies” (p.
iv).
Information provides challenges to many involved in its use and definition as a
public or private good. Floridi (2010) notes the basis for some of these challenges in his
summary as follows:


Information is non-rivalrous, meaning that the seller of information still
retains it after it is sold;



Information is often non-excludable as it tends to leak and to be easily
shared;



Information has high fixed costs and low marginal costs; the first copy of a
book may be high while additional copies are low (p. 90).

In the legal sense, information has a special status afforded by Article 1 Section 8 of
the United States Constitution as it was adopted in 1787. The law is written as follows: “To
promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and
Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries”. This protection
has created the concept of intellectual property although that term was not used until many
decades after the Constitution was adopted. The fact that the term did develop does mean
there is a “thing” quality for information as created by “authors and…their respective
writings” in the law and in the minds of those who use copyrighted works. There is currently
significant controversy over copyright, particularly around its continued extension. The most
recent Supreme Court decision on extension favored the publishers and extended copyright

19

for most works to 70 years after the death of the creator, far from its original length of 14
years from issue.
There are three distinct ideological bases found in the discourse of those who validate
copyright: those who see it as a natural right, those who believe in its utilitarian use, and
those who see a personality argument. Wu (2013) states that “the dominant culture of
intellectual property retains persistent linkage with the natural law tradition, which
recognizes a natural right in the inventor or creator” (p. 34). Zuckert (1997) traces the
influence of British Philosopher John Locke on the thinking of the Founding Fathers and
describes how his concept of the role of government to protect “life, liberty and estate”
became “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” in the American Declaration of
Independence (p. 79). This serves to underscore how fundamental the protection of property
is in our culture.
Those who take the utilitarian view include Wagner (2003) who has created a
taxonomy of information incorporating the impact of copyright as shown in Figure 3. (p.
1003). In Wagner’s taxonomy, Information Type I is the actual work that is protected by
copyright law. Type II is information that is in some way directly derived from the
underlying creation and Type III is information derived from the original work but only
indirectly associated.

20

Figure 6 Wagner’s Taxonomy of Information
Wagner argues that protecting Type I gives creators the needed incentive to create and that
this causes the production of much Type II and Type III information which is now free to
spread into all directions. He concludes that “each creation of even proprietary information
expands the sum total of open information available for further technological, cultural and
social development” (p. 1033).
The third viewpoint in support of copyright is based on the rights of individuals to
have their expressions of themselves, seen to represent their personalities, protected bylaw.
Fisher (2001) notes that this perspective calls loosely on the work of Kant and Hegel and
suggests that “private property rights are crucial to the satisfaction of some fundamental
human needs” and that “policymakers should thus strive to create and allocate entitlements to
resources in the fashion that best enables people to fulfill those needs” (p. 6). This is a
particularly interesting thinking which seems somewhat out of step with the current
environment of the Web where tools such as blogging software, photo sharing and other
collaborative platforms have unleashed a huge amount of creative intellectual activity with

21

many of those creators being either unaware or unconcerned with copyright protections.
There are also those opposed to copyright, and to giving property protection to
intellectual and artist works. There are various positions to examine but certainly the most
prominent is the argument that information cannot be characterized as property but rather
should be considered a public good. This is a position not taken solely by legal scholars but
also by economists, communication and information scholars and policy makers. Information
as public good is not a specific definition of information but rather a philosophical stance on
its nature and best use. Lemley (2004) uses the commonly accepted definition of public good
which includes the characterization of it as non-rivalrous and it is also not something from
which others can easily be excluded (p. 25). Kingma (2001) notes that public goods provide
benefit to more than one person, and cites the examples of a fireworks display or a television
broadcast (p. 57). Kranich (2004), in her discussion of an information commons, states that
“For democracy to flourish, citizens need free and open access to information. In today’s
digital age, this means access to information online” (p. 2).
Those advocating for information to be used as public good, especially in a commons
setting, often must face the criticism of those who cite parallels and concerns relating to the
physical commons. They note the difficulties of common land wherein one person or a small
group can overgraze or overuse the land to the detriment of others. In response, it is noted
that overuse is not physically possible with information. Lemley extends this position by
claiming that “applying property theory to intellectual property involves the internalization
not of negative externalities but of positive externalities—benefits conferred on another” (p.
2). The benefits of having open access to information are multiple. The Scholarly Publishing
and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) has characterized some of these positives as the
ability to “accelerate the pace of scientific discovery, encourage innovation, enrich education,
and stimulate the economy, and create a better educated populace” (p. 2).

22

2.3

What is value, specifically as it relates to the value of information?
Frondizi (1963), in his introduction to value theory, or axiology, poses the ongoing
philosophical question of whether values are objective or subjective. He outlines the terms of
the debate by stating that “value is ‘objective’ if its existence and nature is independent of a
subject; conversely, it is ‘subjective’ if it owes its existence, its sense, or its validity, to the
feelings or attitudes of the subject” (p. 19). In further exploration of this issue, he finds both
the objective and subjective side lacking. He notes that objectivists fail to account for “the
vicissitudes of man’s desires and interests” (p. 135) and yet the subjectivists err when trying
to “reduce value to valuation” and that “if values were created by the subject, without taking
into consideration any element which might transcend the subject himself…the table of
values would fluctuate capriciously” (p. 123). Frondizi tries to bridge the
objectivist/subjectivist gap by proposing that the situation must be considered and concludes
that “values have existence and meaning only within a specific situation” (p. 158).There has
long been identification of two important types of value, these being “value in exchange” and
“value in use.” “Value in exchange” is suited to describe value when information is viewed as
a commodity to be traded. Griffiths (1982) described value in exchange by stating that “Value
is an attribute that does not exist independently…the act of attributing a value to something,
in effect establishes an equivalence relationship, or set or relationships, which can be
expressed by the following equation:
Va=Vb
where the value of A is equivalent to the value of B and A ≠ B.”
This represents the exchange value, usually expressed in dollar terms (p. 269). She notes that
value has three further characteristics which are: 1) It is subjective 2) Assessments are
situation dependent and vary over time and 3) It can be either positive or negative (p. 270).

23

Willemse & Du Toit (1996) support the first two characteristics noted by Griffiths by
claiming that “Information value is situation specific. It is always embedded in a specific
context. This means no absolute value can be established, only an approximate value” (p. 11).
Repo (1986) states that exchange value is really only suitable for valuing information
products, not information (p. 381). King, Griffiths, Roderer & Wiederkehr (1982) define
exchange value as ‘what one would be prepared to exchange for the entity being valued” (p.
8). They note that a dollar amount is usually on one side of the equation and give the
example “The value of my house is $100,000” (p. 8). The dollar amount may frequently
become the price of the item being valued but they also note that concepts of demand,
availability, and utility confound the determination of price.
“Value in use” is helpful in measuring the less tangible aspects of information.
Saracevic & Kantor (1997) state that value in use measures were developed to extend the
economic treatment of value to intrinsic value dimensions (such as satisfaction, pleasure
and pain) and that this resulted in the unifying economic concept called “utility” (p. 530).
This will be discussed further in Section 2.5.
Repo (1986) discusses the two ways of valuing information and claims that ”the
straightforward empirical economic analysis of information products has met serious
problems especially in describing the benefits the use of information products really give” (p.
373). He further notes that information and information products have philosophical values
such as emotional, ethical and spiritual values which are “almost entirely unexplored” (p.
375).
Repo (1986) also states that the value in use is the benefit the user obtains from the
information and that it can be further categorized by examining the fact of use, measured by
payments for information and reading time, the way information is used as described by the
user and the benefits of use as measured by time and money savings (p. 375). Repo (1986)

24

additionally notes that Willingness to Pay has been used to describe expected value in use (p.
375).
King, Griffiths, Roderer & Wiederkehr (1982) state that use value and exchange value
are often used in the “value paradox” (p. 8). This classic economic problem, whose creation
is credited to Adam Smith, is the apparent contradiction that, although water is on the whole
more useful, in terms of survival, than diamonds, diamonds command a higher price in the
market. The solution to the paradox is generally seen as situated in the perception that
diamonds are scarce and water is plentiful. It appears we live in a time when water and
information may have much in common.
There have multiple studies in the value of information over the past several decades.
Some of this is scholarly work was undertaken to understand the topic more deeply. Much of
it has been undertaken to advocate for libraries, librarians, vendors and other players in the
marketplace to help survive or thrive in times of change. The work of King, Griffiths, Roderer
& Wiederkehr (1982) was part of a large government sponsored study titled “Value of the
Energy Data Base.” This data base was used by scientists and engineers at the Department of
Energy’s Technical Information Center (TIC). The basic methodology used in the study was
to enumerate the “number of readings” of reports done by the scientists and engineers and
then to calculate a “savings value” number based on interviews with the readers illuminating
how much they felt having the knowledge in the report saved them. Savings were seen in
time and equipment and in not repeating work that had already been done. They further
calculated that ”the DOE investment of $5.3 billion in the generation of information and about
$500 million in processing and using information yields a partial return of about $13 billion
in terms of savings to scientists and engineers in their time and in equipment. Overall, this
partial return on investment is about 2.2 to 1” (p. 1). It should be noted that this study,
although conducted by an independent consultant, was financed by the TIC.

25

For the purposes of this study, the most suitable framework is exchange value as what
is being measured is what individuals are willing to exchange for information.

2.4
Which theories of human information behavior and decision making are most
applicable to the behavior being studied?
This research is fundamentally one of human information behavior (HIB) as it seeks
to understand more about the ways in which individuals may value and reveal that value by
their selection of particular information objects or documents. HIB is a large field with many
existing theories and others being developed by scholars worldwide. As discussed previously,
one of the most prominent theories in HIB is that of Bates (1989) “berrypicking” in which she
focuses on a naturalistic setting for information selection. Bates (2005) further explicated
this setting by placing HIB in an evolutionary context, stating that “modes of information
perception, processing, transmission, and storage are seen to have developed as a part of the
general evolution of the animal kingdom” (p. 1).
Adding to the scholarship which seeks an evolutionary basis for human information
behavior, Spink & Currier (2006) seek an historical context, exploring HIB from “pre- historic
ages to the 21st century” (p. 17). They state that the “emerging evolutionary approach to HIB
represents a shift to a more holistic framework” (p. 28). In a further extension of the
historical context, Spink & Currier (2006A) examine the behaviors of historical figures
including Napoleon, Darwin and others in an attempt to broaden the range of HIB study and
place it in a longer and potentially richer framework, not tied to examination of recent,
information rich times.
Another aspect of using evolutionary theory in HIB has come from Pirolli & Card
(1999) with their development of information foraging theory. They state that this theory
draws heavily upon models and techniques developed in the optimal foraging theory by
Stephens & Krebs (1986). They state that “all activities can be analyzed according to the
value of the resource currency returned and costs incurred” (p. 7). In this model, the resource

26

currency returned is the value of the information received and the costs incurred are the costs
to the individual to receive the information. Pirolli & Card (1999) cite the following model of
C S Holling which shows the “ratio of the net amount of valuable information gained, G,
divided by the total amount of time spent between patches, T B, and exploiting within patches,
TW.”. In this equation, R is the rate of gain of valuable information per unit cost. It (p. 22)
appears as follows:
R=

G
TB + TW

Pirolli & Card assume that the forager’s activities are divided between activities in which
they must go “between” patches (TB) in the equation and “within” patches (T W) in the
equation although they note that the patch may be a collection of documents or an individual
document (p. 22). They thus proscribe information behavior that is based not just on
optimization but more fundamentally on what they describe as the “evolutionary ecological
perspective” (p. 3). Pirolli & Card also state that although optimization theory models may
depict individuals as “classically rational”, the decision-making theory of Herbert Simon and
his development of bounded rationality and satisficing must be considered (p. 7).
Simon (1955) challenged the traditional economic model of the “rational man” by
claiming that he felt that it was necessary “to replace the global rationality of economic man
with a kind of rational behavior that is compatible with the access to information and
computational capacities are actually possessed by organisms, including man, in the kinds of
environments in which such organisms exist” (p. 99). Simon (1956) further developed this
behavior with the description of it as “satisficing” and explained in the following manner, “
Since the organism, like those of the real world, has neither the senses nor the wits to
discover an ‘optimal’ path—even assuming the concept of optimal to be clearly defined—we
are concerned only with finding a choice mechanism that will lead it to pursue a “satisficing”
path, a path that will permit satisfaction at some specified level of all of its needs” (p. 136).

27

Prabha, Connaway, Olszewki & Jenkins (2007) conducted focus groups with faculty,
graduate and undergraduate students to investigate what leads them to satisfice their
information needs. They indicate that the situational context of both the participants’
specific information need and their role in academic society affects every stage of searching,
including the selection of resources and deciding when to stop the search. This finding
supports that of a 2003 IMLS Study which they cite as stating that participants’ approaches to
information sources and strategies, and the amount of time and effort they devote to
searching, correspond directly to the importance of their objectives . The concept of
satisficing has become deeply embedded in many aspects of Information Science as can be
evidenced by a universal search of the Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences, 3rd
edition (2010). A search of its contents finds eight separate chapters which discuss satisficing
in topics from “Leisure and Hobby Information and its Users” to “Relevance in Theory” to the
expected “Information Use in Decision Making.”
Some new developments in neuroeconomics have extended and enhanced the
understanding of decision making and may prove promising for all in this field. Farb (2013)
states that (neuro) “imaging techniques may help to explain how decision making changes
under particular contexts, such as physical environment, mood, or a person’s cultural
background. Such contexts may transcend accounts of universally rational actors to explain
why different people perceive value differently” (p. 2). Ariely & Berns (2010) state that there
is currently a lot of “hype” around the nascent field of neuromarketing but also find that
“continuing developments in analytical tools for neuroimaging data…suggest that
neuroimaging will soon be able to reveal information about consumer preferences” (p. 13).
Clithero, Tankersley & Huettel state that “Social scientists (and neuroscientists) should not
treat decision-making phenomena as irreducible and mechanism-independent. Instead, the
joint investigation of brain and behavior will lead to greater success than either discipline
could achieve in isolation” (p. 2351). It seems that the promise of a more biologically based

28

understanding of human information behavior is solid but not yet realized or ready to be
applied in research. Simon’s almost 60 year old theory of satisficing, connected to the
evolutionary ideas of Bates and Pirolli & Card, create the strongest theoretical foundation for
the research here.

2.5
How does research about the economics of information and expenditures to
acquire it including money, time and personal data inform this research?
The research presented here uses three expenditures that individuals may exchange for
information: money, time and personal data.
2.5.1 Money. Adam Smith’s “invisible hand”, which pushes the market price to
equilibrium, has been tested by the Internet in its capacities as a distribution mechanism.
Anderson (2007) notes that the supply of content (i.e. information) has grown by factors of
millions but demand has not (p. 140). This relatively sudden disequilibrium seems very likely
to continue in the foreseeable future.
A 2005 OCLC report authored by DeRosa titled Perceptions of Libraries and Information
Resources found that 93% of respondents did not trust information more if they had to pay for
it compared to the information in a free source (p. 3-9). DeRosa also found that 87% of
respondents had never paid for information from an electronic information source (p. 3- 10).
What is perceived as “free” is powerful; Ariely (2008) has described free as a “source of
irrational excitement” (p. 49.)
Money is the most traditional of exchange mechanisms and is used in all settings for
goods both tangible and intangible. The use of money to pay for information has a long
history and can be illustrated most strikingly by the Romans’ use of thirty pieces of silver to
pay Judas to identify and so betray Jesus. This is a prominent cultural fact throughout
Western civilization and may represent one of the most significant transactions of its kind.

29

From a research viewpoint, in terms of understanding the reasons for the behavior, one of the
most-used measures to represent money in an economic transaction is Willingness to Pay
(WTP). Le Gall-Ely (2009) found that the “concept first appeared in the economics literature
more than a century ago” (p. 92) in a paper authored by economist H.J. Davenport to
“determine prices for pure public goods and services” (p. 92.) WTP has been applied in a wide
variety of situations, including attempts to understand the value individuals may place on
intangible environmental items such as clear air and clean water. Le Gall-Ely (2009) states
that WTP is part of the "price perception process" and is related to various types of price
judgments including reference price, acceptable price and value. She notes that it is also
linked to other variables that influence decision making such as satisfaction, loyalty and
culture (p. 93).
Raban & Rafaeli (2004) applied WTP to a study of information in which they used
Willingness to Accept Payment (WTA). Raban & Rafaeli (2004) discuss that there are
generally three ways to assess the value of information, those being normative, realistic and
subjective. Their study focused on the subjective value of information. They found, as
previous researchers in similar studies before them, that participants created a discrepancy
between WTP and WTA, namely that WTA is a significantly higher number than WTP and that
this is related to individual assessments of the value of the information with this value being a
subjective judgment. They note that “the value assigned to specific information by a certain
person can vary according to external circumstances” (p. 327), a finding that gives additional
support to the 2003 IMLS conclusion about the importance of context.
Lopatovska & Mokros (2008) describe WTP as “an intuitively appealing, albeit naïve
approach” to gauging the value of information (p. 93). They used both WTP and Experienced
Utility (EU) in an information study and found that WTP tended to be a better measure of the
“instrumental-rational value that an information object has in problem solving tasks” while

30

EU “reflects the aesthetic-emotional value that an object has in its own right, as the user
engages with the object” (p. 101).
Cooper (1973) proposed that users evaluate documents in a system and then be asked
two questions by a researcher. The first would be how much, in dollars, he would be willing to
pay to use the document (which is the classic WTP measure) but the second would be how
much, in dollars, he would ask to be paid to avoid the document (p. 90). He then proposed
that the answer to the first question be used by the researcher to represent the user’s best
estimate of the personal worth to him, in dollars, of his encounter with the document. Cooper
continues that “This figure we shall call a document-utility” (p. 90).
Cooper’s reliance on document utility points to a set of broad concepts in economics
including utility, expected utility and marginal utility which are measures used by
economists and those studying decision making to better understand consumer choice.
Ariely (2010) states that “expected utility drives choice in the marketplace” (p. 3). Saracevic
& Kantor(1997) state that “In terms of information, perceived utility can be used as a
measure of value.” (p. 530). Ultimately, utility measures, when studied in economics and
consumer behavior, are often linked to WTP measures and in this way, and others, utility and
value are closely linked. That link is underlying the study here as participants are instructed
to select documents that they feel will supply them with optimum information to understand
the issue at hand.

2. 5. 2 Time Research into time as a valued personal expenditure appears in various
scholarly areas. Wilson (1997) notes that the “economic issues related to informationseeking behavior fall into two categories: direct economic costs, and the value of time.” (p.
559). He cites Stigler’s model which finds that “the cost of time will not be the same for all
persons, since the cost of time is higher for persons with larger incomes” (p. 559). Jacoby,
Szbillo & Berning (1976) state that “consumers…use time as a substitute for money and vice

31

versa” (p. 320) but also that “little is actually known about the time-consumer behavior
relationship” (p. 336). They discuss the continued rise of convenience goods which alleviate
time pressure on consumers but may cost more in financial terms (p. 327).
Leclerc, Schmitt & Dube (1995) conducted multiple research studies to investigate
whether consumers treat time like money when they made decisions. One of their key
findings was that “the value of consumers’ time is not constant but depends on contextual
characteristics of the decision situation” (p. 110). This finding is echoed in the views of
Okada & Hoch (2004) who state while “both time and money are exchange mediums” (p. 9),
“people can more easily adjust the value of their time to the particulars of the situation” (p.
10). Okada & Hoch (2004), in five experiments found that “it is the inherent ambiguity in the
value of time that supports and justifies a different spending pattern than that of observed
with money” (p. 314). They also point out the important statement that people have
“relative inexperience” in time exchanges and that there is “greater construal in valuing time,
which leads to great variance in its valuation” (p. 316).
In a striking example of how direct the tradeoff between time and money can be,
Barton (2014) reported on the addition of toll lanes to Florida highways. He stated that
“Motorists pay 50 cents to $10.50 to ride in express lanes, depending on volume…the cost is
not a reflection of congestion in the free lanes, but it pegged to the number of vehicles using
the toll lanes.” This results in a situation where a driver must make a quick and calculated
decision to spend time in the free lanes or money in the toll lanes, an equation that those
familiar with Benjamin Franklin’s oft-quoted statement that “Time is money” would
recognize.
In the information world, advertising has long been an additional source of revenue
for information providers as advertisers have sought consumer’s time to view their messages.
Kingma (2001) notes that “nonexclusionary information products are typically financed by

32

advertising…the information producer sells access to consumers’ time by other information
producers and continues that consumers must spend time seeing commercials to access the
information or entertainment they want” (p. 64).
As information producers vie for consumer “clicks”, attention as expressed in
consumers’ time has joined monetary fees as a critical and prized expenditure by which
consumers pay for information. The use of advertising ostensibly relies more completely in
the sphere of attention rather than time. If consumers only glance at an advertisement,
producers are unlikely to recoup as much value from that interaction as from one in which the
consumer pores over the offering. Yet attention is notably difficult to measure and time
stands as its substitute. Davenport & Beck (2001) have stated that “Today, attention is the
real currency of businesses and individuals” (p. 3) and continue with their contention that
“purist economists may take some umbrage at our calling attention a ‘currency”. But it does
have many attributes of a monetary instrument. Those who don’t have it want it…You can
trade it; you can purchase it…” (p. 3). Colan (2009) describes the prioritizability of
time/attention by stating that it can be managed like other resources by stating “What you can
manage, however, is your attention. Attention is a resource we all possess” (para 2).
2.5.3. Personal Data Using personal data as a currency is a relatively new development
in the marketplace, and has become more prevalent as technology has expanded. Schwartz
(2004) states that “personal information is an important currency in the new millennium.”
(p. 2056). He also states that “a strong conception of personal data as a commodity is
emerging in the United States, and individual Americans are already participating in the
commodification of their personal data” (p. 2057). Personal data has become an expenditure
for information consumers, but what is being expended is more than the data itself as it often
expands to encompass the privacy of the individual involved. Berendt, Gunther &
Spiekermann (2005) state that in “times of ubiquitous electronic communication…the

33

maintenance of privacy…becomes a subject of increasing concern” (p. 101.) They note that
“given the widespread concerns about personal privacy in a networked world, it is commonly
assumed that online behaviors reflect (privacy) concerns” (p. 102.) Norberg, Horne & Horne
(2007) have found, along with others, that a “privacy paradox” exists and “for all the concern
that people express about their personal information, which could be expected to drive one’s
intended and actual disclosure, our observations of actual marketplace behavior…suggested
that people are less than selective and often cavalier in the protection of their own data
profiles” (p. 101.) Acquisti (2004) takes an economic look and finds that
Many are willing to provide very personal information, in exchange for small
reward. From an economic perspective, one could make the argument that those
individuals who demand privacy but take no action to protect theirs, are actually
acting rationally. They discount the potential losses from losing control of their
personal information (uncertain, but possibly large) with the probability that such
an outcome will take place (uncertain, but perceived as low)” (p. 5).
Grossklags & Acquisti (2007) conducted an empirical study using the indicators of
Willingness to Protect (WTP) which was used to measure the monetary amount consumers
would pay to protect their personal information and Willingness to Accept (WTA) which was
used to measure the monetary amount that consumers would accept in return for supplying
their personal information. They found “individuals almost always chose to sell their
information and only rarely elect to protect their information even for values as little as
$0.25” (p. 3) Grossklags & Acquisti (2007) posit that the gap they found in WTP and WTA
reinforces the existing market reality that consumers are “willing to trade off personal data
for small rewards, or are unwilling to change their behavior when privacy threats arise” (p.
6).
Trust is an important aspect in understanding the use of personal data as an exchange
mechanism. The reification of trust is exceptionally problematic yet critical when personal

34

information is used as expenditure. Urban, Sultan & Qualls (2000) have noted that “The most
important element of trust is fulfillment. Quite simply, trust is earned by meeting
expectations” (p. 42). Similar conclusions were reached by Hoffman, Novak & Peralta (1999)
who noted that “consumers simply do not trust most Web providers enough to engage in
‘relationship exchanges’ involving…personal information with them.” (p. 80).
With information suppliers, trust is often viewed through the lens of longevity with more
established sources of information being more highly trusted. This can be evidenced in the
collection development practices of many libraries that depend on titles that consumers know
and trust as a guideline for acquisitions. Yet the new digital consumer may be far less
dependent on established sources and consider newness a virtue. The very real decline of the
Encyclopedia Britannica and the rise of Wikipedia are illustrative here.
Control, which is another key aspect of understanding personal data as an
expenditure, is closely related to trust as can be interpreted from the words of Hoffman,
Novak & Peralta (1999) in their statement that “Trust is best achieved by allowing the
balance of power to shift toward a more cooperative interaction between an online business
and its customers” (p. 85) and that consumers seek both “environmental control and
secondary use of information control.” (p. 81). They further explain that environmental
control relates to the consumer’s ability to control the actions of a Web vendor. Culnan
(1999) notes that “Secondary information use occurs when information collected for one
purpose is reused for another purpose; it may be viewed as a privacy invasion when it occurs
without the knowledge or consent of the individual” (p. 11) in which case the loss of control
by the consumer is palpable.

2.6
How do previous studies of document selection behavior and relevance
inform this research? What other factors inform document selection decisions?
Much of the vast body of scholarly research on Information Retrieval systems focusses on
the interaction between system and user and on providing relevant results. Relevance has
been a primary focus of document selection for several decades. Saracevic produced two
important publications on relevance presenting literature reviews and frameworks, the first
in 1975 and the second in 2007 which reflects how long the subject has been of keen interest.
In 1975 Saracevic stated that ““One of the major conclusions that can be drawn from
experiments is that relevance judgments are not at all associated with a random distribution.
Although it may appear that relevance judgment is a very subjective human process, it has
associated with it some remarkable regularity patterns “(p. 342). He outlines seven different
types of relevance (subject knowledge, subject literature, logical, system, destination,
pertinence and pragmatic) and concludes that “subject knowledge seems to be the most
important factor affecting the relevance judgment as far as human characteristics are
concerned” (p. 341).
Saracevic’s 2007 work elaborates on other aspects of relevance including those shown in the
table below:
Table 1 Saracevic’s Relevance Aspects

Barry (1994), in her work on relevance, identified 23 criteria through content
analysis as identified by academic users to determine relevance and found the following:
Table 2 Barry’s Relevance Criteria
Depth/Scope

Tangibility

Effectiveness

Accuracy/Validity

Consensus with the field

External Verification

Content Novelty

Source Novelty

Stimulus Document Novelty

Affectiveness

Source Quality

Time Constraints

Obtainability

Rieh (2000) specifically focused on cognitive authority in Web documents which
would most closely align with Barry’s relevance criteria of source quality and source
reputation/visibility. Rieh completed a content analysis of her data and identified six major
facets of judgment mentioned by the subjects as follows:
Table 3 Rieh’s Judgment Aspects
Information Quality

Cognitive Authority

Topical Interest

Aesthetic Aspects

Affective Aspects

General Expectations

Rieh also created a category for “Don’t know” which included subjects who expressed that
they did not know, were not sure or did not care about the process (p. 101).
Relevance and document selection are obviously closely intertwined. Wang &
Soergel (1999) used a model for a study of document selection with 3 areas of consideration
before the accept, reject or maybe decision as depicted in Figure 7 below:

37

Figure 7 Wang & Soergel’s Document Selection Model

The values they use are drawn from consumer theory and redefined for document
selection. Additional discussion of this relationship appears in Section 2.6.
The goal of relevance, which to a large extent seems solved by current search engine
algorithms, is to ease the decision making in terms of document selection by the user. If the
most relevant documents are presented, the user can simply carry them off to perform
whatever information task they may be facing.

Other more recently developed aspects are surfacing in the information environment
which may be having an impact on the way users make decisions about which documents or
content to select. As the Web has moved from a text-heavy space to a visual landscape,
aesthetics are most likely playing a larger role in decision behavior. Norman (2002) who has
studied usability, has concluded that “attractive things work better” (p. 17) and that “tensions
between aesthetics and usability as well as those between affect and cognition” (p. 63) must

38

be resolved. Norman’s work may be partially responsible for some of the rich and visually
satisfying websites that draw users back to them on a regular basis.
The rise of the second iteration of the Web, known as Web 2.0, and the interactive and
social aspects of document selection that Web 2.0 facilitates, are just beginning to be a focus
of study. Muchnik, Sinan & Taylor (2013) have investigated whether knowledge of the
aggregated opinions of others has an impact on decision making when rating content on a
social news aggregation site. Their findings indicate that “prior ratings created significant
bias in individual rating behavior” (p. 647) which illuminates the social behavior involved in
this environment. Another example of the social impact on document selection appears in the
comments section of the website of The New York Times. Registered readers can select
certain posts to “like” and those with “likes” are ranked under a tab titled “Readers” Picks”.
Posts with the highest number of likes appear first and, as based on common knowledge of
user behavior, items appearing first in a list of results are more likely to be read than those
appearing further down in the list.

2.7
In what ways can consumer behavior studies inform information behavior as
it relates to this research?
At first glance, there seems to be little apparent overlap between the scholarly fields of
consumer behavior and human information behavior although they share some similar goals.
This may be a result of the fact that consumer behavior is most often allied with traditional
economics and tends to focus on commodity products and exchange value which, as has been
shown, can be limiting in valuing information. When information is discussed in Consumer
Behavior literature, it is most often information about products and the impact that such
information can have in making decisions or changing behavior as illustrated in the studies as
published by Bettman & Kakkar (1977), Bettman & Park (1980) and Dodds, Monroe &
Grewal, (1991).

39

Sheth, Newman & Gross (1991) developed a theory of consumption values in consumer
behavior and identified five consumption values which Information Scientists Wang and
Soergel later used in a document use study (1998), discussed below. These are functional
value, conditional value, social value, emotional value and epistemic value. They note that “a
decision may be influenced by any or all of the five consumption values.” (p. 160). The table
below defines each value more fully:
Table 4 Consumption Values in Consumer Behavior from Sheth, Newman & Gross
Value

Definition

Functional Value

Perceived utility acquired through
functional, utilitarian or physical
performance; traditionally presumed to be
the primary driver of consumer choice
Perceived utility acquired from an
association with one or more specific social
groups
Perceived utility acquired from the capacity
to arouse feelings or affective states
Perceived utility acquired from the capacity
to arouse curiosity, provide novelty or
satisfy a desire for knowledge
Perceived utility acquired as a result of the
specific situation facing the choice maker

Social Value

Emotional Value
Epistemic Value

Conditional Value

Wang& Soergel (1998) stated that “there is a clear analogy between purchasing
goods and reading documents: Both are need-driven, both involve decision making based
on value judgments and both consider the cost (money or time) of acquisition” (p. 117).
They also note that “document value is the user’s perception of the desirability or potential
utility of a document. Utility is the capacity to satisfy a need” (p. 121). Wang and Soergel’s
modification to Sheth, Newman & Gross’ work appears in the following table:

40

Table 5 Wang & Soergel’s Consumptive Values
Value

Definition as applied to information

Epistemic

Perceived utility to satisfy a desire for
knowledge or information that is unknown.
It can be assumed that this is the
prerequisite for all other types of value. (p.
121)
Perceived utility of a document to make a
contribution to the specific task at hand
Perceived utility to be decided

Functional
Conditional

circumstantially
Social

Emotional

Perceived utility based on association with
specific groups including famous author or
institution
Perceived utility stemming from its ability to
arouse feelings or affective states.

In their study, which involved decision making on documents by academics during an
actual research project, Wang & Soergel (1998) found that documents with epistemic and
functional value were most often selected, those with conditional, social and emotional
value significantly less so. (p. 121).
In another effort in the consumer behavior field, Holbrook (1998) created a
Typology of Consumer Value that includes eight types of value. These are efficiency, play,
excellence, aesthetics, status, ethics, esteem and spirituality. He defines consumer value as
“interactive relativistic preference experience” (p. 5). He elaborates on each of the
elements in the definition by detailing how “interaction” can be categorized as objective
(with value
in the object) or subjective (with value in the consumer) and urges a middle ground in
which the value involves an interaction between object and consumer. He continues
by describing how “relativistic” means that consumer value is comparative (involving

41

preferences among objects), personal (varying from person to person and situational
(specific to a context). The use of “preferential” in Holbrook’s definition as he details
it involves a wide variety of value-related terms including items such as affect,
attitude, evaluation, predisposition, opinion and valence (p.8). The aspect of
Holbrook’s definition that he terms “experience” encompasses the notion that
products provide services that translate ultimately to experiences. It is interesting to
consider how closely that allies with Varian’s (1999) characterization of information
as an experience good (p. 5). Holbrook additionally proposes a framework designed
to categorize the various types of consumer value that reflects what he sees as its
three key dimensions: (1) extrinsic versus intrinsic, (2) self-oriented versus other
oriented and (3) active versus reactive (p. 9).
Using Holbrook’s framework to try to assess consumer value of information would
bring in several new and interesting elements not seen in most studies to date. It also raises
the issues of the many different kinds or uses of information. Bates’ (2006) definition of
recorded information” as “communicatory or memorial information preserved in a durable
medium” (p. 1036), allows for a panoply of different types and uses within. In a superficial
browsing of the eight types of consumer value, it can be seen that there are certain types of
information which more closely align with certain values, as shown in the table below:

42

Table 6 Holbrooks’ Identification of Consumer Values (1998) with examples by
Burton (2015)
Consumer Value
Type of Information
Efficiency

Referring to a “How to” Manual

Play

Reading a Novel

Excellence

Using Google

Aesthetics

Browsing a Coffee Table Book

Status

Quoting Harvard Business Review at a
business meeting

Ethics

Protecting personal information about a
colleague

Esteem

Creating a Ph.D. dissertation

Spirituality

Studying the Bible, other holy books

As is evident from this primary categorization, it is important to note that Holbrook has
stated that the typology characterizes some values as extrinsic (Efficiency, Excellence,
Status and Esteem) and some as intrinsic (Play, Aesthetics, Ethics, Spirituality). So an
individual may read a novel for fun but also because they feel a need to impress friends
with being up on the latest, a businessperson may quote Harvard Business Review to
impress colleagues but also because the findings in the article may increase the firm’s
efficiency and a parent may study the Bible to gain more robust spiritual life but also to
gain any ethical teachings they could pass along to their children. The intrinsic and
extrinsic values of information have been little studied.

2.8
What do empirical studies about information behavior on the Internet reveal
about the direction of this research?
Multiple research studies have found that consumers are highly resistant to paying
and price at all for general news content delivered over the Internet. Donatello (2002),
Dou (2004) and Wang, Zhang, Ye & Nguyen (2004) have produced findings that confirm
users' unwillingness to pay for online news content. Donatello cited the fact that

43

consumers are “not conditioned” to paying (p. 40), Dou found that “the biggest obstacle
that content sites have is the prevailing “free” mentality among internet users” (p. 357)
and Wang, Zhang, Ye & Nguyen point out that “one of the biggest challenges facing online
service businesses is the Internet culture that has developed over the years: consumers
have become accustomed to the belief that such businesses are financed by advertisers
and therefore should provide their content/services for free” (p. 306).
Regazzi (2014) has created the term “infonomics” to describe the new information
economy in which consumers expect information to be free. He cites a 2002 survey in
which “librarians and scientists were asked to name the top scientific and medical search
resources that they used or were aware of. The differences between the two groups are
startling. Librarians named Science Direct, ISI Web of Science, Medline, and PubMed as the
top resources while scientists named Google, Yahoo and PubMed.” (p. 8). While the past 13
years may have seen a shift in the habits of librarians, it seems likely that the shift has been
to the free services so popular with scientists in 2002.
Saracevic & Kantor (1997) reported on an empirical study of value of library and
information services which was sponsored by the Council on Library Resources. The work
involved developing taxonomy of value-in-use of library and information services based on
users assessments. The taxonomy had three general areas including Reasons for using a
library or information service, Interaction with a library service and Results of using a
library service. The results area is the most pertinent to this discussion as it relies on user
assessments of what benefits they received. Saracevic & Kantor did not evaluate any
specific library or information services in this work; their goal was to develop the taxonomy
for others to use. They provided a note of caution by stating that “as a rule, users cannot or
do not sustain a focus on value when interviewed about their assessments of the value of a

44

service.” (p. 561). They state the need for special training by interviewers to successfully
gather and analyze responses in this area. At this time, it is not known how many libraries
or information services have employed the taxonomy to better understand value.

45

Chapter 3: Methods
3.1

Research Design
The advantages and disadvantages of both qualitative and quantitative methods were
considered in research design. Creswell (2003) states that quantitative approaches are most
used in situations where postpositivist claims for developing knowledge exist, such as
situations involving cause and effect thinking. This study is based on such a postpositivist
approach as it seeks to understand how consumers will react to certain expenditures and the
effect that such expenditures will have on their document selection. The research questions
focus on a clear pattern of human information behavior which can be measured, so this also
pointed to the direction of quantitative methods. The research questions are seeking
explanations to identified phenomena, observable to all contemporary information producers
and consumers, and this indicated again that the collection and analysis of quantitative data
would be most effective. This decision aligns with Krathwohl’s (2009) assertion that
quantitative methods are most often suitable for situations in which a clear conception of the
problem has emerged before data gathering. In addition, Saracevic and Kantor (1997), in their
work on the value of libraries, found that users have difficulty in sustaining a focus on value
when assessing information services.
This indicated that interviews and other qualitative research might have difficulties in any
study such as this one that is seeking more understanding of value. It was decided to collect a
limited amount of qualitative data to enrich the quantitative results.
The advantages of quantitative data were deemed to outweigh that of qualitative for the
study being proposed and a modified experimental method was then selected as the most
effective way to get meaningful results. Creswell (p. 19) states that surveys and experiments
are most often the chosen strategies of studies involving postpositivist claims and quantitative
data. It was hoped that statistically significant patterns would be found and that the ability to

46

generalize results to a larger population might be achieved. Any study of human behavior
involves significant complexity because there are so many variables involved in understanding
it. Within human information behavior, individual variables including pre-existing knowledge,
epistemological views, experience and familiarity with different types of content and socioeconomic status may impact document selection. In addition, situational variables including
the environment in which information is encountered and the needs of the individual in a
particular place and at a particular time may cause changes in behavior. This results in the
need for considerable attention to be paid in the creation of the variables so that they most
closely represent the factors that contribute to the behavior being studied.
The research uses a quasi-experimental design in lieu of placing individuals into randomly
selected and randomly assigned tightly controlled treatments. The design used here is quasi
since it uses volunteers as subjects who are randomly assigned to one of four treatment
groups. The treatment and control group use similar selection procedures, however, the
control group does not have a treatment requirement prior to selecting documents. The other
three groups are informed that they must spend money, time or personal data prior to
proceeding with the selection of their documents.

3.2

The Research Model
The experiment strives to be straightforward in design yet contain a large enough
number of variables and cases to provide sophisticated insight into the proposed hypotheses.
The research model, depicted in Figure 8, tries best to simulate a real life setting with
the control group in the most familiar setting, in which all documents are free, while the three
treatment groups will be presented with the necessity of using expenditures to select
documents, expenditures with which they are likely to be some familiar. An in depth discussion
of these expenditures as research treatments appears in Section 3.4.
The model contains three different types of independent variables, collected at two

47

different stages in the research. The first set of variables, classified as consumer variables, are
collected at the beginning of the research process, before the experiment begins. The second set
of variables, classified as demographic variables, are collected at the end of the
experiment. The third set of variables, classified as research variables, are collected after the
demographic variables at the close of the survey. All variables are designed to provide
additional information about the participants and to provide data for analysis to determine if
there are correlations between the variables and document selection behavior. A full
description of all variables and the concepts they operationalize, appears in Section 3.3.
The dependent, or outcome, variable is the number of documents selected by each
participant. This variable is created after the participant completes the survey.

48

Figure 8 Research Model

49

The model functions as follows:
1. Participants are presented with 15 questions designed to collect data
about their consumer attitudes and behavior
2. Participants are assigned a random treatment group by randomizer in
the survey software (free, money, time or personal data). The
randomizer randomly assigns participants to the four treatment
groups by an automated process until each group is filled with the
required number of participants.
3. Participants are presented with a set of ten document summaries
collected from a Google search on the health impacts of caffeine and
instructed to select the documents that they feel will supply them with
the optimum amount and variety of information needed to understand
the issue. They are informed they can review all documents and go
back and forth in the selection process as needed
4. Participants are asked to select one document from the set of ten
that they would classify as the best document
5. Participants are asked to describe, in 4-20 words, why they feel the
selected document is the best document
6. Participants are presented with seven questions designed to illicit
key demographic information
7. Participants are presented with five questions to illicit an understanding
of how they reacted and related to the research itself

3.3

Consumer Variables
The variables were developed to best operationalize the concepts as expressed in the research
questions. The consumer variables are designed to understand both attitudes that consumers
may hold as well as how their actual behavior in the marketplace. They are described below.

50

Attitude about Spending Habits
Since money is one of the expenditures used in the experiment, it was necessary to
operationalize and be able to quantify how individuals spend (and conversely save) money.
The way in which individuals spend money varies and is it not necessarily dependent on
available wealth. There are those who purposely spend below their means and those who
spend well above. Rick, Cryder and Loewenstein (2008) developed a scale that looks at
both ends of the spending spectrum. Their “tightwad/spendthrift” scale provides a
measure of individual differences and is based on the variable “pain” of paying. It was
decided to use an 11 point Likert scale as this scale allows for discrimination along a
continuum which functions as a numeric indicator of the individual’s response and it allows
greater opportunity to express assessments that a traditional five or six point scale. This
scale provides a true mid- point for participant responses.
Attitude about Saving Habits
As a secondary question to solicit data about an individual’s handling and
attitudes about money, users are asked about their ability to save money versus spend
over their income.
Attitude about Time Habits
Time is another expenditure in the experiment and this variable is intended to
measure people’s personal attitude toward it. Davenport (2001), while positing that the
“’time century’ is over” notes that “most of us are still paid for how long we take to complete
a job” (p. 29) so the pressure of the clock still reigns for many individuals. There are many
factors that apply to how people manage or are managed by time, far too many to try to
elaborate upon here, but it is an observable phenomenon that some people always feel
rushed and others do not. It seems possible that people who are always rushed feel that time
is a scarce resource and may value it more highly and want to save it more often than those
who are not feeling rushed.

51

Attitudes about Personal Data/Privacy
The third expenditure used is personal data. This Consumer variable is designed to
determine the current patterns of an individual’s expenditure of personal data on the Web
in order to receive something that they desire. The implied agreement between the
consumer and the information producer is that the consumer is forfeiting something that
will reduce their overall online privacy.
Current Behavior Patterns-Monetary/subscription
This variable is designed to elicit actual behavior patterns as it relates to paying for
information. The payment of fees is currently of two types: subscription or individual
payments for documents. There are also many hybrid situations and individual payment
plans in which subscribers to a hard copy publication may receive some free information
from the publication’s website. This question is designed to elicit the use of subscriptions
by individuals.
Current Behavior Patterns-Monetary/individual purchases
This variable completes the data collection on monetary behavior be eliciting
how often participants have paid for a document on an individual basis. Certain
information suppliers, particularly in the scholarly field, employ this method of
exchange.
Current Behavior Patterns-Time
Since the primary way that publishers elicit time from their users is by the use of
mandatory ads as a gatekeeper to content, this question is designed to determine how often
users spend time watching advertisements to obtain content.
Current Behavior Patterns-Time/Attention
There is an inherent difficulty in separating time and attention; a deeper
examination of which appears in Section 3.4. This variable is constructed to capture an
understanding of both time and attention by asking how frequently participants watched

52

over the required minimum length of an advertisement based on the understanding that
this behavior would represent attention being paid, rather than simply time spent.
Current Behavior Patterns-Personal Data Protection
Because it is understood that a certain number of information consumers maintain
alternate emails to use in situations in which they do not want to reveal their primary
email, this variable is created to understand how many participants might use this
strategy.
Current Behavior Patterns-Personal Data Use Frequency
This variable is designed to quantify how often participants using alternate email
addresses use them in order to gain access to information.
Current Behavior Patterns-Personal Data Use Frequency-2
This variable is designed to quantify how often participants using their real
email use them in order to gain access to information.
Current Behavior Patterns-Personal Data Use Breadth
This variable is designed to elicit information on how often participants supplied
additional personal data, such as cell phone number or zip code, beyond email address, in
order to gain access to information.
Knowledge of Topic
This variable is an assessment of how much people know about the topic being
used in the research. It was posed to explore further if the intensity of the knowledge
would have an impact on document selection, building on Saracevic’s previously discussed
contention that subject knowledge is the most important factor in relevance judgments.
Interest in Topic
This variable is an assessment of how much interest participants have in the topic of the
research. It is supplemented with an assessment of their personal consumption of caffeine in

53

order to better understand how personal this topic is to them and how that might impact their
document selection.
Current Consumption Patterns-Caffeine
This variable is designed to solicit actual behavior as it relates to the topic being studied.
One could posit that those who are heavy consumers of caffeine would have more interest and
knowledge in this topic as the personal impact would prove greater for them than for others who
are lighter users.
Number of Hours Online Weekly
This variable will assess how much time participants spend online outside of work
each week. The purpose is to provide an indicator of how sophisticated an individual may
be in regard to their use of online information with the underlying assumption being that
those who spend more time online outside work may be more sophisticated users.

3.4

Experimental Groups
The experiment called for participants to be placed in one of four different groups: a
control group in which no expenditure was required to select documents and three groups in
which different expenditures were given to participants to be used as an exchange mechanism
for the documents supplied. Krathwohl (2009) states the importance of “functionally
equivalent groups” in experimental design (p. 478) and cites Reifman’s rule that “Everything
Equal Except Essential Elements” will result in solid design. This was achieved in the study by
using 400 participants from the same source (Mechanical Turk) and then employing the
randomizer in the survey software to assign each participant to a group. The creation of these
groups is based on the following concepts.
Control Group-Free
The participants who were placed in this group were not required to exchange any type

54

of expenditure when selecting documents. This is the most natural setting for current
information consumers using a web search engines to search for a general topic.
Group One-Money
The participants who were placed in this group were told they had a defined budget to
spend to select documents. The difficulties inherent in the Willingness To Pay (WTP) measure
as described in Section 2.5 were deemed significant enough to forego its use in favor of a
hypothetical budget of $15.00. Each of the ten individual documents priced at
$1.50 so that selection of all documents would deplete their budget. The price of $1.50 is based
on the Principal Investigator’s understanding of the past and current environment on the Web.
Publishers’ attempts to find satisfactory pricing for their online offerings have involved many
different elements and combinations. The primary factors used in determining the $1.50 price
for this experiment included:


The most recent plan available to those accessing the Dow Jones Factiva
online database would require an individual to pay $2.95 for an individual
document



Academic publishers may charge one price to purchase a document and one
price to rent it for a short period. As an example, Wiley Online Library
currently posts a price of $38.00 for the full text of an academic article and
$6 to rent it for 48 hours



Some publishers give away a set number of free documents per month and
then begin to charge fees for documents that exceed the set limit.



Some publishers do not charge for their online content

For the sake of clarity and to avoid potential confusion on the part of participants, all
documents were given the same price despite their differences in format, source and
appearance.

55

To increase the sense that participants might feel as if they were spending their own
money in this experimental condition, they were told that if they had any money left at the end of
the selection process, the money would either be returned to them along with their stipend for
participating in the research or it would be contributed to a charity of their choice. They were
told that one of the two options would be randomly assigned at the end of the research study.
The charity alternative was created to reduce any tendency for participants to try to hoard
money if they felt it was definitely going to be returned to them if unspent. It is always possible
that participants would attempt to maximize their own monetary gain which would result in few
documents being selected.
The attributes of money which make it suitable as an exchange mechanism for
information are obvious and many. Its history and continued use provide familiarity to those
participants placed in this setting.
The physical nature of money means it is the most tangible of expenditures. This
tangibility provides low barriers to measurement and provides a cognitive ease not found with
intangible measures.
There is high variability in the spending patterns of individuals which makes it
suitable in this experiment.
Group Two-Time
Participants in this group were told that they would be required to watch a 60 second
advertisement for each document they selected. This could total 10 minutes total if all
documents were selected. Although 60 seconds might represent a time commitment slightly
longer than is currently usual in the Web environment, it was felt that it created better parity
with the other treatment measures being used. As discussed in Section 2.5, there is difficulty in

56

separating time and attention as separate measures. Davenport & Beck (2001) note that “in the
absence of precise attention currency, we often use the proxy of time…you measure what you
can in this world” (p. 11). Attention, not merely time, is clearly what advertisers seek when
using it as an exchange mechanism.
Although advertising has appeared in published content for centuries, it has evolved and
adapted to new platforms along with technology. Web advertisements come in various forms,
including broad based banner ads and ads that are personalized to an individual based on their
searching history and preferences. The use of mandatory viewing of advertisements is
increasingly apparent on the Web and is most often used with video content. Google, the owner
of the highly used video service YouTube, terms this type of advertising “non-skippable instream ads” and explains that “Non-skippable in-stream ads are video ads that may appear pre-,
mid-, or post-roll while viewing partner content. They can be up to 15-30 seconds long and
viewers must watch the ad before they're able to watch the selected video. A companion
300x60-pixel ad unit may be usually displayed alongside YouTube videos that show in-stream
ads on desktop.” (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/188038?hl=en).
Three of the important attributes that make time suitable as expenditure in this
study, are its close relationship to attention, its ability to be measured, and its highly
individual use.
Group Three-Personal Data
Participants in this group were told that they would need to supply their email address
in order to select an individual document. The instructions indicated that the email address
would be used only within the context of this research study to better understand research
issues and that participants could be contacted in the future about such research.
Personal data, including email addresses, represents the newest type of expenditure of

57

those used in the study. Chairman John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV conducted a recent Senate
Commerce Committee investigation of the data broker industry and how it affects consumers.
In introducing a bill to regulate the industry, Law360.com reported that Rockefeller stated “In
2012, the data broker industry generated $150 billion in revenue. That’s twice the size of the
entire intelligence budget of the United States government—all generated by the effort to
detail and sell information about our private lives” (p. 1.) Every time a consumer willingly
supplies personal information to a website in order to gain access to information or other
benefits, there is a potential monetary gain for the organization that collects it.
Many consumers are aware of the difficulties of maintaining privacy online and
marketers are sensitive to this awareness. SDL Marketing, as reported by the website
Marketing Pilgrim, produced the following infographic to highlight what is valuable to
consumers:

Figure 9. SDL Marketing Chart on Consumers and Personal Data

58

Email address was selected for this study as a representative of personal data
because it is one of the most commonly used measures as an exchange for information. SDL
has placed it on the “less sacred” side of the personal data continuum they studied. Email
address is understandably easy for producers to use and benefit from; they can add those
providing it to an email distribution list and attempt to develop a relationship using it. The
other types of personal data studied by SDL are relatively harder to obtain and several of
them, such as ISP and location, may be passively collected. In this study, it was necessary to
use a measure of personal data that the consumer knowingly contributed so that the
exchange was palpable.
Consumers may attempt to reduce the privacy issues created when expending
personal data by creating alternate identifiers, such as email addresses, to use in online
transactions. This behavior reveals that consumers are willing to put effort into trying to
protect something they view as valuable. This behavior was operationalized in the creation
of the variable described in Section 3.3.
Three of the attributes of personal data that make it suitable and useful as
expenditure for information as it is positioned in this study are the increased consumer
awareness of its value, its ability to be made tangible and the variations in individual use.
In summation, this study uses three expenditures that are commonly accepted on
the Web between information producers and information consumers. The salient
characteristics for which they were chosen is illustrated below:

Demographic Variables
Several of the most noted studies in document selection behavior have used relatively small
and homogenous samples and little collection of demographic data was completed. Bruce
(1994), Barry (1994) and Wang & Soergel (1998) all used students and faculty members at
academic institutions as their samples. The sample sizes in these studies ranged from 6 to
30 participants. The sample used in this study is much larger and presumably more diverse
than those earlier studies.
Age
The study requires participants to be at least 18 years of age. Due to the knowledge
about the demographics of Mechanical Turk workers, the expected age range is 25-35.
Gender
This question will ask if male or female or if this is information they chose not to
supply. It seems unlikely to yield correlations to information behavior but will give a fuller
demographic profile of the participant base.

60

Perceived Annual Income Worth
This variable requires participants to state how much they realistically believe they
should receive in annual compensation based on their education, skill level and experience.
It is being used as a proxy for the standard question of how much income people actually
have because it is known that a direct question of this type often provides faulty data. The
question as posed is also designed to get an understanding of how people may value the
corresponding resource of time as Kingma and others have used hourly wage rates to
calculate return on investment studies in the information sphere. For example, if
information users report that access to certain information saved them two hours of time,
the return could be calculated using the hourly rate of the individual in terms of savings.
Geographic Location
The study will include participants from the United States and Canada as the content
is deemed to be the most familiar to the residents of these countries.
Who Pays for Internet Access
This variable will determine if the participant personally pays for internet access as
opposed to using public spaces or having it supplied by others. It is designed to contribute
greater understanding to those who may have a passionate belief in the model of free
information.

3.6

Research Variables Research Interest
This variable asks participants to indicate how interesting they felt the research
was. It is designed to explore how level of engagement in the research might impact results.

61

Research Relevance
This variable asks participants to indicate how relevant they felt the research was.
It is designed to find out more about how the relevance of the research impacts results.
Research Realism
This variable is designed to solicit feedback on how realistic the research setting
appeared compared to a real life situation. Although all participants are undoubtedly
familiar with web searching and with the treatments applied, it is impossible to duplicate
their own reality. This variable is a measure of how successful that effort was.
Research Care
This variable was designed to solicit feedback on the speed and care they took with
the questions. Although obviously it would be easy to provide a false answer, it is used to
provide another in the series of motivation checks as described in Section 3.4.
Research Feedback
A text box was designed to solicit feedback on the research in general.

Question

Participant Recruitment and Sample Size
Participant Recruitment
A study of this type requires a large participant pool in order to yield the best
results; more detail is provided below in the discussion of sample size. The introduction of
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk in 2005 has proved to be an effective venue for recruiting large

65

numbers of research participants. Paolacci, Chander & Ipeirotis (2010) discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of using the service for running experiments. They examined
the demographics of 1,000 Mechanical Turk users and found that “there are significantly
more females (64.85%) than males (35.15%) and…the educational level of US [Mechanical
Turk] workers is higher than the general population” (p. 3) They state that “despite the
differences with the general population, on all of these demographic variables, Internet
subject populations tend to be closer to the US population as a whole than subjects
recruited from traditional university subject pools” (p. 3). Schneider (2015) notes that
“though Turkers come from all over the world, they live predominately in the United States
and India, the two countries where Amazon pays them with actual money; others can
receive only gift cards to Amazon.com” (p. A22). Schneider also states that “while newer
crowd-work platforms continue to proliferate—Crowd-Flower, Clickworker, Cloud-Crowd,
and so on, Mechanical Turk remains the standard, especially for researchers looking for a
large and diverse pool of subjects” (p. A22).
Paolacci, Chander & Ipeirotis concluded that “Workers in Mechanical Turk exhibit
the classic heuristics and biases and pay attention to directions at least as much as subjects
from traditional sources. Furthermore, Mechanical Turk offers many practical advantages
that reduce costs and make recruitment easier, while also reducing threats to internal
validity” (p. 11).
Sample Size
It should be noted that while Mechanical Turk was the platform from which
participants were recruited, due to the relatively lengthy response required for this study,
participants were directed to a survey on Qualtrics for the actual research. The instrument
used for recruitment on Mechanical Turk is shown in Appendix A.

66

This research was tested at the probability level of .05 which assumes that 95 out of
100 times the results would not occur by chance. To maximize mean differences between
groups and allow similar dispersion within each group, a sample size of 400 was chosen to
produce a reasonable assessment of the treatment effect of the dependent variables. The
control group and each experimental group was set at 100 participants. Each participant
was paid $3.00 to complete the survey. The payment mechanism exists through
Amazon.com.
The 400 participants were randomly assigned to the control and treatment
groups by use of the Randomizer element in Qualtrics.

3.7

Research Motivation
It is possible that any given participant’s motives may be influenced by outside
factors such as trying to complete the research quickly rather than to get the best answers
as they were instructed. These concerns are mitigated by collecting data about each
participant that might indicate their usual search habits, including their interest in and
knowledge of the search topic, and by querying them at the conclusion of the research
about their method of completion. The survey instrument also includes an “Attention
Check” question designed to ensure that participants are carefully reading instructions.
This was recommended by Qualtrics as a method for helping to ensure valid responses.
The participant recruiting tool, Mechanical Turk, also captures the time that each
participant spent on the study for additional insight.

3.8

Query Subject and Selection of the Documents
The selection of a subject query and the decisions about which documents should
be displayed was an important consideration in the design of the research. The goal was to
use a subject query that would be of wide and general interest. The decision to use the

67

health impacts of caffeine was made easier by the fact that the same query had been
successfully used in a very small study on document selection completed for a class project
by the author in May 2012. The decision about which documents to use was made on the
need to have variety in terms of sources, type, timeliness and content. There was a need to
provide a realistic feel to the document set which was accomplished by using the search
string “health impacts of caffeine” into Google Search in November 2014. Several searches
were done and documents were selected from four different sets of search results. The
document attributes appear in the Table 8 as shown below:

Eisenberg & Barry (1988) found that “relevance judgments are affected by the
order of presentation of items to be judged” (p. 297). Their study did not allow for users
to go back and change ratings once the entire document set had been seen. In order to
ameliorate order effects, participants in this study were told (and were able) to go back
and forth between documents when making selections. Florance & Marchionini (1995)

69

identified the “recursive” and “additive” information strategies. They found that while
some users may use an additive strategy to build an answer sequentially, others use a
recursive strategy which is non-sequential and may involve passing up “information as
irrelevant: and the return to it later because a “new information makes it seem more
valuable.” (p. 160). A random document order was generated for the set by the author but
the study was designed so that all participants would see the documents in the same
order to reduce any power of document order.

3.8

Instrument
The survey was developed on Qualtrics. The final survey is attached as Appendix B.

3.9

Pilot Study
It was decided that a staged pilot study would help to ensure high quality
results. The three stages included:
Stage One: This stage involved the solicitation of four participants to take the
study on paper as a check for wording, usability and understandability. This was
accomplished by use of 2 females and 2 males in the author’s personal circle varying in age
from 25-62. All comments were reviewed and those with helpful suggestions were
included in the next round of the survey. An interesting issue arose regarding the use of
personal data. One participant noted that she maintained an alternate email address to use
with websites and producers with whom she did not want to have an ongoing relationship.
This resulted in the addition of the questions about alternate email addresses. The rest of
the comments tended to be minor and focused on grammar. No one had a problem
understanding how to complete the survey or the purpose of the research.
Stage Two: This stage involved the creation of a small dataset. It was decided that
the primary researcher would create 16 dummy cases in order to test the instrument and

70

to ensure that the data being generated was the correct data to answer the research
questions. This dataset was also used to ensure that the data could be properly generated
on Qualtrics and moved to SPSS which was selected as the statistical software package for
the final analysis of the data. In order to create the dummy cases, the author used the
“contacts” list in her cellphone and randomly selected 16 people. Since she has knowledge
of these individual’s attitudes and habits, she was able to complete the research in a more
life-like manner than if it had been random generation of responses.
Stage Three: This stage involved a collection of 40 live responses for further
analysis and confirmation that the survey was working and answering the research
questions. Forty participants were recruited via Mechanical Turk and offered $5.00 for
completion of the survey. The data was collected in less than one hour. Payment was
made after the answers were reviewed. Only one participant failed the attention check
question so that case needed to be deleted from the data set. Extensive testing was able
to be conducted on this data set and a plan for analysis of the larger data set was created
after this stage of the pilot test. This stage also provided the necessary information to pay
participants in the final study $3.00 as the higher amount used in it resulted in such rapid
and high quality results that it was deemed able to be reduced for the larger test group.

Chapter 4 Results and Findings
4.1

Introduction
This chapter presents the results and findings of the research. Discussed here are the
mechanics of the posting of the survey, payment of participants, a demographic profile of the
participants and reviews the findings using each of the research questions as posed in
Chapter 1. Variable Tables have been created to summarize the results for all variables and
appear at the end of this chapter. The variables appear in these tables (numbers 21-24) by
type of variable. Table 21 shows results for scale variables; Table 22 show the results for
nominal variables; Table 23 shows the results for ranked variables and Table 24 shows the
results for the qualitative research variable. .More discussion of the findings appears in
Chapter 5.

4.2

Data Gathering Process
The link to the Qualtrics survey was posted on Mechanical Turk on Thursday, February 5,
2015 in the mid-afternoon. There was a 100 participant limit set on each treatment group.
The goal of having 400 participants was met in about one hour of having the HIT live. At
that point, the survey was closed. All survey responses were subsequently reviewed for
accuracy before payment. Two participants failed the attention check so received no
payment. The survey completed with 401 total responses of which 399 were valid.
Information about the survey participation was received from both Mechanical Turk and
Qualtrics.

From Mechanical Turk, the following was learned:


Average Time Per Assignment: 17 minutes, 36 seconds



Effective Hourly Rate: $10.22 (This rate is calculated by taking the average
time per assignment and extrapolating that across 60 minutes with a $3.00

78

payment.)
Qualtrics generates Survey Durations, as shown below for this study. The shortest
time shown was 2 minutes, the longest time was 44 minutes.

Hypothesis Testing and Results
Research Hypothesis One: Users will make different total document selections from a set
of documents when expenditures are required compared with a set in which no expenditure
is required.
This hypothesis represents the primary focus of the study. A new variable, Total Selected,
needed to be created in order to do the analysis. To accomplish this, the number selected
by each participant was totaled and added to the available variables.
It was decided that an ANOVA would be the best test to determine if there were significant
differences in the means of the various groups. The six assumptions needed for a successful
ANOVA, as listed below, were all met.
Hypothesis One was tested with the use of a boxplot, as shown below:

81

Figure 12
Box plot of four treatment groups with Mean Number of Documents Selected
Outliers
The boxplot shows five outliers: cases 24, 36, 160, 205 and 213. Case 160 was one of the
participants who failed the attention check and was not paid for participation in the study. The
results from this case were not used in other analyses.
There were two outliers in the control group, case 24 and 36. Case 24 reported very high
ratings for Privacy and Spending Habits yet only selected five documents. The remaining four
outliers showed a similar propensity for selection of a large number of documents with all of them
selecting either 9 or the total set of 10 documents as compared to an overall mean of 3.8. All cases
also showed well above mean responses are questions relating to Spending Habits and three out
of four showed well above mean responses on the question relating to privacy concerns. Two of

82

the four reported estimated annual incomes well below the mean ($20,000 and $25,000) while
two were close to the mean of $50,000 per year. Two were male and two were female. Their ages
were within the mid-range of those reported at 21, 24, 38 and 40. None described themselves as
head of household.
Box Plot Analysis


The boxplot generated shows that the median value for the Free condition is well above
that of the other conditions.



The boxplot also reveals that the median values for money and personal data are
similar.



The boxplot reveals that the median value for time is in between the values of Free and
those of Money and Personal Data.



It should be noted that any constraints on document selection results in greater
selectivity.

Determining Normal Distribution
To determine if the distributions were normal, QQ Plots for all four groups were created. It was
discovered that all four conditions showed normal distribution with the 45 degree line
representing expected distribution and the circles selected from the dataset corresponding quite
closely. This confirmed that there was no systematic error in the data. QQ plots appear in
Appendix C.
Homogeneity of Variances
It is necessary to run a test to determine that the homogeneity of variances is not violated.

Data as presented here as mean ± standard deviation. The total number of documents
selected was highest in the Free group (5.0 ±2.0), followed by Time (4.0 ± 2.1), followed by
Money (3.3 ± 2.0) and then very closely by the lowest group being Data (3.2 ± 2.0). The
Means vary from 3.2 to 5 but the standard deviations only vary from 2.0 to 2.1, a very small
range.

This means that 11/5% of the variability in the number of documents selected was to due to

by chance alone, indicating strong results.
More discussion of these findings will appear in Chapter 5.

POST HOC Tests—Tukey

The Tukey test reveals that:


The average number of documents chosen in the Free condition
is significantly higher than in the Money condition.



The average number of documents chosen in the Free condition
is significantly higher than in the Time condition.



The average number of documents chosen in the Free condition
is significantly higher than in the Personal Data condition.



The Money condition and the Personal Data condition are not
significantly different with respect to average number of documents
selected.



The Money condition and the Time conditions are marginally different
with respect to the average number of documents selected with the
average number being less for Money than for Time.

86



The Personal Data condition and the Time condition provide significant
differences in number of documents selected with the average number of
documents being less for the Data condition than for the Time condition

H1 FINDINGS: These results are interesting with perhaps the most surprising finding being
that the boxplot results were confirmed with the similarity of Money and Personal Data in
their ability to impact document selection behavior. The following findings can be stated:


Participants in the Free group selected a significantly higher mean number of
documents than those in any other group.



Participants are reacting/valuing the same information differently depending
on the condition they are in.



Participants selected the similar mean number of documents in the Money
and Personal Data groups.



Participants in the Time condition selected a mean higher number of
documents than in the Money or Personal Data groups.

Research Hypothesis Two: Consumer Variables will have an impact on the total number of
documents selected by participants.
Scatterplots for selected variables were run initially to check for linearity. The variables
chosen were expected to have a significant correlation with total number selected. Those
chosen were:


How Often Real Email Supplied



How Often Alternate Email Supplied



Knowledge of the Health Impacts of Caffeine

These were anticipated as variables that might provide correlation to the dependent

87

variable.
The scatterplots appear in Appendix D. No apparent linearity can be seen in these plots.
Since it seemed puzzling that linearity could not be established, it was decided to run the
Pearson’s correlation for more data. This test confirmed that there were not significant
correlations between the Consumer Variables selected and the Total Number Selected. All
Correlation tables appear in Appendix E.
H2 Findings: There were no significant correlations between the Consumer Variables
and the Mean Number of Documents selected.
This was surprising as it was expected that behaviors and attitudes would impact the ultimate
selection of documents. The variables that were created to assess participant’s attitudes
about spending might have been correlated to their spending in the Money condition along
with attitudes and actions about privacy and time having correlations there. The fact that
there were no correlations points to the overarching importance of the expenditure in
determining their document selection behavior.
Research Hypothesis Three: Demographic variables will have an impact on the total
number of documents selected by participants.
Scatterplots for selected variables were run initially to check for linearity. The variables
chosen were expected to have a significant correlation with total number selected. Those
chosen were:


Age



Perceived Annual Income Worth

The scatterplots appear in Appendix C. No apparent linearity can be seen in these plots.
Since it seemed puzzling that linearity could not be established, it was decided to run the

88

Pearson’s correlation for more data. This test confirmed that there were no significant
correlations between the Demographic Variables and the Total Number Selected. All
Correlation tables appear in Appendix D.
H3 Findings: There were no significant correlations between the Demographic
Variables and the Mean Number of Documents selected.
This was surprising as it was expected that demographic variables might have some impact
on document selection behavior. The strongest variable was expected to be the participants’
estimate of how much they believed they should earn annually as it would seem that a
relationship could exist between high income individuals and spending money for
information. It was posited that age might influence document selection behavior with
younger participants being more likely to provide an email address than older ones. The fact
that such correlations do not exist again points to the impact of the treatment and potentially
to the power and validity of the statement that “information wants to be free.”
Research Hypothesis Four: Research variables will have an impact on the total number of
documents selected by participants.
Scatterplots for selected variables were run initially to check for linearity. The variables
chosen were expected to have a significant correlation with total number selected. Those
chosen were:


Research Interest



Research Relevance

The scatterplots appear in Appendix C. No apparent linearity can be seen in these plots. Since
it seemed puzzling that linearity could not be established, it was decided to run the Pearson’s
correlation for more data. This test confirmed that there were no significant correlations
between the Research Variables and the Total Number Selected. All Correlation tables appear
in Appendix D.

89

H4 Findings: There were no significant correlations between the Research Variables
and the Mean Number of Documents selected.
Although correlations with these variables were not expected to be as strong as those with
Consumer or Demographic variables, it is interesting that no correlations existed at all. This
may be related to the participant pool.

Other Relationships Tested
The lack of correlation between any of the Consumer, Demographic and Research (nontreatment) variables with the Pearson’s Correlation test discovered that there was no linear
relationship between them as discussed above.
To determine whether curvilinear relationships or non-linear relationships might be found,
all permutations of the non-treatment variables were also tested against the dependent
measure, the total number of documents selected, in regression models. None of these
regression models produced meaningful results and thereby confirmed that none of the nontreatment variables were responsible for explaining variability in the total number of
documents selected.
Research Hypothesis Five: The document selected as best will vary from group to group.
Note: A summary of the documents appears in Chapter 3, section 3.9.
In order to analyze this hypothesis, it was necessary to determine what was chosen as best by each
group. The following was determined:

Figure 13 Most Selected Documents
It can be seen that the documents that varied most from the norm are documents 7,
8 and 9. The characteristics of these reveal that the most popular is Document 8.
Characteristics of this document include that it was from a popular source, the US Food and
Drug Administration. No date was given on the document representation, although
participants may have assumed that a website as supplied by the US Government, is very up
to date.
The least selected as best document were Document 7, also from a popular source a,
The CaffeineInformer, although this source is not as widely known as the US Food and Drug
Administration. No date was available for the document. Document 9, which was also well
below midrange in terms of number of participants selecting, was from Addiction, which
appears to be a mix of scholarly and popular content. The date listed was December 1994,
and it was the oldest document in the document set made available. This document took an
unusual approach to the discussion of caffeine by focusing on the commercial interests that

92

may benefit financially from having people become addicted to caffeine and would provide
seemingly little value to those seeking information about the health impacts of caffeine.
H5 Findings: There was a slight variation in what was selected as best document
depending on treatment group. The data does not lend itself to further statistical
testing. Deeper analysis across groups revealed one document was by far the most
selected and several were well below average in the number of those who selected.
Research Hypothesis Six: There will be a difference in the reasons given for selecting the
best document depending on group.
This hypothesis can be tested by coding the qualitative data provided by participants and
then determining the most important factor in the participants’ selection. Participants were
told they were to provide a reason for selecting the document as best document in 4-20
words. In order to do so, it was necessary to develop a codebook that represented all
possible answers. This required examination of past research to discern the reasons
participants have given for document selection. A traditional measure used in document
selection is information quality.
Belkin & Rieh (2002) compiled a table showing definitions of quality as shown below:

Content was the most given reason for naming a document “best document”. Some of the
comments given by those using this code included:
Content-Sample Responses


“It has the most solid, scientific evidence”



“It seems pretty scientific and it presents pros and cons on the issue”



“It seems the most unbiased and, and seems to just be providing the facts”



“It gets to the heart of the matter which is how caffeine affects the brain”



“It gives me enough details and lists the main things about caffeine”

Sample responses for the other codes are as follows:
Relevance—Sample Responses


“It is relevant to me as I have a child of that age”



“My father has Alzheimer’s”

95



“Alzheimer’s disease runs in my family, so I am interested most in this
article”



“I am interested in this specific research area”



“I'm not really good at reading and retaining information that way so a video
form would help me to understand the subject better”

Timeliness—Sample Responses


“Most current research available amongst research papers”



“It is one of the most current and seems to be very in depth”



“It's the most recent, comprehensive study I can see”



“This is a recent document and seems to outline everything I want to know”



“This is the most up to date piece of info by something that could be
considered proper science”

Source—Sample Responses


“The document comes from a fairly unbiased source. The source doesn’t
receive funding from paid sources”



“The Food and Drug Administration is a government organization”



“I trust the FDA to provide thorough, accurate and useful information”



“It’s coming from a trusted source, one I am quite familiar with”



“I have been a longtime fan of Lifehacker and trust their hacks”

Other-Sample Responses


“It has video. Who really reads LOOONG articles nowadays? It is 2015
already. Give me the visual representation”



“Makes it easy to read in a fun format.”



“It looks the most likely to hold my attention”

96



“I didn't want to choose any, since I don't want to give away my email
address”



“If I am paying for something, I would rather watch a video”

Coding reliability was confirmed by having the data coded by another individual
after the initial coding was completed by the researcher. The individual selected was a
fellow MLIS graduate and information professional. The instructions provided were to read
each comment and code it with the appropriate numeric code. In the case of a comment
where more than one reason was included, the instructions indicate that the code should be
applied for the first reason given.
Cohen’s kappa was run in SPSS to determine intercoder reliability. There was good
agreement with the kappa=.663, with p<.0005.

H6 Findings: Content was given as the primary reason for selecting a document as
best document in Group One (Free). Content was given as the primary reason for
selecting a document as best document in Groups Two, Three and Four. Although
these data is not able to provide an in-depth statistical analysis of the reasons given, the
conclusions do give weight to those currently positing that the source of a document, once a
primary indicator of authority and value, may be waning. Dede’s description of a shift in
epistemology from the classical in which ‘Premier reference sources, such as the
Encyclopedia Britannica, and curricular materials, such as textbooks, embody“
authenticated” knowledge as compiled by experts and transmitted to learners” (p. 80) to an
epistemology which is more collaborative and less dependent on experts may be reflected
here with more participants choosing content over source as the primary reason for their
best document selection. This result also reflects the finding of Wang & Soergel (1998) that
documents with epistemic and functional value were most often selected.



“Information need and desirability would certainly depend on a baseline-- and,
yes, you did ask how much I knew about caffeine--so I likely selected a much
different article than if I had a lot less experience with caffeine. The article I
selected I felt would give me the most info that I would not have already seen, as
it seemed to indicate that there was some squelching of info due to lobbying by
the industry”



“None, but some of the articles presented looked extremely boring and plain”



“I would have maybe wanted a little more of a directed purpose statement for my

Chapter 5 Discussion and Conclusions
5.1

Overview
This objective of this study was to gain more understanding of how, and in what
ways, consumers of digital information are willing to pay for, and thus express their finding
of value in, general interest information. Four groups were studied: those who were
required to make no overt expenditure, those required to spend a stated monetary budget,
those who were required to expend time and those who were required to expend personal
data.
An analysis of the data collected by the survey instrument, as outlined in Chapter 4,
indicated that the study generated some significant findings. These findings, and their
implications, are discussed in context of the research questions posed in Chapter 1.

5.2

Discussion of Findings related to Research Questions
RQ1 What impact on document selection behavior occurs when users are faced with
expenditures of money, time or personal to select documents compared to document
selection when all documents are free?
As discussed in Chapter 4, the statistical analysis of the results of the total number of
documents selected by those in each of the four groups, conducted by a one-way ANOVA,
found that the average number of documents selected is significantly different between
expenditure conditions. This means that different required expenditures required of
information consumers will cause them to select a different mean number of documents. A
further statistical test, Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) was used to explore
which groups differ. As shown in Chapter 4, the effect size calculation revealed that 11/5%
of the variability in the number of documents selected was due to the treatment effect. As
effect size is a measure of strength, this was a satisfactory result.

107

The Tukey test determined that the average number of documents chosen in the
Free condition was significantly higher than in all three other conditions, those being
money, time and personal data expenditure. While not surprising given the extant empirical
evidence, it does provide a basis to explore what free actually means to consumers.
Shampanier, Mazar & Ariely (2007) discuss the tendency of consumers to “overreact” to the
price of free (p. 743) and in some cases increase how much they value products offered free.
Their research on “zero as a special price” explores the significance of zero with three
possible mechanisms and finds that the “zero-price effect might be better accounted for by
affective evaluations than by social norms or mapping difficulty” p. 754). While the work of
Shampanier et al. focusses on products that individuals are not accustomed to paying zero
for, as may not be the case with information, their examination of the power of zero could
provide illumination on the power of free with information.
The finding also raises questions about the culture and norms of the Internet as a
distribution system that may contribute to the change in consumer behavior. Ghosh (1998)
describes the early Internet culture as one of a modified (and hypothetical) “cooking pot
model” in which individuals contribute and share resources without compensation (p. 13).
Ghosh is specifically addressing those who contribute to the Internet with shared postings,
technical expertise and other types of content but his analysis raises the issue of the
interactive nature of the Internet which may lend itself to a free distribution model. The
influence of the Internet’s early inhabitants may pervade users’ attitudes and behavior and
create expectations of free content that have now become rigidified.
The Tukey test also determined that the Money condition and the Personal Data
condition were not significantly different with respect to average number of documents
selected. This treatment may need specialized research in future studies because a)the cost
versus compensation issue previously noted may influence participants in this group to

108

select fewer documents in order to receiver greater personal compensation and b)the
financial incentive may work to have participants examine documents more carefully
which could result in fewer selected. This is an interesting finding because it places
expenditures of money and personal data in a similar category. The use of personal data as
an exchange mechanism is growing rapidly and gaining the attention of consumers.
Schwartz’s (2003) assertion that personal information is a currency led him to define a new
market for personal data and he is viewing it clearly as an exchange mechanism for money.
In this setting, third party organizations may be purchasing personal data from brokers.
Personal data can also be viewed as a currency by those who trade it for more personal data
in a social capital context as may be legitimized by the vast array of social media networks
currently extant.
The third and final result from the Tukey test showed that the Money condition and
the Time condition are marginally different with respect to the average number of
documents selected with the average number being less for Money than for Time. This is
interesting as money and time are so often given equivalent status in our personal and
public discourse yet in this study, they separate, at least to a marginal degree. The higher
mean for the time condition may give rise to the conclusion that information consumers are
more willing to part with their time than their money in the acquisition process but the
finding also needs to be examined in light of the contention by Soman (2001) that “It is
possible individuals do not follow conventional ‘red and black’ accounting systems with
time because it is cognitively more difficult” (p. 183). The difficulty in separating time and
attention is also an important aspect that should be considered in evaluation of this finding
as publishers and consumers may be at odds when publishers seek attention and
consumers give them time.

109

Research Questions 2, 3, 4
RQ2 Do consumer variables impact document selection when the expenditures of
money, time and personal data collection are placed on documents?
RQ3 Do demographic variables impact document selection when the expenditures of
money, time and personal data collection are placed on documents?
RQ4 Do the variables involved in assessment of the research study impact document
selection when the expenditures of money, time and personal data collection are placed
on documents?
These Research Questions were formulated to search for correlations between
individual characteristics and document selection behavior and no such correlations were
found. This finding could be used to strengthen the initial one that the treatment groups were
impacted by the treatment and not by any tested attributes of the individual participants. In
this study, the treatment effect dominated in providing statistically significant results which
explained the mean number of documents selected regardless of personal attributes. It is
certainly possible that there are other personal variables outside the scope of this study that
could have correlated with the dependent variable but the number of variables tested gives
some indication that these types of variables may truly have little impact.
RQ5 Does the selection of a “best document” from a document set vary when the
expenditures of money, time and personal data collection are placed on documents?
There were slight differences between groups in the “best document” selected. In both
the free and money groups, document 8 (FDA) was selected as best. In the time group, there
was a tie between documents 2 and 10 (LifeHacker and Video). In the data group, document 5
(National Geographic) was chosen as best.

110

When the responses of all groups are merged, however, a best document clearly
emerges with almost 25% of the total participants selecting the same document (Document
8). This would seem to indicate that although the differences did exist when viewing by
treatment, the expenditures were not strong enough to impact the assessment of this
document overall.
It should also be noted that there did not appear to be any strong impact from the
presentation order of the documents. There are several explanations for this:


participants were not given results in the format of search engines where up
to ten results can be viewed at a time allowing for a quick scan before making
a selection



the documents were presented in an order determined by the Principal
Investigator and not ordered by a search engine and so the order did not
necessarily reflect any calculated relevance



participants did not select the search topic or the search words which
created the document set so expectations could be different from a selfdirected search

RQ6 Does the reason individuals provide when asked to select one “best document”
from a document set vary when the expenditures of money, time and personal data
collection are placed on documents?
Participants in the control group (free), and the time and personal data group
provided reasons for their best document selection that led to coding their selection as
based on content. The content code was designed to cover all aspects of content and was
applied to some aspects of document format and presentation as well. The documents
presented were written for a wide range of audiences from scholarly to popular although

111

they were all retrieved from a web search and no library databases were used so the
scholarly documents should have been accessible to general readers.
The Money groups’ explanations led to coding for Source. Although the data does
not lead to in-depth statistical analysis, it points to an interesting trend which could be
expressed as a consumer willingness to select documents with known “brands” when paying
money for information. Consumers may be using a brand heuristic to make a selection as the
brand may signal quality, comprehensiveness and other positives in the consumer’s mind.
The study found that the groups did not select the same number of documents. It was
also discovered that the independent variables categorized as Consumer, Demographic and
Research did not significantly affect the number of documents selected by participants.
The revised research model, shown in Figure 14 reflects the outcome of the study. It
can clearly be seen that participants in the money group selected a higher mean number of
documents and that money and personal data acted as a higher barrier than time in terms of
total number selected. These results appear in the revised model.
The independent variable groups did not have a significant effect on the results and so
are deleted from the revised model.
An additional finding, not depicted in the revised model, is that the expenditures did
not significantly affect what document participants selected as “best document”. The group
designation also did not significantly affect the reason they stated for choosing the document.

Theoretical Implications
This study was structured on the theoretical underpinnings of a naturalistic,
evolutionary theory of human information behavior as developed by Bates (1989), Pirolli &
Card (1999) and Spink and Curry (2006). It can reasonably be ascertained that this study
both draws strength from and adds to this theoretical underpinning. The results provide
evidence to posit that as users move through the information patches as described by Pirolli
& Card, they deplete a patch faster if the barriers to entry are low and less quickly if the
barriers are high. The changes to Bates’ Berry-picking Model, as shown in Figure 5, reflect

113

this reality. Bates’ original model depicted an equal number of documents being extracted
from each query/document set but this study reveals that that number will vary depending
on the conditions in the patch.
The study was also designed to further the reification of the value of information by
using document selection behavior as a representation of the value that the information
consumer attributes to any given document. This can be seen most clearly using Griffith’s
equation, depicted on p. 23, in which Va=Vb where the value of A is equivalent to the value
of B and A ≠B, these results can be used to represent the equation as follows:
Vdocselected=Vexpenditure
in which a document selected is considered by the information consumer to have equivalent
value to the expenditure, whether it be time, money or personal data. Each of the
documents selected by each individual user may be considered to have been worth the
expenditure to that participant in the context of the experiment and so could be
represented as follows:

Implications
The implications of this study’s findings could prove beneficial for all those producing and
distributing information to consumers. For the purposes of this discussion, producers will
be broken down into two primary sectors: general news and information, and scholarly
information. Although one individual may be consuming information as a member of both
sectors, the environment and cultural norms of each is different and therefore gives rise to
different implications.
For the producers of general news and information, these results confirm and
extend other empirical studies that find consumers do not want to pay for information. As
participants in the free conditions selected a significantly higher mean number of
documents than those in any other treatment, this clearly shows that “free” is established
firmly as the preferred exchange value. This confirms previous empirical studies as well as
giving enhanced credence to Brand’s words. As many are doing in the consumer
marketplace, it would seem desirable, if not imperative, to focus on other types of
expenditures and others are doing so. Some providers, including the Financial Times, may
seek “opinion” as a currency as shown in Figure 15. This type of arrangement is more like a
barter situation with the exchange mechanism being intellectual capital on both sides of the
equation. This may help reduce the inapproprobility of the information asset being offered.

115

Figure 15 Financial Times Expenditure Required to Access Content

The preference for free is also influencing the more traditional world of scholarly
publishing and the information behavior of academia. As Open Access models continue to
gain momentum, more information consumers will expect free, just as they have learned to
do in the consumer sphere. As of this writing, The Registry of Open Access Repositories
Mandatory Archiving Policies (ROARMAP) reports that open access mandates have been
adopted by over 240 universities and over 90 research funders worldwide. Alternative
exchange values are currently rare in the academic sphere but may be utilized if current
trends continue.

116

5.5

Limitations of the Study
The study was designed as an experiment to provide the optimum testing
environment for the research questions. The limitations of an experimental design are
inherent in the environment; although 8.78 (out of 11) was the mean score when
participants were queried about how realistic they found the research. The participants’
assessment of their own particular treatment does not provide a measure that would
support the external validity of the design. However this does provide for an indication of
the face validity of the particular treatments. Only an actual live setting in which users are
spending their own money, time and giving up their own personal data can provide results
that are of higher caliber. Experimentation also relies on the ability to reproduce results, so
another limitation of this study is that it was conducted only once.
It would be beneficial to administer the study again at a different time and to a different
pool of users to find out if the results could be duplicated.
The sample was not selected randomly and this limits generalization of the
research findings.

Prior studies conducted in naturalistic settings usually used

convenience samples as well although those investigations used far fewer respondents
than the present study.
The document set was relatively small which could be considered a limitation but
studies on the number of documents actually examined in real searches reveal that
individuals rarely go beyond the first page of results, typically ten results, when searching
the Web. Thus, the current study capped the number of potential documents that could be
selected at ten based so as to best provide the most familiar environment for consumers.
It is always possible that subjects will behave in a cooperative way to please the
experimenter. This study did not account for experimenter error that could occur because
of this. Note that the control group would be subject to the same level of such error and

117

thus all four of the groups might be expected to include such error in the same direction.

5.6

Future Research
This study focused on expenditures that information consumers may be called on
to use in exchange for information. One of the major findings, that the mean number of
documents selected by those in treatment groups using money and personal data as an
expenditure was fewer than the number selected in other groups, would appear to be an
avenue for additional research to examine further the ways that money and personal data
may relate in terms of consumers’ behavior and attitudes. The expected relationship
between using personal data to acquire information is based on the concern for individual
privacy. In further discussion with one of the pilot study participants, it was revealed that
privacy was not the main concern but that information filtering was primary. The study
participant commented that her major concern with supplying an email address was that
her email inbox would become so crowded that she would miss something vital. The
reluctance to expend an email address can be situated in personal information
management context which would be an interesting and potentially fruitful avenue for
future research.
It would also be interesting to use other types of expenditures to evaluate how
consumers might use them as exchange mechanisms for information. These types of
efforts would most likely come under consideration by organizations in the need of
different and new business models to help them work with the new digital information
consumer.
This study focused expenditures as an expression of value for information but did
not explore the types of value that information may supply and if consumers might use
expenditures differently if the types were varied. The use of Holbrook’s typology would
provide a fascinating research study to determine how consumers might relate these values

118

(efficiency, play, excellence, aesthetics, status, ethics, esteem and spirituality) to their daily
information behavior habits and if consumers attached different value to them. The
increasing amount of information that consumers are presented with and its intrusion into
all aspects of activity could make for meaningful insights.
In closing, it should be noted that Brand’s statement gives an agency to information
that is, at its core, somewhat curious. It may certainly be valid that information consumers
want information to be free but ascribing a “want” to information gives it a power that may
not seem warranted. Enter Floridi, the Philosopher of Information, who has suggested that
inanimate things have moral value that may merit them some degree of respect. Floridi
discusses the emergence of the infosphere which exists along with our natural world and
points to clear biocentrism in terms of our ethical code. Does information or perhaps
specific information objects have inherent rights that require them to be treated with
dignity and fairness? Future researchers may have the ability and need to explore that
question and others in a comparable domain and the answers may not be at all what might
be expected or anticipated.
