THE AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF AWARD-WINNING
MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN’S AND YOUNG ADULT LITERATURE IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NORTHEAST OHIO (178 pp.)
Director of Dissertation: William P. Bintz, Ph.D.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the availability and accessibility of
multicultural children’s and young adult literature as represented by winners of ethnicspecific youth literature awards in selected public libraries in Northeast Ohio. The
researcher searched Online Public Access Catalogs for winners and honor books of the
American Indian Youth Literature Award, Américas Award, Asian/Pacific American
Award for Literature, Carter G. Woodson Book Award, Coretta Scott King Book
Awards, Pura Belpré Award, and Tomás Rivera Mexican American Children’s Book
Award. The data were analyzed for the frequency of occurrence of each title in the
holdings of 36 library systems and 172 central libraries, branches, and mobile units
within those systems. The results show that only six of the 172 library outlets in the
study had more than 50% of the 449 books in the study, while 148 outlets had fewer than
30% of the titles. The average number of books held by library outlets was 85.4 titles, or
19% of the books in the study. This information should be of interest to teachers,
librarians, teacher and librarian educators and their students, and others who are
interested in multicultural youth literature, as it calls attention to the current availability
and accessibility of multicultural youth literature in public libraries, and advocates for all
children in this increasingly diverse country to have access to books that reflect their own
culture and ethnicity, and other cultures and ethnicities, as well.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
There has been considerable media attention on the lack of diversity in books for
children and young adults (e.g., Blair, 2013; Horning, 2014; Kirch, 2013; Mantle, 2013;
C. Myers, 2014; W. D. Myers, 2014; “Why hasn’t the number,” 2013). The Cooperative
Children’s Book Center (CCBC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison compiles
annual statistics on children’s literature published in the United States written by and
about people of color, which the CCBC defines as Africans, African Americans,
American Indians, Asian Pacifics, Asian Pacific Americans, and Latinos (Cooperative
Children’s Book Center, 2014). In a 2014 article, Kathleen Horning, director of the
CCBC, reports, “As of July 11, we had received 1,509 trade books published in 2013. I
found that 1,183 (78.3 percent) were about human beings. And just 124 of those (10.5
percent) featured a person of color. And that also means that 1,059 of the books about
humankind (89.5 percent) were about white people” (Horning, 2014, p. 20).
Public Libraries and Multicultural Youth Literature
In a diverse country such as the United States, children’s and young adult books
by and about people of color should be available and accessible in local public libraries in
diverse communities, as well as in communities that are not diverse. Children of color
need to read culturally authentic books by and about people from their own culture.
White children, teachers, and preservice teachers, as well as children of color, need to
read culturally authentic books by and about people from other cultures. Public libraries
are a valuable resource for reading material in communities, and should be a source for
1

2
multicultural literature for children and young adults. Additionally, many students of
color score lower than their white peers on reading assessments (Snyder & Dillow, 2012).
Research shows that students who read more perform better in school (Krashen, 2004), so
low-performing students should be encouraged to read more books that interest them,
including books by and about people who share their culture, and these books should be
available and accessible in public libraries.
Public Libraries Are an Important Resource in Communities
Students benefit in many ways from reading (Kasten, Kristo, McClure, &
Garthwait, 2005; Krashen, 2004, 2011), and public libraries are a vital resource for access
to books (Krashen, 2011, 2013; Krashen, Lee, & McQuillan, 2012). In 2010, 297.6
million people in the United States, or 96.4% of the U.S. population, were served by
public libraries (Institute of Museum and Library Services, 2013). In a recent national
study of library use, 70% of the respondents who are parents stated that at least one of
their children has visited a public library or bookmobile in the past 12 months (Pew
Research Center, 2013). When discussing the study participants as a whole, the report
states, “In general, women, African-Americans and Hispanics, adults who live in lowerincome households, and adults with lower levels of educational attainment are more
likely than other groups to say these [public library] services are ‘very important,’ as are
parents with minor children” (Pew Research Center, 2013, p. 14). This research shows
that libraries are a valuable asset in communities, and are appreciated by people,
including people of color. Ly’s (2010) research confirms that public libraries are
important to residents of low-income communities. Since libraries are an important

3
source for reading material and are an important and valued part of communities of color,
the local public library should be a place where multicultural children’s and young adult
books are available and accessible.
Diversity in the United States
The population of the United States is becoming increasingly diverse, which can
be seen from the changes in demographics between 1990 and 2010. The percentage of
whites in the U.S. population decreased from 80.3% in 1990 to 77.9% in 2010, while the
percentage of African Americans increased from 12.1% to 13.1%, and the percentage of
Hispanics increased from 9% to 16.9% in that same time period (U.S. Census Bureau,
1992a, 1992b, 2010). A more diverse population should mean that multicultural reading
material should be available and accessible to residents, as well.
Students of Color Score Lower than White Students on Reading Tests
The National Center for Education Statistics reports that African American and
Hispanic students consistently score significantly lower than white students on National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading assessments (Snyder & Dillow,
2012). In 2013, 46% of white students scored at or above proficient in fourth grade
NAEP reading assessments, while 18% of African American students and 20% of
Hispanic fourth-graders scored at or above proficient. The statistics for eighth grade
students are similar, with 46% of white students, 17% of African American students, and
22% of Hispanic students scoring at or above proficient in reading (National Center for
Education Statistics, 2013). In light of their lower overall reading scores, it is more
important than ever for students of color to read more, and public libraries serve an

4
important role in facilitating this by providing access to a wide variety of books that
young people will want to read, including books by and about people from the same
culture and ethnicity as the students.
Reading More Books for Enjoyment Is One Way to Improve Reading Ability
Research studies show that students who read more perform better in school, even
when poverty is a factor (Evans, Kelley, Sikora, & Treiman, 2010; Krashen, 2004, 2011),
and students who have access to books tend to read more (Ramos & Krashen, 1998).
Other studies indicate that students are more likely to find books that interest them in the
public library or elsewhere outside of school, than in school (Ivey & Broaddus, 2001;
Worthy, 1998; Worthy, Moorman, & Turner, 1999), and students prefer to select their
own reading material rather than read the books that are provided in school (Baker, 2002;
Davis, 2000). Book selection and reading response studies suggest that students prefer to
read about characters and topics that are personally meaningful to them and that relate to
their lives (Barry, 2013; Davis, 2000; Gray, 2009; Hinton & Berry, 2004; Sims, 1983).
Therefore, students of color who are low-performing readers should be encouraged to
read many books, including interesting books with protagonists that share their culture,
and these books should be available and accessible at the local public library.
The Value of Multicultural Books
Bishop (1990a) likened books to mirrors, windows, and sliding glass doors that
can provide readers with the opportunity to see themselves and their culture reflected in
the stories they read, as well as the opportunity to learn about people from other cultures
and people who have life experiences that are unfamiliar to the reader. Numerous other

5
writers also make the argument that children need to read and have access to
multicultural books that accurately reflect their own ethnic and cultural background (e.g.,
Al-Hazza & Bucher, 2008; Aoki, 1992; Banks, 2008; Bishop, 1990b; Golos & Moses,
2011; Harris, 1992, 1996; Kasten et al., 2005; McNair, 2011; Myers, C., 2014; Myers, W.
D., 2014; Naidoo, 2011; Nathenson-Mejía & Escamilla, 2003; Seale & Slapin, 2005), as
well as books about people from other cultures and ethnicities (e.g., Banks, 2008; Gay,
2000; Harris, 1996; Kasten et al., 2005; Rasinski & Padak, 1990; Rosenblatt, 1938/1995;
Yamate, 1997).
Multicultural Books Need to Be Available and Accessible in Public Libraries
The relatively few multicultural children’s and young adult books that have been
published are often not found in schools or bookstores, leading students of color who
want to read books about their own culture, and any student who wants to read about
other cultures, to seek such reading material elsewhere (Baker, 2002; Horning, 2010,
2014; Sims, 1983). Thus, multicultural youth literature needs to be available and
accessible in public libraries. Teachers who want to incorporate multicultural literature
into their classrooms often have to intentionally search for such books and purchase them
on their own or get them from public libraries when they are not available in school
libraries (Abellán-Pagnani & Hébert, 2013; Gray, 2009).
Public libraries are an important source of books for students, especially those
who do not have access to many books at home or in school. Librarians have long been
trailblazers in the effort to make sure that young people of color have access to high
quality multicultural children’s and young adult literature (Güereña & Erazo, 2000;

6
Horning, 2010; Núñez, 2009; Tolson, 1998). Librarians spearheaded efforts to establish
ethnic-specific literary awards to encourage the writing, publication, and distribution of
multicultural literature for young people (Smith, H. M., 2009; Treviño, 2006). Despite
the hard work of many librarians, it is sometimes difficult to find high quality, culturally
authentic multicultural children’s and young adult literature in public libraries (Adkins &
Hussey, 2006; Harris, 1996; Horning, 2014; Nathenson-Mejía & Escamilla, 2003).
Research is needed to determine the extent of the availability and accessibility of
multicultural youth literature in public libraries so that efforts can be made by librarians
and teachers to improve access and availability to multicultural books, where
improvement is needed (Garrison, 2012; Kurz, 2012).
Although there is considerable evidence of the benefits of strong public libraries
(e.g., Krashen, 2004, 2011; Krashen et al., 2012), and of multicultural children’s and
young adult literature (e.g., McNair, 2011; Nathenson-Mejía & Escamilla, 2003), studies
on the availability and accessibility of multicultural children’s and young adult literature
in public libraries in the United States are scarce. Two recent dissertations are evidence
of increased current scholarly concern about the availability of multicultural literature for
youth in public libraries (Garrison, 2012; Kurz, 2012). Both studies researched the youth
literature collections of public libraries for the presence of books that won ethnic-specific
youth literature awards and surveyed librarians about their book selection strategies.
Garrison (2012) researched libraries in an unnamed southeastern state for the presence of
books that won the Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature, the Coretta Scott King
Book Award, and the Pura Belpré Award, along with the Newbery and Caldecott

7
Awards. Kurz (2012) examined the youth literature collection of libraries in South
Carolina for the availability of books that won the Américas Book Award, the Carter G.
Woodson Book Award, the Coretta Scott King Book Award, the Pura Belpré Award, and
the Tomás Rivera Mexican American Children’s Book Award.
The purpose of this descriptive study was to investigate the availability and
accessibility of award-winning multicultural children’s and young adult literature in
public libraries in Northeast Ohio by analyzing the youth literature collections of selected
libraries in diverse and non-diverse communities for the presence of books that won
ethnic-specific literary awards.
Statement of the Problem
The availability and accessibility of multicultural youth literature in public
libraries is important because the United States is becoming increasingly diverse (U. S.
Census Bureau, 2010), and African American, American Indian, Asian Pacific American,
and Latino children are from cultural and ethnic groups that have historically been and
are currently underrepresented in children’s literature (Cooperative Children's Book
Center, 2014; Horning, 2014; Horning, Lindgren, & Schliesman, 2013; Larrick, 1965).
Children of color need to be able to see characters from their own culture and ethnicity in
the books they read, and they need to be able to find these books at the local public
library.
White children, teachers and librarians, and preservice teachers and librarians
need to be able to learn about and read about people of color, as well (e.g., Bishop,
1990a; Brindley & Laframboise, 2002; Gray, 2009; Howard, 1993; Macphee, 1997;

8
Overall, 2009). White teachers and preservice teachers need to learn about other cultures
because, as Brindley and Laframboise (2002) observe, “while there has been an
increasing emphasis on multicultural education, the vast majority of young adults
entering teacher education remain White, middle-class, female, and monolingual,” and
“are expected to teach at a time of ever increasing cultural diversity in American schools”
(p. 405). Learning about underrepresented cultures is also important for librarians. In a
call for cultural competence in the field of library and information science, Overall
(2009) states that librarians “need to fully understand cultural issues affecting minority
and underserved populations, and how cultural issues affect perceptions of libraries” (p.
176). Although the number of people of color in the United States is increasing, the
reality is that there are still many communities that have very little diversity. As a result,
some white children grow up without having much contact with people from other
cultures. Macphee (1997) argues that multicultural literature can be beneficial for white
children by providing them with “vicarious experiences of others’ sociocultural attitudes,
beliefs and experiences” (p. 33). Therefore, multicultural children’s and young adult
literature should be available in all public libraries—in diverse communities, as well as in
communities where there are few or no residents of color.
Although, as media reports have highlighted (Blair, 2013; Kirch, 2013; Mantle,
2013; “Why hasn't the number,” 2013), the number of multicultural children's and young
adult books published every year is below what it should be, there are some being
produced (Cooperative Children's Book Center, 2014). There is a need for multicultural
children’s and young adult literature, and these books should be available and accessible

9
in public libraries (Garrison, 2012; Horning, 2014; Kurz, 2012). This descriptive study
will analyze and describe the availability and accessibility of multicultural youth
literature in public libraries in Northeast Ohio.
Significance of the Study
There is a gap in the professional literature related to the availability and
accessibility of multicultural children’s and young adult literature in public libraries.
This study will add to the small body of current research that is attempting to address this
neglected area of scholarship. Garrison (2012) and Kurz (2012), two researchers who
have recently studied multicultural youth literature in public library collections, both
approach their research from the perspective of librarians and librarian educators who are
concerned with library collection development practices. This study is from the
perspective of a public library user—an instructor of children's literature who gives her
students, most of whom are preservice teachers, assignments to go to the public library in
search of multicultural children's literature and wonders if they will be able to find it
there, and who believes that children of color should be able to find books that reflect
their own culture in the local public library, and that white children and children of color
should be able to find books about other cultures and ethnicities in their local library, as
well.
This research produced a descriptive analysis of the presence or absence of
children’s and young adult literature that won ethnic-specific awards in public libraries in
diverse and non-diverse communities in selected counties in Northeast Ohio.
Multicultural youth literature is an important part of multicultural education, which is a

10
concern in teacher education programs (Banks, 2008). Children’s and young adult
literature courses in the fields of English, education, and library and information science
include multicultural literature as part of the course curriculum (Kiefer, 2010; Short,
Lynch-Brown, and Tomlinson, 2014). The results of this study will be of interest to other
professors of children’s literature in teacher education, library and information science
programs, children's literature specialists, practicing teachers and librarians, and also to
publishers of multicultural books for young people as content developers. An awareness
of whether or not multicultural children's and young adult books are available in public
libraries is critical information for professors to consider as they make instructional
decisions. It is imperative that preservice teachers and librarians learn about book
selection strategies and resources that can be used to find high quality, culturally
authentic multicultural children’s and young adult books, and knowing whether or not
multicultural books are available in the local public library is a vital part of that process.
Multicultural youth literature should be available and accessible to practicing teachers so
they can include such literature in their courses, even when it is not available in
classroom or school libraries or bookstores, and to children and teens, so they can read it
for enjoyment. Public libraries are a significant resource in this endeavor.
This research will also be of interest to library personnel by calling attention to
the need to include multicultural children’s and young adult literature in public library
collections in communities with diverse populations, as well as in communities that are
not diverse (Kurz, 2012). Garrison (2012) found that some of the librarians in her study
do not purchase multicultural literature for the library. Some of the reasons these

11
librarians gave are: multicultural literature does not circulate; there are not many people
of color in their community; or if people of color do live in the community, then they do
not use the library. It is important to keep in mind that multicultural literature is not only
for people of color. White children also need to be exposed to multicultural literature
(Howard, 1993; Macphee, 1997), and this literature should be available to them. It is also
important to consider that books cannot be checked out if they are not in the library's
collection, or if they are not accessible to patrons (Horning, 2014). Additionally, in
communities where there are at least some people of color, perhaps some members of
underrepresented groups may not feel welcome at the library, or may feel that there is
little of interest for them there, especially if there are few or no culturally relevant
materials available or visible (Adkins & Hussey, 2006; Horning, 2014).
In communities where people of color do not use the library very much, teachers
can play an important role in getting students and their families into the library (Ramos &
Krashen, 1998; Whitehead, 2004). Teachers who value multicultural youth literature and
use it in their classrooms, and who know that multicultural literature is available and
accessible in local public libraries, can introduce their students to such literature and to
the public library, and help their students to view the public library as a safe, welcoming
space (Ly, 2010) where they and their families can find interesting, enjoyable, relevant
reading materials, including multicultural literature. Teachers are often introduced to
multicultural youth literature in university children’s and young adult literature courses
when their professors give them assignments to find multicultural books at the local
public library. This study will join similar studies (Garrison, 2012; Kurz, 2012) to serve

12
as evidence that there is a definite need and demand for multicultural youth literature in
public libraries.
Research Question
The purpose of this descriptive study is to analyze and describe the availability
and accessibility of award-winning multicultural children’s literature in public libraries in
Northeast Ohio by answering the following question: To what extent are children’s and
young adult books that won ethnic-specific literary awards available and accessible in the
youth literature collections of selected public libraries in Northeast Ohio?
Definition of Terms
Availability: For the purpose of this study, a book title will be said to be available
if it is owned by a library in any print or non-print format and is able to be checked out by
library patrons. This will be determined by the presence or absence of the book in the
library Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC).
Children's and young adult literature: The term children's literature is generally
used to refer to literature for children from birth through early adolescence (Short et al.,
2014) and the term young adult literature is used to refer to literature from the
approximate ages of twelve through nineteen (Cart, 2010). The literary awards used for
this study include books for children as well as books that are intended for young adults.
This study is focused on the winners of certain ethnic-specific awards, so all books that
won the awards in this study will be included, whether they are intended for children or
for young adults.

13
Multicultural literature: The term multicultural literature has been the subject of
considerable controversy over the years (Cai, 2003). According to Cai and Bishop
(1994), multicultural literature had its roots in the multicultural education movement.
Harris and Willis (2003) note that “early notions of multiculturalism as ethnic study have
given way to versions of multiculturalism that include gender, class, sexual orientation,
ableism, age, religion, and geographical location” (p. 826). Kasten et al. (2005), state
that “‘multicultural literature’ does not mean a few authors of color, but rather authors
who write about different kinds of families, different economic circumstances, different
ethnicities, experiences, home settings, sexes, ages, interests, information, regions, and
lifestyles” (p. 32). Short et al. (2014) acknowledge that the term multicultural literature
has been defined in different ways by different authors. However, “most define it more
specifically as literature by and about groups that have been marginalized and
disregarded by the dominant European-American culture in the U.S. This definition
includes racial, ethnic, religious, and language minorities, those living with physical and
mental disabilities, gays and lesbians, and people living in poverty” (p. 218).
This study, like Garrison (2012) and Kurz (2012), analyzed the availability of
multicultural children's and young adult literature in public libraries by using winners of
ethnic-specific children's literature awards as the sample of multicultural books. Garrison
(2012) used the winner and honor books for the Coretta Scott King Book Award, the Pura
Belpré Award, and the Asian Pacific American Award for Literature. Kurz (2012) only
looked for African American and Latino books in library collections, and used the winner
and honor books for the Coretta Scott King Book Award, the Pura Belpré Award, the

14
Américas Award, the Tomás Rivera Mexican American Children’s Book Award, and the
Carter G. Woodson Book Award. The present study used winner and honor books for the
American Indian Youth Literature Award, the Américas Award, the Asian/Pacific
American Award for Literature, the Carter G. Woodson Book Award, the Coretta Scott
King Book Awards, the Pura Belpré Award, and the Tomás Rivera Mexican American
Children’s Book Award.
Public libraries in Northeast Ohio: This term is used to indicate public libraries
that are located in counties included in the Northeast Ohio Regional Library System
(State Library of Ohio, n.d.). The Institute of Museum and Library Services (2013) uses
the Federal-State Cooperative System definition for public libraries. According to that
definition, public libraries provide
an organized collection of printed or other library materials, or a combination
thereof; paid staff; an established schedule in which services of the staff are
available to the public; facilities necessary to support such a collection, staff, and
schedule, and support in whole or in part with public funds. A community may
have only one public library or a public library system, which may have a central
library and multiple branches or bookmobiles. (p. 3)
This study follows the Institute of Museum and Library Services (2013) practice
and uses the term public library to refer to “the administrative entity, either a singleoutlet library or a library system,” and the term outlet “to refer to central libraries, branch
libraries, and bookmobiles” (p. 3).

Summary
This descriptive study investigated the availability and accessibility of
multicultural children's and young adult literature as represented by winners and honor
books of the American Indian Youth Literature Award, the Américas Award, the
Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature, the Carter G. Woodson Book Award, the
Coretta Scott King Book Awards, the Pura Belpré Award, and the Tomás Rivera
Mexican American Children’s Book Award, in selected public libraries in Northeast Ohio
by searching the Online Public Access Catalogs (OPACs) of the selected libraries for the
presence of the award-winning books. This study also analyzed how the availability of
these books reflects the racial and ethnic composition of the community in which the
libraries are located.

CHAPTER II
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
The availability of multicultural children’s and young adult literature in public
libraries is an important subject of study for a number of reasons. Multicultural youth
literature should be available to children of color who need to see themselves and their
culture reflected in the books they read, and to white children and children of color who
need to learn about other cultures in this increasingly diverse society (Bishop, 1990a).
Children of color lag behind white children in national reading assessments (National
Center for Education Statistics, 2013; Snyder & Dillow, 2012). Reading is vital to
academic success, and public libraries are an important source for a wide variety of
reading material (Krashen, 2004, 2011). Teachers and preservice teachers need to learn
about multicultural youth literature and how to identify and locate such literature for use
in their classrooms (Brindley & Laframboise, 2002). Multicultural literature for children
and young adults should be available and accessible in public libraries (Garrison, 2012;
Kurz, 2012). Ethnic-specific children’s literature awards are one way to identify
multicultural youth literature (Garrison, 2012; Kiefer, 2010; Kurz, 2012; Short et al.,
2014), so books that win ethnic-specific youth literature awards should be available at
public libraries.
This literature review will begin with a discussion of the importance of reading
and the importance of public libraries followed by a discussion of multicultural children's
and young adult literature, and youth literature awards.

Reading and Public Libraries
Students of color often score lower than white students on national reading tests
(National Center for Education Statistics, 2013; Snyder & Dillow, 2012). Educators want
all students, including students of color, to be successful in school. Reading is vital to
academic success, and public libraries are an important source for a wide variety of
reading material (Krashen, 2004).
Students Who Read More Perform Better in School
Research studies show that students who read more and have access to books
perform better in school, even when poverty is a factor (Anderson, Wilson, & Fielding,
1988; Evans et al., 2010; Krashen, 2004, 2011, 2013; Krashen & Shin, 2004). Krashen
(2004) states that in general, students read more when books are available in the home.
Evans et al. (2010) reviewed data from over 70,000 cases in 27 nations, and found that
children who grew up in homes with at least 500 books stayed in school an average of
three years longer than children who grew up in homes with few or no books, regardless
of country, parent education level, and parent occupation. Of course, many children do
not grow up in homes with 500 books, but most children do have access to many books at
the public library (Pew Research Center, 2013). Ramos and Krashen (1998) studied
second and third grade Hispanic students at a school in Los Angeles, California. The
students had few books at home, if any, and their classroom and school libraries were
poorly stocked. Teachers were concerned about the lack of books available to the
children, so they arranged for the students to visit the local public library. After the
library visit, the researchers found that the children were excited about reading and began

18
to read more. Sixty-seven percent of the children asked their parents to take them back to
the library on their own.
Anderson et al. (1988) instructed 155 fifth-grade students to keep a record of the
time they spent on out-of-school activities. The researchers found that, in general,
children do not spend a lot of time reading when they are not in school. However,
“reading books was the out-of-school activity that proved to have the strongest
association with reading proficiency,” and “time spent reading books was the best
predictor of a child's growth as a reader from the second to the fifth grade” (p. 297).
Students Prefer to Read Books They Self-Select
If the goal is to get students to read more, it is essential to provide them with
books they will enjoy reading. Students prefer to select their own reading material
(Baker, 2002; Davis, 2000; Ivey & Broaddus, 2001; Parker, 2008; Worthy & McKool,
1996). Parker (2008) found that when students recommend books to other students, they
are more likely to suggest books that they self-select outside of school than books that are
required reading in school. Worthy and McKool (1996) studied students who say they
hate to read, although the students reported enjoying some books in the past. The type of
books the students preferred reading, such as scary stories, comic books, and magazines,
were not available in school, and their teachers provided the students with very little
opportunity to read self-selected materials in school.
Although some researchers find that students read more when they have books
available at home (Krashen, 2004), that is not always the case, especially when the
children have no choice about which books are brought into the home. Some of the

19
students in Worthy and McKool’s (1996) study reported that they own books that were
given to them as gifts, but the students admitted that they do not read the books at home
because they are not interested in them.
Public Libraries Provide Access to Books
The studies cited above establish that reading is vital for students to succeed in
school, but, as Krashen (2013) says, “the necessary condition for encouraging reading is
access to reading material” (p. 21). Public libraries provide vital services to communities
(Ly, 2010; Pew Research Center, 2013), and are a significant source of reading material
for students, especially students who do not have access to many books at home or in
school (Krashen, 1995, 2004, 2011, 2013; Krashen et al., 2012; Krashen & Shin, 2004;
Ramos & Krashen, 1998; Whitehead, 2004; Worthy et al., 1999). Studies show that
students are more likely to find books that interest them in the public library or elsewhere
outside of school, than in school (Ivey & Broaddus, 2001; Worthy, 1998; Worthy &
McKool, 1996; Worthy et al., 1999). In the Worthy and McKool (1996) study on
children who say they hate to read, students who do not use the library were more likely
to be disinterested in reading. None of the students who said they hated to read had been
to a public library in the previous year, and some had never visited a public library in
their lives.
Multicultural Books Should Be Available in Public Libraries
Public libraries should serve as a significant source for multicultural children’s,
young adult, and adult literature in the community. Multicultural literature for youth may
be difficult to find in bookstores. According to Horning (2010), publishers say they

20
“have trouble pushing a book with a multicultural theme past their marketing department
because marketing claims the mega-bookstores won’t stock the books. And yet we all
know the demand is there” (Horning, 2010, p. 14). The fact that bookstores are unlikely
to stock many multicultural children’s and young adult books is another reason for public
libraries to help create a market for such books by making sure that these books are
available and accessible to patrons (Horning, 2014).
Multicultural Children's and Young Adult Literature
Multicultural Literature and Multicultural Education
Multicultural youth literature has roots in the field of multicultural education, and
the importance of including multicultural literature in the classroom and in public
libraries is related to multicultural education concepts (Cai, 2008; Cai & Bishop, 1994;
Macphee, 1997; Short & Fox, 2003). Banks (2008), a leader in the field of multicultural
education, describes multicultural education as “a reform movement designed to make
some changes in the education of students” because some current educational practices
“are harmful to students and reinforce many of the stereotypes and discriminatory
practices in Western societies” (p. 1). Banks further explains
Multicultural education assumes that race, ethnicity, culture, religion, and social
class are salient parts of the United States and other Western nations. It also
assumes that diversity enriches a nation and increases the ways in which its
citizens can perceive and solve personal and public problems. Diversity also
enriches a nation by providing all citizens with rich opportunities to experience
other cultures and thus to become more fulfilled as human beings. When

21
individuals are able to participate in a variety of cultures, they are more able to
benefit from the total human experience (p. 1).
Banks (2008) acknowledges that the concept of multicultural education is
controversial, but notes that some opponents have misconceptions about it. One of those
misconceptions is that multicultural education is only for people who can be classified as
other in some way, and that it is “an entitlement program and curriculum movement for
African Americans, Latinos, the poor, women, and other marginalized groups” (p. 8).
This misconception is problematic, Banks argues, because it leads educators at
predominately white schools to think that they do not need to include multicultural
education in their curriculum because they do not have many students of color in their
schools. This view has a negative effect on white children. Banks (2008) says, “By
teaching mainstream students only about their own cultures, the school is denying them
the richness of the music, literature, values, lifestyles, and perspectives” of other cultural
and ethnic groups (p. 2).
Banks (2008) describes five dimensions of multicultural education: content
integration, the knowledge construction process, prejudice reduction, equity pedagogy,
and an empowering school culture and social structure. Teachers and teacher educators
may use multicultural children’s and young adult literature in their classrooms to support
some of these dimensions of multicultural education. Content integration is the aspect of
multicultural education that “deals with the extent to which teachers use examples, data,
and information from a variety of cultures and groups to illustrate the key concepts,
principles, generalizations, and theories in their subject area or discipline” (p. 31). The

22
knowledge construction process looks at the ways knowledge is created and “how the
implicit cultural assumptions, frames of reference, perspectives, and biases within a
discipline influence the ways that knowledge is constructed within it” (p. 31). The
prejudice reduction dimension of multicultural education examines students’ attitudes
about race and develops “strategies that can be used to help students to develop more
positive racial and ethnic attitudes” (p. 34). Teachers who practice equity pedagogy “use
techniques and teaching methods that facilitate the academic achievement of students
from diverse racial, ethnic, and social-class groups” (p. 34). An empowering school
culture and social structure involves “restructuring the culture and organization of the
school so that students from diverse racial, ethnic, language, and social-class groups will
experience educational equality and empowerment” (p. 34).
Many schools of education and teacher educators want to make sure that
preservice teachers learn about multicultural education concepts (e.g., Arias & Poynor,
2001; Willis & Harris, 1997), and some include multicultural children’s literature in their
courses for that purpose (Brindley & Laframboise, 2002; Cai, 2008; Escamilla &
Nathenson-Mejía, 2003; McNair, 2003). As a result of exposure to multicultural
education concepts and multicultural children’s and young adult literature in their
university courses, some teachers and preservice teachers are determined to use
multicultural literature in their classes (Brindley & Laframboise, 2002; Gray, 2009;
Harris, 2012; Macphee, 1997). One preservice teacher said, “I am deeply passionate
about bringing an abundance of multicultural literature into my classroom” (Brindley &
Laframboise, 2002, p. 415). A graduate course in children’s literature prompted Gray

23
(2009) to evaluate her classroom library to see if the books reflected the culture and
ethnicity of the African American students in her classroom. When she realized that
there were not enough books about African Americans available to her students in school,
Gray took steps to create a more inclusive classroom library by learning more about
African American literature and adding more culturally relevant books.
Children of Color and Multicultural Literature
Although it is widely suggested that teachers and librarians recommend to
students books that reflect the students’ own culture (e.g., Al-Hazza & Bucher, 2010;
Bishop, 1982, 1990a; Escamilla & Nathenson-Mejía, 2003; Gay, 2000; Harris, 1992,
1996; Kasten et al., 2005; Larrick, 1965; Nathenson-Mejía & Escamilla, 2003), some
book selection researchers suggest that ethnicity does not matter when students choose
books to read (Holmes, Powell, Holmes & Witt, 2007; Mohr, 2006; Williams, 2008). For
example, when discussing the results of their research, Holmes et al. (2007) report that
“the evidence appears to converge on the idea that race is immaterial to inducing children
to select one book over another” (p. 280). However, many factors contribute to decisions
children make about which books to select when they are participants in book selection
research studies, including research design, the quantity and quality of books from which
they are asked to choose, the reading sophistication level of the child, the child's interest
in reading as a worthwhile activity, and other factors.
One example can be seen in Barry’s (2013) recent study of the reading
preferences of a group of 148 racially heterogeneous eighth grade students (45%
Caucasian, 17% Hispanic, 9% African American, 26% multi-racial, 2% Native

24
American, and 1% Asian American), many of whom were reluctant readers. Barry found
that the students “wanted some kind of connection with the character,” but did not
specifically seem to want or need a racial or ethnic connection (p. 360). In response to
the statement “I would read more often if I had books about teens who were the same
race as I am,” 71% of the males in the study and 62% of the females responded by
indicating “My reading would not change” (p. 360). Barry reports the responses to this
question by the gender of the students, not by ethnicity. One explanation for the apparent
lack of interest in culturally specific literature expressed by these students could be the
large number of Caucasian and mixed-race students in the study. Barry notes that the
teacher of the students remarked that the children “seem to be less aware of race,
especially because so many of the kids are of mixed ethnicity at our school rather than
Black or White” (p. 359). The teacher further explains that the some of the students did
not understand the terms ethnicity and Caucasian, which could have had an effect on the
way the students answered questions related to race.
It is also possible that students so rarely see people of color in books that it does
not occur to them that culturally relevant books are an option. Aoki (1992) explains
When questioned about the importance of Asian Pacific American literature,
young Asian Pacific American students usually reply that it's nice to have the
book, but don't question the lack of such Asian Pacific American books because
they think “that's the way things are. We do what the teachers tell us. Teachers
just give us books about non-Asian Pacific Americans” (p. 112).

25
Or, as one of the African American students in Hefflin's (2003) study stated, “I mostly
always see White people and animals in books” (p. 176). Sims (1983) notes that when
culturally relevant books are unavailable, children of color “may be denied access to just
those books that could provide important self-affirmation and possibly create lifetime
reading habits” (p. 25).
While some reader response studies, such as Holmes et al. (2007), seem to
suggest that students do not care about culture or ethnicity in their reading material, other
studies provide evidence that children of color want to read, and benefit from reading,
culturally accurate books with protagonists that reflect their own culture (e.g., Adkins &
Hussey, 2006; Brooks, Browne, & Hampton, 2008; Hefflin, 2003; Parker, 2008; Sims,
1983; Smith, 1995; Spears-Bunton, 1990).
When the previously mentioned study by Barry (2013) included the ethnicity of
students in a discussion of the findings, 67% of the Hispanic females and 88% of the
African American females wanted more ethnic-specific reading material. An African
American respondent noted that it was “harder to find [stories] about people of my race”
(p. 360). One of the Hispanic students asked, “Why can't they ever have books relating
to me?” (p. 360). Another student “said that not seeing herself in the novels ‘makes me
feel like an outcast’” (p. 360). This statement supports the observation by Kasten et al.
(2005) that students who do not see themselves in books feel alone.
The children in Hefflin's (2003) study expressed dismay that their teachers only
give them the opportunity to read African American literature during February for Black

26
History month. The students wanted more than that. One of the students, referring to the
African American books that Hefflin used in the study, said
These are the people that I used to learn about in February—that’s Black History
month. . . . but mostly we don't talk about those people any more. In these books
[all six of them] we can still see them [Black people] and learn what it was like in
Africa long ago and the African people (p. 176).
The children expressed that reading African American books made them feel joyful to
such an extent that they enthusiastically shared the stories with their friends and family
(Hefflin, 2003). It is significant that students get so excited about reading culturally
relevant books that they want to share the books with their family members and friends,
some of whom may not have previously been readers (Flake, 2008; Parker, 2008; Sims,
1983).
Reading culturally relevant books can have a positive impact on the lives of
young people of color. An example of this can be found in Parker (2008). The African
American and Caribbean American young men in Parker’s study were entering their
senior year in high school. Parker had been their teacher when the students were in the
ninth and tenth grades, and describes one young man, Antoine, as “an aliterate reader,”
who chose not to read (p. 121). However, Antoine’s apathy toward reading ended when
Parker gave him the book Tears of a Tiger by Sharon Draper. Antoine read the whole
book overnight, and came to school the next day wanting to discuss it. He shared the
book with his friends. “From that point,” Parker says, “Antoine changed his attitude
toward reading.” Antoine began completing his reading assignments, checked books out

27
of the classroom library, and even “wrote his college application essay about being given
Tears of a Tiger and my relentlessness to have him read it as finally motivating him
enough to try, and eventually become a competent reader” (p. 121).
Sharon Flake (2008), author of realistic culturally authentic novels for young
adults, describes the enthusiasm of African American boys she meets during school
visits. Flake says that teachers tell her that some of the students “develop such a zeal for
reading that it captures the attention of their parents, grandparents, and siblings,” and
encourages those family members to read the books themselves. Flake explains, “One
reason I believe these boys gobble up such books is because finally someone is telling
their story, or that of people who look like them and live where they live.” She
continues, “Black boys will read. But to get them off to a flying start, we've got to give
them books that remind them of home—of who they are. When this happens, they fly
through books—even the most challenged readers” (p. 14).
The examples of the students in Parker's (2008) study and Flake's (2008)
experiences highlight the fact that young people often need adults to connect them to
culturally relevant books that are of interest to them. Parker put a lot of thought into the
books she selected to use with the young men in her study, and the boys who showed
such enthusiasm for Flake's books were introduced to those books by their teachers.
These experiences illustrate how important it is for preservice and inservice
teachers and librarians to become familiar with multicultural children's and young adult
literature and with the culture of their students so that they can recommend books that
will interest their students (Abellán-Pagnani & Hébert, 2013; Arias & Poynor, 2001;

28
Barry, 1998; Gray, 2009; Nathenson-Mejía & Escamilla, 2003; Overall, 2009; Parker,
2008). There are examples in the scholarly literature of teachers doing this. AbellánPagnani and Hébert (2013) describe a teacher who saw a need to connect with her
Spanish-speaking students who were recent immigrants. This teacher asked for advice on
how to select and use Hispanic American children's literature with her students, and acted
on that advice, to the benefit of her students. As previously mentioned, Gray (2009)
realized that her African American students did not have many culturally relevant books
available to them at school, so she educated herself about African American children's
literature, and purchased approximately one hundred African American books to add to
her classroom library.
Unfortunately, some teachers make multicultural books available to their students
only at certain times of the year, such as Black History Month (Gray, 2009; Hefflin,
2003). Gray (2009) examined the books available in classrooms at one school and found
very few African American books. In some instances, African American books were
present in the classroom but were unavailable for use by the students, as they were
packed away and labeled for February.
Learning About Other Cultures through Multicultural Literature
Readers also want to learn about people who are different from them. Some
students enjoy reading about people who are of the same ethnicity, but who have
different life experiences. For example, an African American girl from a Northern city
remarked, “I like reading stories about [Black] kids whose lives are different from mine.
I like . . . to learn about their lives. That’s why I like stories about when people were in

29
the South and stuff” (Sims, 1983, p. 24). Other students express interest in reading about
people of different ethnicities and cultures. Adkins & Hussey (2006) asked Latino
college students about their experiences with public libraries when they were young. One
respondent stated that it would be “ideal” for libraries to have “books about every culture
so that you don't just learn about your own culture but you could go get a book and learn
about somebody else's culture. But I haven't, you know, seen that” (p. 456).
Students learn about other cultures when their teachers incorporate multicultural
literature into classroom lessons. Macphee (1997) is a white teacher who describes how
she uses Rosenblatt’s (1938/1995) transactional theory of reading along with Banks’s
(2008) transformational theory of multicultural education to broaden her white upper
middle class elementary school students’ awareness of other cultures. Macphee (1997)
states, “My plan was to use literature to encourage discourse among my students
regarding social issues to see what their attitudes were toward minorities in both
historical and current situations” (p. 34). Macphee further states that she hopes that
“multicultural literature will be used as a catalyst to encourage student dialogue about
important social issues, making others' voices as loud and vital” as the students in her
study who spoke out against the discrimination experienced by the characters in the
multicultural books they read in class (p. 39).
Availability and Accessibility of Multicultural Youth Literature
Students and teachers and parents need to have access to books about people from
all walks of life. Parents of children of color search for culturally relevant books for their
children (Sims, 1983; Willett, 1995). When discussing the reading habits of the ten-year

30
old girl who is the subject of her study, Sims (1983) says, “One of the most obvious and
yet possibly overlooked factors in determining Osula’s and other Black children’s choice
of reading matter about Afro-Americans may be the availability of such books” (p. 23).
Librarians and teachers play an important role in connecting children with multicultural
books in the classroom and in the public library and in making those books available to
students (Agosto, 2001; Horning, 2010, 2014; Naidoo, 2012; Naidoo & Vargas, 2011;
Nathenson-Mejía & Escamilla, 2003). As Adkins and Hussey (2006) explain, “librarians
select what is included in the collection, which in turn influences what patrons are able to
access and use” (p. 459). This is also true of teachers, who select what books are used in
their classroom. Studies show that teachers, librarians, and other adults have a powerful
influence in encouraging children to read by connecting them with interesting reading
material (Anderson et al., 1988; Gray, 2009; Ivey & Broaddus, 2001; Parker, 2008).
The study by Anderson et al. (1988) that examined the out-of-school activities of
children found that teachers have an important influence on the amount of time students
spend reading outside of school, perhaps by making sure that students have access to
interesting books, and by encouraging students to read. In the study, the class that spent
the most out-of-school time reading, read over three times as much as the class that spent
the least amount of out-of-school time reading. The authors state that teachers can
influence out-of-school reading by encouraging students to read, providing them with
access to interesting books, reading aloud during school, and providing time for
independent reading during school.

31
Controversies Concerning Multicultural Youth Literature
Harris (1996) outlined problems and controversies in the field of multicultural
children’s and young adult literature. Authors of color have had to struggle with trying to
convince teachers and librarians that their books are not just for children of color, but can
be appreciated by everyone, including whites (Harris, 1996). Garrison (2012) reports that
some of the librarians in her study admit that they do not purchase certain multicultural
books for their libraries because there are no residents of that cultural group in their
community, or if there are, they do not come into the library. Additionally, studies
suggest that teachers, either consciously or unconsciously, may not be inclined to use
culturally authentic multicultural books (Jipson & Paley, 1991; Wollman-Bonilla, 1998).
Another concern in the field of multicultural youth literature is that of cultural
authenticity (Fox & Short, 2003; Harris, 1996; Mikkelsen, 1998). For many years, books
about people of color were written by authors from outside the cultural group represented
in the books, and were often insensitive, inaccurate, or contained stereotypes and subtle
or overt racism (Cai, 1994; Harris, 1990, Nilsson, 2005; Seale & Slapin, 2005), or were
in other ways “distorting or misrepresenting some aspects of the culture reflected in their
books” (Bishop, 1992, p. 41). Children from cultural groups that were insensitively or
inaccurately depicted have felt devalued and have been ostracized by other children
because of negative depictions in books read in school (Seale & Slapin, 2005).
Books that contain negative stereotypes and cultural inaccuracies include some
that are considered classics, have won prestigious awards, and are highly regarded by
many people (Bishop, 2012; Harris, 1990; McNair, 2003; Mikkelsen, 1998; Sutherland,

32
1997). Children’s literature professors have reported that students may express resistance
when informed that their favorite books from childhood are culturally insensitive,
inauthentic, or racist (McNair, 2003). Wollman-Bonilla (1998) found that teachers and
children’s literature students may reject books that accurately and realistically portray
issues such as race, class, and gender inequities because these topics make them feel
uncomfortable.
According to authors such as Aronson (1995, 2011) and Lasky (2003), identitybased ethnic-specific literary awards may infringe upon authors’ right to write whatever
they want about whomever they want. Other authors counter that these arguments ignore
the history and power structure surrounding the publishing industry (Pinkney, 2001).
Bishop (2003) states
The framing of the issue has sometimes been reduced to absurd arguments about
whether skin color or an author’s ethnicity is the determinant of authenticity. In
fact, much of the authenticity debate seems to be oversimplified, ignoring or
downplaying both history and the complexities of the ways race, power, and
privilege operate in this society and in the field of children’s literature (p. 29).
Bishop (1992) says about books written by cultural outsiders, “Many such books
have merit and have been recognized for their positive contributions and artistic
achievement. Other books have received mixed reviews; that is, even though their
literary quality may be high, they have been found to contain both major and minor
flaws,” or may distort or misrepresent the culture portrayed in the books (p. 41). Since
there is wide variety in the quality and cultural authenticity of books about people of

33
color, teachers and librarians do well to become informed about cultural and ethnic
groups and about multicultural youth literature (Abellán-Pagnani & Hébert, 2013;
Bishop, 1992; Gray, 2009, Hefflin & Barksdale-Ladd, 2001; Overall, 2009; Wilfong,
2007).
Youth Literature Awards
Youth literature awards are one way for teachers, librarians, and the general
public to find high quality literature for children and young adults (Kiefer, 2010; Short et
al., 2014; Yokota, 2011). There are hundreds of awards for literature for young people,
so teachers and librarians who want to use literary awards as book selection tools could
benefit from learning what each award honors, which organization sponsors the award,
and the criteria used for selecting the award.
Ethnic-Specific Youth Literature Awards
Ethnic-specific youth literature awards can be used to find high quality
multicultural books for children and young adults (Barry, 1998, 2013; Gangi, 2008; Gray,
2009; Harris, 2012; Horning, 2010; Kasten et al., 2005; Kiefer, 2010; Naidoo, 2012;
Pinkney, 2001; Short et al., 2014; Williams & Bauer, 2006; Yokota, 2009). Some
examples of ethnic-specific youth literature awards are the awards that were included in
this study: the American Indian Youth Literature Award, the Américas Award, the
Asian/Pacific American Youth Literature Award, the Carter G. Woodson Book Award,
the Coretta Scott King Book Awards, the Pura Belpré Award, and the Tomás Rivera
Mexican American Children’s Book Award. This section will briefly describe these
awards.

34
Coretta Scott King Book Awards
The oldest ethnic-specific youth literature award in the United States is the
Coretta Scott King Book Award (Yokota, 2011). Librarians Glyndon Flynt Greer and
Mabel McKissick and publisher John Carroll came up with the idea for the award in 1969
as a result of a discussion about the fact that the prestigious Newbery and Caldecott
awards had never been awarded to an African American (Smith, 2009). Although Arna
Bontemps was the first African American to win a Newbery Honor in 1949 for the book
The Story of the Negro, it was not until 1975 that Virginia Hamilton became the first
African American to win a Newbery Medal for her book M. C. Higgins, the Great
(American Library Association, 1999b). In 1976, Leo Dillon became the first African
American to win the Caldecott Medal for author Verna Aardema’s book Why Mosquitoes
Buzz in People’s Ears, which Dillon co-illustrated with his wife Diane (American Library
Association, 1999a). The first Coretta Scott King Award was issued in 1970. An
illustrator category was added in 1974, and the John Steptoe Award for New Talent was
added in 1995 “to recognize exceptional work from new African American authors and
illustrators” (American Library Association, 2009a).
Pura Belpré Award
The Pura Belpré Award was created by two children’s librarians, Oralia Garza de
Cortés and Sandra Rios Balderrama, and was first awarded in 1996 (Balderrama, 2006).
The Pura Belpré Award
is presented annually to a Latino/Latina writer and illustrator whose work best
portrays, affirms, and celebrates the Latino cultural experience in an outstanding

35
work of literature for children and youth. It is co-sponsored by the Association of
Library Service to Children (ALSC), a division of the American Library
Association (ALA), and REFORMA, the National Association to Promote
Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish-Speaking, an ALA
affiliate. (American Library Association, 2014b).
American Indian Youth Literature Award
The American Indian Youth Literature Award is sponsored by the American
Indian Library Association, an affiliate of the American Library Association. The award,
which was first presented in 2006 and has been issued every two years since then, was
"established as a way to identify and honor the very best writing and illustrations by and
about American Indians. Books selected to receive the award will present American
Indians in the fullness of their humanity in the present and past contexts" (American
Indian Library Association, 2009).
Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature
The Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature is sponsored by the
Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association, an affiliate of the American Library
Association. The purpose of this award is "to honor and recognize individual works
related to Asian/Pacific American experiences (either historical or contemporary) or
Asian/Pacific American cultures" (Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association, 2011).
The first award was given in 2003, the next award was in 2006, and every year since
then. There are five categories of awards: adult fiction; adult nonfiction; children’s
literature; young adult literature; and picture books. (Asian Pacific American Librarians

36
Association, 2011). Books that won this award in the adult literature categories are not
included in this study.
Américas Book Award
The Américas Book Award is sponsored by the Consortium of Latin American
Studies Programs, which founded the award in 1993 “to encourage and commend
authors, illustrators, and publishers who produce quality children’s and young adult
books that portray Latin America, the Caribbean, or Latinos in the United States, and to
provide teachers with recommendations for classroom use” (Consortium of Latin
American Studies Programs, n.d.).
Carter G. Woodson Book Award
The Carter G. Woodson Book Award is sponsored by the National Council for the
Social Studies, the national professional organization for social studies educators. The
award was founded in 1974 “for the most distinguished social science books appropriate
for young readers that depict ethnicity in the United States. The purpose of this award is
to encourage the writing, publishing, and dissemination of outstanding social science
books for young readers that treat topics related to ethnic minorities and relations
sensitively and accurately” (National Council for the Social Studies, n.d.).
Tomás Rivera Mexican American Children’s Book Award
The Tomás Rivera Mexican American Children’s Book Award is sponsored by
the Texas State University College of Education. The award was created in 1995 “to
honor authors and illustrators who create literature that depicts the Mexican American
experience” (Texas State University College of Education, n.d.).

37
Research on Multicultural Youth Literature in Public Libraries
Two recent dissertations examined the youth literature collections of public
libraries for the presence of award-winning multicultural children’s and young adult
literature (Garrison, 2012; Kurz, 2012). The purpose of Garrison’s (2012) research was
“to identify factors influencing collection development and the selection of multicultural
children’s literature titles in public library collections in geographically and
demographically diverse communities across one southeastern state” (p. 9). Garrison
examined the collections of ten library systems and their branches to find out if the
presence of the Coretta Scott King Award and the Pura Belpré Award would predict the
presence of the Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature in the library collections.
She also sought to find out if racial and ethnic demographics of the community would
“predict the presence of their corresponding ethnic specific award” in the library
collections (p. 10). Garrison also interviewed acquisitions librarians to find out “what
factors influence the selection of multicultural children’s literature” (p. 10).
Kurz (2012) states that the purpose of her study was to “explore the ways in
which multicultural books for African American and Latino youth are collected in South
Carolina’s public libraries” (p. 7). Kurz accomplished her goal by performing a
“collection analysis to determine the representation of certain multicultural books for
youth within South Carolina’s public library collection” (p. 8). Kurz collected data on
all of the libraries in the state of South Carolina. Kurz also conducted a case study on
four exemplary library systems in her study in order to offer public librarians examples of
best practices in collection development of multicultural youth literature.

38
Summary
Multicultural children’s literature should be available in public libraries for a
number of reasons. The percentage of people of color in the United States is continually
increasing (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). African American and Latino students do not
perform as well as white students on national reading assessments (Snyder & Dillow,
2012). This section discussed research that indicates that children who read more do
better in school, and public libraries are an important resource for a wide variety of
reading material (e.g., Krashen, 2004). Children of color need to read books about their
own culture, and children of color and white children need to read about people from
other cultures (e.g., Banks, 2008; Bishop, 1990a). This section also discussed
multicultural literature for children and young adults, youth literature awards,
controversies surrounding multicultural youth literature, and briefly discussed two recent
studies on award-winning multicultural youth literature in public libraries.

CHAPTER III
METHODOLOGY
This descriptive study fills a gap in the current professional literature on the
availability and accessibility of multicultural children’s and young adult literature in
public libraries, and expands on recent research by Garrison (2012) and Kurz (2012).
Garrison (2012) examined the youth literature collections of ten public library systems in
an unnamed southeastern state for books that won the Coretta Scott King Book Award,
the Pura Belpré Award, and the Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature. Kurz
(2012) examined the collections of all forty-two public library systems in South Carolina
for African American and Latino books that won the Coretta Scott King Book Award, the
Pura Belpré Award, the Américas Award, the Tomás Rivera Mexican American
Children’s Book Award, and the Carter G. Woodson Book Award.
This study differs from Garrison (2012) and Kurz (2012) in that Garrison and
Kurz are both librarian educators, and one of the primary purposes for their research was
to find out about library collection development of multicultural books. Garrison
accomplished this goal by conducting interviews with acquisitions librarians. Kurz did
extensive case study research on the collection development practices of libraries that
were positive examples of cultural diversity in their youth literature collections. The
present study is from the perspective of an instructor of children’s literature whose
students are mostly preservice teachers. The primary purpose of this study is to explore,
analyze and describe the availability and accessibility of children’s and young adult
books that won ethnic-specific literary awards in the youth literature collections of
39

40
selected public libraries in Northeast Ohio. Knowing whether or not, and the extent to
which, ethnic-specific award-winning youth literature is present in public libraries is
important for instructors of children’s literature who want to design instruction in a way
that encourages their students, especially preservice teachers, to learn about multicultural
youth literature, and to use the public library to find such literature. When the preservice
teachers become classroom teachers, they can then use multicultural literature with their
own students of all cultures and ethnicities so that their students can find enjoyment in
reading about the students’ own culture, and learn about other cultures as well.
Classroom teachers will also be able to encourage their students to use the public library
to find multicultural literature.
An awareness of the presence or absence of multicultural youth literature in
public libraries in Northeast Ohio will also be useful to remind librarians and librarian
educators of the importance of intentionally including multicultural children’s and young
adult literature in their collections in diverse communities, as well as in communities that
are not diverse (Garrison, 2012; Kurz, 2012). All children can benefit from reading about
people from other cultures and ethnicities, and the public library is an important resource
for finding such literature.
Background
Creswell (2009) recommends that researchers identify and make explicit the
worldview that shapes the research study. The researcher approached this study with a
pragmatic worldview. Creswell explains that pragmatism is a worldview that “arises out
of actions, situations, and consequences,” and is concerned with practical solutions to real

41
problems (p. 10). Creswell further states, “instead of focusing on methods, researchers
emphasize the research problem and use all approaches available to understand the
problem” (p. 10). Teddlie and Tashakkori (2009) similarly state that the research
question is of primary importance to researchers with a pragmatic worldview, and such
researchers select the research methods that will best enable them to accomplish the goal
of their research.
The topic for this dissertation gradually evolved from the researcher’s personal
experiences as an instructor of children’s literature at a university in Northeast Ohio. In
the process of exploring culturally authentic multicultural children's literature, the
researcher sought out and purchased many beautifully written and illustrated
multicultural children's books from a wide variety of cultural, ethnic, and diverse
perspectives. Although the researcher acknowledges that there are not as many culturally
authentic multicultural books for children and young adults as there should be, these
books do exist, and they should be available in public libraries.
The researcher agrees with the multicultural education perspective that all
children—children of color and white children—need to learn about and encounter books
written by and about people of their own culture and other cultures in school (Banks,
2008; Kasten et al., 2005). Therefore, it is important for practicing and preservice
teachers and librarians to learn about multicultural books for children and young adults so
they will be able to share such literature with their students in diverse schools, and in
schools and communities where there is little or no diversity (Banks, 2008; Bishop,
1990a; Gay, 2000; Harris, 1992; Kasten et al., 2005; Overall, 2009).

42
Additionally, Krashen's (2004, 2011) reviews of reading research present
convincing evidence that, in general, reading more is one factor that can help improve
students' performance in school. This is important for students of color since they often
score lower than white students on national reading assessments (Snyder & Dillow,
2012). As mentioned earlier, research shows that students are likely to read more when
they are interested in what they are reading (Baker, 2002; Kasten et al. 2005; Parker,
2008; Worthy et al., 1999); books that students are interested in reading are often not
found in school (e.g., Baker, 2002; Parker, 2008; Sims, 1983; Worthy et al., 1999); and
many students of color want to read books about people who share their culture (e.g.,
Adkins & Hussey, 2006; Parker, 2008; Sims, 1983). Research also shows that
multicultural books are often not found in schools (Baker, 2002; Gray, 2009; Sims,
1983).
For these reasons, the researcher introduces the preservice teachers and other
students in her children's literature classes to a wide variety of multicultural children's
books, and to book selection resources that can be used to help them identify
multicultural children's and young adult literature titles. Using ethnic-specific children’s
literature awards is one strategy that can be used to find multicultural literature for youth
(e.g., Barry, 1998, 2013; Gray, 2009; Harris, 2012; Kasten et al. 2005; Kiefer, 2010;
Naidoo, 2012; Short et al., 2014; Yokota, 2009), so the researcher gives her students
assignments that require them to use these awards to find and read multicultural
children's books. Some of the students have reported that they have difficulty finding the
books in their local public libraries. Other children’s literature instructors (Harris, 1996)

43
have reported the same problem, which prompted the researcher to ask: Are multicultural
children's books available in public libraries in Northeast Ohio?
The researcher believes that multicultural children’s and young adult literature is
important, and children of color should be able to find culturally authentic books about
their own culture in their local public library, and all children—children of color and
white children—should be able to find culturally authentic books about other cultures at
the library. Therefore, multicultural books should be available and accessible in all
public libraries, in diverse communities, as well as in communities where there is little or
no diversity.
This study sought to explore, analyze, and describe the availability and
accessibility of multicultural youth literature in public libraries in Northeast Ohio, and
expanded on related research by Garrison (2012) and Kurz (2012). In her
recommendations for future research, Garrison (2012) called for studies to examine the
availability of multicultural books “in other formats including electronic books, audio
books, and multilingual titles” (p. 114). The present study collected information on the
availability of multicultural books in print and non-print formats. Kurz (2012) called for
other researchers to analyze public library youth literature collections for multicultural
children’s and young adult literature. The present study provides evidence of the extent
to which ethnic-specific award-winning multicultural children’s and young adult
literature is available and accessible in public libraries in Northeast Ohio.
Restatement of the Question

44
The purpose of this descriptive study is to analyze and describe the availability
and accessibility of award-winning multicultural children’s literature in public libraries in
Northeast Ohio by answering the following question: To what extent are children’s and
young adult books that won ethnic-specific literary awards available and accessible in the
youth literature collections of selected public libraries in Northeast Ohio?
As mentioned in the terms section of this document, the term public library is
used to refer to “the administrative entity, either a single-outlet library or a library
system,” and the term outlet is used “to refer to central libraries, branch libraries, and
bookmobiles” (Institute of Museum and Library Services, 2013, p. 3), or the physical
location where patrons go to get books.
Procedures
The research question is: To what extent are children’s and young adult books
that won ethnic-specific literary awards available and accessible in the youth literature
collections of selected public libraries in Northeast Ohio?
The researcher followed the following procedures to address that question:
1. Create the list of books to be used in the study
2. Create the list of public libraries and library outlets to include in the study
a. Make a list of Northeast Ohio counties to include in the study
b. Compile a list of public libraries and library outlets within the counties to
be included in the study
c. Gather ethnic demographic data from the United States Census Bureau for
the zip code of each library outlet that will be included in the study

45
3. Check the availability of the books in the libraries and library outlets using the
Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) for each library in the study
4. Analyze the data
Books Used in the Study
The researcher began the study by compiling a list of all of the books that are
winner and honor books during particular years as described below for the ethnic-specific
awards that were used in the study:


American Indian Youth Literature Award



Américas Award for Children’s and Young Adult Literature



Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature



Carter G. Woodson Book Award



Coretta Scott King Book Awards



Pura Belpré Award



Tomás Rivera Mexican American Children’s Book Award
The researcher gathered information about the award-winning books from the

official website for each award. For each book, the following information was collected
and entered into a spreadsheet: title, author, illustrator, name of general award (for
example, Coretta Scott King Award), name of specific award (for example, Coretta Scott
King Author Award or Coretta Scott King Illustrator Award or John Steptoe New Talent
Award), award level (winner or honor), and award year. After all of the books from all of
the awards used in the study were entered into the spreadsheet, the researcher sorted the
information by title to look for books that won more than one award. The researcher

46
copied the list of books and related information into a new spreadsheet and removed the
duplicates while noting all of the awards for each title, so that there was only one entry
for each title.
There were a total of 449 distinct book titles, which are listed in Appendix A in
alphabetical order by title for their respective awards. Thirty-eight books won two or
more of the awards used in the study: 31 books won two different awards, and seven
books won three different awards. The 38 books are counted once in the total of 449
distinct titles, but they appear on the lists of the all appropriate awards in Appendix A,
marked to note that the title also won at least one other award. The books used in the
study are explained below.
American Indian Youth Literature Award. Winner and honor books for the
American Indian Youth Literature Award (American Indian Library Association, 2014)
from the inception of the award in 2006 to 2014 were included in the study and are listed
in Table 30 in Appendix A. There were 25 titles that were winner or honor books for this
award in the categories of middle grades, picture book, and young adult.
Américas Award. Winner and honorable mention books for the Américas
Award (Consortium of Latin American Studies Programs, n.d.) from 1995 to 2013 were
included in the study and are listed in Table 31 in Appendix A. There were 64 distinct
titles that won the Américas Award. Twenty-six titles were winner or honorable mention
for the Américas Award and one or more of the other awards included in this study.
Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature. Winner and honor books for
the Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature (Asian/Pacific American Librarians

47
Association, 2014) from its inception in 2003 to 2014 were included in the study and are
listed in Table 32 in Appendix A. There were 54 titles that were winner or honor books
for this award in the categories of children’s literature, picture books, young adult, and
youth literature. One book also won a Carter G. Woodson Award, and appears on that
list, as well.
The Carter G. Woodson Book Award. Winner and honor books for the Carter
G. Woodson Book Award (National Council for the Social Studies, 2013) from 1995 to
2013 were included in the study and are listed in Table 33 in Appendix A. There are 109
distinct titles that were winner or honor books for the Carter G. Woodson Book Award in
the categories of elementary level, middle level, and secondary level. Eight titles were
winner or honor books for the Carter G. Woodson Award and one or more of the other
awards in the study.
As mentioned in Chapter 2, the National Council for the Social Studies, sponsor
of the Carter G. Woodson Award, issues this award “for the most distinguished social
science books appropriate for young readers that depict ethnicity in the United States”
(National Council for the Social Studies, 2013). Unlike the other awards used in this
study, the Carter G. Woodson Book Award includes books from a variety of ethnicities.
The researcher collected data on all of the books that won the Carter G. Woodson Award
from 1995 to the present, and all of these books are included in the total of 109 books that
won these awards. However, the researcher noted the ethnicity of the protagonist of
Carter G. Woodson Award-winning books. Of the 109 Carter G. Woodson titles, 66
books are about African Americans, eight books are about Latinos, 16 are about

48
Asian/Pacific Americans; 14 are about American Indians; three are about Jews; one is
about immigrants from various countries; and one is about persons of mixed race. All of
the Carter G. Woodson Book Award winners and honor books are listed by title in Table
33 in Appendix A.
The Coretta Scott King Book Awards. Winner and honor books for the Coretta
Scott King Book Awards (American Library Association, 2014a) from 1995, the first
year for the Coretta Scott King/John Steptoe New Talent Award, to 2014 were included
in the study. The researcher included all of the Coretta Scott King book awards: the
Coretta Scott King Author Award, the Coretta Scott King Illustrator Award, and the John
Steptoe New Talent Award. The Coretta Scott King Award books that were included in
the study are listed in Table 34 in Appendix A. There were 139 distinct titles that were
winner or honor books for the Coretta Scott King Book Awards. Five of these titles were
winner or honor books for both the Coretta Scott King Author Award and the Coretta
Scott King Illustrator Award, and are included on the lists for both of those awards. Four
Coretta Scott King Award books also won the Carter G. Woodson Book Award, and
appear on that list, as well.
Pura Belpré Award. Winner and honor books for the Pura Belpré Award
(American Library Association, 2014c) from its inception in 1996 to 2014 were included
in the study and are listed in Table 35 in Appendix A. There were 80 distinct titles that
were winner or honor books for the Pura Belpré Award. Seven of these titles were
winner or honor books for both the Pura Belpré Author Award and the Pura Belpré
Illustrator Award, and are counted for both of these awards. Thirty-one books were

49
winner or honor books for the Pura Belpré Award and one or more of the other awards in
the study.
Tomás Rivera Mexican American Children’s Book Award. Winner and honor
books for the Tomás Rivera Mexican American Children’s Book Award (Tomás Rivera
Mexican American Book Award, 2014) from it inception in 1996 to 2014 were included
in the study and are listed in Table 36 in Appendix A. There are 23 distinct titles that
won the Tomás Rivera Award. Eleven of these books won one or more other awards that
are included in this study.
Libraries Used in the Study
The next step was to compile a list of libraries to use in the study. There are 251
public library systems and 481 public library branches in the state of Ohio (State Library
of Ohio, n.d.). To make the data more manageable for this study, the researcher only
collected data for public libraries in counties in Northeast Ohio in which Latinos or
African Americans alone or in combination with any other race make up at least 5% of
the total population of the county, according to the 2010 United States Census. The State
Library of Ohio lists four regional library systems in the state of Ohio: Northeast,
Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest (State Library of Ohio, n.d.). For the purposes of
this study, the researcher defined Northeast Ohio to be the counties that are included in
the Northeast Ohio Regional Library System. Table 1 lists all of the counties in the
Northeast Ohio Regional Library System, along with demographic information from the
2010 United States Census.

The counties in which at least 5% of the population are African American or
Latino, and were used in the study, are: Cuyahoga, Erie, Lorain, Mahoning, Portage,
Richland, Stark, Summit, and Trumbull. Within these counties are a variety of diverse
and non-diverse communities.
The researcher created a list of all of the public libraries in each of the counties
included in the study. There are a total of 47 public libraries in the nine counties. As
explained below, the researcher encountered technical difficulties searching the OPACs

51
of some of the smaller libraries. Therefore, the researcher decided to limit the libraries
included in the study to libraries that belong to either the SearchOhio library consortium
or the CLEVNET library consortium. The researcher consulted the State Library of
Ohio’s directory of Ohio library consortia (State Library of Ohio, 2011), and added
consortium affiliation to the spreadsheet with information about the libraries. Table 2
lists each county included in the study, all of the public libraries in each county, and the
consortium affiliation of each library. Eleven libraries were not affiliated with
CLEVNET or SearchOhio, and were not included in the study. The libraries that were
eliminated from the study include one library in Cuyahoga County, five libraries in
Lorain County, one library in Richland County, three libraries in Stark County, and one
library in Summit County. The excluded libraries are noted on Table 2.

The 36 remaining library systems were used in the study and are listed in Table
37 in Appendix B. The libraries used in the study have a combined total of 172 outlets.
Seventeen of the libraries have only one outlet. Nineteen libraries have one or more
branches in addition to the central library. Eight libraries have at least one bookmobile.
The State Library of Ohio maintains a publicly available database with
information on all of the public library systems in the State of Ohio (State Library of
Ohio, n.d.). The researcher downloaded the data in spreadsheet format from the State
Library of Ohio website to obtain information on libraries included in the study. The
information collected for each library included the name of the library and the library’s
street address, city, zip code, and website address. For comparison purposes, the
researcher also recorded the population of the library legal service area, the juvenile
circulation, print holdings, and print expenditures, and included this information in Table
37 in Appendix B.
The State Library of Ohio also makes publicly available on its website a
spreadsheet containing information on all of the library branches in the state of Ohio
(State Library of Ohio, 2012). The researcher downloaded the spreadsheet of library
branches and gathered the following information for each branch of the libraries included
in the study: the name of the library; the name of the branch; and the street address, city,
and zip code for the branch. The researcher then combined the information on the library
systems and the information on the library branches into one spreadsheet and sorted by
library name. The researcher verified the accuracy of the information downloaded from
the State Library of Ohio by checking it against information on each library’s website.

54
Any necessary corrections, such as address changes or new, closed, or combined
branches, were made on the spreadsheet.
The researcher then created two spreadsheets from the verified information: one
spreadsheet contained information on every library system included in the study. The
other spreadsheet contained information on every library outlet included in the study.
The list of library outlets included single branch libraries as well as all branches and
mobile service outlets that were listed on the library websites and included in the library
system’s Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC). The researcher also looked up 2010
United States Census data for the ethnic and racial composition of the zip code for each
library outlet.
Check the Availability of Books in Libraries
After creating the list of books and the list of libraries and library outlets to use in
the study, the researcher checked each library's Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC)
for the availability of each of the 449 books that were used in the study. The following
information was recorded: whether or not the book was in the library system's OPAC,
available for patrons to use. Books that were lost or missing were noted but not counted,
as they were not available for patrons to use. Books that were in storage were counted
since they were available for patrons to request. A book was counted as present in a
library’s system if it was available in any book format or edition: hardcover, paperback,
audiobook, e-book, e-audiobook, large print, braille, or foreign language. The
availability of each book was noted for each library system and for each outlet in the
library system.

55
The researcher created a separate Microsoft Excel workbook for the purpose of
collecting data for this study. First, the researcher created a master spreadsheet with one
column in which the researcher entered a row for each of the 449 distinct book titles
included in the study. The researcher added a column to record whether or not the title
was owned by the library system; a column to record how many outlets in the library
system owned the title; and columns to record if the library owned the book in audio,
digital, large print, braille, or foreign language formats or editions.
The researcher then copied the master spreadsheet and pasted the information into
a new spreadsheet in the Excel workbook for each library system included in the study.
A column was created in each spreadsheet for each library outlet in that particular library
system.
After a separate spreadsheet for each library system was created in the workbook,
the researcher began to collect data, looking up each title in the library Online Public
Access Catalog (OPAC). If a library user goes to the website of any of the CLEVNET
libraries and searches the catalog for a book title, holdings for all of the CLEVNET
libraries will appear in the results, making it easy for a patron to request a title from
another CLEVNET library. For the 21 libraries in the CLEVNET system, the researcher
used the OPAC at www.clevnet.org, recording the holdings for each library system and
its outlets in the appropriate spreadsheet for that particular library system. Library
patrons who search for a title at the website of a SearchOhio library will get results for
only that particular library’s holdings. Library patrons can optionally click a button to

56
get results for other SearchOhio libraries and request a title from another SearchOhio
library.
The researcher began collecting data by searching for the titles of each of the 449
books in the OPACs of some of the largest libraries in the SearchOhio consortium on
their individual websites. The researcher searched the individual OPACs for the Akron,
Cuyahoga County, Youngstown, and Warren libraries, and successfully collected data
this way. However, when the researcher began to search the individual OPACs of the
smaller libraries, she encountered technical difficulties trying to search for a large amount
of books at once. The catalogs at some of the smaller libraries repeatedly shut down
while the researcher was trying to search for the books in the study, so the researcher
used the SearchOhio OPAC at http://ohpir.westervillelibrary.org to search for holdings
for the remaining libraries in the SearchOhio network.
The researcher copied the master list of 449 book titles into a new spreadsheet and
created a column for the total holdings for all 36 library systems in the study, and a
column for the total holdings for all 172 library outlets in the study. Total library system
and library outlet holdings for each title are included in the tables in Appendix A.
The researcher then analyzed the data using frequency statistics. The researcher
sorted the lists of holdings by library systems and by library outlets from the most
holdings of books in the study to the fewest and created charts and a frequency table.
The researcher did this for the entire set of 449 books in the study, and for each award in
the study. The results are explained in Chapter 4.

57
Summary
This chapter described the process the researcher used to answer the research
questions. The researcher analyzed the youth literature collections of selected public
libraries in Northeast Ohio, and described the presence or absence of children’s and
young adult literature that won ethnic-specific awards in public libraries in selected
counties in Northeast Ohio.

CHAPTER IV
ANALYSIS OF THE FINDINGS
The purpose of this study was to analyze and describe the availability and
accessibility of multicultural children’s and young adult literature in public libraries in
Northeast Ohio, as represented by the presence or absence of books that won ethnicspecific youth literature awards in the holdings of selected public libraries. The
researcher searched Online Public Access Catalogs (OPACs) for winners and honor
books of seven ethnic-specific youth literature awards. This chapter will analyze and
describe the findings of the study, beginning with a description of the library system and
library outlet holdings of the award-winning multicultural books used in the study,
followed by a description of the findings as related to the ethnic-specific awards and
books used in the study.
Library Holdings
There were 449 distinct titles of award-winning multicultural books in this study,
representing winner and honor books for the American Indian Youth Literature Award,
the Américas Award for Children’s and Young Adult Literature, the Asian/Pacific
American Award for Literature, the Carter G. Woodson Book Award, the Coretta Scott
King Awards, the Pura Belpré Award, and the Tomás Rivera Mexican American
Children’s Book Award, from selected years, as described in Chapter 3, and as listed in
the tables in Appendix A. Thirty-six library systems and 172 library outlets were
included in this study, as described in Chapter 3 and in Table 37 in Appendix B. The
researcher checked the library OPACs for the presence of the 449 award-winning
58

59
multicultural titles. The library system holdings for each of the awards in the study are
listed in Table 38 in Appendix B.
Library Systems
The number of award-winning books included in the study that were held by a
single library system in the study ranged from a high of 382 titles, or 85% of the 449
books in the study, to a low of 36 titles, which is 8% of the books, as shown on the chart
in Figure 1. The average number of titles held by library systems was 173.61, or 39% of
the books in the study. The five library systems with the most holdings of the books in
this study were Cleveland Public Library, with 382 of the 449 titles; Akron-Summit
County Public Library, with 364 titles; Warren-Trumbull County Public Library, with
317 titles; Stark County District Library, with 300 titles; and Cleveland HeightsUniversity Heights Public Library, with 299 titles.

The frequency distribution of the number of books held by the library systems and
library outlets in the study is displayed in Table 3, using class intervals of 25. Fourteen
of the 36 library systems in the study, or 39% of the libraries, had 200 or more of the 449
titles in the study, while 22 library systems, or 61%, had fewer than 200 titles. Ten
library systems had fewer than 100 of the books, and two library systems had fewer than
50 books. All 36 of the library systems in the study had more than 25 of the books in the
study in their holdings.

Library Outlets
The number of titles in the study that were held by library outlets in the study
ranged from a high of 363 titles, or 81% of the 449 books in the study, to a low of three
books, which is 0.67% of the total number of titles, as shown on the chart in Figure 2.
The average number of books in the study that were held by a library outlet in the study
was 85.4 titles, or 19% of the 449 titles in the study. The ten library outlets with the most

62
holdings of the books in this study were Cleveland Main Library, with 363 titles; Akron
Main Library, with 322 titles; Warren Main Library, with 287 titles; Cleveland HeightsUniversity Heights Lee Road Library, with 268 titles; Mansfield Main Library, with 231
titles; Rodman Main Library, with 230 titles; Kent Free Library, with 223 titles; Shaker
Heights Main Library, with 223 titles; Euclid Public Library, with 207 titles; and Reed
Memorial Library, with 187 titles.
As can be seen in Figure 2 and in Table 3, nine outlets, or 5% of the 172 outlets in
the study, had more than 200 of the 449 titles in the study in their collection, while 164
library outlets, or 95% of the outlets, had fewer than 200 of the titles. One hundred
twenty-three outlets had fewer than 100 of the books, 42 outlets had fewer than 50 of the
books, and 24 outlets had fewer than 25 of the 449 books.

Library Outlet

Figure 2. Library Outlet Holdings of Books Included in Study
Table 4 shows the frequency distribution of library outlet holdings in terms of
percentages. Two library outlets had more than 70% of the books in the study, and six

63
library outlets had more than 50% of the books in the study. Conversely, 166 of the
library outlets had fewer than 50% of the books in the study, 148 outlets had fewer than
30% of the books, and 107 outlets had fewer than 20% of the books in the study.
Multiple-Outlet Library Systems
Library systems in the study that have multiple outlets varied in the number of
holdings at each individual outlet. The five library systems that have the most outlets, in
order from most to fewest outlets, are Cleveland Public Library, Cuyahoga County Public
Library, Akron-Summit County Public Library, Public Library of Youngstown and
Mahoning County, and Stark County District Library.
The Cleveland Public Library has a central library, 27 branches, and a
bookmobile. The library system has 382 of the 449 books in the study. Holdings of the
books in the study at individual outlets in the system range from a high of 363 titles to a
low of 35, as detailed in Table 39 in Appendix B.
The Cuyahoga County Public Library has 27 branches. The library system has
291 of the 449 books in the study. Holdings of the books in the study at individual
outlets in the system range from a high of 119 titles to a low of 4, as detailed in Table 40
in Appendix B.
The Akron-Summit County Public Library has a central library, 17 branches, and
three bookmobiles. The library system has 364 of the 449 books in the study. Holdings
of the books at individual outlets in the system range from a high of 322 titles to a low of
35, as detailed in Table 41 in Appendix B.

64
The Public Library of Youngstown and Mahoning County has a central library
and 14 branches. The library system has 236 of the 449 books in the study. Holdings of
the books at individual outlets in the system range from a high of 185 titles to a low of 9,
as detailed in Table 42 in Appendix B.
The Stark County District Library has a central library, nine branches, and five
bookmobiles. The library system has 300 of the 449 books in the study. Holdings of the
books in the study at individual outlets in the system range of a high of 178 titles to a low
of 25, as detailed in Table 43 in Appendix B.
Demographic Information
The researcher gathered demographic information from the 2010 United States
Census for the zip code of each outlet in the study with the intention of relating
information about each outlet’s holdings of the multicultural books in the study to
demographic information about the community with the same zip code as the outlet.
While gathering the information, the researcher realized that connecting information
about holdings at library outlets in this study to demographic information about the zip
code of the outlets would be inaccurate and misleading for a number of reasons.
Some of the outlets with the most holdings of the titles used in this study are the
main branch of multiple-outlet library systems, and provide services to a population
beyond the zip code of that particular outlet. Some outlets, particularly main branch
outlets in larger cities, may have a business zip code that is specific to the library and not
connected to any residents. Additionally, some main branch outlets may be in a
downtown area where there are few residents who share the zip code of the outlet, and

65
the residents who live downtown and share the zip code of the outlet may not be
representative of the community served by the outlet.
The researcher found that 23 zip codes of outlets in the study were shared by
more than one outlet, and 55 outlets shared a zip code with at least one other outlet.
There were three zip codes that were shared by four outlets each, three zip codes that
were shared by three outlets each, and 17 zip codes that were shared by two outlets each.
In the case of one zip code that was shared by four outlets, three of the outlets were in
one library system, and the other outlet with the same zip code was in a different library
system. In three separate instances, two library outlets in different library systems shared
zip codes. In two of those instances, the two same-zip code libraries were in different
counties.
Although the researcher decided not to connect demographic information to
library holdings, the demographic information that she collected can be a useful way to
describe the wide variety of communities included in the study since the researcher
included in the study only counties in Northeast Ohio that had at least five percent
African American or Latino population at the county level. Within those counties are a
wide variety of diverse and non-diverse communities, as can be seen in Table 44 in
Appendix C.
The researcher copied the demographic information about the 172 outlets into a
new spreadsheet and sorted the data by zip code, then removed the duplicate zip codes.
The zip code for the Greenford Branch Library in the Youngstown-Mahoning County
library system was also removed because demographic information is not available from

66
the United States Census for that zip code. The researcher removed the zip codes of the
main branch outlets for Akron Public Library, Cleveland Public Library, Stark County
District Library (Canton), and the Public Library of Youngstown and Mahoning County
(Youngstown) because the demographic information for the zip codes associated with
those outlets appeared to have some of the problematic situations mentioned above. The
demographic information on the remaining zip codes is listed in Table 44 in Appendix C.
Since the researcher removed the zip codes for the Akron, Canton, Cleveland, and
Youngstown main library outlets, she looked up city-level United States Census data for
those cities. That information is in Table 5.

Awards and Books
Only two of the 449 books in the study were in the collections of all 36 library
systems. Those books are Bud, Not Buddy, the 2000 Coretta Scott King Author Award
winner, and The Watsons Go to Birmingham—1963, a 1996 Coretta Scott King Author
Award honor, both by Christopher Paul Curtis. Three books are owned by 34 of the 36
library systems: Elijah of Buxton, the 2008 Coretta Scott King Author Award winner by
Christopher Paul Curtis; Martin’s Big Words, a 2002 Coretta Scott King Illustrator
Award honor book written by Doreen Rappaport and illustrated by Bryan Collier; and
The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, the 2008 American Youth Literature
Award Winner by Sherman Alexie.
Eighteen of the 449 books in the study are in the collections of 100 or more of the
library outlets in the study. Those 18 books are listed in Table 6.

Alternative Formats
The researcher gathered information on library holdings of alternative formats of
the award-winning titles included in the study. The alternative formats include
audiobooks, e-audiobooks, e-books, large print, braille, and foreign language versions of
a title. Audiobooks come in a variety of formats, such as cassettes, CDs, or audio
recordings of the books on preloaded digital devices. Some libraries may have separate

99
catalogs for digital media. The researcher only looked in the libraries’ regular OPAC for
holdings, so it is possible that the libraries may have more digital holdings than those the
researcher found. Patrons of libraries that are members of the CLEVNET consortium
have access to e-audiobooks and e-books through CLEVNET. Thirty-three of the 36
library systems in the study have at least one title in the study in an audio format in the
libraries’ regular OPAC. Ten of the 36 library systems in the study had at least one of the
books in the study in large print format. Two library systems each had one book in the
study available in braille format. Twelve library systems had at least one of the books in
the study available in a foreign language. Cleveland Public Library had 22 of the titles
available in a foreign language. Most of the foreign language versions were in Spanish.
Cleveland Public Library had one book in Marathi. The book is Born Confused by
Tanuja Desai Hidier, a 2003 honor book for the Asian/Pacific American Award for
Literature in the youth literature category.
Summary
This chapter analyzed and described the library system and outlet holdings of the
winner and honor books of the seven ethnic-specific youth literature awards that were
included in the study. The next chapter will discuss the findings.

CHAPTER V
DISCUSSION, IMPLICATIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this descriptive study was to analyze and describe the availability
and accessibility of award-winning multicultural youth literature in public libraries in
Northeast Ohio by answering the following question: To what extent are children’s and
young adult books that won ethnic-specific literary awards available and accessible in the
youth literature collections of selected public libraries in Northeast Ohio? The researcher
checked Online Public Access Catalogs (OPACs) of 36 library systems for the presence
or absence of winner and honor books of the following seven ethnic-specific youth
literature awards: American Indian Youth Literature Award, Américas Award for
Children’s and Young Adult Literature, Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature,
Carter G. Woodson Book Award, Coretta Scott King Book Awards, Pura Belpré Award,
and Tomás Rivera Mexican Children’s Book Award.
The researcher noted whether or not the 449 award-winning books in the study
were present in the libraries’ collections at the library system level and at the library
outlet level. Like the Institute of Museum and Library Services (2013), the researcher
uses the term public library to mean “the administrative entity, either a single-outlet
library or a library system,” and the term outlet “to refer to central libraries, branch
libraries, and bookmobiles” (p. 3), or the place where a patron goes to get books. There
were 36 public libraries and 172 library outlets in the study.
The results of this study confirm that the multicultural children’s and young adult
books used in this study may be difficult to find on the shelves at most of the Northeast
100

101
Ohio public library outlets that were included in this study. Only six of the 172 outlets in
the study had more than 50% of the books, while 148 outlets had fewer than 30% and 107
outlets had fewer than 20% of the titles. The average number of books held by library
outlets was 85.4 titles, a mere 19% of the books. While not as many books about people
of color are published as could be expected in a diverse country such as the United States,
some multicultural books do exist. When preparing this list of books, the researcher used
ethnic-specific youth literature awards to prepare a list of 449 multicultural books that
have gone through a formal selection process and been deemed high-quality culturally
authentic books by selection committees qualified to make that determination. These
books should be available and accessible in the collections of public libraries.
This chapter will begin with a discussion of the findings of the study as they relate
to the research question, followed by a discussion of the implications of the findings,
recommendations for future research, and limitations.
Discussion of the Findings
Library System Holdings. The researcher recorded a book as owned by a library
if there was at least one copy of the title in any print or non-print format at any outlet in
the library system. Figure 1, Table 3, Table 4, and Table 38 display information about
the total holdings of books in the study at library systems in the study. The holdings of
those books by library systems ranged from a high of 382 books, which is 85% of the 449
books, to a low of 36 titles, which is 8% of the books. The average number of books held
by library systems was 173.61, or 39% of the books. Only four of the 36 library systems
had more than 300, or 67% of the 449 books. Of the other 32 library systems, 10 had

102
between 200 and 299 of the books, 12 had between 100 and 199 titles, and 10 library
systems had between 1 and 99 of the books.
Very few of the libraries studied have an adequate number of the books available
in their collections, while the majority of those libraries do not have enough of the books
to meet the needs of diverse communities. The numbers presented above highlight the
fact that there is a wide range in the number of books available in the libraries. The
library system with the most books has 346 more of the books than the library system
with the fewest books. There is even a wide range within the top five libraries, as the
library with the most holdings of the books has 83 more titles than the fifth-ranked
library.
The researcher gathered information at the system level regarding library holdings
of alternative formats of the award-winning titles. The alternative formats include
audiobooks, e-audiobooks, e-books, large print, braille, and foreign language versions of
titles. Libraries that are members of the CLEVNET consortium have access to digital
books and audiobooks through CLEVNET. Some libraries may have separate catalogs
for their digital media. The researcher only checked regular OPACs for titles in this
study, and acknowledges that data she recorded about alternative format holdings may
not be accurate for that reason. There were few large print and braille editions of the
books considered. Twelve library systems had at least one title available in a foreign
language. All of the foreign language books were in Spanish, with the exception of one
book in Marathi. The researcher only looked up titles in English. Libraries may have

103
books catalogued by their foreign language titles. If so, these titles would have been
missed by the researcher.
Library Outlet Holdings. The holdings of books by library outlets ranged from
a high of 363 books, which is 81% of the 449 books, to a low of three books, which is
0.67%. The average number of books held by library outlets was 85.4 books, or 19%.
Only two library outlets had more than 300, or 67% of the 449 books. Of the other 170
library outlets, seven had between 200 and 299 of the books, 40 had between 100 and 199
titles, and 123 library outlets had between 1 and 99 of the titles. Figure 2, Table 3, and
Table 4 display information about the total holdings of books at library outlets. These
figures are evidence that the award-winning multicultural children’s and young adult
books studied here are scarce in the collections of the vast majority of the library outlets
researched.
There is great variation in the number of books available in the holdings of library
outlets. The library outlet with the most books in the study has 360 more books than the
library outlet with the fewest. The range within the top five outlets in the study is very
wide, as the outlet with the most holdings has 132 more titles than the fifth-ranked outlet.
Even when library systems have many of these books, there is still a wide range
of books at library outlets within the same multiple-outlet library system, as can be seen
in Tables 39, 40, 41, 42, and 43 in Appendix B. For example, as displayed in Table 39,
the Cleveland Public Library, the highest-ranking library system in this study in terms of
the number of books in the study in its holdings, has a central library, 27 branches, and a
bookmobile. The Cleveland Main Library outlet in the Cleveland Public Library system

104
has 363 of the 449 books, which is the highest number of any of the 172 library outlets in
the study. Holdings of the books in the study at the other outlets in the Cleveland Public
Library system vary, ranging from a high of 115 to a low of 35 of the titles. Variation in
the number of books at library outlets is to be expected because different outlets have
different needs, and librarians take into consideration the resources of the library and the
needs of the communities they serve when they make decisions about which multicultural
books to purchase and at which outlets to place them. Unlike some of the other central
library outlets in multiple-outlet library systems, Cleveland Main Library has at least one
copy of most of the books in the study owned by that library system, a practice that is
beneficial to the community. When one centrally located outlet in a library system has
many multicultural books, patrons of outlets with fewer books have the option of going to
the outlet with a larger selection, and books can easily be sent to other outlets when
needed.
Award-Winning Books
The Coretta Scott King Award is unique among the awards in that all 172 of the
library outlets studied have at least one of the 139 Coretta Scott King Award titles. The
Coretta Scott King Award is the oldest and best-known ethnic-specific award in the
United States (Short et al, 2014; Yokota, 2011), so it is not surprising that winners of that
award would be in more libraries and library outlets than books that won the other
awards. Table 6 lists 18 books that are in the collections of 100 or more of the researched
outlets. Fifteen of the 18 books are Coretta Scott King Award books, which is
confirmation of the popularity of the award. Of the three other books on that list, two are

105
Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature winners that also won the Newbery Medal,
the most prestigious children’s literature award in the United States. The third book on
the list is The Absolutely True Story of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie, an
American Indian Youth Literature Award winner.
Library outlet holdings for the Pura Belpré Award are displayed in Figure 4 and
Table 12; holdings for the Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature are displayed in
Figure 5 and Table 15; holdings for the American Indian Youth Literature Award are
displayed in Figure 6 and Table 18; holdings for the Américas Award are displayed in
Figure 7 and Table 21; holdings for the Tomás Rivera Award are displayed in Figure 8
and Table 24; and holdings for the Carter G. Woodson Book Award are displayed in
Figure 9 and Table 27. These figures and tables show that, with few exceptions, the
books in the study are largely absent from the library outlets in the study. One hundred
forty-nine of the 172 library outlets have fewer than 30% of the Pura Belpré Award
books, and 150 or more outlets have fewer than 30% of the books for the Asian/Pacific
American Award for Literature, the American Indian Youth Literature Award, the
Américas Award, the Tomás Rivera Award, and the Carter G. Woodson Award. Over
100 of the library outlets have fewer than 20% of all of the awards in the study, with one
exception. Forty-six library outlets have fewer than 20% of the Coretta Scott King
Award books in the study.
It is noteworthy that several libraries do not have any of the books that won some
of the awards. Nine outlets do not have any of the Pura Belpré Award books, 12 outlets
do not have any of the Asian/Pacific American Award books, 37 outlets do not have any

106
of the American Indian Youth Literature Award books, 16 outlets do not have any of the
Américas Award books, 28 outlets do not have any of the Tomás Rivera Award books,
and six outlets do not have any of the Carter G. Woodson Award books that were
included in the study.
Table 7 lists 15 books are not held by any library system studied. Of these books,
one is a Pura Belpré Award book, two are Asian/Pacific American Award books, six are
American Indians in Youth Literature Award books, one is an Américas Award book,
and five are Carter G. Woodson books. Table 8 lists 11 books that are only held by one
of the studied outlets. Those books include four American Indian in Youth Literature
Award books, three Américas Award books, and four Carter G. Woodson books.
Although the booklist used for this study included books as far back as 1995, only five of
the books in Table 7 and Table 8 are from the 1990s. Books as recent as 2010, 2011, and
2012 are included on those lists. Most of the titles on the lists of books that are in none
or only one of the library outlets are from the American Indian Youth Literature Award,
the Américas Award, and the Carter G. Woodson Award, which might indicate that these
awards are not used as book selection resources for librarians as much as the other
awards discussed here.
Access and Availability
Availability. Only 15 of the 449 books were not available at any of the libraries.
Cleveland Public Library, the library system with the most books from the list, had 382,
or 85% of the 449 books, and Cleveland Main Library, the library outlet with the most
books in this study, had 363, or 81% of the books. This means that 434 titles, or 97% of

107
the 449 books, are in the holdings of at least one library studied. Additionally, all of the
libraries considered are members of either the CLEVNET library consortium or the
SearchOhio library consortium. Patrons can easily request books from any other library
in the consortium through their library’s OPAC. Thus, books can be said to be available
through the library consortia, as well as through the library outlet or library system.
When the ability to request books through consortia is taken into consideration,
even more of these can be said to be to be available. CLEVNET and SearchOhio have
member libraries that were not included in this study because they are not located in a
Northeast Ohio county that was considered. Patrons using the OPAC of their local
library can easily request books from any CLEVNET or SearchOhio library, including
libraries that were not included here. Additionally, patrons of SearchOhio libraries can
also easily request books from OhioLINK, a consortium of academic libraries in the state
of Ohio, which further expands the number of books in the study that are available to
library patrons.
As mentioned earlier, Table 7 lists the 15 books in the study that are not in the
collections of any library system researched here. Also included in that table is
information about the availability of the books through CLEVNET, SearchOhio, and
OhioLINK. Ten of the 15 books were available through at least one of the three
consortia. Therefore, 444 of the 449 books in the study, or 99% of the books, are
available in the holdings of at least one CLEVNET, SearchOhio, or OhioLINK library,
and thus can be said to be easily available to patrons who know how to search for them.

108
Librarians at any of the outlets should be able to order any of the remaining five books
through interlibrary loan.
Access. The previous section established that 99% of the books considered here
are easily available to patrons who know how to find them. The problem is that although
the books are available to those with the knowledge and skills to search for them, they are
not accessible to the average person, including the children who need the books the most.
When considering the availability and accessibility of books in public libraries, it is
important to consider the way people look for books. Most people find library books by
going to their local public library outlet and browsing for something interesting. The
information gathered in this study and presented here provides evidence that whether or
not library patrons will find the books in this study at their local library outlet depends on
which outlet they use. Cleveland Main Library, Akron Main Library, the Warren branch
of the Warren-Trumbull County Public Library, and the Stark County Main Library
consistently ranked in the top ten outlets for all seven awards considered, so patrons who
use those outlets have access to books that won those awards. However, patrons who use
the vast majority of the researched libraries are not likely to find very many of these
books on the shelves of their local library outlet.
In order to gain access to books that are not at their local outlet, patrons must first
know that the books exist, and then know how to request them from other outlets in the
library system, from other libraries in the consortium, or through interlibrary loan.
Librarians can help with that process, but patrons, especially children, may not realize
that high quality, culturally accurate multicultural books, such as the books discussed

109
here, exist and are available at other libraries for them to request. When patrons do not
see multicultural books on the shelves at their local outlet, they may become frustrated
because they cannot find what they were looking for and may not think to ask a librarian
for assistance, or may not know what to ask for.
Implications of the Findings
There are many reasons why multicultural children’s and young adult literature
should be available in public libraries. The United States is becoming increasingly
diverse (U.S. Census Bureau, 1992a, 1992b, 2010), and African American, American
Indian, Asian Pacific American, and Latino children are from cultural and ethnic groups
that have historically been and are currently underrepresented in children’s literature
(Cooperative Children’s Book Center, 2014; Horning, 2014; Horning, Lindgren, &
Schliesman, 2013; Larrick, 1965). Children and their families, teachers, and the general
public should be able to find multicultural books at their local public library. This is the
case in diverse communities, as well as in communities that are not diverse. Children of
color need to have access to culturally authentic books about people who share their
culture. White children, teachers, preservice teachers and librarians, as well as children
of color, should be able to find culturally authentic books about people who are from
other cultures (Bishop, 1990a; Horning, 2014; Howard, 1993; Overall, 2009).
Many students of color score lower than their white peers on reading assessments
(National Center for Education Statistics, 2013; Snyder & Dillow, 2012), and can benefit
by reading more (Krashen, 2004, 2011). Research suggests that students who have
access to books tend to read more (Ramos & Krashen, 1998), and public libraries are an

110
important source for reading material (Krashen, 2004, 2011). Students of color want to
read books about people who share their culture (e.g., Adkins & Hussey, 2006; Barry,
2013; Parker, 2008; Sims, 1983). Authors have reported that multicultural books are
often not found in schools (Baker, 2002; Gray, 2009; Sims, 1983), or bookstores
(Horning, 2010, 2014). Public libraries are important community resources for the access
they provide to books that may be difficult to obtain elsewhere (Krashen, 2013), and
multicultural children’s and young adult literature should be available and accessible in
local public libraries (Garrison, 2012; Horning, 2010, 2014; Kurz, 2012).
Unfortunately, the results of this study show that, with very few exceptions,
library outlets do not have enough award-winning multicultural books in their collections
to meet the needs of people in the community who require access to high quality,
culturally authentic, multicultural children’s and adult literature.
It is important for educators of future teachers and librarians and professors of
children’s literature to be aware of whether or not multicultural children’s and young
adult books are available in public libraries in order to make instructional decisions.
Preservice teachers and librarians need to learn about book selection strategies and
resources that will help them select high quality, culturally authentic multicultural
children’s and young adult books to share with their future students and library patrons.
Practicing teachers should include multicultural literature in their courses, even when
these books are not available in their classroom or school libraries or bookstores.
It is important for professors of children’s literature, education, and library
science courses to teach their students how to use literary awards, booklists, and other

111
book selection resources to identify titles they might want to read, and how to request
books if they are not at their local library outlet, or not owned by their library system or
the consortium to which their library belongs.
Recommendations for Future Research
The central purpose of this study was to determine whether or not children’s and
young adult books that won ethnic-specific literary awards were owned by the library
systems considered, and, if so, if the books were on the shelves of the local public library
outlets. It was beyond the scope of this study to find out the reasons why the books were
or were not at any library system or outlet. A future study could do more in-depth
research to find out why librarians decide which multicultural books to purchase for their
library, and which outlets get them. Future studies could also research school libraries to
see if they have the multicultural books used in the study in their collections, or research
bookstores for multicultural books on their shelves.
Limitations of the Study
This study is not meant to be generalizable. It describes the holdings of a specific
set of books at a specific set of libraries at the time the study was conducted. This study
does not claim to make any assumptions about holdings by the libraries in the study of
books that are not included in the study. It is probable that the libraries may have in their
collections other high quality multicultural children’s and young adult books that were
not winner and honor books of the ethnic-specific awards that were considered here.
Library collections can change daily, as librarians add new books to their collections, and
as books are weeded out, become lost or missing, or are otherwise removed from

112
collections. The researcher acknowledges that libraries may have had some of the books
in the study prior to the period of time that the researcher collected the data for this study,
and may have acquired some of the books after the researcher collected the data. This
study is only a snapshot of the way things were at the time the study was conducted. The
researcher also acknowledges that the data are only as accurate as the Online Public
Access Catalogs (OPACs) that she consulted.
Conclusion
Media attention on the lack of diversity in youth literature raises the public’s
awareness of this very important issue (Blair, 2013; Kirch, 2013; Mantle, 2013; “Why
hasn’t the number,” 2013). Along with the call for more books that promote diversity, it
is important to realize that high quality multicultural literature already exists, and should
be on the shelves of library outlets in diverse and non-diverse communities across the
country. Ethnic-specific youth literature awards are valuable tools that librarians can use
to help identify books to include in their collections, and that professors of children’s
literature, education, and library science courses can use to help introduce their students
to multicultural literature.
