ABSTRACT
This qualitative exploratory single case study explored embedding information literacy into first
year undergraduate curriculum and the importance of faculty and librarian collaboration.
Embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum and faculty and
librarian collaboration is a necessary means to promote student development and growth, critical
thinking skills, and lifelong learning. The specific problem is the need to better understand how
faculty and librarians can best collaborate on designing a first year undergraduate curriculum that
embeds information literacy in first year undergraduate curriculum. A single case study was the
chosen design and focused on two subjects, embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum and the importance of faculty and librarian collaboration. Data were
collected for the study by conducting interviews from instructors and librarians in a four-year,
private university located in the Southeast region of the United States. The instructors and
librarians gave their perspectives concerning embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curricula and the importance of the collaboration process. Data received from
both groups of professionals were analyzed using the NVivo10 software and yielded beneficial
information and insights that have the potential to assist in embedding information literacy into
first year curricula and the collaboration process. The analysis of data also allowed the
identification of six major themes: (a) embedding information literacy, (b) quality enhancement
plan, (c) institutional support for collaboration, (d) collaboration between faculty and librarians,
(e) curricula improvement, and (f) perceived benefits.

Introduction

First year undergraduate students are in learning environments where information literacy
plays a vital role in the academic culture. Most first year undergraduates have not developed
adequate information seeking skills appropriate for success at the higher education level (Fain,
2011). Adequate information seeking skills can be found in the definition that the Association of
College and Research (ACRL) gives to information literacy: skills to find, retrieve, evaluate,
analyze, and use information, or information literacy (ACRL, 2000). Literature focusing on the
first-year experiences of college students that lead to the retention or attrition of college students
is abundant (Astin, 1993; Padgett, Keup, & Pascarella, 2013; Tinto, 2002). There is also an
abundance of research and information also exist on retention and persistence rates, dropout
rates, and graduation rates as well as the factors influencing these rates (Bovill, Bulley, & Morss,
2011, Purdie & Rosser 2011; Tuckman & Kennedy, 2011). Bovill, Bulley, and Morss suggested
that because first-year undergraduate students find themselves in unfamiliar territory, their level
of autonomy and independence must increase as they begin to engage in a new social
environment.
Some degree of lifestyle changes that accompanies college life is expected including
becoming acclimated to a new academic environment, social environment, and possibly a new
culturally diverse institutional environment (Maunder, Cunliffe, Galvin, Mjali, & Rogers, 2013;
Bovil, Bulley, & Morss, 2011). Decision-making, critical thinking, and information literacy
become crucial as first year undergraduate students adjust to their new surroundings. Determing
and Johnson (2011) suggested that to help first year undergraduate students survive their first
year of college librarians and faculty must develop collaborative partnerships to design curricula

1

that embed information literacy. This qualitative explanatory single case study explored the need
to better understand how to design a first year undergraduate curriculum that meets the needs of
first year undergraduate students through faculty and librarian collaboration. Chapter 1 includes
the background, problem statement and purpose of the study, the general significance of the
study, and the significance of the study in terms of leadership. Additionally, the chapter includes
the nature of the study, research questions, conceptual framework, definitions of important terms,
assumptions, scope, limitations and delimitations, and a chapter summary.
Background of the Study
There is an abundance of information that focuses on the first-year undergraduate student
and research findings on the importance of the first year undergraduate student experience
(Andrews & Patil, 2007; Bovill, Bulley, & Morss, 2011; Goodman & Pascarella, 2006; Purdie &
Rosser 2011; Tuckman & Kennedy, 2011; Vanthournout, Gijbels, Coertjens, Donche, &
Petegem, 2013; Yager, Salisbury, & Kirkman, 2013). Those experiences range from the
students’ sense of belonging to and in their higher education institution, first year undergraduate
seminars, persistence, and graduation. Bovill, Bulley, and Morss penned an article explaining
why engaging first year students and empowering them in their overall first year undergraduate
experience is so important. Bovill, Bulley, and Morss described how first year undergraduate
students find themselves in unfamiliar territory where they must begin to engage in new social
environments that requires an increase of autonomy and independence. Wilkes, Godwin, and
Gurney (2015) stated that the first year undergraduate student is in an unfamiliar environment in
his or her new tertiary environment and academic writing expectations are also unclear. Orme
(2008) provided an analogy of first-year undergraduate students likening them to immigrants
who just came to a new country; thus acculturation and acclimation are necessary for student

2

success. Bovill, Bulley, and Morss provided statistical evidence to support student dropout rates;
“first-year drop out rate in the United States is estimated at 25%” (p. 197). Pascarella and
Terenzini (as cited in Purdie & Rosser, 2011) reported that 50% of first-year students do not
proceed to second year instruction. Tuckman and Kennedy (2011) provided evidence that the
dropout rate for universities is 25% while community colleges average a 50% dropout rate.
Purdie and Rosser (2011) opined that improving the quality of education lead to increased
student persistence and graduation.
The issue for this research study was not concerned with student persistence rates,
dropout rates, graduation rates, seminars, or programs. This research was concerned with
empowering and engaging first year undergraduate students toward academic achievement and
independence by way of embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum
through faculty and librarian collaboration. The issue, according to Bovill, Bulley, and Morss
(2011), is increasing student’s connectedness and active learning, and improving student’s
engagement and empowerment through improving first year undergraduate curriculum. Bovill,
Bulley, and Morss suggested that providing high-quality and positive first year undergraduate
academic learning experiences for students and can be considered a challenge for higher
education institutions. The challenge is for the institution to meet and increase support of the
educational needs of first year undergraduate students. One way to meet the challenge is through
improving first-year undergraduate curriculum by embedding information literacy as a means to
target student motivation that results in increased student engagement through active learning
(Vanthournout, Gijbels, Coertjens, Donche, & Petegem, 2012). According to Vanthournout, et
al. to date there are not very many studies conducted specifically in higher education setting that

3

examined relationships between students and their motivations, their academic performance or
their learning strategies.
According to Turusheva (2009), and Badke (2008), this is the age of information where
large amounts of information can be easily accessed by a vast majority of people at any given
time through computer technology. There are times when large amounts of information are
needed to answer personal inquires, daily work processes, and to meet academic requirements.
Information is used to answer questions, solve problems, or simply to advance personal
knowledge (Badke, 2008). One must have the capacity to sort through the masses of available
information, determine its accuracy, validity, and reliability in order to meet specific needs.
Accurate information is critical for success in academics, business, and life. Having accurate
information improves the decision-making process. Information literacy is the tool that provides
individuals with this capability. Information literacy can be defined as having a set of abilities to
recognize when information is needed, the ability to locate, evaluate, and effectively use the
information (American Library Association, 1989). Information literacy is a major component
and an essential contributing factor to lifelong learning (Boeriswati, 2012). All students,
especially first year undergraduate students need to know what information literacy is and how to
use it.
A primary lifestyle change of first-year undergraduate students is that of acculturation
and engagement. Maunder, et al., (2013) indicated that new social, academic, and culturally
diverse environments are challenging demands for first-year undergraduate students. Maunder,
et al. also considered that academic assimilation in higher education is an important part of the
process of cultural and social assimilation for first year undergraduate student experiences.
Bovill, Bulley, and Morss (2010) stated that student development, engagement, and

4

empowerment should be the focus for first year undergraduate student experiences. Goodman
and Pascarella (2006) observed that first year experiences are essential for student achievement.
Donnison, Edwards, Itter, Martin, and Yager (2009) stated that research revealed that student
engagement is essential to successful first year transition and academic persistence. Summerlee
and Murry (2010) suggested that a key driver to academic success is the students’ active
engagement with their institution. Goodman and Pascarella (2006) wrote about first-year
undergraduate seminars and how those are comprised of regularly scheduled meetings, noting
that students who participate in first-year undergraduate seminars have a higher persistence rate
to second-year of study.
Information literacy involves a continuum of learning and is the tool that has the potential
to challenge students in their development, has the potential to incite active engagement, and
potentially one of the causes that will promote students to achieve academically, professionally,
and with their personal goals, thus enabling the individual to fully and successfully participate in
society and the marketplace (Boeriswati, 2012). The ACRL, 1996-2015; Boeriswati, 2012;
DaCosta, 2010; and Decarie, 2012, reported that embedding information literacy into course
curriculum is important and supported by research in the field; however, research also reports
that there are still students who lack proficiency in information literacy skills (Badke, 2009;
Decarie, 2012; Detlor, Booker, Serenko, & Julien, 2012). This study will emphasize the need for
embedding information literacy and making it an integral part of first year undergraduate
curriculum. According to Badke (2009) information literacy should not be projected as remedial
education, but as a core foundational component of first-year undergraduate curriculum. Badke
also adequately stated that, “Our information age is too complex and too important to all of us
for half measures” (p. 49).

5

First year undergraduate students have a multitude of choices from which they can
retrieve information, which means they usually reach for information that is easiest and quickest
to access (Fain, 2011). Most first year undergraduate students have very little or no
understanding of what information literacy is nor have the skills to operate within the parameters
of information literacy. According to Derry (2008) in higher education institutions information
literacy is a necessary skill set for academic success and necessary for success in the 21st
technological and information century. The Internet is easy and familiar and has a tendency to
convince many first year undergraduate students that popular Internet search engines such as
Google, Yahoo, and Bing are adequate, appropriate, and acceptable for academic research
(Byerley, 2004). The issue with some of the information that comes from the Internet is that it is
non-filtered, meaning there are questions concerning the authenticity, validity, and quality of the
information (Turusheva, 2009). What is interesting about information literacy is that once an
individual has that skill set he or she is able to discern the authenticity, reliability, and credibility
of information retrieved from popular Internet search engines (Badke, 2008). Collaboration
between faculty and librarians, with the focus of embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum can facilitate students’ information literacy abilities. There are many
regional higher accrediting organizations as well as the Association of College and Research
(ACRL) that identify faculty and librarian collaboration as a characteristic of best practices in
information literacy programs and as a component of effective information literacy education
(Douglas & Rabinowitz, 2016).
First year undergraduate students are in a new learning environment where information
plays a vital role in the academic culture. Most first year undergraduates have not developed
adequate information literacy skills appropriate for success at the higher education level (Fain,

6

2011). The ACRL defines information literacy as having the skills to find, retrieve, analyze, and
use information (ACRL, 2000). Information literacy has the potential to develop student’s
cognitive skills and ignite critical thought processes that are necessary when considering the best
information to use (Decarie, 2012). Decarie also stated how information literacy benefits the
students’ academic world, work world, and their personal world. The desired impact for
information literacy is for students to become more self-reliant, have the ability to manage their
own learning, and have the ability to make wiser information retrieval choices (Boerswati, 2012;
McBride, 2012). Information literacy encourages the student to reconsider course assignments
not only as process of collecting information, but as a tool to enhance formulating their own
perspectives, create new perspectives, or reinforce preexisting notions (McBride, 2012).
Information literate students are able to locate information, evaluate it, determine if the
information meets their needs, and then make informed decisions based on the information.
Decarie (2012) stated, “Without this ability, we cannot move forward” (p. 167). Wong (2010)
posited that information literacy is essential to intellectual development, critical thinking, and
life-long learning.
Statement of the Problem
First year undergraduate students are in a new learning environment where information
plays a vital role in the academic culture. Most first year undergraduates have not developed
adequate information literacy skills appropriate for success at the higher education level (Fain,
2011). The generations of students born in the digital age between 1982 and 2000 are referred to
as millennials, Gen X, or Gen Next. Millennial students have a different learning mentality,
learning style, and attitude from the previous generation of students (Taylor, 2012; Sumerlee &
Murray, 2010). Because of advanced technology the speed at which information is available is

7

overwhelming and with the availability of the Internet information literacy has become an issue
in higher education (Horton & Keiser, 2008). The issue, according to Gross and Latham (2011),
which points to the general problem, is that first year undergraduate students do not value the
process of locating information. They view locating information only as a product, thus, making
the embedding of information literacy in the undergraduate curriculum a necessity.
The specific problem is the need to better understand how faculty and librarians can best
collaborate on designing a first year undergraduate curriculum that embeds information literacy
into first year undergraduate curriculum and address the issue of students valuing the process of
locating information as noted by Gross and Latham (2011). Embedding information literacy into
first year undergraduate curriculum enables the student to develop critical thinking skills,
recognize the value of information, effectively use information, synthesize information into
knowledge, and make better decisions (Conley & Gil, 2011).
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory single case study was to explore the
importance of faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into first
year undergraduate curriculum and to consider how a first year undergraduate curriculum
embedded with information literacy would support first year undergraduate students with their
information literacy needs. The importance for faculty and librarian collaboration and
embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum is a necessary means to
promote student development and growth, critical thinking skills, and lifelong learning. Faculty
and librarians are equipped to collaborate and provide a quality first year undergraduate
curriculum that is relevant and adds value to information literacy (Brasley, 2008). Qualitative
research is social or behavioral in nature, focusing on meaning rather than statistical

8

measurements of quantity, intensity, or frequency (Denzin & Lincoln, 2007). Case studies
focusing on contemporary events (Merriam, 2009) such as information literacy in higher
education are practical and have the potential to be immediately applicable to the problem
(Marczyk, et al., 2005). The population for the study included faculty who teach first-year
undergraduate students and librarians with a discourse in information literacy from universities
located in the Southeast region of the United States. The sample consisted of 15 instructors and
five librarians.
Significance of the Study
Information literacy is a useful and transferable skill and a necessary attribute for college
graduates to be successful in the rapidly changing information environment (Taib & Holden,
2013). Higher education institutions are to produce students who meet the demands of today's
marketplace industries. Marketplace industries require graduates who have skills in defining
information, engaging with it, and have the ability to creatively solve complex problems
(Andrews & Patil, 2007). Therefore, it is necessary and important to embed information literacy
into first year undergraduate curricula to produce graduates who are intellectually developed and
able to effectively engage in the workforce and larger society. According to Boeriswati (2012)
one of the major focal points of higher education has become information literacy. Boeriswati
also suggested that information literacy is not just an application of a formal educational
environment. Information itself has become a major societal commodity. Information literacy
applies to all disciplines of education, every learning environment, and every level of education;
and is an important component of everyday life (Boeriswati, 2012). The demand in today’s
employment market is for employees who are information literate (Decarie, 2012). For example,
in 2012 a workplace seminar was held at The City University of New York (CUNY) where

9

library faculty and job counselors met with employers to hear their expectations of potential
hired graduates (CUNY, 2012). Employers identified that their employees must be able to
navigate, filter, summarize, and effectively communicate information (CUNY, 2012).
Many research findings support the concept of information literacy as a personal need for
professional development (Boeriswaiti, 2012; Davis, 2014; Rauterkus & Rauterkus, 2007). The
inference is that information literacy is needed in more than just the academic environment.
According to Boeriswati there are many documented reports that strongly suggest a personal
need for the personal development of information literacy. According to Davis (2014) the
healthcare industry is one area where it is important for a person to be able to understand
discharge instructions and the instructions provided for administering medications. Davis stated
that adults with low literacy levels found it difficult to understand their medical instruction sheet.
Another example is the need for information literacy in a person’s day-to-day financial world.
Rauterkus and Rauterkus stated that basic financial literacy is a concept many Americans fail to
grasp in their everyday lives, evidenced by high bankruptcy rates, consumer debts, and little or
no savings.
McBride (2011-2012) suggested that information literacy is not only for the student to
learn how to increase library researching skills but it is the guide to the student becoming an
information literate person who can then further his or her learning abilities as technologies
continue to increase. It is essential that students understand the processes involved in conducting
research, how to make the connections between specific resources, and the have ability to
communicate his or her findings (Thompson, 2002). Catts and Lau (2008) stated that literacy
involves a continuum of learning and Turusheva (2009) stated that after five years, 50% of
information acquired by the university is considered old. Therefore, students need to have the

10

capacity and competence to endure the changing world of information. When students are
competent in information literacy it enables them to achieve specific goals, develop knowledge,
increases learning potential, and the ability to participate in the wider society (Boeriswati, 2012).
The goal of higher education institutions is to produce students who meet the demands of
workforce industries that require graduates to have skills to effectively engage with information
and have the ability to creatively solve complex problems using valid and credible information
(Andrews & Patil, 2007). Employers expect their employees to be capable of problem-solving,
collaboration, written communication skills, and have critical thinking skills (CUNY, 2012).
Information literacy provides those skills. According to Salisbury et al. (2012) information
literacy should be considered as a core institutional value. Although recent research shows the
importance of information literacy, Detlor, et al., (2012) wrote that the education literature is still
reporting students as lacking proficient information literacy skills. According to Kurubacak
(2006), some professors perceive that they will encounter resistance to changing curriculum and
some professors may not want to be involved with changing the entire first year undergraduate
curriculum. Kurubacak also stated that some professors have indicated that due to large teaching
loads, advisor duties, or research activities there are time constraints to changing curriculum that
include information literacy.
Significance of Study to Leadership
President Obama declared that by 2020 America would once again have the highest
proportion of college graduates in the world (Cook & Pullaro, 2010). Graduation rates are
important outcome measures of a higher education institution’s success. However, success
through second-year persistence is necessary before getting a student to graduation. Improving
first year undergraduate curricula is important to the field because it is a main vehicle used to

11

develop and engage students. Lodge (2012) indicated that student engagement is relevant to
overall achievement and will potentially lead to persistence and graduation, which is directly
aligned with President Obama’s declaration. Higher education institutions must learn how to
effectively and innovatively engage students in better ways especially for the generation of
learners who have different mentalities and styles of learning (Kuh & Kinzie 2005; Summerlee
& Murry, 2010). First-year undergraduate experiences should incite students’ academic
mentality, challenge their style of learning, and encourage an attitude of higher learning. Higher
education institutions must become both innovative and creative in developing first year
undergraduate curricula to stimulate first-year students’ interests, curiosity, and participation on
every level.
It is expected that graduates of higher education institutions have attributes that go
beyond their knowledge in specialized course subject matter (Wong, 2010). Information literacy
applies to all disciplines of education and it is the teaching process that supports student learning.
According to Thompson (2002) regional accreditation agencies state that library instruction is
essential to higher education learning and that information literacy is a core skill set required for
an undergraduate degree. Mahaffy (2006) suggested that first year undergraduate curricula
embedded with information literacy could alleviate the frustrations many of the first year
undergraduate instructors experiences. Many first year undergraduate instructors experience
concern for students’ lack of research efforts and critical thinking skills demonstrated by their
sole reliability of Internet information. The educator’s challenge then becomes to gradually and
consistently shift the students’ reliability of Internet sources such as Google and other popular
Internet search engines and move them toward information resources provided in the institution’s
library such as journal databases and peer-reviewed articles. Journal databases and peer-

12

reviewed articles are appropriate for scholarly writing. They provide reputable and credible
evidence that strengthens, substantiates, and gives credence to the student’s stance on a particular
subject (Andrews & Patil, 2007).
Information literacy is a major focus of education and cannot necessarily be taught in one
assignment, one course, or a “one-shot” librarian presentation. Information literacy becomes
more effective when woven into the fabric of the overall course curriculum. Embedding
information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum has the potential to equip students
with the necessary skills to succeed academically, succeed in the workforce, and to personally
succeed (Mahaffy, 2006). Because academics have responsibility and oversight of their course
design they can provide practical and essential starting points for embedding information literacy
in the design of their particular courses (Salisbury, Karasmanis, Robertson, Corbin, Hulett, &
Peseta, 2012). Salisbury et al. indicated that some academics and librarians favor embedding
information literacy into course curriculum and believe that collaboration is the best practice to
achieve this. Marfleet and Dille (2005) on the other hand noted instructors who believe that
devoting time to teach on effective Internet searches is time consuming and takes away from
more substantive areas of the course. Although embedding information literacy into course
curriculum is an approach to increase student development, some have said the embedded
approach is time consuming.
However, institutions reflect a top-down approach to information literacy when it is
included in graduate capability statements as a core institutional value (Salisbury, et al., 2012).
To create learning atmospheres where students have the best possible learning experiences,
Salisbury et al. suggested that an acceptable institutional information literacy solution requires
top-down strategic initiatives implemented through bottom-up collaborations. Therefore,

13

embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum becomes relevant to
faculty and librarian collaboration. This would require a management organizational change.
Modifying first year undergraduate curriculum can potentially increase the power and authority
in and of an institution (Kurubacak, 2006).
Nature of the Study
The qualitative research method was chosen for this study as a naturalistic approach to
understanding the phenomena of interest. The qualitative method was chosen as an approach for
this research as opposed to the quantitative method in order to understand the uniqueness of the
phenomenon of interest. The qualitative method was also chosen in order to gain full and rich
descriptions and individual perspectives from the research participants (Merriam, 2009).
There were three research questions and two sub-research questions that guided this study
that asked “how and why” questions; therefore, a case study design was chosen for the study.
Yin (2009) suggested that a case study asking “how” and “why” questions is viable when there a
contribution to the body of knowledge can be made, when it does not require control of
behavioral events, and when the focus is on contemporary events. There are several design
approaches in qualitative research, including ethnography, grounded theory, and phenomenology
although this is not an exhausted qualitative design list. Neither of those designs was chosen, as
they did not support the needs of this study.
The study was conducted at four-year private university located in the Southeastern
region of the United States with a sample population or 12 participants, eight instructors and four
librarians. The study employed the purposive and snowball sampling approach, which according
to Merriam (2009) is common in qualitative research when the researcher’s intent is discovery,
understanding, and the need to gain greater insight to the phenomena of interest being

14

researched. Snowball sampling occurs when a research participant recommends another
potential candidate who fits the study’s criteria and may be able to participate in the study. The
initial recruitment process presented opportunities for snowball sampling to occur and each
research participant was chosen according to the preselected research criteria.
Triangulation of data included field notes, samples of classroom worksheets and
homework assignments, and transcripts from the tape-recorded interviews. Data were analyzed
using NVivo10 software to facilitate analyzing the interview transcripts, audio transcripts, field
notes, and to identify themes, coding, and to edit the collected data (QSR, 2014). According to
Merriam (2009) data analysis is used to identify portions of the collected data and the researcher
begins to make sense of collected data to answer the research questions, and substantiate
findings.
Research Questions
According to Yin (2009) a research design cannot be employed until an answerable
question has been formulated and he stated that some questions might arise from the initial
curiosity concerning a topic of interest. However, Yin continued, that in order to formulate a
substantially answerable question a literature review on the topic should be conducted which
helps to further research. The conducted literature review on the topics of embedding
information literacy and faculty and librarian collaboration helped to formulate three Research
Questions (RQs), and two Sub-Research Questions (SRQs) that guided this study:
RQ 1: Why is it necessary to embed information literacy into first year undergraduate
curriculum?
RQ 2: Why is collaboration between faculty and librarians important for embedding
information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum?

15

RQ 3: How does collaboration between faculty and librarians embedding information
literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum improve or impact the quality of the
curriculum?
SRQ 1: How and/or why are higher education institutions responsible for embedding
information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum?
SRQ 2: How can higher education institutions approach the problem of embedding
information literacy into the first year undergraduate curriculum in order to achieve the
greatest amount of participation and greatest success?
Conceptual Framework
According to Torres, et al., (2003) the fundamental notion of student development is that
college years are critical for students to develop their identity. Terenzini, in his 1987 annual
meeting paper, stated that there should be a conceptual understanding of how college students
achieve growth and development. Terenzini’s developmental theories describe the dimensions
of student development and the phases of individual growth dominated by levels of hierarchical
sequence. As cited by Terenzni’s (1987), Chickering’s (1969) and Perry’s (1970) theories of
development are listed as prominent. Kolb (1984) and Piaget (1952) are also among the list of
prominent researchers in this general class of student development.
Chickering’s Seven Vectors of Development describe how students establish their
identity and development during their college years and also considers the students’ emotional,
interpersonal, ethical, and intellectual aspects in the developmental process (Evans, Forney, &
Guido-DiBrito, 1988). Perry’s theory of intellectual and ethical development focuses on
students’ interpretation and meaning making of the teaching and learning process. Perry’s theory
of student development is formulated by the structures that begin simplistically with absolutes

16

and conclude with more complex forms of thinking (Evans, Forney, & Guido-DiBrito, 1988).
Kolb’s (1984) theory of student development is based on experiential learning that focuses on
learning styles, how knowledge is created through the transformation of experience, and
emphases the importance experience has had in the learning process (Evans, Forney, & GuidoDiBrito, 1988). Piaget’s (1952) theory of student development is based on constructivism based
on four stages of development: sensory motor stage (ages zero to two), preoperational stage
(ages two to seven), concrete operational stage (ages seven to eleven), and the formal operational
stage (ages eleven to adulthood) (Powell & Kalina, 2009). The formal operational stage is the
interest of this study; because that is when higher levels of thinking begin to occur.
Constructivism
The proposed study will be underpinned by the constructivist theory. This theory was
selected because according to Bealle (2010), constructivism is a well-suited vehicle for imparting
information literacy. It provides the framework to facilitate students becoming active learning
participants (McBride, 2010). McBride also stated that instructors become facilitators in helping
students locating and using new information and that constructivism facilitates student driven
learning and engagement. Information literacy requires a more complex method of thinking that
enables an individual to assimilate new information that will substantiate, adjust, or modify
existing thoughts or ideas with the newfound information (Orme, 2008). Faculty and librarian
collaboration and implementation of curricula focusing on research processes and effective
techniques for search, retrieval, and evaluation of information sources have the potential to
stimulate meaning and understanding of information literacy (Brasley, 2008; Dennick, 2012).
Constructivist learning has the potential to transform the student from a passive learner to a

17

learner who is an active participant in his or her own learning process (Concept to Classroom,
2004).
Constructivism is a theory based on how people learn and their ability to construct
understanding and knowledge through reflections of their own experiences (Concept to
Classroom, 2004). If a higher education institution takes the constructivist approach to
embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum, the institution must
take into consideration that students also have preexisting knowledge about how to retrieve
information (Orme, 2008). Salisbury et al, (2012) stated that the constructivist approach is what
will allow the student to build on his or her pre-existing knowledge of information literacy as he
or she becomes engaged with the courses learning activities. Concerned with students’
preexisting beliefs as it pertains to knowledge and learning consideration must be geared toward
the how information literacy will affect the students’ development of abilities in information
(Orme, 2008). The concept of constructivism evolves from the encounter of a new idea,
experience, or information and reconciling it with preexisting ideas and experiences. As a result
there is the possibility of modifying the preexisting ideas, experiences, or information, or a
potential to discard the new information as irrelevant (Concept to Classroom, 2004).

Assumptions
The literature concerning information literacy presented several assumptions. According
to Leedy and Ormrod (2005) assumptions in qualitative research must be validated through
conducted research otherwise the research is meaningless. There were several assumptions made
from the reviewed literature and assumptions made concerning the interview process. It was first
assumed that the sample of instructors and librarians would willingly volunteer to be
interviewed. That assumption was met when 12 research participants were successfully
recruited. The second assumption was that the participants would provide truthful and objective
answers concerning the current state of first year undergraduate curriculum in their institution.
The researcher believed each participant gave passionate and matter-of-fact responses to each of
the interview questions, which gave the perception that each participant truthfully and
objectively answered the questions. The third assumption was that the participants’ experiences

20

would be reflective of other librarians and first year undergraduate instructors. This assumption
could not be substantiated since the study consisted of one higher education institution. The
fourth assumption was that the sample of eight instructors and four librarians would be adequate
to reach saturation on the subject.
The final assumption was that the participants would give an accurate account of their
efforts to embed information literacy into course curriculum, their attempts at collaboration, and
how they believed collaboration would impact first year undergraduate curriculum. This
assumption was substantiated based on the answers given by each participant. Prior to the
study’s interview process, confidentiality and anonymity was emphasized as part of the process
of establishing a trusting environment between researcher and interviewee (Appendix D).
Limitations
This study was limited to 12 participants, four librarians whose discourse is in
information literacy and eight instructors who have experience with the first-year undergraduate
curricula. The first limitation was concerned with participant recruitment and the expectation
that 12 participants would be recruited for participation in the study. The second limitation was
also concerned with research participants and the expectation that each would provide honest and
objective responses especially concerning the reasons for collaboration or the lack of
collaboration, if such exist. However, there was no guarantee that answers would be completely
honest. An additional limitation to the study was potential investigator bias in interpreting
collected data. The researcher’s experiences with information literacy as a previous first year
undergraduate student were mitigated by insights from the literature review findings. The
researcher dismissed previous experiences for the sake of the study and concentrated on how the
research participant responses conceptualized theory and practicality rather than the researcher’s

21

individual predisposition. To reduce potential researcher bias interviews were tape-recorded and
notes were taken during the interview process. Some participants experienced time constraints,
which resulted in telephone interviews or sending and receiving the completed interviews via
email.
Delimitations
This study was delimited to a four-year private university located in the Southeastern
region of the United States. The conducted study was limited to eight instructors who teach first
year undergraduate students and four librarians who have a discourse in information literacy.
Gender was an irrelevant issue for this study. Educators who do not teach first year
undergraduate students or who have less than two years experience in teaching first year
undergraduate students were not recruited for the study. First year undergraduate students also
were not considered for the study because the focus of the study was on faculty and librarian
collaboration on embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum.
Faculty and librarians were interviewed concerning the importance of embedding information
literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum, and points concerning collaboration.
Scope of the Study
The scope of this qualitative exploratory single case study was limited to exploring
faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curricula at a four-year, private university located in the Southeastern region of
the United States. Interviews were conducted with four librarians who have a discourse in
information literacy and eight instructors who teach first year undergraduate students. Semistructured, open-ended, interview questions were asked of each participant to retrieve and reveal
his or her views, thoughts, insights, and possible concerns, if any exist, on the importance of
embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum and on faculty and
22

librarian collaboration. Asking semi-structured interviews allowed the interviewer some latitude
in framing the questions during the interview. Asking semi-structured interview questions also
allowed the interviewer to probe for additional information, clarification of responses, or to ask
additional questions based on the interviewees initial response (Shank, 2006). Information
literacy is not limited to one academic discipline or one type of higher education institution and
collaboration can be accomplished between librarians and faculty of any discipline.
Transferability of information can be accomplished and enhanced through thorough research on
embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum and the importance of
faculty and librarian collaboration. The research findings are potentially transferable to all
disciplines and all higher education institutions; however, the study is not meant to be
generalizable.
Chapter Summary
Chapter 1 includes an introduction to a specific problem, which is the need for faculty
and librarian collaboration in order to design a first year undergraduate curriculum that embeds
information literacy and meets the needs of current and future generation students’ ways of
learning. Chapter 1 further describes the significance of this research study to leadership and the
responsibility of higher education institutions to produce information literate students who meet
the demands of workforce industries and the larger society. Faculty and librarian collaboration
on embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum potentially leads to
student development, persistence, and graduation, all factors that align with President Obama’s
declaration that America will have the highest proportion of graduates by the year 2020 (Cook &
Pullaro, 2010). Chapter 1 includes the conceptual framework of the study, which discusses
students’ development of cognitive skills, critical thinking, life-long learning, and

23

constructivism. The nature of the study is described as a qualitative exploratory singe case study
to answer “how” and “why” questions of interest on the topic of embedding information literacy
into first year undergraduate curriculum and faculty and librarian collaboration. Chapter 1 also
includes the scope, limitations, delimitations, and definition of terms for the study.
Chapter 2 consists of a review of the literature with an introduction to the qualitative
exploratory single case study that seeks to provide a better understanding for the need to embed
information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum and the importance of faculty and
librarian collaboration. The literature review also seeks to provide a better understanding of how
faculty and librarian can design a first year undergraduate curriculum embedded with
information literacy that is conducive to millennium students’ way of learning. Chapter 2 also
includes title searches, articles, research documents, and journals that were researched along with
keywords used to conduct appropriate and relevant searches. In addition, Chapter 2 includes the
historical background of information literacy, information literacy and higher education, first
year undergraduate students, conceptual frameworks, embedding information literacy, and
faculty and librarian collaboration.

Chapter 2
Literature Review

The purpose of this qualitative exploratory single case study was to explore the
importance of faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into the first
year undergraduate curriculum and to consider how a first year undergraduate curriculum
embedded with information literacy supports first year undergraduate students with their
information literacy needs. The reviewed literature produced many accounts that supported the
necessity for information literacy in first year undergraduate curriculum and not just as a portion
of first year seminars, but to the entire first year undergraduate curriculum. The reviewed
literature concerning faculty and librarian collaboration also identified the necessity and
importance of collaboration to improve curricula by embedding information literacy. Although
Montiel-Oswald (2010), cited by Latham, Gross, and Witte (2013), stated that an account of
teacher/librarian collaboration is given little attention in the education literature. Embedding
information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum will cause students to actively
engage in coursework, activate student academic growth and development, incite critical
thinking, develop information literacy competencies, and provide a means for continuous
lifelong learning.
Title Searches, Articles, Research Documents, and Journals Researched
The search for pertinent information on information literacy, embedding information
literacy, higher education, first year undergraduate students and information literacy, and
conceptual frameworks related to information literacy were found through an array of document
sources. The University of Phoenix library provided access to numerous databases for
information on information literacy such as EBSCOhost, ERIC, peer-reviewed journal articles,

25

reports, ProQuest dissertations, Thomas Gale, PowerSearch, and University of Phoenix
dissertations. Internet websites were also used to research information on the topic of
information literacy. These search engines and Internet websites provided the access and
information for addressing the each of the three research questions, two sub-research questions,
and for addressing the case study design. Key words that were used in the search: academic
achievement, accreditation mandates, case study, collaboration, conceptual framework,
connectivism, constructivism, critical thinking, embedded approach, first year curriculum, first
year undergraduate students, higher education, information literacy, lifelong learning, and
student development.
Historical Background of Information Literacy
Paul G. Zurkowsik, a lawyer interested in intellectual property, copyright, and business,
first introduced the term information literacy in 1974 (Badke, 2010). Zurowski realized that
information industry companies found that once information was produced in machine-readable
form, companies were changing the fundamentals of publishing (Kelly, 2013). The
fundamentals of publishing began changing in 1974 and Zurowski believed from that time
training and education were needed to teach the public on how to fully and effectively use the
new services that were being provided. It was in 1974, a time before desktop computers, tablets,
or mobile phones (Kelly, 2013), that Zurkowski, as president of the Information Industry
Association wrote in a report to the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science
(NCLIS) that universal training on information literacy was necessary. At that time access to
services was linked to mainframe computers and required users to have a specific skillset (Kelly,
2013). In his report Zurkowski reported that information was not knowledge in itself but
concepts or ideas that are in a person’s field of perception (Badke, 2010). The information is

26

then evaluated and integrated which either reinforces or changes the person’s previous
perception and can be used as a basis for decision-making and action (Badke, 2010).
In a 1974 report presented to the NCLIS, Zurkowski appealed for a national program that
would achieve universal information literacy by 1984 (Badke, 2010). His reasoning was that
information should be harnessed to achieve goals and that there should be a system of sharing
information sources that achieves library comprehension without stealing publishing profits
(Badke, 2010). Zurkowski realized that training would be needed because most people were
lacking in these skills. Badke reported that for the most part, Zurkowski’s appeal for a national
program was ignored. Zurkowski had a broad view of information literacy, including its
relativity to every type of information need encountered by the every-day citizen. In 1990,
Zurkowski wrote, “Information directed at decisions become a part of that decision process and
contributes critical value” (p. 49). Zurkowski also posited that information literacy is not
restricted to bibliographic instruction or library orientation, and that not all information would be
found in the library (Badke, 2010). Zurkowski believed that students should be taught the value
of information and that information literacy is not about just knowing how to manipulate
database information for the purpose of completing a research assignment. Students should
know how to use information to solve problems, make informed decisions, generate new
information, and have the ability to effectively and ethically utilize information from library
databases and Internet websites (Badke, 2010). Zurowski stated that knowing how to handle
information is the essence of information literacy; knowing what information literacy is and its
importance is the first step in knowing how to handle information (Badke, 2010).

27

Information Literacy and Higher Education
Student learning and development is a major goal of every higher education institution.
Keniston (1960) believed in the importance of maximizing the student’s intellectual resources by
focusing on the individual student’s growth and development. The goal of higher education is to
develop student’s growth, transforming students into individuals who are informed, responsible
citizens, socially prepared for society, and the marketplace (Keniston, 1960). We live in an age
of information where access to information is gained quickly, rapidly changes, and more than
just knowledge (Turushevs, 2009). Living in a society that is overwhelmed with a myriad of
information sources and easy access, information literacy becomes very important (McBride,
2011-2012) to a first year undergraduate student. Information, when used effectively, is a tool to
accomplish a specific purpose (Badke, 2010).
According to Marfleet and Dille (2005) having information literacy skills is a necessity as
society is in a continual shift from an industrial economy based on production, to an economic
society based on information and services. Sellen (2002) stated that because of this societal
shifting, there is an expected higher educational response to information literacy. Sellen also
stated that information literacy is identified as one of the new core competencies of the 21st
century. Mandušić and Blašković (2013) stated that information literacy is necessary in higher
education because it is relevant to a society “where knowledge becomes the main source of labor
productivity and the first condition of success of an individual.” (p.49). Higher education
institutions in the United States have always sought after ways to prepare graduates for life and
career however, in this changing society, higher education institutions face new challenges
(Ramaley, 2014). The challenge is to create an inspiring academic environment that engages

28

millenniums, meeting their educational needs in meaningful ways that go beyond the formalities
of higher education (Ramaley, 2014).
A basic principle of higher education institutions is to develop students’ intellectual
abilities by inciting critical thinking and the ability to construct a framework for learning how to
learn (ACRL, 1996-2015). Information literacy is that construct however, information literacy’s
only focus is not in increasing students library researching skills or knowing how to retrieve
credible information from the internet; its focus is to also be used as a tool that augments lifelong
learning (McBride, 2011-2012). Higher education institutions are to provide students with
foundations for continued growth and development that enable them to sustain their academic
life, transition them into their careers, and their personal lives (ACRL, 1996-2015). Higher
education institutions spend a substantial amount of money on electronic resources, specialized
journals and databases, and other research tools for its libraries (Badke, 2008). Therefore,
students should be taught how to take advantage of the resources available to them. According
to Badke (2011), the only way for students to learn how to navigate the institutions’ library
database systems is to teach them and not give in to the dumbing down of the research process.
Badke also stated that there are many times when searching for information critical thinking and
lateral thinking is requires as sometimes there are multiple search paths that need to be followed
in order to get to the solution.
Phan, Hardesty, and Hug (2014) reported that during fiscal year 2012 academic libraries
spent a total of approximately $2.8 billion and expenditures for electronic current serial
subscription totaled about $1.4 billion. Phan, Hardesty, and Hug also noted that in fiscal year
2012 academic libraries spent approximately $123.4 million for bibliographic utilities, networks,
and consortia. Higher education institutions must find ways to challenge and enable students to

29

understand the impressive quantity of available information formats in the institution’s library
(Gibson & Jacobson, 2014). McBride (2011-2012) suggested that information literacy is not
only for students to learn how to increase library researching skills; but it is to guide the students
in becoming information literate and can then further their learning abilities as technologies
continue to increase. It is essential that students understand how to make the connections
between specific resources, processes involved in conducting research, and the ability to
communicate their findings (Thompson, 2002). Students need to have the capacity and
competence to endure the changing world of information. When students are competent in
information literacy they are able to achieve goals, develop knowledge and potential, and they
are successfully able to participate in the wider information society (Boeriswati, (2012). The
goal of higher education institutions is to produce students who meet the demands of today’s
industries. According to Salisbury et al. (2012) information literacy should be considered as a
core institutional value, and some regional accreditation agencies provide specific information
literacy standards in their mandates (Thompson, 2002).
Accreditation Mandates
Regional accreditation agencies have established mandates for higher education
institutions to implement information literacy programs and assess the resulting learning
outcomes (Thompson, 2002). Four of the six regional accreditation commissions specifically
mention information literacy in their standards:


New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) affirms that the
institution provide appropriate orientation and training for use of these resources,
as well as instruction in basic information literacy (Thompson, 2002);

30



Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) identifies information
literacy as a core learning ability and competency and institutions must clearly
articulate expectations concerning student’s learning, library use, and information
resources evidenced by the syllabi and curriculum (Thompson, 2002);



North Central Association of Schools and Colleges (NCA), in its 2001 Addendum
to the Handbook of Accreditation, explicitly mentions training in information
literacy including research techniques. It also addresses that during new student
orientation, new students are to be informed of library services and requisite skills
for accessing library resources (Thompson, 2002);



Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in their accreditation standards
characteristic of excellence state that information literacy is the understanding and
set of skills necessary to carry out the functions of effective information access
and evaluation and they note that application is an essential component of any
general education program (Thompson, 2002).

Regional accreditation agencies have established mandates for implementing information
literacy into higher education programs; this means the institution is accountable to ensure
students are learning, acquiring the competencies to function effectively after graduation
(Thompson, 2002). The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges
(SACSCOC) does not specifically state information literacy as a specific standard in their
mandate. It does, however, regard the characteristics of information literacy as important
(Brasley, 2008). The SACSCOC (2011) specifically states that “the primary responsibility for
curriculum content, quality, and effectiveness lie with the faculty” (p. 29) and that “the
institution is to provide adequate student and faculty support, access to library collections, and

31

other learning/information resources” (p. 20). This is a critical point because the research takes
place in the Southeast Region of the United States, where the SACSCOC has accreditation
authority.
Standards of Information Literacy
The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) is the professional
organization of librarians who in 2000 published the standards of information literacy in a
document outlining its five standards (Appendix E). The standards identify what information
literate students should be able to demonstrate (a) Determine the nature and extent of information
needed; (b) Access needed information effectively and efficiently; (c) Evaluate information and
its sources critically and incorporate it effectively into the student’s knowledge base and value
system; (d) Use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose; (e) Understand the
ethical, legal and socio-economic issues surrounding the use of information and access and use
information ethically and legally (ACRL, 2001; Harmony, et al., 2010; Stevens & Campbell,
2008). Each standard has performance indicators and expected student outcomes and as a whole
the standards are designed to highlight information literacy needs for students in higher
education, generate ideas for creating learning activities for students, and they also serve as an
assessment tool to measure learning outcomes (Stevens & Campbell, 2008)).
Research shows that first year undergraduate students are not proficient with the
necessary information retrieval skills identified by the ACRL Information Literacy Competency
Standards (Appendix E; Turusheva, 2009). First year undergraduate students are satisfied with
and prefer the Internet because the Internet is easy to access and does not require critical thinking
(Turusheva, 2009). However, when a student has mastered the principles of Information
Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education they are equipped with the tools that can

32

be applied throughout a lifetime (Turusheva, 2009). According to the fourth standard of the
competency standards, the student should be able to effectively use information for a specific
purpose (Appendix E; ACRL, 2001). At the advanced level of the fourth standard, the student is
aware of the breadth and depth of a research topic, having the ability to formulate a search
strategy, synthesize, and integrate information from a variety of sources (Appendix E). The
student is then able to draw appropriate conclusions, communicate those conclusions clearly to
others, and make an informed decision based on the conclusions (ACRL, 2001). Standard four
does not apply in academics only; it is a life application for lifelong learning. At some point in
everyone’s life, decisions will have to be made that require obtaining more information. It is
important to have the ability to gather information from appropriate sources, evaluate it, and
determine its credibility and value according to the need. Having this ability allows one to make
informed decisions.
First Year Undergraduate Students
As students transition from high school to their first year of college, they begin to realize
that higher education practices and expectations are far different from what they have previously
experienced (Maunder, et al., 2012). Most first year undergraduate students have very little or
no skills to operate within the parameters of information literacy, and are familiar with utilizing
the institution’s library sources. Gross and Latham (2012) stated that many students enter higher
learning institutions without achieving information literacy skills meaning they have below
proficient information literacy skills. Some students have a misconception of what they think
they can do and overestimate what they can actually do which causes students to think they do
not need any training in information searches (Gross & Latham, 2012). According to Dunne and
Sheridan (2012) some students have not had sufficient practice in retrieving information,

33

critically evaluating it, and utilizing information to develop and support writing assignments.
During Dunne and Sheridan’s study, students indicated that writing at the higher education level
is different from their previous writing practices. This is a recurring theme in the literature;
therefore, information literacy is necessary for academic success at the higher education level
and success in the 21st technological and information century (Derry, 2008).
The millennial generation of students relies on the Internet because using it is easy and
familiar. The ease and familiarity of the Internet convinces many first year students that popular
search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing (Byerley, 2004) are adequate, appropriate, and
acceptable for academic research and scholarly writing. However, some information that comes
from the Internet is non-filtered, meaning there are questions concerning its authenticity,
validity, and quality (Turusheva, 2009). Kuh and Gonyea (2015) stated that just because
information if found on the Internet does not make that information automatically valid and
reliable. The ability to think rationally about information retrieved from the Internet is crucial
because anyone can put anything on the Internet (Pachtman, 2012). Kuh and Gonyea also stated
that students must be able to critically discern the quality of information electronically retrieved
and have the ability to effectively utilize that information according to their research needs.
This does not mean that all information retrieved from the Internet is unreliable; however,
when students understand what information literacy is and how to use it they are able to decide
which websites and articles yield the most credible information (Badke, 2009). Gross and
Latham (2009; 2011) implied that when students are faced with a question they do not know,
they “Google it,” and choose the first article they find on the subject and that makes the student
seem uncaring because it does not involve critical thinking. Gross and Latham (2012) also stated
that when a student is below proficiency in information literacy skills, they tend to accept any

34

information they find. When students begin to understand and utilize information literacy they
will not accept information before evaluating it and they are better able to discern the quality of
information. Information literacy involves a continuum of learning (Boeriswati, 2012) it has to
be practiced and discernable, and utilized according to the authenticity and credibility of the
information (Badke, 2008) especially when the information retrieved from popular Internet
search engines.
Although recent review of the literature shows the importance of information literacy
learning, Detlor, et al., (2012) wrote that the education literature is still reporting students as
lacking proficient information literacy skills. Summerlee and Murray (2010) stated that the
millennial generation of students does not have the same learning mentality, learning styles, or
attitudes of the previous generation of students and first year undergraduate students are in a new
academic learning environment where information is overwhelming and plays a vital role in the
academic culture. Information is needed for most writing assignments and all information will
not come from course assigned reading materials. Yet most first year undergraduate students
have not developed adequate information seeking skills that will enable them to navigate the
institution’s library or the Internet for information that is appropriate for success at the higher
education level (Fain, 2011). In this age of advanced technology, the overwhelming amount of
available information, the speed at which information is available, and quick Internet access,
information literacy has become an issue in higher education (Horton & Keiser, 2008).
Because of the easy access to the Internet, students overestimate their capacity to retrieve
information (Marfleet & Dille, 2005) and underestimate the rigors of academic and scholarly
research (Byerly, 2004). Students believe that they have above average information literacy
skills when in reality they are below proficient in actual skills. Gross and Latham (2007)

35

conducted an initial study that compared students’ results of pre and post-test surveys asking
them to estimate their information literacy skills. Gross and Latham’s survey revealed that
students who were identified with below proficient scores believed “both before and after taking
the test that they would score as above average” (p. 575). Orme (2008) stated that higher
education institutions have to do better with how the nature of knowledge is gained.
There is some concern that recent generations of students do not have the same learning
mentality as the previous generations of students. Historically, students were subject to the
instructor as the dispenser of knowledge through lectures, and paper and pencil were the
common tools for communication (Smyth, 2011). Millenniums come to class with an arsenal of
the newest technological digital devices and yet not aware of how to use the information
available on those devices to enhance their academic learning or scholarly writing (Smyth,
2011). Leung (2010) stated that while the millennium generation has grown up with the Internet
and are impressively Internet savvy, many of them lack information literacy skills that allow
them to be critical and ethical consumers of information.
Scholarly writing and research is a common practice in higher education studies;
however, a common response among students when they hear the word ‘research’ is to become
panicked (Peters & Roybal, 2011). There are several reasons that can cause this type of panicky
response from some students: (a) they are not familiar or aware of how to use or access the
institution’s library; (b) they have a superficial knowledge of the institution’s library, they can
get it in but are unaware of how to navigate once in it (Mazella, Heidel & Ke, 2011); and (c)
some students are just intimidated by the institutional library and avoid it totally. Mazella,
Heildel, and Ke, stated that students who learn about the library’s resources and become familiar
with using it, gain confidence in using the library and searching for a major literature database.

36

This would indicate the importance for librarian presence. An assigned academic research
project is not intended to cause panic among students neither is it purposed for students to simply
collect and regurgitate information. The research process is intended for the student to collect
information, formulate his or her own perspectives, and perhaps gain or create new insight
toward a specific subject (McBride, 2011-2012). Information literacy plays an important role to
enabling students to successfully complete a research task. The Internet is an important source
of daily information; however, information literacy must be understood and used in locating,
retrieving, and effectively using that information for a specific purpose (Leung, 2010). Leung
also suggested that the need for students to have stronger information literacy skills is becoming
increasingly urgent.
McAskill (2008) opined that there is quite an emphasis and acknowledged importance for
the students’ need of information literacy. He further opined that although this is the case, many
students would never be taught how to navigate the Internet for quality information or the
subscription databases provided by their institution’s library. Students must be taught how to use
and navigate the institution’s library in order to conduct proper research (Peters & Roybal,
2011). Their capacity to use the library and their research skills will improve and increase as
they are taught and practice the steps in how to navigate the library (Peters & Roybal, 2011)).
Students will have a greater chance at becoming skilled in their academic research and
increasingly responsible for their learning as information literacy is directly implemented into the
course curriculum.
It is important for first year undergraduate students to have information literacy skills that
enable discernment of good information from information of questionable reliability.
Information literacy also allows students to critique the sources information is retrieved from,

37

especially resources retrieved from the Internet (Peters & Roybal, 2011). Competence in
information literacy benefits students by enabling them to become more aware of the value of
information that leads to better understanding, better critical thinking, and the ability to make
informed decisions (Buckingham & Willett, 2006). Competence in information literacy will also
benefit students as they enter the workforce and the process of lifelong learning.
Benefits
The role of higher education is to move students who come to the institution with a preexisting set of notions, that may be simplistic in nature, to individuals who think in a more
complex model (Orme, 2008). Thinking in a more complex mental model enables the student to
assimilate new information that either allows the student to substantiate or modify existing
thoughts with newly found information (Orme, 2008). Students who are knowledgeable with
information literacy can differentiate between primary and secondary sources of information and
can differentiate between credible and substantial information versus information that is faulty
(Decarie, 2012). When students begin searching for information they become more familiar with
the language of the specific topic they are researching and the familiar language becomes useful
in keyword searches (Decarie, 2012).
Information literacy has the potential to develop students’ cognitive skills and ignite their
critical thought processes that are necessary when considering the best information to use
(Decarie, 2012). Decarie suggested that information literacy benefits the students’ academic
world, their world of work, as well as their personal world. The desired impact for information
literacy is for students to become more self-reliant, gain the ability to manage their own learning,
and gain the ability to make wiser information retrieval choices (Boerswati, 2012; McBride,
2012). Information literacy encourages the student to reconsider course assignments not only as

38

merely a process of collecting information, but as a tool to enhance formulating his or her own
perspectives, create new perspectives, or reinforce preexisting notions (McBride, 2012).
Information literate students are able to identify key concepts from retrieved information,
determine the author’s qualifications to dispense information on a specific subject, determine the
intended audience and purpose for the information, and understand how the information is
relevant to their topic of interest (Harmony, Kumar, Refaei, & Skutar, 2010). With these
abilities in tow, students are able to make informed academic, work, or personal decisions for
applying the information to a specific need. Decarie stated, “Without this ability, we cannot
move forward” (p. 167). Information literacy is essential in intellectual development, in the
workforce, and as a platform for life-long learning (Wong, 2010).
Workforce
Industry demands skills from graduates that are beyond generic or technical in nature.
According to Andrews and Patil (2007), it is expected for graduates to be able to define, engage
with, and solve complex problems creatively, collaboratively, and responsively in rapidly
changing and global contests. Higher education graduates are also expect to contend with
changes in communication technologies, changes in types of information available, and various
media technologies brought on by the information age and the revolutionary changes
accompanying the Internet’s mass uptake (Andrews & Patil, 2007). Today’s industries require
graduates to have skills that allow them to effectively engage with information and the ability to
creatively solve complex problems using valid and credible information (Andrews & Patil,
2007). Information literacy provides those skills. And according to Salisbury et al. (2012)
information literacy should be considered as a core institutional value in higher education.

39

Currently the employment market demands employees who are information literate
according to Decarie (2012). During a workplace readiness seminar held at The City University
of New York (CUNY) where library faculty and job counselors met with employers to hear what
was expected of potential graduates they would hire (CUNY, 2012). Employers stated that they
expect their employees to have and be capable of problem-solving, collaboration, written
communication skills, and critical thinking skills (CUNY, 2012). Employers also identified that
their employees must be able to navigate, filter, summarize, and communicate information. The
common concern of 500 interviewed business decision makers was that graduates would fall
short of their expectations (CUNY, 2012). Patil (2014) stated that without information literacy
skills graduates find scarce employment opportunities. Research shows that most teachers
indicate that information literacy is a personal need for professional development (Boeriswati,
2012). The inference is that information literacy is needed in more than an academic
environment. Having information literacy skills also prepares the individual for independent
lifelong learning (Patil, 2014).
Life-long learning
Information literacy according to Boeriswati (2012) has become a major focus of higher
education. However, information literacy is not just an application of a formal educational
environment; information itself has become a major societal commodity (Boeriswati, 2012).
Information literacy is important in education as it applies to all disciplines, every learning
environment, and every level of education; it is an important component of everyday life
(Boeriswati, 2012). Individuals who are equipped with information literacy skills are people
who are prepared for lifelong learning; they will always be able to find information needed for
any task or to make any decision (ACRL, 2000). Badke (2008) implied that the core of lifelong

40

learning is the having the capacity, ability, and understanding of how to retrieve and evaluate and
use information. In life there are always decisions that must be made, some minor and some
major and one should be equipped with as much relevant information in order to make a sound,
well-informed decision. Information literacy and decision making requires knowing how to
formulate a question, where to look for information, and how to evaluate the relevancy of the
information specific to the question. McBride (2012) stated that information literacy enables an
individual to use information to formulate, substantiate, or modify an existing perspective or to
create new insights.
There are many documented reports that strongly suggest information literacy is also a
personal need for personal development (Boeriswati, 2012). In healthcare, it is important for a
person to be able to understand discharge instructions and the instructions provided for
administering medications (Davis, 2014). Davis stated that adults with low literacy levels found
it difficult to understand their medical instruction sheet. In finance, the lack of financial literacy
leaves many at a disadvantage in their day-to-day lives. This is evident by high bankruptcy rates,
little or no savings, and high consumer debt levels (Rauterkus, & Rauterkus, 2007). Information
literacy is therefore not just applicable to academics but to the process of lifelong learning.
Conceptual Theories and Theorists
The role of higher education is to transform students thinking from individuals who have
simplistic, pre-existing thoughts and notions, to individuals who think in a more complex model
(Orme, 2008). Orme suggested that this model of thinking enables the students to assimilate new
information and substantiate it, adjust it, or modify it with pre-existing information. According
to Andrews and Patil (2007), information literacy is to be treated as the backbone to developing
critical thinking; information literacy supports critical thinking. Limberg, Olof, and Sanna

41

(2012), opined that information literacy supports critical thinking and becomes more than a rote
skill, it also allows one to challenge dominant ideologies and information available through a
wide range of technologies. Information literacy has the potential to develop student’s cognitive
skills and ignite their critical thought processes that are necessary when considering the best
information to use (Decarie, 2012).
Student Development
Student development is among the priorities of higher education institution; its theories
focus on intellectual growth and behavioral changes that occur in students over the course of
their college years (Evans, et al., 1988). Student development theories originate from
investigating the changes students go through in their college years. As a result of
developmental changes students feel a more sense of self, stability, and groundedness (Torres,
Howard-Hamilton, & Cooper, 2003). According to Torres, et al., the fundamental notion of
student development is that college years are critical for students to develop their identity.
Terenzini stated in his 1987 annual meeting paper that there should be a conceptual
understanding of how college students achieve growth and development. According to Terenzini
(1987), developmental theories describe the dimensions of student development and the phases
of individual growth dominated by levels of hierarchical sequence. As cited by Terenzni,
Chickering (1969) and Perry’s (1970), theories of development are listed as prominent. Kolb
(1984) and Piaget (1952) are also among the list of prominent researchers in this general class of
student development.
Chickering’s seven vectors. Chickering’s (1969) concern was with the environmental
influences students’ face that impacted their development in higher education. He realized that
students struggled with identity development and determined that was a core development issues

42

within college students. According to Evans, et al., (1988), Chickering was responsible for the
evaluation of innovative curricula practices and the impact it had on student development.
Chickering presented seven vectors of development he identified as the core developmental issue
with college students establishment of identity. The seven vectors are: (1) developing
competence, (2) managing emotions, (3) moving through autonomy toward interdependence, (4)
developing mature interpersonal relationships, (5) establishing identity, (6) developing purpose,
and (7) developing integrity. Chickering (1969) noted that each vector builds on each, can
interact with one another, and are not necessarily sequential in operation or achievement (Evans,
et al., 1988). Developing competence, managing emotions, and establishing identity are vectors
that can interact with one another simultaneously. The ability to be able to cope with events,
successfully achieve goals, recognize, accept, and express emotions with control builds the
student’s confidence and competence. The student is able to begin establishing identity, identify
a sense of self that is stable and grounded (Torres, et al., 2003, Evans, et al., 1988) when faced
with various academic situations and institutional social encounters (Evans, et al., 1988).
Perry’s theory of intellectual and ethical development. Perry’s (1913-1988) theory of
intellectual and ethical development is a model used to help understand how college students
reach an understanding of knowledge. Perry (1913-1988) formulated a nine-position theory of
cognitive development that student’s progress through which explains the typical course of
student thought pattern development and ideas of their own “unfolding views of the world”
(Yordy, 2008; Evens, et al., 1988, p. 129). Perry’s theory provides a continuum of development
consisting of nine positions or resting points, with development taking place during transition
between the positions with each transition causing cognitive growth (Evans, et al., 1988).
Perry’s first three positions represent “Modifying of Dualism,” which is a progression from

43

students believing in absolute truths, blind obedience, and what is considered ‘right’ to be
defined by others, to recognizing the legitimacy of the unknown (Yordy, 2008). The second
three positions “The Realizing of Relativism,” describe progression from recognizing different
viewpoints and that there is no need for a hidden absolute truth to understanding that instructors
teach multiple truths (Yordy, 2008). Students also begin realizing that reading for principles and
main points, searching for saturation, stability, and understanding that their own sense of truth is
more beneficial to their learning (Yordy, 2008). The final trio of Perry’s nine-position theory of
cognitive development is “Evolving of Commitments.” In this trio of cognitive development
students progress from making initial commitments in certain areas or subjects of interest to the
ultimate commitment of searching for truth as a way of life in any area or subject (Yordy, 2008).
Kolb’s theory of experiential learning. Kolb (1984) states that learning is a central life
task and the process where knowledge is created through the transformation of experience. Kolb
developed the four-stage cycle of learning styles concrete experience, reflective observation,
abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation (Evans, et al., 1988). He respectively
called these dimensions feeling, watching, thinking, and doing. Kolb believed to be effective in
learning; students would need to exercise each of the dimensions of the learning cycle. Students
would have to be able to involve themselves in a learning experience without bias, observe their
learning experience and reflect on those experiences having multiple perspectives, formulate
concepts, integrate observations into theories, and make their theory applicable by solving
problems and decision making purposes. Learning is a central life task, but personal
development consists of three stages: acquisition, specialization, and integration (Evans, et al.,
1988).

44

Basic learning abilities and cognitive structures develop in the acquisition stage and occur
from birth to adolescence. Social, educational, and organizational socialization occur in the
specialization stage. Learning styles are developed in this stage and last throughout formal
education, career training, and the early experiences of adulthood. Integration occurs during mid
career, where emphasis on the non-dominant learning style components is expressed (Evans et
al., 1988). Kolb’s point is that development through the three stages of development is
characterized by increasing complexity and relativism and is associated with personal growth.
Piaget’s theory of constructivism. Piaget’s (1952) theory of constructivism has four
stages: sensor motor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational stage. The
formal operational stage occurs between ages eleven through adulthood (Powell & Kalina,
2009). The formal operational stage describes the period in which higher levels of thinking and
the ability to solve more complex problems occur, depicting the growth and logical thinking
(Powell & Kalina, 2009). Piaget (1952) believed that individuals achieve growth and
development through assimilation and accommodation (teAchnology, 1999-2015). Assimilation
occurs when individuals incorporate new knowledge or experiences into past knowledge.
Experiences and accommodation causes individuals to have to reinterpret new knowledge or
experiences into what was already mentally contained (teAchnology, 1999-2015).
When people produce knowledge or are introduced to new knowledge, they create their
own meaning of the information based on their personal experiences. However, assimilation and
accommodation provides individuals with an opportunity to rethink their preconceived notions
(teAchnology, 1999-2015). Piaget (1952) believed that education and the dissemination of
knowledge is an exchange and dependent on transmission and transformation (Palmer, 2001).
Piaget also believed that knowledge had to be transmitted in a way that lowers barriers and

45

increases opportunities for learning in order for development to occur (Palmer, 2001). Piaget
claimed that development would be difficult without the dissemination of knowledge and that
disseminated knowledge allows the creation of new knowledge (Palmer, 2001).
Freire’s Banking Concept of Education. Freire’s (1993) Pedagogy of the Oppressed,
presents a brilliantly morbid description of a teaching method that is oppressive and gives it the
analogy of a banking system. The term “banking concept of education” describes education as a
narrative; the teacher is all knowing and the student is lack and void of knowledge; the instructor
is the depositor and the students are the depositories (Freire, 1993). The banking concept of
education operates with the notion that students are empty minded and only available to receive
the deposits of the instructor. Freire stated that the banking concept of education is “the scope of
action allowed to the students extends only as far as receiving, filing, and storing the deposits”
(p. 72). This would imply that the only course of action in the classroom is to listen to the
lecture, take notes, and memorize the information until it is time to regurgitate the information
on an exam. The more students operate in this fashion, the less their capacity to develop any
critical thinking skills (Freire, 1993). Freire further stated that the banking concept of education
tremendously reduces creativity and critical thinking; it cannot promote development within the
student. There is no exchange of ideas, no creativeness, no sparking of curiosity. The banking
concept of education does not invite students to think in a more complex model at a higher level.
According to Smith (2014), Freire considered learning as social, reciprocal, and
interactive in nature. Freire (1993) stated that knowledge is continuous and emerges through
invention, reinvention, and the constant curiosity and question of inquiring minds. Information
literacy challenges the student to think critically, by considering and dissecting the material
being learned (Heiman, 1985). The banking concept of education Freire writes about is

46

diametrically opposed to his own situations on education and on the concept of information
literacy. Information literacy challenges the student to retrieve information that is reliable,
credible, and not accepting imposed or deposited information at face value. Freire believed that
education should be liberating, transformational, incite critical thinking and creativity, and
participatory in a process that encourages growth and development in both the students and
instructors. There are more student development theories in the literature and they all seem to
imply the common theme that student development is progressive. Development progressively
increases intellectual development by way of increasing understanding, learning abilities,
developing competence, increasing reasoning abilities, and critical thinking skills.
Critical Thinking
According to Lau and Chan (2004-2015), having the ability to think rationally, clearly,
and engage in reflective, independent thinking is critical thinking. Critical thinkers can
understand logical connections between ideas, identify the relevancy and importance of ideas,
seek applicable sources of information, and systematically solve problems (Lau & Chan, 20042015). Vejar (2014), stated that critical thinking is deductive thinking, and described as a mental
process where a person has an inner dialogue processing what is being learned, rather than
passively or blindly receiving information. Critical thinking begins with a solid understanding of
information because one is not able to think critically about something on which they have no
knowledge. Vejar also suggested that course curriculum should include activities that encourage
critical thinking and that writing assignments elicit more critical thinking skills. When students
use critical thinking skills they are able to effectively analyze the document or information they
are reading, ask questions of the information, and check the information for accuracy and
relevance in order to substantiate their justification for agreeing with or using the information

47

(Vejar, 2014). The skills necessary to deploy critical thinking skills are very similar to the skills
needed to deploy information literacy (Wong, 2010).
According to Blake, et al., (2003), information literacy is a cognitive skill that involves
critical thinking; having the ability to skillfully analyze, assess, and reconstruct information in a
manner that is reasonable and meets relative standards of acceptability. Information literacy
requires the ability to determine type of needed information, assessment and evaluation of
information, and effectively incorporating the information to achieve a specific purpose
(Boeriswati, 2012). The student becomes increasingly able to master content when using
information literacy skills to further his or her investigational needs and become more selfdirected (Boeriswati, 2012). Students begin advancing to a higher level of intellectual and
personal development through information literacy and critical thinking skills (Vejar, 2014;
Wong, 2010). Both critical thinking and information literacy require an understanding of
information. Critical thinking and information literacy are also both relevant to all disciplines of
education and can be effectively taught within the context of a specific subject area (Boeriswati,
2012). Information literacy facilitates a more efficient way to navigate the information world
and higher order of thinking and higher order thinking facilitates the students’ intellectual growth
and personal growth and development (Vejar, 2014; Wong, 2010).
Connectivism
According to Carreño (2014) connectivism is the integration of principles and the
connections that allow us to learn; those principles are explored by chaos, networks, complexity
and self-organization theories focused on connecting specialized information sets. Connection is
when two or more entities are brought together for the purpose of providing access and
communication in order for a real or notional link can be established (Merriam-Webster, n.d.).

48

Connecting is the concept of networking and networks, generally small and populated with
people who have the same interests, information, and knowledge, according to Carreño (2014).
The concept of networking and networks is important to note because according to Del Carreño
learning is an external process that focuses on core elements, and not entirely under the
individual control.
Just as people connect with people to form social networks, connectivism considers the
principle of complex networks in order to redefine the process of learning (Moral, Cernea, &
Villalustre, 2013). The networks are referred to as “nodes” which are anything that can be
connected to something or someone else such as people, organizations, databases, computer
networks, and the Internet creating integrated sets and increases the network complexity (Del
Carreño 2014). Learning occurs in the haze of a shifting of core elements in the environment
and usually not under complete control of the individual, so it is the connections that enable one
to learn more than one’s current state of knowing (Del Carreño, 2014). According to Del
Carreño, the difference between constructivism and connectivism is that in constructivism is that
learners learn by understanding meaning making tasks, while connectivism understands that
everything is connected to everything.
One of the principles of connectivism is the integration of networks when it becomes
advantageous to consider the source of information acquired (Del Carreño, 2014). Not all
connections are of equal strength and not all information contains the value or credibility needed
for a specific situation. Connections not being equal in strength are very similar to the concept
of information literacy and having the ability to assess the credibility, reliability, and value of
information retrieved. Del Carreño stated that when information is abundant one should have the
ability to quickly evaluate the value and importance of the retrieved information, especially

49

considering how quickly information evolves. Del Carreño further stated, nodes acquire better
profiles when recognition is gained by their expertise and are more successful acquiring
additional connections.
When students understand how to navigate and utilize the institution’s library they will
potentially understand that the sources of information are provided by experts in specific fields
of study and more connections will be made to the institution’s library. The premise, according
to Del Carreño (2014) is that connectivism understands that everything is connected to
everything, in that case, first year undergraduate curriculum should connect writing assignments
to the institution’s library, that will in turn connect first year undergraduate students to the
resources needed for their research, which is connected to greater learning, student engagement,
development, learning, and success. Connectivism is different from constructivism as its main
foci are networks and community, whereas the main focus of constructivism is on knowledge,
experience, and integrating new knowledge with preexisting knowledge.
Constructivism
Constructivism is a theory based on how people learn and their ability to construct
understanding and knowledge through the reflection of their own experiences (Concept to
Classroom, 2004). Hein (1991) explained constructivism is learning that consists of an
individual’s own perception of meaning. Dennick (2012) provided a clearer explanation of what
constructivism is “The constructivist view of learning is concerned with how learners construct
an understanding of the world” and “meaning and understanding are built up in a process that
depends on the existing knowledge foundations and cognitive operations of each individual and
the learning activities they engage in.” (p. 618). The concept of constructivism evolves from the
encounter of a new idea, experience, or information, reconciling it with preexisting ideas and

50

experiences with the possibility of modifying the preexisting ideas, experiences, or information,
or potentially discarding the new information as irrelevant (Concept to Classroom, 2004). In
Zurkowski’s 1974 report to the NCLIS he stated that information was not knowledge but
concepts or ideas that are in a person’s field of perception (Badke, 2010, p. 48). The information
is then evaluated and integrated which either reinforces or changes the person’s previous
perception and can be used as a basis for decision-making and action (Badke, 2010).
Hein (1991) stated in one of his principles of constructivist thinking that an individual has
to already have knowledge in order to learn new knowledge. Hein’s theory is that the more one
knows the more one can learn and assimilate new knowledge to pre-existing knowledge. Hein
suggested that in their teaching roles, educators need to consider these nine principles of
constructivist thinking: (a) learning is an active process; (b) people learn as they learn; (c)
constructing meaning is mental; (d) learning involves language; (e) learning is a social activity;
(f) learning is contextual; (g) one needs knowledge to learn; (h) it takes time to learn; and (i)
motivation is a key component in learning. Hein expounded on these principles, eight of which
seem recurring in theme, that learning is engaging, interactive, and mental. The principle not
included in the recurring theme is the eighth principle, but is just as important to remember, that
learning is not immediate and it takes time to learn.
Hein (1991) suggested that for significant learning to take place learning must be
practiced and ideas need to be revisited, processed, manipulated, and used. Badke (2008) stated
a similar concern about information literacy, stating that it cannot be effectively learned in a oneshot type of seminar or librarian visit, but it must be embedded into curriculum to be practiced on
a continuous basis. Bealle (2010) stated that constructivism is a well-suited vehicle for
imparting information literacy. Constructivism provides the framework to facilitate students

51

becoming active learning participants. It also has the potential to transform students from
passive learners to learners who are active participants in their learning process (Concept to
Classroom, 2004; McBride, 2010).
Embedding Information Literacy Into First Year Curriculum
The Association of American Colleges & Universities “affirms that all students must
have multiple opportunities, over time, to practice excellence, integrity, and responsibility to self
and others as part of their basic responsibilities as learners (Dey, 2010, p. viii).” Higher
education institutions must undertake the challenge of the information age and restructure
curricula to help students become information literate through active learning (Mandušić &
Blašković, 2013). Designing course curriculum that embeds information literacy has the
potential to facilitate student intellectual development, enhance critical thinking, and prepares
students for society and the marketplace (Evans, et al., 1998). Higher education institutions
should focus on revising existing first year undergraduate curriculum to promote and embed
information literacy in a manner that meets the needs of millennium students (Mandušić &
Blašković; 2013; Dey, et al., 2010). Wilkes, Godwin, and Gurney (2015) stated that students
could see the need for information literacy skills when they are embedding early in the course
discipline. Wilkes, Godwin, and Gurney also stated that students have the opportunity to apply
their information literacy skills in a more meaningful way, thus become more active and engaged
in their learning. Jarson (2010) believed developing this type of curriculum could be achieved
whether information literacy is expressly outlined in the curriculum or not. However, Pritchard
(2010) stated that the curricula must support the development of information literacy.
Information literacy should be embedded in first year undergraduate curriculum because
it is too much information for a one-time course or one-shot class visit from the librarian. It

52

should also be taught in substantial portions of the existing curriculum (Badke 2008). Detmering
and Johnson (2011) also stated that a one-time lesson is not adequate for sustained inquiry and
constructive learning. There are times when the librarian only has one opportunity to cover a
wide range of topics and one hour is not enough time to adequately do so (Thompson, 2002).
Librarians have a limited amount of time during the one time sessions so they are focused on
having students concentrate on the nature of research within a subject specific context while
developing critical thinking through learning activities (Detmering & Johnson, 2011). Since one
of the principles of information literacy is to be able to evaluate sources of information,
Detmering and Johnson suggested that students should know how to think critically and
understand why they would choose one article of research as opposed to another. Detmering and
Johnson’s suggestion agrees with the information literacy principle of being able to evaluate
sources of information. There has to be an understanding on the best way to approach teaching
information literacy in the 21st century (McBride, 2011-2012).
Mednick (2002) stated that the best way to embed information literacy into curriculum is
to start from the top down indicating that high-level administrators need to be aware of the
imminence of implementing information literacy into curriculum. Salisbury et al., (2012) also
suggested that an acceptable institutional information literacy solution requires top-down
strategic initiatives implemented through bottom-up collaborations. Salisbury et al. also
suggested that this is necessary to create learning atmospheres where students have the best
possible learning experiences. Therefore, embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum becomes relevant to the management of organizational change.
Embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curricula familiarizes students with
the institution’s library where on-line research databases are available (Marfleet & Dille, 2010).

53

Information literacy is not discipline specific and it applies to all disciplines at all levels
(Boeriswati, 2012). Marfleet and Dille’s (2010) research concluded with several findings
concerning information literacy. One of their findings concluded that information literacy is
content neutral and that it can be developed throughout the entire college curriculum. Another
conclusion of Marfleet and Dille’s (2010) research was that information literacy skills
accumulate as students’ progress through their academic studies. This aligned with Boeriswati’s
(2012) statement that information literacy involves a continuum of learning, is not specific to any
one discipline, and is necessary at all levels. Kurubacak (2006) stated that awareness and
understanding the current major social, political, economical, and cultural environment is
relevant to reformulating higher education’s curricula.
Course curriculum is one tool that can be used to maximize student resources such as
intellectual growth and development; the curriculum provides the student with the objectives and
parameters for the course’s learning content (Juste & Lòpez, 2010). The curriculum should
cause students to increasingly master more complicated developmental tasks, realize selfdirection, and become interdependent (Evans, Forney, & Guido-DiBrito, 1988). Students should
be able to assess their information needs through course curriculum and information literacy is
the tool to assist students with identifying their informational needs (Wong, 2010). Course
curricula should be considered as integral and as the blueprint for the student to follow in order
to succeed. When information literacy is embedded into course curriculum it helps students
learn how to learn and will potentially facilitate a better quality of student research (Stevens &
Campbell, 2008). It is therefore necessary to design first year undergraduate curriculum in a
manner that enhances information literacy, boosts academic performance, and builds the
student’s confidence in achieving his or her desired goals (Juste & Lòpez, 2010).

54

Decarie (2012) stated that many researchers support embedding information literacy into
course curriculum and that information literacy should be incorporated into a program of study’s
entire curriculum. Designing course curricula that embeds information literacy has the potential
to facilitate student intellectual development, enhance critical thinking, prepare students for
society, and the marketplace (Evans, et al., 1998). Ultimately, embedding information literacy
into first year undergraduate curriculum potentially means total revision to current course
curricula designs (Taib & Holden, 2013). Piaget (1952) believed that curricula had to go beyond
the traditional approach and challenge students to become critical thinkers (teAchnology, 19992015).
Information literacy in first year undergraduate curriculum introduces students to new
information catalogues and research database resources that are meaningful to their research
needs and potentially increases successful student outcomes (Salisbury, et al., 2012). Knowing
where to find credible resources for scholarly writing assignments enable students to present and
substantiate information supported by reputable sources of evidence (Andrews & Patil, 2007).
Information literacy is not remedial education. According to Badke (2009) it is foundational,
necessary, and should be embedded as an integral component of first year undergraduate
curricula. Salisbury et al. stated that when information literacy is embedded in course
curriculum and designed to align with the intended subject of learning, students are clear on what
they need to learn. The curriculum becomes the blueprint for the student to follow for success
and should express student expectations in certain and unambiguous terms (Marfleet & Dille,
2005).
Providing the student with a grading rubric (Appendix F) for a research report gives the
student a breakdown of the criteria and point value of what is required for a specific assignment.

55

The rubric should clearly express what is expected of the student. The rubric should state what is
required for the introduction, information gathering, grammar, conclusion, and breakdown the
points for how well the student reached each of the criteria. It is important for higher education
institutions to provide opportunities for students to increase their readiness and capabilities to use
scholarly information. Developing their information literacy skills in the context of a discipline
provides students with those opportunities (Salisbury, et al., 2012). Embedding the five
information literacy competency standards for higher education (Appendix E) into first year
undergraduate curriculum requires a critical rethinking and reevaluation of the pedagogy of an
entire course (Marfleet & Dille, 2005).
Reevaluation of first year undergraduate curriculum can be achieved through the
transformation of substantial portions of existing courses’ written assignments that include
information literacy dimensions (Marfleet &Dille, 2005). Information literacy is learned through
instruction and by doing (Badke, 2008). A well-organized course syllabus clarifying and
explaining what is expected of students has the potential to create a positive classroom
environment and promotes active and participative student engagement (Juste & López, 2010).
Providing students with activities and assignments that allow for familiarization with the
institution’s library and online research databases provides students with the necessary
opportunities and tools to perform effective searches (Marfleet & Dille, 2005). Engaging
students in activities require them to retrieve and evaluate information to complete a required
writing assignment fosters information literacy (Marfleet & Dille, 2005).
Global Issue
According to Boerswati (2012) embedding information literacy into course curriculum is
not just an American concern; it is a global issue and concern for many countries. Boerswati

56

discussed Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa. Boerswati stated that the Japanese
government had made changes to its curriculum by embedding information literacy into it. The
new Japanese policy declares that information literacy is fundamental and necessary for students
to engage in an advanced information society. In New Zealand, since 1993, information literacy
has been included in their national curriculum considering information literacy a foundational
development in the community. In Singapore’s Department of Education and South Africa’s
Center for Educational Technology and Distance Education both find information literacy as
foundational to the education process. Both Singapore and South Africa have developed policies
to embed information literacy into curriculum. South Africa’s policy supports embedding
information literacy into all classes and in all subject areas.
Faculty and Librarian Collaboration
In higher education institutions there has been an increase in faculty accountability and
institutional accountability creating an emphasis for faculty and librarian collaboration.
According to Latham, Gross, and Witte (2013) faculty and institutional accountability becomes
an important issue since there has been focused emphasis on student learning outcomes and
student performance. Latham, Gross, and Witte further suggested that developing collaborative
partnerships between teachers and librarians is a means to address educational and regional
mandates. Through the collaborative process, faculty and librarians have the potential to design
a curriculum that embeds information literacy that will provide students with progressive and
perpetual standards that cause them to think more critical about information, think about the
process of locating information, and conceptualizing research in a broader sense (Detmering &
Johnson, 2011). Information literacy requires a more complex method of thinking that enables

57

individuals to assimilate new information that will substantiate, adjust, or modify existing
thoughts or ideas with the newly found information (Orme, 2008).
It is important that faculty and librarians agree on the learning outcomes for information
literacy when planning the curriculum (Brasley, 2008). Kenedy and Monty (2011) stated that
when the faculty member defines the assignment(s) librarians could design the resources needed
for the research process and enable improved student performance. According to Decarie (2012)
information literacy should be embedded into course curriculum as well as the entire program of
study. Students who are information literate are able to differentiate between primary and
secondary sources of information, have a better understanding of information that is credible and
valuable for their academic purposes. With information literacy students will also be able to
identify inaccurate, fallacious, or flawed information (Decarie, 2012). When students begin
searching for information they become more familiar with the language of the specific topic they
are researching which is useful for keyword searches (Decarie, 2012). Constructivist thinking
implies that learning is active and becoming familiar with specific topic language is active
learning because it involves language that is contextual. According to Hein (1991) language and
learning is entwined.
Faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy requires an
extremely high level of commitment for the responsibility of ensuring that students acquire
information competencies through interaction, communication, and planning (Thompson, 2002;
Harmony, et al., 2010). The primary focus and importance for faculty and librarian collaboration
is to embed information literacy into undergraduate curriculum that will equip students for skills
that apply in the classroom, the workforce, their personal life, and have the ability to function in
a technologically oriented society (Harmony, et al., 2010). Information literacy has the ability to

58

provide students with new knowledge allowing the student to produce his or her own new
knowledge through assimilation and accommodation, which are two key components of
constructivism (teAchnology, 1999-2015). Assimilation introduces new information to what is
already known in the student’s personal system of thinking, and when students begin to process
the new information to make it fit into their personal system of thinking, accommodation occurs
(Powel & Kalina, 2009). First year undergraduate curriculum should be embedded with
activities, materials, and situations that foster information literacy and the discovery of new
learning (teAchnology, 1999-2015).
Faculty and librarian collaboration is a practical and logical partnership for oversight and
responsibility for curriculum design of individual subjects (Salisbury et al., 2012). Each group
of professionals has expertise in his or her area of concentration and can benefit his or her peers
or colleagues in solving the common problems and frustrations of students who are below
proficient information literacy skills and library ineptitude. However, this type of collaboration
can be time consuming and requires a high level of coordination, communication, and
preparation (Mazella, Heidel, & Ke, 2011). Most researchers believe that faculty and librarian
collaboration is necessary, and that librarians should be included in the curriculum development
process for the purpose of embedding information literacy (DaCosta, 2010).
Although librarians are often encouraged to be proactive and initiate collaborative
opportunities to get involved with curriculum design, there are few examples in the literature that
demonstrate how successful collaboration between faculty and librarians are actually initiated,
developed, and sustained (Machin, Harding, & Derbyshire, 2009). Kenedy and Monty (2011)
stated that literature on faculty and librarian collaboration is limited, as are data on faculty and
librarian partnerships in the collaboration process. According to Latham, Gross, and Witte

59

(2013) the education literature contains reports of studies on teacher-to-teacher collaboration;
however, teacher-librarian collaboration has not received as much attention and that “widespread
success in achieving teacher-librarian collaboration has been limited as best” (p. 3).
Regional accreditation agencies have established mandates for implementing information
literacy into higher education programs. Higher education institutions are accountable to ensure
students are learning and acquiring information literacy competencies to function effectively
after graduation (Thompson, 2002). The Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges (1999)
stated in their education effectiveness section that faculty and library partnerships ensure that
library and information resources are integrated into the learning process (Thompson, 2002).
The Middle States Commission on Higher Education require institutions to show evidence
concerning collaboration between faculty and librarians in fostering relevant information literacy
into curriculum (Thompson, 2002). Accreditation agency mandates on higher educational
programs imply the importance of faculty and librarian collaboration and embedding information
literacy into the design of the first year undergraduate curriculum.
It is also important to remember that information literacy is not course specific, so it able
to span across all educational disciplines. Eland (2003) stated “information literacy infused
across the entire curriculum should be our long-term goal, but it will only be possible if
academic librarians develop then push information literacy instruction outward to the rest of the
curriculum” (D’Angelo & Maid, 2004, p. 212). The accreditation associations’ mandates should
remind faculty and librarians to understand that partnerships are necessary to open professional
and academic dialogue for developing first year undergraduate curriculum to embed information
literacy for the development of student’s research and learning skills across a range of contexts
(Taib & Holden, 2013). Embedding information literacy into undergraduate curriculum provides

60

the student with a holistic view of the research process and allows the student the ability to
differentiate between types and sources of relevant information (Mazell, Heidel, & Ke, 2011;
Knight, 2006). Knowing how to navigate and access the Internet to obtain information does not
necessarily mean one is skilled in research literacy information literacy skills are necessary for
that (Campbell, 2010). Campbell suggested that students need to understand that Internet
websites ending in .org, .edu, or .gov, are resources that have been vetted and in most cases peer
reviewed, making them a more reliable and trustworthy source than the Wiki sites, or other
Internet websites. Campbell further suggested that while faculty may struggle on how to
incorporate information literacy into course curriculum, librarians can offer a great deal of
assistance in that area. Librarians have a unique role in education, they are considered
information specialists in the current digital society and their expertise should be utilized
accordingly (Mednick, 2002). Wilkes, Godwin, and Gurney (2015) stated that librarians have
found the best way to teach information literacy is through embedding relevant information
literacy activities in the discipline of study as opposed to teaching generic information literacy
skills in library orientation workshops.
Collaboration between faculty and librarians can foster an environment toward shared
concerns and agreement of key factors, values, and operational language necessary within the
parameters of designing course curriculum to include information literacy (Machin, Harding, &
Derbyshire, 2009). Collaboration between faculty and librarians appear to be an obvious answer
and a practical necessity to the frustrations both groups of professionals feel with students’
inability to incorporate information literacy into research projects and their lack of sufficient
library skills (Harmony, et al. 2010). We are in an information revolution, suggested Peters and
Roybal (2011) and with as much information available in the literature concerning the

61

importance of information literacy and it being embedded into first year undergraduate
curriculum, why is there so much resistance to the collaboration process?
There is a gap in the research or at least limited literature on successful higher education
faculty and librarian collaboration. Both groups of professionals throughout the literature agree
that collaboration is necessary to refine teaching approaches that guide students away from the
popular unreliable Internet information sources. Both faculty and librarians also would prefer
students to utilize the more reliable and specialized resources available through the institution’s
library. Both groups of professionals agree throughout the literature that embedding information
literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum is important. It has been by noted Brasley
(2008), that most accrediting agencies either explicitly or implicitly document collaboration
between faculty and librarians as a factor for furthering information literacy.
Similar Research Studies
Latham, Gross, and Witte (2013) discussed the results of a qualitative explanatory case
study in which members of library and information science (LIS) faculty and education faculty
were asked their views on several subjects including information literacy and teacher-librarian
collaboration. The study’s findings indicated that while both education faculty and LIS faculty
have overlapping concerns and acknowledge the importance and desirability for collaboration, it
is difficult to achieve. Latham, Gross, and Witte stated that collaboration is an important concept
as the emphasis on student learning outcomes and student performances are increasing.
Developing collaborative partnerships between faculty and librarians would be a means to
address the regional educational mandates. Latham, Gross, and Witte stated that the education
literature reports on studies on teacher-to-teacher collaboration; however, teacher and librarian
collaboration received considerably less attention in the education literature. Latham, Gross, and

62

Witte further stated that teacher and librarian collaboration is reported in LIS literature; however,
“widespread success in achieving teacher and librarian collaboration has been limited at best” (p.
3). Latham, Gross, and Witte’s 2012 study participants were pre-service school librarians and
teachers; this proposed study will employ established instructors with at least two years teaching
first year undergraduate curriculum and librarians with a discourse in information literacy. The
similarities of Latham, Gross, and Witte’s 2012 study mentioned information literacy and the
importance of faculty and librarian collaboration as two 21st century skills; this proposed study is
also concerned with the importance of faculty and librarian collaboration and information
literacy.
Montiel-Overall (2010) discussed a qualitative single case study that analyzed the
phenomenon of collaboration with faculty and librarians to better understand the process of
collaboration. The participants for Montiel-Overall’s study were six elementary school teachers
and six elementary school librarians. The problem, according to Montiel-Overall was that there
was almost no information available about faculty awareness of librarians as collaborative
partners or librarian potential in developing and implementing curriculum. Montiel-Overall
stated that a clear understanding about how and why faculty and librarians should collaborate is
critical for collaboration success. The literature according to Montiel-Overall indicated the
importance for collaboration as improving student academic success. The findings of the case
study reported by Montiel-Overall indicated that there were initial misconceptions and confusion
concerning collaboration; however, there were categories identified as integral components of
collaboration such as common goals, relationship building, and creating joint outcomes. A key
finding reported by Montiel-Overall was that considerable effort would have to be made for

63

understanding the importance for faculty and librarian collaboration and how library instruction
affects student learning.
Montiel-Overall (2010) concluded that on a broad-spectrum faculty still have a
misunderstanding of the potential role librarians can have as collaborators and that the process of
collaboration may be unfamiliar to them. Montiel-Overall also concluded, “Since 21st century
school library professionals envision collaboration as a means to an end in improving student
academic achievement, it is essential that the phenomenon of teacher and librarian collaboration
be fully understood” (p. 49). The Montiel-Overall study employed elementary school teachers
and librarians; this proposed study intends to employ instructors and librarians at the higher
education level. The purpose of Montiel-Overall’s study was to further understand the process
of teacher and librarian collaboration and evaluation of the collaborative process. The purpose
of this proposed qualitative exploratory single case study was to explore why embedding
information literacy in first year undergraduate curriculum is important, the importance of
faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum, and to consider how a first year undergraduate curriculum embedded
with information literacy supports first year undergraduate students with their information
literacy needs.
Barriers to Collaboration
Faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum can be effective in combining a variety of disciplinary approaches. It
is necessary to achieve the common goal of students acquiring essential skills in order to sustain
a complex process that connects their reading, research, and writing (Manzella, Heidel, & Ke,
2011). So what is holding back the collaboration process? According to D’Angelo and Maid

64

(2004) librarians have limited influence in changing curricula because the culture of faculty is
that they are in control and are resistant to change. Brasley (2008) stated that librarians rarely
have the opportunity to participate in the curricula process. Because curriculum development is
faculty driven, librarians are seldom in a position of strength when dealing with faculty; leaving
librarians with the feeling of a constant power struggle to collaborate in embedding information
literacy to the curriculum (D’Angelo & Maid, 2004).
According to Kurubacak (2006) some professors have time constraints due to large
teaching loads, advisor duties, or research activities. Some professors perceive that they will
encounter resistance to changing curriculum and some may not want to be involved with
changing the entire first year undergraduate curriculum (Mazella, Heidel, & Ke, 2011;
Kurubacak, 2006). Kurubacak also suggested that others resist changing curriculum because of
anticipated resistance at the difficulty of faculty initiated curriculum redesign, and sometime
communication becomes difficult across disciplinary lines. Machin, Harding, and Derbyshire
(2009) wrote that there was evidence suggesting cultural differences may be the dividing factor
between faculty and librarians efforts to collaborate.
According to Machin, Harding and Derbyshire (2009) some higher education institutions
do not consider librarians as academic equals justifying their assumptions on the basis that
librarians do not have published works and lack teaching qualifications. Mazella, Heidel, and Ke
(2011) stated that some of the difficulties come as a result of the way an institution is organized
making it difficult for individuals to combine their efforts. As a result of this difficulty Mazell,
Heidel, and Ke also stated that regardless of shared concerns; departments and instructors from
different units remain isolated making it difficult for partnerships to be formed and efforts
combined. Collaboration requires a higher degree of coordination, is time consuming because it

65

requires more preparation and communication, and it requires an extra measure of imagination to
accomplish (Mazella, Heidel, & Ke, 2011).
Overcoming Barriers to Collaboration
Barriers to faculty and librarian collaboration in the effort to create a first year
undergraduate curriculum that includes information literacy can be overcome. Commitment to
student-centered learning, student development and achievement, and institutional integrity
should be the motivation to fully support collaboration and “fully break through the silo mindset
enforced by institutional and disciplinary thinking (Mazella, Heidel, & Ke, 2011, p. 49). When
faculty and librarians intentionally establish relationships they can create an environment and
atmosphere for embedding information literacy into undergraduate curriculum (Pritchard, 2010).
Salisbury, et al. (2012) stated that ‘breaking the ice’ concerning implementation conversations
can be initiated by faculty and librarians to discuss embedding information literacy with regards
to subject content and learning activities. The main focus should be on advancing studentlearning outcomes (Kenedy & Monty, 2011). Thompson (2002) stated that faculty and librarian
collaboration could start with simple networking, shared ides, and thoughts on problem solving.
However, Thompson further stated that creating a faculty and librarian relationship not as simple
as initiating a conversation. According to Thompson the collaboration process requires careful
cultivation of the collegiate relationship, clear communication, consistent conversation, curricula
commitment, mutual availability, and mutual involvement.
Mazella, Heidel, and Ke (2011) stated that commitment to student-centered learning
should be a driving force to explore the necessary expertise of what is needed to meet the
specific demands of the course and student expectations. The primary goal is the needs of the
students and their academic success. As a result of the 1989 ALA Presidential Committee on

66

Information Literacy’s final report, on page 10, there was a rallying call for instruction librarians
on the subject of information literacy and that call is still relevant many years later:
This call for more attention to information literacy comes at a time when many other
learning deficiencies are being expressed by educators, business leaders, and
parents….Because we have been hit by a tidal wave of information, what used to suffice
as literacy no longer suffices; what used to count as effective knowledge no longer meets
our needs; what used to pass as good education no longer is adequate (Thompson, 2002,
p. 223).
Conclusion
As students transition from high school to their first year of college, they begin to realize
that higher education academic practices and expectations are far different than what they have
previously experienced (Maunder, et al., 2012). Students do not usually come to college with
knowledge of information literacy and they have to be taught accordingly (Gross & Latham,
2012). Information literacy opens a new world of understanding for students and what is
expected in his or her new academic environment. The millennial generation of students relies
on the Internet for their information needs and some of the sources are not acceptable for
academic research (Byerley, 2004; Turusheva, 2009).
The reviewed literature has substantiated the need for this qualitative exploratory single
case study on why embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum is
important, the importance of faculty and librarian collaboration, and to consider how a first year
undergraduate curriculum embedded with information literacy supports first year undergraduate
students with their information literacy needs. Embedding information literacy into
undergraduate curriculum has the potential to provide the student with a holistic view of the

67

research process and allows him or her the ability to differentiate between types and sources of
relevant information (Knight, 2006; Mazell, Heidel, & Ke, 2011). Through the collaborative
process faculty and librarians have the potential to design a curriculum that embeds information
literacy providing students with progressive and perpetual standards that cause them to think
more critically about information, think about the process of locating information, and to
conceptualize research in a broader sense (Detmering & Johnson, 2011).
Similar research studies reported the importance for faculty and librarian collaboration
and that there is an abundance of teacher-to-teacher collaboration in the education literature.
However, according to Latham, Gross, and Witte (20120 and Montiel-Overall (2010) teacher and
librarian collaboration received considerably less attention in the education literature. Latham,
Gross, and Witte stated, “Widespread success in achieving teacher and librarian collaboration
has been limited at best” (p.3). Similar research studies also reported that the collaboration
process was more common among elementary school librarians and teachers and pre-service
school librarians and pre-service teachers. This qualitative exploratory single case study
explored faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum on the higher education level through interviews conducted with
faculty members and librarians.
Faculty and librarians have the potential to design a quality first year undergraduate
curriculum that embeds information literacy. A first year undergraduate curriculum embedded
with information literacy potentially provides students with progressive and perpetual standards
that would cause them to think more critically about information, think about the process of
locating information, and to conceptualize research in a broader sense (Detmering & Johnson,
2011). Faculty and librarian collaboration is an important issue as Latham, Gross, and Witte,

68

(2013) indicated that there is an increased emphasis on student learning outcomes, student
performance, an increase in teacher accountability, and an increase of institutional
accountability. Developing collaborative partnerships between teachers and librarians is also a
means to address educational and regional mandates (Latham, Gross, & Witte, 2013).
Chapter Summary
The reviewed literature reflected on the importance of information literacy, its
importance to higher education, and the first year undergraduate student. The reviewed literature
was also a reflection on the importance of faculty and librarian collaboration for the purpose of
embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum. Chapter 2 includes an
introduction to the reviewed literature that gave an account as to why the support of information
literacy is important and a necessity. Chapter 2 also gives an account of the title searches
performed for the historical overview of information literacy, current information on information
literacy, and faculty and librarian collaboration. This chapter further describes the relationship
between information literacy and higher education, first year undergraduate students, and the
conceptual frameworks that are associated with information literacy.

Chapter 3
Methodology

This qualitative exploratory single case study explored the importance of faculty and
librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate
curriculum and considered how a first year undergraduate curriculum embedded with
information literacy supports first year undergraduate students with their information literacy
needs. The importance for faculty and librarian collaboration and embedding information
literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum is a necessary means to promote student
development and growth, critical thinking skills, and lifelong learning. Faculty and librarians are
equipped to collaborate and able to provide a quality first year undergraduate curriculum that is
relevant and will add value to information literacy (Brasley, 2008).
The reviewed literature on the topics of embedding information literacy and faculty and
librarian collaboration helped to formulate the three Research Questions (RQs), and two SubResearch Questions (SRQs) that guided this study:
RQ 1: Why is it necessary to embed information literacy into first year undergraduate
curriculum?
RQ 2: Why is collaboration between faculty and librarians important for embedding
information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum?
RQ 3: How does collaboration between faculty and librarians embedding information
literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum improve or impact the quality of the
curriculum?
SRQ 1: How and/or why are higher education institutions responsible for embedding
information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum?

70

SRQ 2: How can higher education institutions approach the problem of embedding
information literacy into the first year undergraduate curriculum in order to achieve the
greatest amount of participation and greatest success?
Chapter 3 continues with a discussion of the research method and design, design
appropriateness, data collection process, population and sample, and ethical parameters. Chapter
3 also discusses research instrumentation, data collection, data analysis, validity and reliability,
triangulation and concludes with a chapter summary.
Research Method
The qualitative research method was chosen for this study as a naturalistic approach to
understanding the phenomena of interest. Merriam (2009) stated that research is a process
systematically designed to know more about a subject than before research is conducted.
Research can be a basic process motivated by the researcher’s intellectual interest in a
phenomenon or applied research. The findings of the study are used to improve the practice in a
specific discipline (Merriam, 2009). Merriam also stated that qualitative research is a way to
understand the uniqueness of the phenomenon in its context and understand the perspectives of
those involved in the situation. The researcher realized that the qualitative method was the best
method to use to conduct the research in order to gain rich descriptions from participating faculty
members and librarians from the institution where the study was conducted. As a result of the
conducted interviews the researcher collected data full of rich descriptions and individual
perspectives from the research participants.
Quantitative research is completely different from qualitative research in that the
quantitative method of research involves systematic measurements and statistical analysis to
acquire findings (Marczyk, et al., 2005). Quantitative research is sometime referred to as

71

scientific research because of its statistical nature. The defining characteristics of quantitative
research involve testing hypotheses, observation and measurement, and experiments that consist
of two or more groups in order to determine cause-and-effect (Marczyk, et al., 2005).
Quantitative studies also involve the measurement and analysis of casual relationships between
variables. This research study does not seek to test hypotheses, measure, or conduct
experiments.
Qualitative research is not as statistical in nature as is quantitative research (Golafshani,
2003). According to Golafshani (2003) and Merriam (2009) a qualitative study seeks to
understand the uniqueness of the phenomenon that unfolds naturally from its real world setting
and to understand the perspectives of those involved in the situation. Qualitative research has the
potential to retrieve rich descriptions of the phenomenon that statistics do not provide (Merriam,
2009). Merriam also stated that qualitative research is an inductive process that enables the
researcher to collect data that potentially builds his or her underpinning theoretical or conceptual
framework for the research study.
Qualitative Research Designs
Qualitative research is a field of study that can employ a number of empirical materials to
arrive at a better understanding of the phenomenon of interest to be studied (Denzin & Lincoln,
2007). Golafshani (2003) stated that qualitative research is a naturalistic approach with no
attempt to manipulate the phenomenon of interest. The chosen qualitative design depends
greatly on the questions the researcher has concerning the phenomenon, and the design approach
must match the questions the researcher has (Shank, 2006). The case study design was chosen
for this research because the three research questions and two sub-research questions asked “how
and why” questions. Yin (2009) suggested that a case study asking “how” and “why” questions

72

is viable when there is a contribution to the body of knowledge that can be made, when it does
not require control of behavioral events, and when the focus is on contemporary events. There
are several design approaches in qualitative research, including ethnography, grounded theory,
and phenomenology; however, this is not an exhausted qualitative design list. Neither of those
designs was chosen, as they did not support the needs of this study. The last qualitative design on
the following list is the case study design that further explains why the design was chosen.
Ethnography
Ethnography originates from the anthropological field where entire cultures were studied
based on ethnicity and geographic locations (Qualitative Approaches, 2006). During a specified
amount of time a cultural group is studied in their natural setting (Smith, 2016). Ethnography has
evolved from studying ethnicity and geographic locations to the study of any group or
organization such as a business or organizational culture (Qualitative Approaches, 2006).
Grounded Theory
Grounded theory is grounded or rooted in observation and used to develop theory
concerning a phenomenon of interest (Qualitative Approaches, 2006). This research process is
time-consuming because potentially new theories can develop from the data collected. As
repeated ideas or concepts become apparent from collected data and as linkages are developed
between the collected data and theoretical core concepts, the potential basis for new theory
becomes apparent (Qualitative Approaches, 2006). Grounded theory is time consuming because
of the multiple stages of data collection and the time it takes to compare collected data with other
theories that have been found during a literature review (Smith, 2016).

73

Phenomenology
Phenomenology’s concern is with the individual perspective and the meaning one makes
of an event, situation, or experience. Husserl (1859 -1938) was the principle founder of
phenomenology and posited that proper phenomenological description is accomplished through
first person point of view (Beyer, 2013). First person point of view ensures that the event,
experience, or respective item is described just as it was experienced or intended by that person
(Beyer, 2013).
Narrative Analysis
Narrative analysis is storytelling using first person accounts of an experience or event
(Merriam, 2009). The main purpose of a narrative analysis is to tell a story, give a written
account of connected events such as a life history, a historical account of an event, or creative
non-fiction (Merriam, 2009). There accounting of a person’s story has a beginning, middle, and
an end; the researcher then retells the narrative through analytic re-descriptions (Merriam, 2009).
Case Study
A single case study was the chosen design for this qualitative exploratory research study
focusing on two subjects, embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate
curriculum and the importance of faculty and librarian collaboration. Case studies focus on a
single event, person, or subject or it can be accomplished by focusing on multiple sites or
subjects (Bogden & Bilken, 2007). Yin (2009) indicated that when the research question is to
explore the topic of interest and contribute new knowledge concerning that topic conducting a
case study is in order. Case studies focus on contemporary events, are practical, and have the
potential to be immediately applicable to the problem (Marczyk, et al., 2005; Merriam, 2009).

74

Conducting a case study is an effective way to obtain data and identify gaps in the knowledge
base concerning instructor and librarian collaboration in designing first year curriculum
(Merriam, 2009; Yin, 2009). Golafshani (2003) and Merriam (2009) both suggested that a
qualitative case study is a naturalistic approach to understanding phenomena in a context specific
setting.
This research was conducted employing a qualitative exploratory single case study and
retrieved critical information on how to improve the collaboration between faculty and librarians
in higher education. Shank (2006) posited “We only know something to the degree that we first
understand it (p. 6)” and Yin (2009) posited that conducting research that answers “how” and
“why” questions have the opportunity to expand our understanding. Case studies focus on
contemporary events, are practical, and have the potential to be immediately applicable to the
problem (Merriam, 2009; Marczyk, et al., 2005). Information retrieved from case studies are
highly detailed and comprehensive, and attempt to convey “specific nuances, extraneous
influences, and special idiosyncratic details” of what is being researched (Marczyk, et al., 2005,
p. 148).
Design Appropriateness
The case study design was chosen for this study over ethnography, grounded theory,
phenomenological, and narrative analysis designs due to the intent of this study, which was to
answer “how and why” questions. Case studies are designed to explore a single phenomenon of
interest based on an event or an activity that occurred during a specific time and data are
collected (Smith, 2016). The intent of the study was to capture individual perspectives and
secure rich descriptions through the interview process. Semi-structured interviews, asking openended, in-depth questions of faculty and librarians yielded outstanding responses and resulted in

75

understanding the importance of embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate
curriculum and how and why collaboration is important between the two professional groups.
According to Merriam (2009) qualitative research employs the interview process as the
primary strategy for data collection and stated that there are three types of interview processes.
The first interview process is highly structured and involves questions that are predetermined in
the wording of questions and predetermined order in which questions will be asked. Highly
structured interview questions are standardized. The second interview process is semi-structured
and consists of an interview guide that contains a mix of questions that require specific
information from the respondents. Semi-structured interview questions can be used flexibly.
There is no predetermined wording or order of questions in the semi-structured interview
process. The third interview process described by Merriam is unstructured and informal, the
questions are open-ended and the interview is more like a conversation. Merriam stated that the
key to receiving good data in an interview depends on the researcher’s ability to ask well chosen,
relevant, and open-ended questions. Open-ended questions are exploratory in nature and invite
the participant to answer questions in a manner that reveals his or her perspectives. Open-ended
questions also provide the interviewer the opportunity to follow-up with probes or requests for
more details based on the interviewee’s responses (Merriam, 2009).
This study used a combination of the three types of interview processes. The interview
questions were predetermined and in a specific order, the interview questions required specific
information from the respondents, and because the interview questions were open-ended the
interview was conducted more like a conversation. The interview questions were created as a
result of the literature review (Appendix B). The literature was consulted to ensure the context
of the questions and specific meanings of the words used in the interview questions were not

76

ambiguous. Consulting the literature to create the interview questions also ensured the questions
were culturally appropriate and would enable the researcher to answer each of the three posed
research questions and the two sub-research questions and can potentially solve the framed
problem.
Population and Sample
The recruited sample population for this study consisted of 12 participants that included
eight faculty members and four librarians from a four-year, private university located in the
Southeastern region of the United States. The criteria for research participation were that
instructors must have two or more years of experience teaching first year undergraduate students
and librarians must have experience with first year undergraduate curriculum design, information
literacy, and library instruction. Participants were recruited using the online university
community. The appropriate administrator of the university was asked to send a group email
letter requesting volunteer research study participants on behalf of the researcher (Appendix A).
The intent of the email was to gain approval from the institution to reach a broader audience
within the institution. The institution’s administrator was notified that the email was a request
for permission to invite institution members to volunteer for the research study. When proper
approvals were received from the researcher’s institution and from the institution of interest
(Appendix G), the actual letter of invitation was sent to the administrator asking him or her to
send out a group email of the invitation letter on the researchers behalf (Appendix H).
The study followed a purposive sampling approach and a snowball sampling approach,
which is common in qualitative research (Merriam, 2009; Family, n.d.). Purposive sampling is
use when the researcher’s intent is discovery, understanding, and to gain greater insight to the
phenomena of interest being researched. The purposive sampling approach presented

77

opportunities for snowball sampling; some of the research participants recommended other
potential research candidates who fit the study’s criteria who may be willing to participate in the
study. The research study participants were chosen according to the nature of the study and
preselected research criteria (Family, n.d.).
Ethical Parameters
Every researcher must be concerned with the ethics of his or her research and there are
guidelines that must be followed. As a result of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, “The Belmont
Report was initiated in 1979 by the National Commission for the protection of human subjects of
biomedical and behavioral research” (Marczyk, et al., 2005, p. 237). The initiative establishes
principles for ethical codes of conduct for all human participants in research including respect of
persons, beneficence, and justice (Marczyk, et al., 2005). The Belmont Report also identifies
informed consent as a process essential to the principle of respect of persons.
Respect of Persons, Benefice, and Justice
Respect of persons requires a minimum of two ethical convictions to be present;
individuals are treated as autonomous agents, and participants with diminished autonomy are
entitled to protection (Marczyk, DeMatteo, & Festinger, 2005). Research that involves humans
is subject to informed consent, confidentiality, and anonymity. This study does not involve or
present any physical risks, emotional risks, psychological risks, or social stress. Participants are
informed of the nature of the study before they are allowed to participate, they are provided an
opportunity to ask questions concerning the study, and address any concerns of their role in the
study. According to Marczyk, DeMatteo, and Festinger, all who choose to participate in the
study must be treated fairly and no one is to be subjected to any form of discrimination, abuse, or
exploitation.

78

Informed Consent
Researchers are responsible for explaining that all potential participants of the study
receive adequate information concerning the purpose of the study and how the information given
by participants will be used in the study (Wright, 2012). The informed consent form contains a
brief statement explaining what the study is about and will be given to all potential participants
before the interviews are conducted (Appendix C). The informed consent statement explains to
potential participants that a recording device will be used and notes will be taken during the
interview process. Each participant is informed that the interview questions are concerned with
information literacy, faculty and librarian collaboration, and embedding information literacy into
first year curriculum. Participants will be informed that the final report has the potential to bring
awareness to the body of knowledge concerning the importance of faculty and librarian
collaboration for the purpose of embedding information literacy learning into first year
undergraduate curriculum. The informed consent statement allows each participant to make an
informed decision on whether or not to participate (Wright, 2012).
Initially, the purpose of the study will be verbally communicated to potential participants.
The informed consent reiterates that participation is voluntary, participants can withdraw without
any repercussion at any time, and that the final report maintains the participant’s confidentiality
and anonymity. Informed consent will state the participant’s agreement to an interview using a
recording device. If the participant does not wish to be recorded during the interview then that
negates their participation. Participants will sign and date the informed consent, will receive a
copy complete with researcher’s name and contact information in the event they have further
questions on the study or their participation. The informed consent form will be signed and

79

returned to the researcher prior to interviews being scheduled. The researcher will also maintain
a copy of the signed informed consent for record keeping.
Confidentiality and Anonymity
The researcher is responsible for explaining all issues related to confidentiality including
who will have access to participants’ information and what safeguards will be taken to protect
participant confidentiality. Participants are informed of how their information is handled during
data transfers, data storage, recoding, and purging data of identifiers (Marczyk, et al., 2005).
During the process of informed consent the researcher will clearly explain how participant
privacy will be protected and their information kept confidential (Appendix D). For this study
the researcher was the only one present besides the research participant during interviews, the
only one collecting data, transcribing interview sessions, analyzing data, and reporting the
findings of the study. Therefore, the researcher is the only one who will view, maintain, and
have access to the collected data that will be kept in a secure location.
Prior to signing the informed consent, participants are assured of their identity’s
protection in the final report. The participants were informed that their information would be
identified by an alphanumeric code to ensure confidentiality and anonymity. The participants
must sign the informed consent prior to the interviews being scheduled and conducted.
According to Marczyk, et al., (2005) the researcher’s responsibility is to ensure that the
participant’s private information is kept confidential by law protecting the participant’s dignity.
The researcher is also responsible to explain all issues related to confidentiality including who
will have access to their information and what safeguards will be taken to protect their
confidentiality. Marxzyk et al. also stated that participants are to be informed of how their

80

information is to be handled during data collection, data transfers, data storage, recoding, and
purging data of identifiers.
Instrumentation
The primary instrumentation for this study was in the form of the researcher who
conducted interviews utilizing a list of 15 semi-structured interview questions. Secondary
instrumentation for this study included a recording device, a notepad, writing utensils, and a
computer. According to Bogden and Bilken (2007) interviewing is a prime source for gathering
descriptive data in the participants’ own words. The researcher for this study was utilized as the
instrument for data collection, data analysis, and data interpretation, which is appropriate for a
qualitative case study. Rajendran (2001) and Merriam (2009) stated that face-to-face interviews
are a common form of collecting information. However, telephone interviews or interviews via
email were conducted, as some participants were not available for a face-to-face interview.
Data Collection
Data for the study were collected during interviews with participants. Prior to the start of
the interview each participant was given a brief overview of the study and its purpose and
reminded verbally during the interview protocol that a recording device will be used and notes
will be taken with his or her consent (Appendix J). The researcher was careful to maintain
compliance with the confidentiality standards of the Collaborative IRB Training Initiative (CITI,
2015). The researcher submitted to the participants’ choice of interview location, the university
campus, and time of interview, which created a mutual agreement. Each participant chose to
have the interview conducted in his or her office, classroom, or in the library where there was
little distraction and he or she felt comfortable responding to the interview questions. Most of
the interviews were conducted face-to-face. However, there were a few participants who were

81

not able to meet for a face-to-face interview and a telephone interview or interview via email was
scheduled and conducted for those participants. To establish a relaxed atmosphere prior to each
face-to-face or telephone interviews the researcher conducted a brief icebreaker session and
provided some general self-information. Each interviewee was then asked some general
questions, specified in the interview protocol, to help them settle in and prepare to answer the
interview questions (Appendix I). Each participant was presented with a series of 15 semistructured interview questions on the topic of information literacy and faculty and librarian
collaboration. Interview questions were repeated or clarified upon request and each participant
was given ample time to respond.
Each face-to-face and telephone interview was audio tape-recorded and notes were taken
to assist the researcher with information that cannot be captured on an audio tape-recording.
Bogden and Bilken (2007) suggested that gestures and facial expressions that could potentially
provide a pattern or theme to responses of specific questions could not be captured on an audio
recording device. Bogden and Bilken also suggested that taking notes provides the means to
record ideas, potentially evolving themes as the interview process is taking place, and to note
reflective thoughts once the interview is concluded. Each of the interviewed participants has
been identified in sequential interview order with faculty participants identified with an “I” for
instructor and numbered sequentially in interview order, one through eight. Librarians are
identified with an “L” for librarian and numbered sequentially in interview order, one through
four. This type of differentiation in the data collection facilitates analyzing the data and
maintains participant confidentiality. A thank you note was sent to each research participant via
email once the interview session was completed as gesture of appreciation for his or her time and
participation in this research study (Appendix J).

82

Data Analysis
Merriam (2009) stated that data analysis in a qualitative research study is best done
simultaneously with data collection for the purpose of making data analysis more manageable.
Analysis should be ongoing according to Merriam (2009) in order to maintain focus, capture
reflections, note tentative themes, recurring statements, and to make note of what to pay attention
during the next interview. Merriam also stated that ongoing analysis alleviates being
overwhelmed by the amount of data collected and it also allows the researcher to compare
interview notes in between scheduled interview sessions. Collected data from the interviews
were transcribed and analyzed using NVivo 10 software. NVivo 10 software is designed so that
information, whether in document or audio form, can be coded, categorized by words or phrases,
and gather content data from different nodes to reveal associations (QSR, 2014). The purpose of
data analysis according to Rejendran (2001) is to construct a composite framework that
communicates the essence of what the data reveals.
NVivo 10 software was used to analyze collected data from the interview sessions,
analyze interview transcripts, transcribed recorded responses, written field notes, import audio
files, and maintain organization of data to ensure validity and reliability. NVivo 10 software
used coding queries or word frequency queries to discover patterns in data, as well as uncover
associated themes from collected data (QRS, 2014). Once all interviews were completed the
audio-recordings were transcribed into a Word document and then imported into the NVivo 10
software program. However, in order to import the information contained in the Word document
to the software, the software required an identifier to be created for each research participant.
Creating participant identifiers allowed for each participant’s interview responses to become
categorized based on searches for key word(s) and phrases, which in turn became data sets. The

83

created data sets or nodes identified the emerging themes based on the analysis of the faculty
members and librarians’ responses to the interview questions.
Validity and Reliability
Validity and reliability are what make research authentic and has the potential to bring
credible new knowledge to the academic body and possibly construct new policy (Merriam,
2009). The researcher must be attentive to the process of data collection, analysis, and
interpretation so that the findings are presented in a way that conceptualizes the study (Merriam,
2009). Triangulation is the process that uses multiple sources of data collection, such as audio
tape recordings, note taking, member checks, and document (Yin, 2009). Triangulation
corroborates the data and provides a broad scope of perspectives that potentially assist in more
accurate research findings (2009). Merriam (2009) noted that validity in qualitative studies is
relative to the study participant’s reality, experience, and construction of the phenomenon being
investigated. Merriam also stated that data could be validated from collected data through
multiple sources of data such as the interview transcripts, relevant documentation, and
observations.
Member checks is another way to ensure reliability of data collected (Merriam, 2009).
Member checks involve researcher follow-up with several study participants to verify
interpretation of information by the researcher adequately reflects participant perspective
(Merriam, 2009). For this study the researcher will employ member checking, field notes,
transcribed tape-recorded transcripts, and document collection of past or present syllabi or
worksheets that provide examples of information literacy activities for class or homework
assignments as data sources to ensure validity and reliability of the study.

84

Triangulation
Qualitative researchers predominately use the triangulation technique as a means to
ensure that the research account captures various dimensions of the same phenomenon.
According to Bogden and Bilken (2007) triangulation is used to convey the idea that in order to
establish fact, multiple sources of data are needed to potentially communicate fuller
understanding of the phenomenon being studied. Triangulation is also used to ensure research is
rich, robust, comprehensive, and well developed. For this study the researcher employed
member checking, field notes, transcribed tape-recorded transcripts, and document collection of
past or present syllabi or worksheets that provided examples of information literacy activities for
in-class or homework assignments as data sources to ensure validity and reliability of the study.
The use of these strategies for data collection provided the basis for triangulation of the data.
According to Yin (2009) this is an appropriate data analysis approach in qualitative case study
research.
Chapter Summary
Conducting research is a responsible action and is not to be taken lightly especially when
human participants are necessary for the study (Marczyk, et al., 2005). Researchers must follow
a prescribed process for conducting research including IRB approval, informed consent,
following ethical protocols, and proper reporting of findings. Proper reporting of findings
increases the body of knowledge and is instrumental in making adjustments, improvements, or
changes to the field, which is the purpose of conducting research. Chapter 3 discussed the
framework and structure of the research study including the research method and design,
appropriateness of design, research questions, sampling, population, informed consent, and
confidentiality. Chapter 3 also discussed instrumentation, data collection and analysis, and

85

validity and reliability. Chapter 4 presents a detailed analysis and discussion of the results
acquired from the implementation of the study.

Presentation and Analysis of Data

The purpose of this qualitative exploratory single case study was to explore the
importance of faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into first
year undergraduate curriculum and to consider how a first year undergraduate curriculum
embedded with information literacy supports first year undergraduate students with their
information literacy needs. Interviews were conducted with eight faculty members and four
librarians from a four-year, private university located in the Southeastern region of the United
States. Chapter 4 provides a description of the population characteristics of the study; field-test
results, the data analysis process, findings of the study, as well as emerging themes, and
concludes with a chapter summary.
Population Characteristics
The recruited sample population for the study was comprised of instructors who teach
first year students and librarians who have experience with first year curriculum design,
information literacy, and library instruction from a four-year, private higher education institution
in the Southeastern region of the United States. The sample population included eight instructors
and four librarians. Using purposive sampling and the snowball sampling approach the research
sample group of 12 met the criteria to participate in the research study. An alphanumeric code
was assigned to each participant to maintain and protect his or her confidentiality. The alpha
portion of the code identifies profession; the numeric portion identifies the order in which the
participant was interviewed. Faculties were identified with an “I” for instructor and librarians
were identified with an “L” for librarian. Each alpha code was followed by their numeric
interview order. Each of the 12 participants met the criteria to participate in the study. The

Field Test Results
The field test included three professionals in the educational field, one librarian from a
private Southeastern university (not the same university the study was conducted in) and two
noted authors on information literacy. Each of the three field test participants agreed that two of
the initial interview questions were redundant and should be consolidated. As a result of their
suggestion, the two individual interview questions were revised to create one totally different
question reflecting what each of the individual questions was designed to ask. Two of the field
test participants offered that one of the initial interview questions seemed out of place and should
be moved in order for the questions to follow a logical and sequential order. As suggested by the
field test participants that particular interview question was reassigned in order to follow a
logical and sequential order. Each of the three field test participants offered affirming responses
that the interview questions (Appendix B) were clear, understandable, and aligned with the
purpose of the research and each of the research and sub research questions of this study.
Data Analysis Procedures
Data for the study were collected via face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and
on-line interviews. The interview process consisted of making sure the participants were
comfortable and felt at ease, each participant was reminded of the purpose of the study, that
participation in the study was voluntary, and that their identity would be kept confidential.
Participants were also reminded that at any time during the interview they could choose not to
answer a particular question or continue with the interview at all and there would be no type of
penalty or retribution for withdrawal. The interview questions consisted of 15 semi-structured,
open-ended questions that were purposely created to give each participant the opportunity to
freely state his or her view and opinion on embedding information literacy into first year

89

undergraduate curriculum and the importance of faculty and librarian collaboration. Each of the
participant’s perceptions of his or her experiences, ideas, and opinions was captured via audiorecorded interviews and written field notes.
The study’s sample population consisted of eight faculty members and four librarians.
One of the researcher’s assumptions was that the sample population would be adequate in
reaching data saturation. Data saturation is reached when the information being analyzed
becomes repetitive and no new ideas come forth. At this point further data collection becomes
unnecessary and can be halted. Data saturation was reached when tenth participant’s interview
was analyzed. The researcher was reasonably confident that the inclusion of any additional
participants beyond the two remaining scheduled interviews was unlikely to provide new
findings. However, two additional interviews had been scheduled prior to data saturation and
those appointments were kept. Once all interviews were completed the audio-recordings were
transcribed into a Word document and then imported into the NVivo 10 software program. The
software was used to create nodes based on the information retrieved from the research
participants and to identify any emerging themes based on the data sets.
Analysis of data from the responses to the interview questions were designed to identify
patterns or emerging themes related to embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum and to consider the importance of faculty and librarian collaboration.
Twenty-three nodes were initially created based on key words and phrases from the interview
responses. Upon analyzing the references from the interview responses that were placed into the
initial 23 nodes further analysis allowed the researcher to code the data, make reductions, and
create combinations that would result in identifying the six emerging themes.

90

Nodes
Nodes, according to QSR (1999-2015) are central or connecting points. They are
containers for coding, gathering related material in one place for the purpose of identifying
emerging patterns and ideas. There were 23 initial nodes created based on key words and
phrases from the interview responses and there were reductions made as a result of analyzing the
nodes. Some of the initial nodes included key word or phrases such as: adjunct faculty, course
management systems, discipline specific, barriers, overcoming barriers, and Google. However,
these six nodes are not the exhausted list of the 23 nodes, and were not considered because they
did not offer any substantial information or significantly identify a major theme on its own merit.
Upon analyzing the remaining 17 nodes, nine of the nodes were used and some nodes were
combined and created the six major emerging themes. One node was used twice as a
combination as the information was relevant. The remaining eight nodes contained relevant
information and were incorporated and substantiated the six nodes that resulted in the major
emerging themes of this research.
Findings
As a result of analyzing the collected data six major themes emerged based on the
findings of the study. The interview questions were based on embedding information literacy
into first year undergraduate curriculum and faculty and librarian collaboration. Interviews
conducted for the study utilized 15 semi-structured, open-ended questions designed to elicit the
participants’ thoughts, experiences, and opinions.
Interview Questions 1 and 2
Interview questions 1 and 2 addressed the importance of information literacy for first
year undergraduate students and embedding of information literacy in first year undergraduate

91

curriculum. The first interview question asked: How would you describe the importance of
information literacy for students, especially first year undergraduates? Each of the study’s 12
participants responded and agreed that embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum is essential to the success of first year undergraduate students.
Participant I6 said, “I would say that information literacy is essential for students especially first
year undergraduates. It is a crucial set of skills for students to have.” Participant L4 concurred,
“Information literacy is one of the most important skills a student can have when starting his or
her college career.” Participant L1 expressed, “I think that information literacy is a critical skill
for ALL (emphasis from participant) students, but especially the first year undergrads. Having
that skill, the information literacy skill, will allow students to be successful in all of their
coursework.” Participant I3 supported participant L1’s statement,
You’ve got to be able to access information all sorts of ways especially since the
technological means of getting information is increasingly becoming more and more
important. So I say it’s vitally important that students understand how to do that. It is
essential for first year students to have information literacy embedded in the curriculum.
The Internet has become the way most people find information; faculty and librarians
alike agree that students are going to use the Internet while in school and will continue to use the
Internet well after their academic studies have concluded. Research participants L3, I3, I2, and
L2 made statements concerning the importance of knowing how to access and evaluate
information that is retrieved from the Internet. Participant L3 stated, “If you’re going to use
Google, you should know how to use Google.” Participant I3 agreed and stated the following:

92

We need to get these students to the information they need to do a good job in their
assignments, they may know one way to access information, but they need to know how
to access a variety of information mediums and how to evaluate that information.
Participant L3 stated, “Information literacy is imperative and is a huge component of how to
succeed, and one cannot function without information literacy.” Participant I2 stated,
We use the Internet in daily life for everything from finding a plumber, to on-line
shopping, to making vacation plans. It’s impossible to obtain a degree, especially an
advanced degree, without the ability to conduct extensive research on-line and databases.
In responding to interview question 2, Participant L2 stated:
It’s essential that students have information literacy skills for long term and become
information literate. Information literacy is the groundwork that students’ need and if
students don’t have that groundwork all the other building blocks that we built in their
coursework studies is going to be really shaky for them. If students don’t know how to
find basic information, if they don’t know how to interpret that information, and if they
don’t know how to use that information they’re not going to be able to complete their
first week’s assignment let alone finish their thesis. So it’s incredibly essential that
students succeed at their information literacy skills. And the students who are not
successful in information literacy are not going to be successful in life because we see
more and more in our society a lack of information literate individuals. We see people
who don’t know how to effectively evaluate issues that are occurring every day and do
not know how to interpret news properly. Take social media for example, people repost
‘news’ on social media without knowing the source or believing the source without first
investigating who that source is. People post bias information, post hoaxes thinking its

93

true, and some even post things from blogs as if it were news. This is why it is so
essential that information literacy be taught every step of the way, in math, and even in
science. Every subject can have an information literacy component.
An emerging theme from responses obtained from interview questions 1 and 2 was Theme 1:
Embedding Information Literacy.
Interview Questions 3 and 4
Interview questions 3 and 4 addressed the support and practice of information literacy
activities in past and current curricula. Interview question 3 was asked in two parts. Part one of
the question was directed to faculty: How does both past and current curricula support the
practice and application of information literacy activities? Part two of question 3 was directed
toward librarians and asked: If you are a librarian, how does the library support the practice and
application of information literacy activities? These questions were asked to determine if there
were classroom activities and homework assignments that supported the practice and application
of information literacy functions. Part one of interview question 3 yielded nine out of 12
responses from research participants. Participant I2 stated:
It is important that students are shown how to access the library databases, conduct
searches, evaluate sources, and cite those sources properly. The more information
literacy activities are repeated, the greater the ability the student has to use the tools of
search, evaluation, summary and citation.
Participant I2 also stated that she hands out worksheets in class that incite students to engage in
and practice the proper use of the Internet and the institution’s library databases and clearly
expressed “this way they are learning how to apply what they are learning to their assignments.”
Participant I8 implied that more time is needed to cover the required course work and

94

information literacy fundamentals. He stated he “barely touches” the Internet literacy aspect of
the course. Participant I8 also stated:
My class meets once a week for a three-hour session and there’s only so much the brain
can handle in three hours. If we met twice a week I could cover more material before the
brain tuned me out. I could add material about the Internet that goes beyond the textbook
and show students the rich resources that are available to them.
Participant L1 stated, “Some faculty don’t have a background in information literacy.
Actually for most faculty, if they made minor modifications to their existing course outline, class
work, and homework assignments would make them information literacy friendly.”
Participant I7 stated:
All faculty members need to realize the importance of ongoing information literacy
training. Some (instructors) bemoan the poor sources that students use for their papers,
but are they taking an active role in regularly modeling how to evaluate a source? I think
that some of our faculty depend too much on the librarians to deliver the information
literacy content and do not do enough to keep information literacy as an ongoing
conversation after the librarian has left the classroom. I think all would be better served
if faculty took more ownership in continuing what the librarians introduce.
Part two of question 3 led the librarians into discussing one-shot sessions as a process
that supports the practice and application of information literacy activities. The faculty also
discussed “one-shot sessions” as it is also an activity that is included in their curricula.
According to Nardine and Meire (2010) a one-shot session is when a librarian is allocated a
limited amount of time to come into the classroom to introduce students to the research process
and to present relevant instruction on information literacy. While there appeared to be mixed

95

feelings concerning the one-shot sessions that are provided by librarians for the students,
instructors and librarians alike are only content with sessions and feel that one-shot sessions
alone is not enough to cover information literacy. Seven out of 12 participants commented on
this subject. Participant I5 stated:
A lot of our students are adult learners and they do not have a lot of time to be on
campus to utilize the resources that are available. It is good to actually have the librarian
come in the class every quarter and give a one-hour presentation that includes how to
access the library databases, how important it is to find information, and how to utilize
that information appropriately. This is one way we can ensure that all student are
receiving this information.
Participant L2 stated:
The librarians usually go into the classroom and teach students how to navigate the
library’s databases. The one-shot sessions are great, if we can do that we are happy with
that. I mean, I’m not complaining, but you cannot teach information literacy in one class
in one hour you can maybe teach one aspect of one aspect of information literacy.
Maybe a facet of an aspect of information literacy can be taught in an hour.
Participant I7 stated, “It is very important to embed information literacy and for it to be ongoing, we should not consider it one and done.” Participant L1 stated:
Our one-shot program is pretty good. We make a power-point presentation and we have
some tutorials on our online library that students can do. We also provide one-on-one
information literacy instruction in the library and computer labs are available for students
who need help. Having one-shots is better that nothing at all; some schools don’t even do
that.

96

Participant L3 stated, “We normally get a one-shot session, but because a lot of the information
literacy skills need reinforcement and that’s not something you can get in a one-shot session.”
Interview Question 4 was also asked in two parts. Part one of question 4 asked: What
information literacy learning skills and or activities are embedded in your curriculum? Part two
of question 4 was directed toward the librarians: What information literacy learning skills and or
activities are embedded in your library sessions? This question was asked to determine what
information literacy learning activities are embedded in curricula or library services. Question 4
is closely related to question 3 that inquired about activities that support the practice and
application of information literacy activities. Most of the responses that were given for question
3 were repeated for question 4.
Interview Question 5
Interview question 5 was asked to obtain information of about how the participants felt
concerning faculty having primary responsibility for the content, quality, and effectiveness for
curriculum according to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commissions on
Colleges (SACSCOC). Librarians were asked how they felt about faculty having this primary
responsibility. Responding to interview question 5 Participant L2 stated:
Faculty having primary responsibility for content, quality, and effectiveness gives them
the opportunity to embed information literacy into the curriculum. I think it is better if
curriculum comes from faculty rather than coming from administration, because faculty
members know what’s going on and they’re going to be able to create a syllabus
containing information literacy. Instructors have their teaching pedagogy, their teaching
experience, their teaching expertise, they have years of working with students, and
they’re the ones that know it.

97

Participant L4 matter-of-factly stated, “Whether SACCS tells me it’s my primary responsibility
to do it or not, I’m going to do it.” Participant L1 stated that a lot of time “Faculty has
incorporated (information literacy) without even really thinking about it, maybe some of those
things just need to be strengthened, like having the students complete an annotated bibliography,
a research assignment, or something along those lines.”
Some participating faculty members of the university felt they did not have primary
responsibility for the curriculum’s content, quality, and effectiveness. Those members felt the
university’s Quality Enhancement Program (QEP) is primarily responsible for curriculum
development, content, quality, and effectiveness. Participants I4, I1, and I5 agreed that the
curriculum is promulgated by the QEP; however, there was no signs of negativity in those
participants tones as they responded. Participant I4 stated, “We don’t have primary
responsibility because the curriculum is established by QEP and we have to follow the
curriculum, although we are given a lot of flexibility and a lot of support.” Participant I1 stated:
A lot of times QEP determines the syllabus for the classes and QEP is not something that
we as faculty can make decisions about other than once we adopt that material into the
syllabus then we are in charge of teaching that material and evaluating it. All of us here
have to be a part of QEP, so whatever that committee is or who makes the decisions,
when they say ‘this’ is going in the curriculum, we say ‘ok’. We are told by the people in
this university who drive QEP and the curriculum that there are studies that conclude that
in information literacy helps students stay in school, focus on their major, and make the
students more employable.
Participant I5 stated, “We actually have a syllabus for the course and QEP is embedded in the
syllabus to include specific information literacy components.” Another perspective of the QEP

98

was given by two of the participating librarians. Participant L4 stated, “Along with information
literacy being a component of this institution’s QEP. Our Quality Enhancement Plan has
specific criteria in it to emphasize the importance of the library’s role in teaching information
literacy skills.” Participant L1 stated:
Information literacy has been part of our Quality Enhancement Plan for our accreditation,
it (information literacy) is part of our strategic goal and objective, so it is definitely
something the University thinks is important. Information literacy is one of our four
institutional objectives, so all of our programs are assessed on an annual basis to
determine how those programs and courses are meeting this outcome.
An emerging theme that derived from interview question 5 is Theme 2: Quality Enhancement
Plan.
Interview Questions 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12
Interview questions 6 through 8 and questions 11 and 12 were grouped together because
these questions were asked to determine how the participants felt regarding the subject of faculty
and librarian collaboration. Interview question six asked research participant: How does your
institution support faculty and librarian collaboration for embedding information literacy into
first year undergraduate curriculum? Participants L3, I4, I3, and I2 agreed on the importance of
institutional support for faculty and librarian collaboration. Participant L3 stated, “They are
really supportive, and it is very difficult to have collaboration if the institution doesn’t encourage
that. Unless you get encouragement and institutional support, collaboration is not going to
happen.” Participant I4 stated, “If I didn’t have the support of this institution or its
encouragement I would not be here. Support and flexibility is very important for me to achieve
the goal of collaboration.” Participant I4 also stated that, “The school is very supportive and

99

their supportiveness propels and encourages the collaborative effort between faculty and
librarians.” Participant I3 agreed and stated that collaboration is “highly encouraged.”
Participant I2 also agreed stating, “My institution is fully supportive of the faculty and librarian
collaboration process and hopefully other institutions will make similar efforts to incorporate
faculty and librarian collaboration.”
When the participants were asked how specifically the institution supports faculty and
librarian collaboration and embedding information literacy, participants I7, I1, I5, and L4 gave
their accounts. Participant I7 stated, “The Dean of Academic Affairs supports this type of
collaboration and provides the head librarian time to share at New Faculty Orientation.”
Participant I1 stated, “The University encourages faculty and librarian collaboration and they
have in fact created an atmosphere for it. Librarians also voluntarily provide information literacy
workshops (among other workshops) for faculty and students.” Participants I5 and L4
respectively state that the university:
Definitely supports faculty and librarian collaboration and in fact it is a requirement. Our
Quality Enhancement Plan has specific criteria in it to emphasize the importance of the
library’s role in teaching information literacy skills. Our Quality Enhancement Plan
specifically emphasizes librarians going into the first year undergraduate classes to
conduct information literacy training with students.
Responses to question six provided Theme 3: Institutional Support for Collaboration.
Interview question 7. Interview question seven asked participants: Do you think faculty
and librarian collaboration is important or necessary for the purpose of embedding information
literacy into the curriculum, why or why not? Each of the 12 research participants was in
overwhelming agreement that there is indeed an ongoing need for faculty and librarian

100

collaboration and its importance to first year undergraduate students. Participant I5 stated that
collaboration “(It) is extremely important. It ensures our professors are providing accurate
information, and also (collaboration) makes sure that we are all on the same page.” Participant
I4 stated, “Collaboration is important because it helps the students to be able to function in the
courses that they are taking. It helps students in understanding the material and enables them to
write the papers they are expected to write.” Participant L2 responded by stating:
Collaboration is important because the curriculum would be a lopsided either the
curriculum would be subject heavy or heavy with general information literacy
knowledge. If you only have faculty-created curriculum then they (faculty) won’t know
the important little things that we (librarians) know such as the library resources that we
have and are available to them. We have resources available that go hand-in-hand with
information literacy, their coursework, and assignments.
Participant L2 explained that there have been many times she has had conversation with
faculty members letting them know what resources are available in the library and how those
resources can be incorporated into their curriculum. Participant L2 also stated that by the end of
those conversations the faculty member would state, “I didn’t know that.” Participant L4 stated
something similar concerning incorporating information literacy into coursework, “By
collaborating the faculty member can have us (librarians) custom fit our information literacy
material into their curriculum, classroom activities, or homework assignments. Without that
collaboration process our resources would feel just like the Internet but with more difficulty for
the students.” Participant L1’s concern was that:
Faculty might not be aware of some of the resources that are available to students and
stated how collaboration can make things easier for faculty. Librarians have expertise

101

that faculty members do not have and while faculty members may be experts in their
subject discipline they may not be experts in the research process. Those are some of the
ways I see librarians working with faculty members to incorporate information literacy.
Participant I1 was in agreement with Participant L1 and stated that collaboration is important
because “We cannot read each other’s mind. If I don’t tell the librarian that ‘there is something
new I want to try; is there a way to build that into the classroom website?’ then I would never
know if there is a way for that to happen. The students would be on the shortchange end of that
learning experience if I don’t ask the question.” Participant I6 stated that, “For the most part it
seems that information literacy could be considered a specialty of college librarians so why not
collaborate with the experts? It also offers students another person to go to other than their
professor for assistance.” Participant I3 summed up the conversation and stated:
To me, obviously the librarian has information that I don’t have and they have access to
information I don’t have. So I feel that collaboration is necessary and important because
I need to be able to access the information I need to do what I need to do for the students.
I don’t think I can take advantage of it too much.
Interview question 8. Interview question eight is considered part two of question six
asking how institutional support affects faculty and librarian collaboration efforts. Faculty and
Librarians both expressed how important librarian input is to the collaboration process; this
perception was substantiated by 47 references made by both professions. Participant I2 stated:
Librarians are expected to work with instructors and the librarians are not only willing
but are eager to be invited to the classroom to discuss with the students how to access the
library’s databases and the library services that are available to them.

102

Participant I6 stated, “The librarians are super helpful and a lot more accessible. They
consistently offer workshops on various topics that are useful for both faculty members and
students.” Participant L4 stated, “Having a librarian give a clear guide to information literacy in
the first quarter can alleviate some of those first year undergraduate pressures and help students
feel more confident in their academic potential.” Participant I8 stated:
I believe strongly in the need for the librarian to come into my courses. She informs the
students that using Google or a similar search engine may produce many hits, but these
may not be of a high quality. So the librarian demonstrates that the better way to retrieve
information is to use the library’s on-line databases.
Along the same lines as Participant I8’s statement, Participant L3 stated that when she makes a
presentation to a class concerning websites her practice is to pull up several websites and
compare them to show the students why one website is better than the other. We then have a
discussion about evaluating the information, about its accuracy, if there is an author, who that
author is, and what makes that author credible. Participant L3 stated, “I also inform the students
that these are the things they need to think about when getting your information.” Participant L4
stated:
One of the largest reasons that many of our students fail (and this is anecdotal) is a lack
of knowledge on basic ideas of college writing. Things like citations, the writing process,
and research techniques are all big deterrents for many of our students. Those are all
things the librarians’ can help fix.
Participant I1 stated, “Librarians can uncover new resources or show students how to further dig
into a resource to find information and I’m sitting right here learning all of that too!” Librarians
have a lot to offer faculty members on the subject of information literacy, Participant L1 stated,

103

“We’re hoping that when faculty realize what librarians can do for them that they will be more
aware and more open for opportunities for collaboration.
Collaboration between faculty and librarians require communication from both
professionals and both professions commented on the need for communication in order for
collaboration to be successful. In this four-year, private university in the Southeastern region of
the United States, there is close proximity between the library and the classrooms. Participant I2
stated, “There is no excuse not to talk to each other, they are right down the hall, I can go down
there, pick up the phone, or shoot them an email.” Participant I5 stated that communication is
“extremely important” and that “as long as there is communication between all of us it ensures
our professors are providing accurate information and that we are all on the same page.”
Participant I6 echoes Participants I2 and I5 by stating, “It is necessary for the librarians to hear
from us faculty members concerning the assignments that will require library assistance.
Communication is key.” Participant L4 agreed and stated, “It can be hard to be on the same page
as an instructor without constant conversation.” Participant I5 also stated:
If we work together and give the students entrée to these (information literacy) skills not
only in one class but in many classes then the students will become more adept and
confident in using the library’s databases, e-books, and the Internet which are not the
future but are the present.
Participant I3 concluded the subject on communication stating, “Teamwork is always good!”
Interview question 11. Interview question 11 asked both group of professionals: How
can you contribute to the collaboration process? In response to question 11 Participants I8, I1,
I5, I3, and L4 gave examples of how they have contributed to the collaboration process.
Participant I8 explained that his contribution to the collaboration process is inviting a librarian

104

come into the class and explain how to access the library’s various databases. He stated, “The
visiting librarian has the students explore some of the available databases and as a result the
students learn or at least have an idea of how to use an on-line database.” Participant I1 stated:
I can instruct the students myself and show them their way around library databases, but I
do like inviting the librarians in the class to take an actual part of the teaching
responsibilities on locating and using the institution’s databases.
Participant I5 stated, “I think as instructors one of the ways we can contribute to the
collaborative process is purpose to meet with the librarian(s) each quarter and have continuous
conversations about the needs of the students and to review assignments.” When Participant I3
was asked how he contributes to the collaboration process he stated:
I collaborate every quarter with the librarians to get their assistance for all kinds of
things. I give the librarians what they need to produce the products that they are trying to
help me with. I think that’s a good way to state how I see my part in the collaboration
process. If I can find a way to help the librarian understand better what it is I’m looking
for, and they can help me, that’s an aid in the collaborative process.
Participant L4 stated:
I contribute by providing easier access to library resources to the instructors’ students. I
also contribute by being a point of contact for the students in matters where the librarian
might have more useful information or knowledge than the instructor on research issues.
An example of that is when I made a research guide for an instructor, the guide was
divided into weeks and I provided the articles that would be in the students’ reading
material for that week. All of the students were able to work with the research guide and

105

I felt like the instructor and I were using both of our skill sets to best inform and teach the
students.
Interview question 12. When responding to question 12 that asked participants: Have
you reached out to initiate collaborating and what was the outcome? Each of the responding
participants stated that their outcome to initiation has been positive. Participant L2 stated, “I can
go to the faculty member and suggest ‘hey, let’s do this or what do you think about this; and
they’ll say oh yeah, that’s a good idea, or maybe we could try it like this, and we just collaborate
and it works out fine.” The outcome is positive communication and a plan on how to embed
information literacy into coursework activities or homework assignments. Participant L1 stated,
“I always inform the faculty that we are available for consulting, and that we can come in their
class and do a presentation or whatever they need.” Initiating collaboration does not seem to be
an issue for this institution as Participant L3 stated, “Faculty members here have been really
great. They’ve been very open and receptive to collaborating and trying new ideas.” Participant
I5 stated that she has in the past and currently initiates collaboration by inviting librarians to
come to her class to make an hour session presentation on information literacy. One participant
(I5) expressed that collaboration feels like a “a partnership and a joint effort on this campus that
allows us to utilize each other’s expertise.”
Each of the responses to interview questions 6 through 8 and questions 11 and 12
established Theme 4: Collaboration between Faculty and Librarians. Collaboration between
faculty and librarians on embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate
curriculum, positive collaborative outcomes, and communication between the two groups of
professionals has the potential to improve the quality of the curriculum.

106

Interview Questions 9 and 10
Interview questions 9 and 10 addressed curricula improvements to support embedding
information literacy and what impact embedding information literacy would have on first year
undergraduate curricula. Question 9 asked: In your opinion, moving forward, how could
improvements to curricula be made to support embedding information literacy? Each of the 12
participants felt that embedding information literacy into the curriculum would greatly improve
the curricula’s quality. Participant I3 stated, “Embedding information literacy sources within
classes and adding it to the curriculum is just one more thing that pulls the students’ classes,
coursework, and homework assignments together, across the board.” Participant I5 inferred that
a quality curriculum is one that contains information literacy activities in it and stated that it is
“very important so that students have an understanding of how exactly their papers are to be
formatted.” Participant L4 suggested a curriculum requiring students to frequent the library
during the first few weeks of the course for assignment(s) completion could potentially improve
the curriculum’s quality. Participant I6 inferred that a curriculum infused with information
literacy would be an improvement and stated:
First, it would just be helpful to actually teach students what information literacy is. A
research paper should be a course requirement, as well as walking students through the
process of how to use the online aspects of the institution’s library.
Participant L2 stated:
So moving forward, the curriculum has to be completely revamped. I think that the
curriculum design team should consist of faculty members and librarians. Administration
support persons should be present as facilitators to guide the discussions. It is the faculty
and librarians who do the teaching so we have to come together to create assignments not

107

just for library use but also coursework assignments that cause students to use
information literacy skills.
While responding to question 9 concerning improving curricula to support embedding
information literacy, four of the 12 research participants suggested that information literacy
should be provided as a separate course for credit. Participant I4 implied that information
literacy should have its own course and stated, “If I was an undergraduate, just starting out, and
had a fear of writing papers, I would want a course on information literacy first.” Participants
L1, L2, and L3 all agreed that information literacy should receive more formalization in higher
education institutions. Participant L1 stated, “I wish we had more of a formal first year
undergraduate experience where students received more information literacy training.”
Participants L2 and I4 made very similar comments and suggested that there should be a quartersemester or a semester long course on how information literacy is done. Both Participants stated,
“First year undergraduate students should be required to take an introductory information literacy
course like Information Literacy 101 or something like that.” Participant L3 stated,
I really wish the undergraduate curriculum especially the first year undergraduate
curriculum would have a class where the student can get credit. I wish all universities
and campuses incorporated an information literacy course that required all students to
take for credit. That would be the best-case scenario.”
Participant I4 stated:
I don’t know if there’s a course that students can take in an undergraduate college
program that would introduce them to information literacy, but a course would be
outstanding. I would think a course like that would make sense in this day when most

108

college courses require some form of research project. Students should be given a course
in information literacy so they are as literate about information literacy as they should be.
Participant L4 suggested that students would definitely receive the benefit from having
information literacy in their first year undergraduate curriculum and said, “Students will receive
a more complete introduction to the rigors of college while also learning a fuller toolset to deal
with those rigors.”
Interview question 10 asked each participant: How would embedding information literacy
impact the quality of first year undergraduate curricula? Participant L1 stated, “Information
literacy is a critical skill especially for first year undergrads, having it embedded in the
curriculum would make a great impact. Information literacy is a skillset that will allow students
to be successful in all of their coursework.” Participant I7 thought that embedding information
literacy would impact first year undergraduate curriculum “In a very positive way.” The
responses to interview questions 9 and 10 produced Theme 5: Curricula Improvement.
Interview Questions 13 and 14
Interview questions 13 and 14 addressed the issue of barriers to the collaboration process
and how to overcome those barriers. Question 13 asked: What, if any, are some of the barriers
you encountered or foresee encountering in the collaboration process? Most of the research
participants agreed and indicated that there are no ‘real’ barriers to the collaboration process in
this institution because the QEP is a driving force that highly encourages the collaborative
process. However, there were a few participants who expressed what they considered to be
barriers to the collaboration process. Time and an extra workload were the main issue pointed
out as barriers to the collaboration process. Participant I6 expressed that scheduling is a barrier
and stated, “Along with scheduling, both professionals must make sure we are both on the same

109

page at the same time.” Participant L4 stated, “Professors do not want to have to do extra work.
Constructing e-classroom pages for the professor’s course we have to solicit and utilize the
professor’s input which adds to his or her workload that they normally would not have had to
do.” Participant L1 stated, “The big barrier is time, most instructors feel they are already
struggling to teach what they have to teach.”
Question 14 was asked in two parts: Can you think of ways to possibly overcome those
barriers? What are your suggestions? The research participants who stated that time,
scheduling, and extra work were barriers had no concrete suggestions on ways to overcome those
barriers. One research participant thought that more communication and instruction on what
should be done could help to eliminate any barriers to the collaboration process. Research
Participant I5 expressed that adjunct professors could be a barrier to the collaboration process
and stated, “As long as us full time professors stop to teach and communicate with our adjuncts,
I don’t think we will have any barriers when it comes to information literacy.” Participant L2
and I5 expressed the importance of knowing the institution’s system, what its capabilities are,
and staying relevant are factors in alleviating barriers to the collaboration process. Most of the
participants expressed that they did not feel there were any barriers to the collaboration process
in this institution.
Interview Question 15
The final question of the interview, question 15 asked: Finally, what benefits do you think
students, faculty, and librarians would gain from the collaborative effort of embedding
information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum? The research participants, all 12,
gave insight to their thoughts on the matter of benefits. Participant I7 stated, “It’s not just a
benefit, it is an obligation that we have to prepare our students to be informed consumers of

110

information.” Participants I6 and L4 echoed similar sentiments, respectively, stating “If it’s done
right and streamlined, it is less of a headache for everyone” and “I think it comes down to
perceived extra work when in fact embedding information literacy and faculty and librarian
collaboration can create much smother classes.” Participants I5 and I3 respectively stated:
When we are all collaborating and making sure we are saying the same thing, and we are
all providing students with the resources available to them, those are major benefits for
our students so they can be successful in their current and future courses. Anytime you
can facilitate the interaction of people for a collaborative effort, it fosters goodwill.
Participant L2 stated:
Students will have a better grasp on how to do this academic thing. Students will learn
how to read their assignments which is sometimes half the battle. Having information
literacy in their classes early on in the process is going to hopefully improve students’
grades, decrease their stress, and decrease how much time they spend on an assignment.
For faculty members, they are not going to have to spend all day teaching students how to
avoid plagiarism, how to do an APA citation, or how to search a library database.
Faculty can focus on teaching students the subject matter. Librarians are actually going
to see the library’s resources utilized by the students in a way that is worthy of how much
the institution is spending on the resources. If information literacy is incorporated in first
year undergraduate curriculum its just going to create a foundational building block that
is going to be successful for all the stakeholders; students, faculty, and librarians.
Participant L1 stated:
I think everyone would gain because it is one of those win-win-win situations. It would
be easier for librarians to conduct information literacy instruction and collaboration

111

would provide us with more opportunities to do so. It would also hopefully increase the
use of the library resources that we all work so hard to make available to our students.
Our student’s lives would be easier when its time for them to do their research
assignments that would make them more successful in school and that improves
retention. We tell our students that the value of having information literacy skills is not
just for the time you are students. We let them know that information literacy skills are
lifelong skills. We also inform the students that information literacy is not confined to
the campus. There are a lot of employers who are looking for a person to have
information literacy skills when they are hiring a potential candidate. The employer’s
though is that training is conducted for the tasks of the job but they are not there to train
or teach information literacy skills or critical thinking. The employers do not have the
time or the resources to teach a new hire how to find or evaluate information. Information
literacy is definitely a career related skill. The benefit for faculty is that students will turn
in better assignments, which makes grading easier. I think another importance of
supporting information literacy is that studies report that if you have good background
information, you are able to learn more and I think the same can be said for information
literacy skills. If you have good information literacy skills it makes it easier to learn in
general. So again, faculty and librarian collaboration and embedding information literacy
into first year undergraduate curriculum is a win-win-win situation all the way around.
According to all 12 of the research participants embedding information literacy into first
year undergraduate curriculum and the collaboration of faculty and librarian has direct benefits
for the students. Participant I8 stated, “I think the we would create an environment that would
bear much fruit for the students.” Participant I3 agreed with Participant I8 stating:

112

Embedding information literacy into first year curriculum will help facilitate student’s
critical thinking skills. Students are hopefully going to be able to think a little bit better,
they are going to be able to express themselves a little better in writing and in speech,
think a little more clearly about issues, and understand that there are people with different
points of view.
Participant L4 believes embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum
would lead to fewer frustrated, ignorant, students stating “Students will receive a more complete
introduction to the rigors of college while also learning a fuller toolset to deal with those rigors.”
Participant L2 stated, “If students have better information literacy there’s going to be a higher
retention rate of students. It is an assumed belief that there is a link between increased
information literacy, instruction, and retention and administrators love that!” Participant I2
stated, “Students clearly benefit from the reiteration of information the more it is repeated, the
greater the ability the student has to use the tools for searching for information, evaluating the
information, summarizing the information, and citing the information.” Participant L3 stated
“Students would have less anxiety, they would be more efficient in their time management skills
because they would not be searching on Google all the time and it would kind of streamline their
research assignments. I mean it would just make everything easier. And an obvious benefit to
the students succeeding is that it boosts everyone’s moral!” The results of interview question 15
produced Theme 6: Perceived Benefits.
Emerging Themes
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory single case study was to explore the
importance of faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into first
year undergraduate curriculum and consider how a first year undergraduate curriculum

113

embedded with information literacy supports first year undergraduate students with their
information literacy needs. Each of the 12 research participants were asked 15 semi-structured,
open-ended interview questions concerning their views and opinions on embedding information
literacy into first year curriculum and the importance of faculty and librarian collaboration. The
themes that emerged are a result of analyzing the data from the responses of the Instructors and
Librarians who participated in the research study. The participants’ responses provided the
identification of several themes. As a result of the analysis of the participants’ responses six
major thematic groups emerged and are listed in the order of discovery (see Table 2).

Chapter Summary
Conducting research is a responsible action and is not to be taken lightly when human
participants are involved in the study (Marczyk, et al., 2005). The researcher must follow a
prescribed process for conducting the research and reporting the findings of the research.
Chapter 4 provides a description of the field-test results, population characteristics, and the data

114

analysis procedures. Chapter 4 also includes the findings and emerging themes from the
research study. The NVivo 10 software assisted in developing the themes that emerged as a
result of the 15 semi-structured, open-ended interview questions. The six major thematic groups
were (1) Embedding Information Literacy, (2) Quality Enhancement Plan, (3) Institutional
Support for Collaboration, (4) Collaboration Between Faculty and Librarians, (5) Curricula
Improvement, and (6) Perceived Benefits. Each theme is a direct reflection of the responses to
the interview questions that were asked, listed in the order of discovery in the findings, and in
alignment with each of the three research questions and two sub-research questions.
Chapter 5 will recap the findings and emerging themes from Chapter 4, as well as the
summary of findings. Chapter 5 focuses on the conclusions of the study, recommendations for
leaders, suggestions for further research, a chapter summary, and dissertation summary.

Chapter 5
Conclusions and Recommendations

The purpose of this qualitative exploratory single case study was to explore the
importance of faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into first
year undergraduate curriculum and consider how a first year undergraduate curriculum
embedded with information literacy supports first year undergraduate students with their
information literacy needs. The necessity and importance for faculty and librarian collaboration
and embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum is a necessary
means to promote student development and growth, critical thinking skills, and lifelong learning.
Faculty and librarians are equipped to collaborate and can provide a quality first year
undergraduate curriculum that is relevant and adds value to information literacy (Brasley, 2008).
Faculty members and librarians from a four-year private university in the Southeastern region of
the United States participated in the study and provided responses to 15 semi-structured, openended interview questions. The data analysis process involved using NVivo 10 software to
organize the data seeking to identify emerging themes. The results of this study has the potential
to help academic leaders plan effective professional development for faculty members and
librarians on collaboration and embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate
curriculum. Chapter 5 includes the research questions, field test results, the study’s population
characteristics, data analysis procedures, a summary of the research findings, and emerging
themes. Chapter 5 also includes recommendations to leadership, suggestions for future research,
and a chapter 5 and dissertation summary.

116

Population Characteristics
The sample population for the study was recruited from a four-year private university
located in the Southeastern region of the United States that included eight instructors who teach
first year students and four librarians who have experience with first year curriculum design,
information literacy, and library instruction. Purposive sampling and the snowball sampling
approach were utilized to obtain the research sample group of 12 who met the criteria to
participate in the research study. Each participant was coded using an alphanumeric system to
protect and maintain individual confidentiality. There were four male participants and eight
female participants. Each of the 12 participants were White, ranged in age from the mid-twenties
to mid-sixties, and in total had an average of 22 years in higher education and the area of
information literacy as indicated in Table 1.
Field Test Results
The field test included two subject area professionals on information literacy and one
librarian. The two subject area professionals are noted authors on information literacy and the
librarian is from a private university located in the Southeastern region of the United States. The
librarian is not from the same private Southeastern university where the study was conducted.
Each of the three field test participants agreed that two of the initial interview questions were
redundant. As a result of the field test participants identifying two initial interview questions as
redundant, the researcher revised the two interview questions into one totally different question
to reflect what each of the individual questions was designed to ask. Two of the field test
participants offered that one of the initial interview questions seemed out of place and should be
moved in order for the questions to follow a logical and sequential order. As suggested by the
field test participants, that particular interview question was reassigned in order to follow a

117

logical and sequential order. However, each of the field test participants offered affirming
responses that the interview questions (Appendix B) were clear, understandable, and aligned
with the purpose of the research and each of the research questions of this study (Yin, 2009).
Data Analysis Procedures
The steps for organizing and analyzing the data of this qualitative exploratory single case
study began with organizing the data which proceeded into exploring and coding the data,
building themes based on the coding, and a presentation of the findings. Data for the study were
collected via face-to-face interviews, on-line interviews, and telephone interviews. The
interview process consisted of making sure the participants were comfortable with the process
and felt at ease to answer the interview questions. Each participant was reminded of the purpose
of the study, each participant was reminded that his or her participation in the study was
voluntary, and withdrawal from the research process was permitted at any time without penalty
or reprisal. Fifteen semi-structured, open-ended interview questions allowed each participant to
freely state views on embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum
and the importance of faculty and librarian collaboration. Each of the participant’s perceptions
of his or her experiences, ideas, and opinions was captured via audio-recorded interviews and
written field notes. The audio-recorded interviews were transcribed into a Word document and
imported into NVivo 10 software. The software was used and nodes were created based on the
collected data retrieved from the interview participants and then to identify themes based on the
data sets.
The purpose of the data analysis process was to find patterns and themes that derived
from the collected data provided by research participants in the study. According to Creswell
(2005), analyzing qualitative data involves an understanding of the data before attempting to

118

code and classify themes and patterns. Merriam (2009) stated that the purpose for analyzing data
is to make sense of the collected data. The first step involved in the data analysis process was to
search the raw data looking for any general terms and themes, which involves consolidation,
reducing, and interpreting the data (Merriam, 2009). Merriam also stated that ultimately the
purpose for the data analysis process is to answer the research question.
Although the data analysis process was not based on key word identification, but on thematic
analysis, the raw data was initially consolidated and placed into 23 nodes using key words in
attempts to determine frequent tendencies and possible themes. Nodes are created categories
based on frequently used words and phrases used by the research participants who were
interviewed. Upon analyzing the references from the interview responses that were placed into
the initial 23 nodes further analysis allowed the researcher to code the data, make reductions, and
create combinations that would result in identifying the six emerging themes (Table 2).
Coding
The purpose for coding the data was to construct a composite framework that
communicated the essence of what the data revealed (Rajendran, 2001). Nvivo 10 software was
crucial in searching raw data looking for key words that depicted possible patterns and themes
and to “facilitate the process of storing, analyzing, and sorting the data” (Creswell, 2005, p. 234).
Dividing the text into nodes helped to identify and code data and to dismiss data not relevant for
the study (Creswell, 2005) in order to create a matrix of recurring themes and general terms.
Upon identification of general terms and themes, the next step was to code the terms and themes.
The coding process generated several themes that emerged through the analysis of responses
from faculty and librarian responses concerning their individual perceptions of embedding
information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum and the importance of faculty and

119

librarian collaboration. The six major themes that emerged from the data were: (a) embedding
information literacy, (b) quality enhancement program, (c) institutional support for collaboration,
(d) collaboration between faculty and librarians, (e) curricula improvement, and (f) perceived
benefits. The themes are listed according to the order of discovery from the findings. The data
analysis process allowed synthesizing the information from the research participants to be place
in corresponding nodes thus facilitating the coding of themes relevant to the phenomenon under
study (Houser, 2008). The data analysis and coding techniques used were appropriate for this
single case qualitative exploratory study approach.
Research Questions
Yin (2009) stated that a research design could not be employed until an answerable
question has been formulated. The purpose of this qualitative exploratory single case study was
to explore the importance of faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information
literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum and consider how a first year undergraduate
curriculum embedded with information literacy supports first year undergraduate students with
their information literacy needs. Yin also stated that a researcher’s curiosity of a topic of interest
could raise potential research questions; however, it is the literature review on the topic that
assists the researcher in formulating substantially significant questions to further research. In
completing the literature review the researcher was able to formulate three Research Questions
(RQs), and two Sub-Research Questions (SRQs) that guided the study.
Research Question 1
The findings from the research established Theme 1: Embedding Information Literacy,
and answers RQ 1: Why is it necessary to embed information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum? Each of the study’s 12 participants agreed that embedding

120

information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum is essential for first year
undergraduate students. The participants used words like crucial, critical, essential, and
imperative to describe how they felt about information literacy being embedded into first year
undergraduate curriculum. One participant stated how information literacy is the groundwork
that all other course building blocks are built on and that every subject could have an information
literacy component.
Research Question 2
The second research question, RQ 2 asked: Why is collaboration between faculty and
librarians important for embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate
curriculum? is answered by the data that resulted in Theme 4: Collaboration between Faculty
and Librarian. Each of the 12 research participants was in overwhelming agreement that there is
indeed an ongoing need for faculty and librarian collaboration and its importance to first year
undergraduate students. One research participant stated how collaboration enables students to
effectively function in their courses, provides a better understanding of the course material, and
enables students to write better papers they are expected to write. Another participant declared
that faculty and librarian collaboration is important in order to balance the course material.
Research Question 3
Findings from the study and the research literature support and answer RQ 3: How does
collaboration between faculty and librarians embedding information literacy into first year
curriculum improve or impact the quality of the curriculum? Each of the 12 participants felt that
embedding information literacy into the curriculum would greatly improve the curricula’s
quality. One participant suggested that embedding information literacy sources within classes
and adding it to the curriculum is the component that would pull the students’ classes,

121

coursework, and homework assignments together across the board. Another participant implied
that a quality curriculum is one that contains embedded information literacy activities. A third
participant declared that embedding information literacy into first year curriculum would impact
the curriculum in a way that would give the students’ a better grasp on how to fulfill their
academic requirements. Theme 5: Curricula Improvement is a result of the study’s findings.
Sub-Research Questions 1 and 2
Findings from the participants’ responses suggested that SRQ 1: How and/or why are
higher education institutions responsible for embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum? and SRQ 2: How can higher education institutions approach the
problem of embedding information literacy into the first year undergraduate curriculum in order
to achieve the greatest amount of participation and greatest success? could have been combined
to create one sub-research question to reflect what each of the individual questions was designed
to ask. However, in asking the two sub-research questions separately, multiple themes were
established and the findings of the study provide sufficient answers to each of the individual subresearch questions.
When the participants were asked SRQ 1 and SRQ 2, most participants spoke about the
institution’s Quality Enhancement Plan. They commented that the QEP supports and expects
information literacy to be embedded into first year undergraduate curriculum and the need for
faculty and librarian collaboration; which reiterated Theme 1: Embedding Information Literacy
and established Theme 3: Institutional Support for Collaboration. The participants declared that
the QEP is the major driving force for curriculum input, embedding information literacy, and
collaboration between faculty and librarians. The participants’ declarations established Theme 2:

122

Quality Enhancement Plan, and reiterated the establishment of Theme 4: Collaboration between
Faculty and Librarians.
Each research and sub-research question was answered as a result of the findings in the
study and produced five specific themes. However, Theme 6: Perceived Benefits does not
support any of the research questions nor the sub-research questions on its own merit. It did
effectively answer interview question 15 that asked what benefits would students, faculty, and
librarians gain from a collaborative effort in embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum. Theme 6: Perceived Benefits is the apparent product of themes one
through five. The summary of the findings provides greater insight to each of the above research
and sub-research questions.
Summary of Findings
As a result of the imported 12 transcribed interviews using NVivo 10 software the
process of coding to nodes occurred. The nodes were created based on the characteristics and
recurring words from the study participant’s responses. Initially, there were 23 nodes created as
a result of collected responses made by the research participants in reference to the interview
questions. After the 23 nodes were analyzed further and consolidated, ultimately six nodes
remained which assisted in formulating the findings and discovering the emerging themes.
Analyzing data from the instructor’s and librarian’s responses allowed the identifying of six
emerging themes: (a) embedding information literacy, (b) quality enhancement plan, (c)
institutional support, (d) collaboration between faculty and librarians, (e) curricula improvement,
and (f) perceived benefits.

123

Theme 1: Embedding Information Literacy
The reviewed literature discussed the need for information literacy to be embedded into
first year undergraduate curriculum. Badke (2009) stated that information literacy should be
embedded in first year undergraduate curriculum because it is too much information for a onetime course or one-shot class visit from the librarian and it should be taught in substantial
portions of the existing curriculum. Thompson (2002) also stated that there are times when the
librarian only has that one opportunity to cover a wide range of topics and one hour is not
enough time to do so. Findings from the study are aligned with Badke’s and Thompson’s
statements. Participant L2 stated:
The librarians usually go into the classroom and teach students how to navigate the
library. The one-shot sessions are great if we can do that we are happy with that; I mean,
I’m not complaining, but you cannot teach information literacy in one class.
Participant I7 stated “It is very important to embed information literacy and for it to be on-going.
We should not consider it ‘one and done’.” In the literature review Badke (2009) also stated
“Information literacy is not remedial education it is foundational, necessary, and should be
embedded as an integral component of first year undergraduate curriculum” (p.49). Findings
from the study show that each of the study’s 12 participants agreed that embedding information
literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum is essential to the success of first year
undergraduate students. Participant I6 said, “I would say that information literacy is essential for
students, especially first year undergraduates. It's a crucial set of skills for students to have.”
Further findings from the study also aligned with Badke’s statement, Participant I3 stated:
It is essential for first year students to have information literacy embedded in the
curriculum because you’ve got to be able to access information all sorts of ways.

124

Increasingly, the technological means of getting information is becoming more and more
important. So I would say information literacy is vitally important for students to
understand how to do that.
Theme 1: Embedding Information Literacy sufficiently answered RQ 1: Why is it necessary to
embed information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum?
Theme 2: Quality Enhancement Plan
According to Keniston (1960) the goal of higher education is to develop student’s
growth, transforming students into individuals who are informed, responsible citizens, socially
prepared for society, and the marketplace. The four-year, private university located in the
Southeastern region of the United States where the research was conducted has a Quality
Enhancement Plan (QEP) in place that determines a majority of what goes into the course’s
curriculum. The QEP was designed to enhance the way students learn; the plan starts by linking
first year course assignments to information literacy and is also designed to link professional
awareness in critical thinking into first year courses. When the interview question was asked
concerning faculty having primary responsibility for the content, quality, and effectiveness of the
curriculum, there were some research participants who stated that the QEP was the major driving
force for curriculum input. This Southeastern university’s QEP program aligned with the
literature in the research. According to Thompson (2002) regional accreditation agencies has
established mandates for implementing information literacy into higher education programs
meaning that higher education institutions are accountable to ensure students are learning and
acquiring information literacy competencies to function effectively after graduation.
The reviewed literature also indicated that an acceptable institutional information literacy
solution requires top-down strategic initiatives implemented through bottom-up collaborations in

125

order to create learning atmospheres where students have the best possible learning experiences
(Mednick, 2002; Salisbury, et al., 2012). Participant L1 stated, “Information literacy has been
part of our quality enhancement plan for our accreditation, it (information literacy) is part of our
strategic goal and objective, so it is definitely something the university thinks is important.” One
participant also stated that the institution’s Dean of Academic Affairs fully supports the
collaboration process. Still another participant stated how the institution where the study was
conducted creates an atmosphere for collaboration and embedding information literacy. The
literature review further indicated that higher education institutions should focus on revising
existing first year undergraduate curriculum to promote and embed information literacy in a
manner that meets the needs of millenniums (Mandušić & Blašković, 2013; Dey, et al., 2010).
One research participant shared similar thoughts as Mandušić& Blašković and Dey, el al. and
strongly suggested that first year undergraduate curricula should be revamped to include
information literacy with faculty and librarians making in relevant inputs.
The responses provided by the research participants concerning the institution’s quality
enhancement plan are related to SRQ1: How and why are higher education institutions
responsible for embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum? and
SRQ2: How can higher education institutions approach the problem of embedding information
literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum in order to achieve the greatest amount of
participation and greatest success? This four-year, private Southeastern university has a Quality
Enhancement Plan in place to ensure information literacy is included in several of their first year
undergraduate courses.

126

Theme 3: Institutional Support for Collaboration
The reviewed literature indicated that Regional Accreditation agencies have established
mandates for implementing information literacy into higher education programs. Higher
education institutions are accountable to ensure students are learning and acquiring the
competencies to function effectively after graduation (Thompson, 2002). The Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) does not specifically
state information literacy as a specific standard in their mandate. It does, however, regard the
characteristics of information literacy as important (Brasley, 2008). The SACSCOC (2011)
specifically states that “the primary responsibility for curriculum content, quality, and
effectiveness lie with the faculty” (p. 29) and that “the institution is to provide adequate student
and faculty support, access to library collections, and other learning/information resources” (p.
20). This is a critical point because the research takes place in the Southeast Region of the
United States, where the SACSCOC has accreditation authority.
Research participants described how their institution is supportive and flexible in them
achieving the goal of faculty and librarian collaboration. One participant stated that the
supportiveness of the institution propels and encouraged the collaborative effort between faculty
and librarians. Findings of this study are similar to that of Ramaley’s (2014) conclusion that the
challenge for higher education institutions is to create an inspiring academic environment that
engages millenniums. Ramaley’s study also concluded that higher education institutions should
find meaningful ways to meet the educational needs of millenniums that go beyond the
formalities of higher education. Several participants indicated that their institution has created an
atmosphere for faculty and librarian collaboration and it is highly encouraged.
The findings of this study also aligned with Eland’s (2003) suggestion that infusing

127

information literacy across the entire curriculum should be the long-term goal of higher
education institutions. Eland further stated that this would only be possible if academic
librarians develop and then push information literacy instruction outward to the rest of the
curriculum. Several research participants spoke about the institution’s Quality Enhancement
Plan and how the plan is specifically concerned with librarians going into the first year
undergraduate classes to perform information literacy training with students. Both groups of
professionals in the study also stated how the QEP emphasizes the library’s role in teaching
information literacy skills. The reviewed literature for this study also mentioned that the
mandates made by the accreditation associations should remind faculty and librarians to
understand that partnerships are necessary to open professional and academic dialogue.
Collaboration and open dialogue are crucial for developing and embedding information
literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum and develops student’s research and learning
skills across a range of contexts and disciplines (Taib & Holden, 2013). One research participant
mentioned how the Dean of Academic Affairs supports faculty and librarian collaboration by
providing the head librarian time to share information during New Faculty Orientation. There
were several participants who expressed how they feel that the collaboration process is a
partnership and that continuous communication is key to achieving their goals. Findings from
this study supported the reviewed literature and answered SRQ 2: How can Higher Education
Institutions approach the problem of embedding information literacy into first year curriculum in
order to achieve the greatest amount of participation and greatest success?
Theme 4: Collaboration Between Faculty and Librarians
Through the collaborative process, faculty and librarians have the potential to design a
curriculum that embeds information literacy. Embedding information literacy would provide

128

students with progressive and perpetual standards that causes them to think more critically about
information, the process of locating information, and to conceptualize research in a broader sense
(Detmering & Johnson, 2011). Within the research literature review there was a concern for
faculty and librarian collaboration. Harmony, et al., (2010) stated that the primary focus and
importance for faculty and librarian collaboration is to embed information literacy into
undergraduate curriculum that will equip students for skills that apply in the classroom, the
workforce, their personal life, and the ability to function in a technologically oriented society.
Findings from this study indicated the same.
Participant L3 stated “Because instructors have their degrees in education, they know
how to teach but we know about information, how to evaluate and all that kind of stuff. So, if
we can come together we can help students survive once they graduate at their jobs.” Participant
I3 stated, “I can give the Librarians what they need to produce the products that they are trying to
help us with. I think that’s a good way to state how I see my part in the collaboration process. If
I can find a way to help the librarian understand better what it is I’m looking for that’s an aid in
the collaborative process.” According to Kenedy and Monty (2011), when the faculty member
defines the assignment(s) the librarian could design the resources needed for the research
process, which enables improved student performance, this is also cited in the literature review.
Participant L4 corroborated Kenedy and Monty’s (2011) statement and stated, “By collaborating,
the faculty member can have us custom fit our information literacy material to their curriculum
and classroom activities.” Participant L2 stated:
It can’t be just a librarian creating the curriculum because we don’t know the subject
matter we’re the generalists. We know the general information, we know the information
literacy tutorials and everything, but we don’t know how to sometimes take that and

129

apply it to the nursing research class. Faculty members know what they want specifically
applied to their curriculum and how it needs to be applied to their classroom.
The literature review further indicated that faculty and librarian collaboration is a
practical and logical partnership for oversight and responsibility for curriculum design of
individual subject matter (Salisbury, et al., 2012). Each professional has expertise in his or her
area of concentration and can benefit his or her peers or colleagues in solving the common
problems and frustrations of students who are below proficient information literacy skills and
library ineptitude. Findings from the study aligned with Salisbury, et al. as Participant I5
indicated, “We’re in partnership with the librarians and I feel like this is a joint effort on this
campus, so that also allows us to utilize the librarian’s expertise.” Participant I2 stated, “If we
work together and give the students entrée to these information literacy skills not only in one
class but in many classes, they become more adept and confident in using e-books, the Internet,
and databases, which are not the future but which are the present.” Participant I3 simply stated,
“Teamwork is good!”
In the reviewed literature Taib and Holden (2013) gave one explanation as to why faculty
and librarian collaboration is important. The authors stated it is necessary to open professional
and academic dialogue for developing first year undergraduate curriculum and embedding
information literacy for the development of student’s research and learning skill across a range of
contexts. Most of the research participant agreed with Taib and Holden’s explanation. Campbell
(2010) and Mednick (2002) also give reasons for the importance of faculty and librarian
collaboration. Campbell stated that while faculty may struggle on how to incorporate
information literacy into course curriculum, librarians could offer a great deal of assistance in
that area. Mednick stated that librarians have a unique role in education, they are considered

130

information specialists in the current digital society and their expertise should be utilized
accordingly. Each of the librarians who participated in this study agreed that he or she could and
are willing to assist faculty member and want to be utilized in this capacity. Findings from this
study supported the reviewed literature and answered RQ 2: Why is collaboration between
faculty and librarians important for embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum?
Theme 5: Curriculum Quality Improvement
The literature review addresses concerns for the quality of the curriculum. According to
Evans, Forney, and Guido-DiBrito (1988), the curriculum should cause students to be able to
increasingly master complex developmental tasks, achieve self-direction, and become
interdependent. Wong (2010) stated that students should be able to assess their information
needs through course curriculum and information literacy is the tool to assist students with their
informational needs. Responses from faculty and librarians alike aligned with Evan, Forney, and
Guido-DiBrito (1988), and Wong (2010), and indicated that embedding information literacy
sources within classes and adding it to the curriculum is just one more thing that pulls the
students’ classes, coursework, and homework assignments together, across the board.
Participants also implied that a quality curriculum is very important so that students
understand exactly how their papers are to be formatted. They suggested a curriculum that
requires students to frequent the library during the first few weeks of the course for
assignment(s) completion could potentially improve the curriculum’s quality. In responding to
the need for curriculum improvement participants suggested that the curriculum’s quality would
be improved by faculty and librarian collaboration to completely revamp the curriculum to
include information literacy. Participant L2 stated, “Faculty and librarians are the people who

131

are doing the teaching so we have to come together and make assignments not just for library use
but assignments that also cause students to use information literacy skills.”
The literature review indicated how designing course curricula that embeds information
literacy has the potential to facilitate student intellectual development, enhance critical thinking,
and prepare students for society and the marketplace (Evans, et al., 1998). Taib and Holden
(2013) suggested that ultimately, embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate
curriculum could potentially mean a total revision to current course curricula designs. One
librarian stated that there is a definite need for revamping and revising curricula. Marfleet and
Dille (2005) suggested that curriculum revisions could be achieved by transforming substantial
portions of existing courses’ written assignments to include information literacy dimensions.
Information literacy is learned through instruction and by doing (Badke, 2008).
In the findings of the study one of the research participants declared that the curriculum
has to be totally revamped by the faculty and librarians to include assignments that encourage
use of the library and information literacy. Findings from this study and the reviewed literature
supported and answered RQ 3: How does collaboration between faculty and librarians
embedding information literacy into first year curriculum improve or impact the quality of the
curriculum?
Theme 6: Perceived Benefits
The research participants for this study voiced many opinions on the benefits of
embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum and the importance of
faculty and librarian collaboration. However the statements of benefit were focused on the
benefits students would receive as an outcome. According to the reviewed literature for this
study Decarie (2012) stated that students who are knowledgeable with information literacy can

132

differentiate between primary and secondary sources of information and can differentiate
between credible and substantial information versus information that is faulty. Statements from
at least three faculty members and one librarian aligned with Decarie’s statement. Each of the
three faculty members and the librarian suggested that information literacy was an important
component in knowing how to locate information and evaluate it. The responses from those
participants also acknowledged that students would use the Internet long after they have
completed their college courses and they should know the importance of how to use the Internet
and interpret and evaluate information that is credible versus information that is not. Information
literacy encourages the student to reconsider course assignments not only as merely a process of
collecting information, but as a tool to enhance formulating his or her own perspectives, create
new perspectives, or reinforce preexisting notions (McBride, 2012). Research Participants I8
concurred with Mcride (2012) stating:
Knowing the tools of information literacy students are hopefully going to be able to think
a little bit better, they are going to be able to express themselves a little better in writing
and in speech, think a little more clearly about issues, and understand that there are
people with different points of view.
The literature review further indicated that information literacy is a benefit for the
students’ academic world, their world of work, as well as their personal world and how it is
essential for intellectual development, and a platform for life-long learning (Wong, 2010;
Decarie, 2012). Data from the study aligned with Wong and Decarie as one research participant
suggested that students must succeed at their information literacy skills to be successful in life.
Decarie also stated, “Without this ability, we cannot move forward” (p. 167). Findings from the
study also aligned with Decarie as one participant stated that “Information literacy is imperative,

133

a huge component of how to succeed, and one cannot function without information literacy.”
Information literacy is not just an application of a formal educational environment. Information
itself has become a major societal commodity. Information literacy is important in education as
it applies to all disciplines, every learning environment, and every level of education and it is an
important component of everyday life (Boeriswati, 2012). Research Participants L2 and L3
echoed Boeriswati’s statement and suggested that information literacy reaches across all
disciplines, it can be a component of every subject, and is necessary and essential at all levels of
education as people have the need of information every day.
Recommendations for Leaders
When higher education institutions begin to fully understand the importance of
embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum and the importance of
faculty and librarian collaboration, the institution can begin to implement professional
development programs to facilitate that particular goal. The four-year, private university located
in the Southeastern region of the United States where the research was conducted has a Quality
Enhancement Program in place to facilitate embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate courses as well as to facilitate faculty and librarian collaboration. The mission
statement of this institution states that they provide a broad-based core curriculum that promotes
critical thinking, skills for life-long learning, and developing the requisites to pursue and
appreciate knowledge. Information literacy is not specifically mentioned in this institution’s
mission statement; however, it is implied by what is contained in the broad-based curriculum
they provide.
In comparing the findings of this study with the reviewed literature various
recommendations can be made. When a higher education institution’s mission focuses on what

134

core curricula should contain either specifically expressed or implied it becomes a goal for the
institution to ensure that it is doing everything necessary to make that goal a reality. Therefore,
the first recommendation is to incorporate a program that promotes embedding information
literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum. The second recommendation is to mandate
faculty and librarian collaboration for the purpose of embedding information literacy in first year
undergraduate curriculum. The third recommendation is to provide information literacy as a
course for credit. The fourth and final recommendation is for higher education institutions to
implement a professional development program for faculty and librarians on information literacy
and embedding information literacy in first year undergraduate curriculum. Each of these
recommendations could prove to be beneficial to higher education institutions.
Suggestions for Future Research
The reviewed literature and the findings of this study provided enough evidence to prove
there is a need of faculty and librarian collaboration. Kenedy and Monty (2011) stated that the
literature on faculty and librarian collaboration is limited, as are data on faculty and librarian
partnerships in the collaboration process. Latham, Gross, and Witte (2013) stated that the
education literature contains reports of studies on teacher-to-teacher collaboration; however,
teacher-librarian collaboration has not received as much attention and that “widespread success
in achieving teacher-librarian collaboration has been limited as best” (p. 3).
The first recommendation for further research is for continued qualitative research on
faculty and librarian collaboration in more than one institution. One assumption made by the
researcher was that the experiences of the librarian’s and faculty members who participated in
this study would be reflective of other first year undergraduate faculty members and librarians.
This assumption could not be substantiated in this study since the study consisted of one higher

135

education institution. This type of research also has the potential to greatly contribute to the
current limited research literature available on faculty and librarian collaboration in higher
education institutions. Further research on faculty and librarian collaboration has the potential
to facilitate a better understanding of how faculty and librarians can best collaborate on
designing a first year undergraduate curricula that would embed information literacy. MontielOverall (2010) stated that there was almost no information available concerning teachers’
awareness of librarians as collaborative partners or librarian potential in developing and
implementing curricula. A key finding reported by Montiel-Overall was that considerable effort
would have to be made for understanding the importance for teacher and librarian collaboration
and how library instruction affects student learning. This study’s findings on the importance on
faculty and librarian collaboration are in agreement with the statements made by those authors.
A second recommendation for further research is to conduct a qualitative study on how
faculty and librarian collaboration affects student-learning outcomes. This type of research has
the potential to not only focus on the collaborative process; it also focuses on potential student
benefits as a result of the collaborative process. This type of study can also be conducted using
the quantitative method of research. The third recommendation for further qualitative research is
to consider how to approach the dynamics of embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curriculum. This type of study has the potential to redesign how first year
undergraduate curriculum is developed. The fourth and final recommendation is for a
quantitative research study that compares the effectiveness of faculty and librarian collaboration
in large public higher education institutions versus small or mid-sized private institutions. This
type of study has the potential to offer statistical evidence on the perceived differences each type
of institution may have concerning faculty and librarian collaboration.

136

Study’s Strengths
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory single case study was to explore the
importance of faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into first
year undergraduate curriculum and consider how a first year undergraduate curriculum
embedded with information literacy supports first year undergraduate students with their
information literacy needs. The findings of this study suggest that the purpose of this study was
achieved and strengthened based on the responses received from the 12 research participants
who were faculty members and librarians from the four-year, private Southeastern university
where the study was conducted. The purpose of this study was also strengthened when all of the
research participants agreed that embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate
curriculum as well as faculty and librarian collaboration is indeed necessary and essential. The
12 research participants further agreed that embedding information literacy into first year
undergraduate curricula and faculty and librarian collaboration would indeed benefit students
and support their information literacy needs. The faculty members and librarians who
participated in this research implied that the process of embedding information literacy into first
year undergraduate curriculum is the component of the collaborative process and has great
potential in facilitating student success. The reviewed literature also suggested that faculty
members and librarians are well equipped to collaborate and have the ability to produce a quality
first year undergraduate curriculum that is relevant and add value to information literacy
(Brasley, 2008). Finally, each of the three research and two sub-research questions were
successfully answered. Five of the six emerging themes were directly relevant to the research
and sub-research questions.

137

Study’s Weaknesses
Considering the purpose of this study there were several assumptions made. One of those
assumptions was that the responses from faculty members and librarians in this study would be
reflective of other first year undergraduate instructors and librarians responses. The findings of
this study could not substantiate that assumption because the sample population consisted only of
one higher education institution used in this study. Had there been more than one institution
used in this study that assumption would have been either substantiated or unsubstantiated.
The research also noted another weakness in this study concerning barriers to faculty and
librarian collaboration and overcoming those barriers. The reviewed literature indicated that
some of the barriers to the collaboration process are that librarians rarely have the opportunity to
participate in the curricula design process or that librarians are seldom in the position of strength
when dealing with faculty members. Other barriers mentioned in the reviewed literature are that
of time constraints, perceived added workloads, and difficulty in the communication process.
There were only a couple of research participants who addressed the issue of time constraints
and the perception of an added workload. The other participants felt that barriers to the
collaboration process were of no consequence in the institution where the study was conducted.
Perhaps this is due to the institutions Quality Enhancement Plan.
The four-year, private university located in the Southeastern region of the United States
where the study was conducted has a Quality Enhancement Plan in place, which is designed to
enhance the way students learn. The plan starts by linking first year course assignments to
information literacy and is also designed to link professional awareness in critical thinking into
first year courses. Although there were a couple of research participants who addressed time
constraints and the perception of an extra-added workload, each participant stated how the
138

Quality Enhancement Plan expects and encourages collaboration between faculty members and
the librarians.
Study’s Relevance To Conceptual Framework
This qualitative exploratory single case was underpinned by the constructivist theory.
The constructivist theory was selected because as indicated by Bealle (2010), constructivism is a
well-suited vehicle for imparting information literacy and Mcbrided (2011-2012) also concluded
that constructivism provides the framework to facilitate students becoming active learning
participants. Most of the research participants implied in their responses how information
literacy activities in the curriculum causes the student to become engaged in their own learning.
Cited in the literature review, in Freire’s (1993) Pedagogy of the Oppressed, he stated that
students should not be considered mere empty receptacles for instructors to deposit information.
However, there should be an exchange of ideas between instructors and students, student’s
curiosities should be sparked, and their creativeness should become unlocked.
Information literacy requires a more complex method of thinking that enables an
individual to assimilate new information that will either substantiate, adjust, or modify existing
thoughts or ideas with the newfound information (Orme, 2008). One research participant
mentioned how information literacy will facilitate critical thinking and help students to consider
someone else’s opinion even if it is different from theirs. According to Brasley, 2008 and
Dennick, 2012, faculty and librarian collaboration and implementation of curriculum focusing on
research processes and effective techniques for search, retrieval, and evaluation of information
sources have the potential to stimulate meaning and understanding of information literacy.
Constructivist learning has the potential to transform the student from a passive learner to
a learner who is an active participant in his or her own learning process (Concept to Classroom,
139

2004). Salisbury et al, (2012) stated that the constructivist approach is what will allow the
student to build on his or her pre-existing knowledge of information literacy as he or she
becomes engaged with the courses learning activities. Hein (1991) stated in one of his principles
of constructivist thinking that an individual has to already have knowledge in order to learn new
knowledge. Hein’s theory is that the more one knows the more one can learn and assimilate new
knowledge to pre-existing knowledge. Piaget’s (1952) theory on constructivism believed that
individuals achieve growth and development through assimilation and accommodation
(teAchnology, 1999-2015). Assimilation occurs when individuals incorporate new knowledge or
experiences into past knowledge. Experiences and accommodation causes individuals to have to
reinterpret new knowledge or experiences into what was already mentally contained
(teAchnology, 1999-2015). Two of Chickering’s seven vectors of student development include
the student developing competence and the student moving though autonomy toward
interdependence (Evans, et al., 1988). According to Andrews and Patil (2007) and Lupton
(2004), information literacy should be treated as the backbone to the development of critical
thinking; it supports critical thinking and reflects the vast amount of information available
through a wide range of technologies. One research participant stated how he is always
challenging his students to think critically, broaden their views, and consider alternate
perspectives. Evans, et al. stated how student development is among the priorities of higher
education institution and that its theories focus on intellectual growth and behavioral changes
that occur in students over the course of their college years. Information literacy has the
potential to develop student’s cognitive skills and ignite their critical thought processes that are
necessary when considering the best information to use (Decarie, 2012).

Chapter Summary
Chapter 5 included the study’s sample population, population characteristics, data
analysis procedures, and field test findings. The summary of research findings,
recommendations to leaders, and suggestions for future research, the study’s, strengths and
weaknesses, the study’s relevance to the conceptual framework, and a chapter summary were
also included in chapter 5.
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory single case study was to explore the
importance of faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into first
year undergraduate curriculum and to consider how a first year undergraduate curriculum
embedded with information literacy supports first year undergraduate students with their
information literacy needs. The sample population of 12 research participants was recruited
from a four-year, private university located in the Southeastern region of the United States. The
characteristics of the sample population consisted of eight faculty members and four librarians,
eight females and four males, with an average of 22 years in the field of education.
The six major themes that emerged from faculty members and librarian’s data were: (a)
embedding information literacy, (b) quality enhancement plan, (c) institutional support for
collaboration, (d) collaboration between faculty and librarians, (e) curriculum quality
improvement, and (f) perceived benefits. There were four recommendations for leadership that
emerged as a result of this study, one of which is to incorporate a program that promotes
embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum. There were also four
suggestions for future research studies based on the findings from this study, one of which is
continued qualitative research on faculty and librarian collaboration.

141

The issue according to Gross and Latham (2011), which points to the general problem, is
that first year undergraduate students do not value the process of locating information. They
view locating information only as a product, thus, making the embedding of information literacy
in the undergraduate curriculum a necessity. The specific problem, also noted by Gross and
Latham, is the need to better understand how faculty and librarians can best collaborate on
designing a first year undergraduate curriculum that embeds information literacy into the
undergraduate curriculum, which would address the general issue. One of the four
recommendations as a result of this study is for higher education institutions to implement a
program that promotes embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum.
This recommendation was made considering the effectiveness of such a program in the
institution where the study was conducted. If faculty and librarian collaboration for the purpose
of embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate curriculum is mandated by an
institution the general and specific problem has the potential to be addressed greatly and
diminished. In 2009 Badke stated that information literacy should be projected as a core
foundational component of first year undergraduate curriculum because the information age is
too complex and too important to all of us for half measures.
Information literacy has the potential to develop student’s cognitive skills and ignite
critical thought processes that are necessary when considering the best information to use
(Decarie, 2012). Information literacy benefits the students’ academic world, work world, and
their personal world (Decarie, 2012). The desired impact for information literacy is for students
to become more self-reliant, have the ability to manage their own learning (Boerswati, 2012). It
is also a desired impact that students have the ability to make wiser information retrieval choices
according to McBride (2012). Information literate students are able to locate information,

142

evaluate it, determine if the information meets their needs, and then make informed decisions
based on the information. Decarie stated, “Without this ability, we cannot move forward” (p.
167). Wong (2010) posited that information literacy is essential to intellectual development,
critical thinking, and life-long learning.
The findings from this study, based on the responses from the sample population of
faculty members and librarians from this four-year, private university in the Southeastern region
of the United States agreed that embedding information literacy into first year undergraduate
curriculum is essential and collaboration is absolutely important to establish a balanced
curriculum. Each participant echoed the sentiment that communication is the key to
collaboration and that collaboration is a necessity as well as embedding information literacy into
first year undergraduate curriculum. As one participant concluded: “Embedding information
literacy into first year curriculum and faculty and librarian collaboration results in a win-win-win
situation.”

Invitation Letter
Good day to you prospective research participant,

My name is Lisa Marie Anderson. I am a student at the University of Phoenix working on my
Doctorate in Higher Education Administration. As part of my dissertation, I am conducting a
research study entitled “Embedding Information Literacy And The Importance of Faculty and
Librarian Collaboration: A Qualitative Case Study”. The qualitative case study explores why
embedding information literacy in first year undergraduate curriculum is important, the
importance of faculty and librarian collaboration on embedding information literacy into first
year undergraduate curriculum, and how a first year undergraduate curriculum embedded with
information literacy supports first year undergraduate students with their information literacy
needs.
The criteria for participating in the study are that you are an instructor with two or more years
experience teaching first year students and librarians who have experience with first year
curriculum design, information literacy, and library instruction. The interview would take place
in a mutually agreed upon location and time, consist of 15 questions, with an estimated interview
time of 45 minutes to an hour. If you fall into either of those two categories and are interested in
participating and/or have any questions concerning the research study, please call me, Lisa Marie
Anderson at 678-392-xxxx or via email at xx@phoenix.edu.

Thank you for your time and your consideration,
Lisa Marie Anderson
