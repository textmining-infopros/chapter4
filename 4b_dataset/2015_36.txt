DEDICATION
I dedicate my dissertation to my oldest sister, Linda Joyce, who was my biggest
cheerleader. Linda was a registered nurse when she passed away o f a heart attack in
2000 at the young age o f 49. How ironic that the cause o f her passing was a heart attack.
Linda had a heart so big that she selflessly gave o f herself to her family, friends, and even
strangers. As my big sister, Linda often told me, “Shirley, you can do it.” She repeatedly
told me that I could do anything. Her belief in me and her constant encouragement
boosted my esteem and shaped me into the person that I believe in whom she would be
proud. During my doctoral journey, my energy and enthusiasm sometimes waned. But I
would hear Linda’s voice whispering, “Shirley, you can do it.” Therefore, it is with great
humbleness, gratitude, and love, that I dedicate this work to my big sister, Linda Joyce
Harrison Bell Dixon. I will miss her for as long as I live.

ABSTRACT
Dickerson, Shirley H., The emotional memories o f selected veteran academic librarians:
Their lived experiences in the 20th century academic library. Doctor o f Education
(Educational Leadership), December, 2015, Sam Houston State University, Huntsville,
Texas.
Purpose
The purpose o f the phenomenological study was to examine the perceptions and
lived experiences o f selected veteran academic librarians who experienced dramatic
periods o f change in librarianship over the past three decades, which were largely
influenced by technology.
Methods
Moustakas's (1994) qualitative transcendental phenomenological research method
was used to examine the emotional memories o f five veteran academic librarians through
their lived experiences in the 20th century academic library. Individual interviews were
conducted with the five veteran academic librarians who met specified selection criteria.
Interviews were recorded and transcribed with consent. Data were analyzed using a
phenomenological reduction process.
Findings
Data analysis resulted in three major themes, wherein several corresponding
subthemes also emerged. The three themes and the constructed meanings were: (a) shifts
in role o f the academic library organization (i.e., academic libraries reconceive and
reconstruct the ways in which they support faculty and students in research and
education); (b) shifts in the role o f the academic librarian (i.e., the 21st century academic
librarian must possess combined research and technology skills); and (c) emotional
memories o f the veteran academic librarian (i.e., what do the selected veteran academic

librarians for this study recall from their 30 plus years career as an academic librarian?).
Implications and recommendations for practice and future research are discussed.
KEY WORDS: Academic librarian, Academic libraries. Emotional memories,
Organizational identity, Affective events theory. Library transformation

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
My life has been greatly enriched by scores o f wonderful people who supported
me throughout my doctoral journey. I cannot imagine completing this journey without
their love, friendship, mentorship, and support. I was especially blessed to have an
awesome access to faculty members on my dissertation committee who shared their
professional experiences and insights in support o f my study. Dr. Rebecca Bustamante,
my committee chairperson, was a huge inspiration to me, never failing to lift my spirit
and encourage me whenever I waivered. With fondness, I recall her high energy and
engaging leadership during a university-sponsored trip to Costa Rica in 2012. Rather
than allowing me to retreat behind my apprehensions on that trip, she compelled me, in a
noncritical way, to confront them and to enjoy the journey. It was during this trip that I
was drawn to her genuine and caring nature. Dr. Bustamante’s constant encouragement
caused my qualms and fears during that trip to take flight. I also owe immense gratitude
to my other committee members, Dr. Judith Nelson and Dr. Holly Weimar. I did not
have a prior relationship with them, yet, they were willing to commit their time and
expertise in developing my dissertation. They meticulously read through several drafts of
my dissertation, offering valuable feedback with each pass. I will forever be grateful for
their professional support.
Throughout my doctoral journey, I encountered many wonderful professors who
left a lasting impression on me. However, I would like to especially acknowledge Dr.
Anthony J. Onwuegbuzie who taught several my doctoral courses. Dr. Onwuegbuzie
consistently demonstrated a tremendous work ethic that was characterized as credibility,
accountability and professionalism toward research and scholarship. Under his tutelage, I

had the opportunity to co-write and present with him and my doctoral cohorts at regional,
national and international conferences. While I conducted my study, I appreciated the
rigorous manner in which he taught his courses and his elevated expectation for
professionalism.
I am indebted to the veteran academic librarians for their enthusiasm and
willingness to take part in my study. Their openness in sharing their experiences was
regaling as I nostalgically listened to their early career experiences which were similar to
my own. I am also very appreciative o f my transcriptionist, Jared McNeely, who is a
graduate student at Stephen F. Austin State University. He delivered quality transcripts
within the requested timeframe. My life has been tremendously enriched through the
friendship formed with the doctoral students in Cohort 24. We laughed and cried
together, studied together into the wee hours o f the morning, and missed time with our
families in pursuit of a common goal. We often reminded each other that we had
embarked on a bird by bird journey. We have formed a lifelong bond as friends and
colleagues that I will always cherish. Cohort 24 rocks!
Words cannot begin to express my eternal gratitude to my family. I want to
express a special love and appreciation to my mother, Jessie Berry, who told me that I
should seize the opportunity to begin this journey regardless o f my stage in life. She kept
up with my progress throughout the doctoral journey, reminding me along the way that
she was looking forward to the day when I would reach my goal. She believed in me and
propelled me forward by elevating her expectations o f me. My mother, along with my
four sisters and three brothers cheered me along the way, doing whatever I asked o f them
to help me along the way. My father, Arthur L. Harrison, Sr., passed year and half before

my dream was realized. As an adult child, whenever I telephoned him, he would say to
me, “I was just thinking about you.” And my heart would sing.
My utmost heartfelt appreciation goes to my husband o f 40 years, Mark
Dickerson. He supported me by providing me with the space and time to do whatever I
needed to do. A man o f few words, he demonstrated his and love support in his actions.
I appreciate the love and support o f our three adult children, Marcherie, Ashlee, and
Aaron, and their spouses for believing in me. I want to thank our seven grandchildren for
their loving, excited spirits for not thinking it strange that their Grandest was still a
student. I knew they were watching me; therefore, my desire to succeed was greatly
increased. Finally, I give honor to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for giving me the
strength to make it across the finish line. He surrounded me with His circle o f love and
protection and granted me unmerited favor throughout my doctoral journey.

CHAPTER I
Introduction
Our memory is our coherence, our reason, our feeling, even our action. Without it
we are nothing. — Luis Bunuel (Hedges, 2005).
In the wake o f constant change in the library profession, veteran academic
librarians struggled to redefine their role on the university campus and to maintain the
library’s time-honored position as the ‘heart o f the university’ (Euster, 1995, p. 2; Gyure,
2008, p. 107).) As the function o f university libraries and librarians’ roles continue to
change, there is an evident need to explore how constant flux and innovations have
influenced librarians’ perceptions and emotions, and capture the historical perspectives o f
veteran librarians. Daring speculation about how technology would transform libraries
was a topic o f much discussion even before the existence o f computers in libraries (e.g.
Licklider, 1965; Young, 2008). As early as 1945, Vannevar Bush, the director o f the
U.S. Office o f Scientific Research and Development during World War II, envisioned the
memex, an information storage device o f that era, as being used to classify and to retrieve
information in unprecedented ways (Sapp & Gilmour, 2002). Much like Vannevar Bush,
J.C.R. Licklider, nicknamed “Computing’s Johnny Appleseed,” speculated about
graphical computing, point-and-click interfaces, digital libraries, and other ideas that
have since materialized in the digital age o f libraries (Waldrop, 2000). Much o f the
technology that librarians now take for granted can be credited to the vision o f Licklider
(1965), who believed that computers would “rescue the human minds from its
enslavement by mundane detail” (p. 68). Licklider believed that humans and computers
were destined to unite in an almost mystical symbiotic relationship. After working for

2

the National Security Agency during the early years o f the computer age, Henriette D.
Avram accepted a job at the Library o f Congress. Avram had no background in library
work, yet she was tasked with developing an automated cataloging format where none
had existed. She accomplished this groundbreaking technology by combining two
complex fields, computer programming and intricate cataloguing practices, to complete
the Machine Readable Cataloguing (MARC) Project which was piloted from 1966 to
1968. The MARC system quickly revolutionized the way in which libraries throughout
the country and, ultimately around the globe, approached cataloging o f print materials
(Schudel, 2006).
The purview o f the 20th-century academic librarian was to “protect the books and
to exercise control over their use” (Shores, 1935, p. 146). The role o f the librarian had
been elevated to a service profession, a rank that did not exist until the late 19th century.
In the 1700s, academic libraries were single rooms and evolved to freestanding libraries
in the 1800s. However, changes in higher education after the Civil War spurred the
development o f large, prominent libraries, centrally located on campuses, intended to
symbolize the “ heart o f the university” (Gyure, 2008, p. 107). The period between
1890 and 1940 was considered the university library’s “ golden age” (p. 119). The
university library building o f great size, prominent, decorated entries, elevated platforms,
grand interior staircases, and neoclassical or colonial revival styles, were erected on
prime sites on university campuses. A larger library building showcased the university’s
growing commitment to accumulating facts and producing knowledge (Gyure, 2008).
Even with the presence o f stately, pristine library buildings, libraries played a relatively
minor part in the university’s overall educational mission (Gyure, 2008). Melvil Dewey

3

recognized that the librarian could not afford to become stagnant in their role and issued a
challenge to the profession to assume an expanded role beyond merely keeping and
preserving books.
Dewey (1876) preached to the librarian profession that it is not enough that the
books are cared for properly, are well arranged, and are never lost. It is not enough if the
librarian can readily produce any book requested. It is not enough that he can, when
asked, give advice as to the best books in his collection on any given subject. He must
put every facility in the way o f the readers, so that they shall be led on from good to
better. He must teach them how, after studying their own wants, they may themselves
select their reading wisely (Dewey, 1876, pp. 5-6). When Dewey issued this challenge to
librarians to become educators, it was initially met with resistance. However, the impetus
to change in the profession’s perception o f their role began when Dewey established the
first American school for library science at Columbia University in 1887. With this
seminal event, the academic library began its first paradigmatic shift from the keeper of
the books to greater involvement in developing its user services (i.e., bibliographic
instruction, instruction in the use o f the library, and how to conduct research). The period
beginning in the m id-193 Os to the 1960s can be characterized as the period when the role
o f the academic librarian became more closely aligned with the academic mission o f the
college and university, which was to educate students. An information explosion after
World War II meant that librarians had to cope with new and different kinds o f materials.
Librarians shifted their philosophy from the conservation o f materials on library shelves
to the utilization o f library materials for research and scholarship (Atkins, 1991). The
complexity and specialization o f the library organization grew as research publications

4

increased and the responsibility o f collection development (i.e., selection o f library
resources) transferred from the university faculty to the librarian (Rice-Lively & Racine,
1997).
Some o f the early adaptations o f technology into the library environment occurred
with (a) typewriters (i.e., increased productivity and standard readability); (b) telephones
(i.e., facilitated communications with external library users); (c) reprography (i.e.,
forerunner o f the copier machine); and (d) film and audio recordings (allowed libraries to
handle images and sound in addition to text) (Tychoson, 1997). Technological
innovations were ongoing and, with the development o f telecommunications technology
in the mid-1960s, librarians were able to use computers to remotely access data located
outside o f the library. The application o f telecommunications technology offered a new
way for academic librarians to begin to serve library users. Early technological
advancement significantly influenced library services and signaled an irreversible
convergence o f technology with librarianship. The clarion call to the library profession
to take note o f the emergence o f technology could not go unheeded as technology began
to undo the established behaviors and functions o f the academic librarian. Speculation
turned into realization as early as the mid-1960s as technology altered academic library
routines and services (Rice-Lively & Racine, 1997). During this period, the academic
library was ushered into the age o f automation with the debut o f events outlined in Table

1.

Lancaster (1978), a professor in the Graduate School o f Library Science at the
University o f Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, forecasted the transformation o f libraries into
a paperless society by the end o f the 20th century in his publication, Toward Paperless
Information Systems. Lancaster predicted a possible withering o f libraries, with
librarians assuming redefined roles in “libraries without walls” (Young, 2008, p. 844).
Although Lancaster’s predictions were considered radical during that time period, many
have since realized that Lancaster’s predictions were on course in determining the impact
technology would have on libraries (Sapp & Gilmour, 2002).
Lancaster (1978) was troubled by librarians’ uninterested response to the spread
o f technology and its implications for the library profession. He pled with the profession
to plan for the arrival o f new technologies, otherwise, be caught unawares and

6

overwhelmed by the chaos o f change. In his effort to get the attention o f the profession,
Lancaster (1978) issued the following admonition:
We cannot bury our heads in the sand. We may choose to ignore the electronic
world, but this will not make it go away. Now is the time for responsible
organizations to study the implications o f the rapid technological changes that are
occurring for the operations o f publishers, primary and secondary, for the
operations o f libraries and information centers, and for the individual scientist as
producer and user o f information. If we do not plan now for the years ahead, we
may find that transition to be one o f disruption and chaos rather than one o f
ordered evolutionary progress (p. 166).
Lancaster (1978) was very critical o f many library administrators who foolishly
assumed that future technologies would accommodate traditional library services and
collections. He accused the profession at large as being extremely myopic, ignoring the
social and economic implications o f technology. Lancaster (1985) continued to reiterate
his prophecies in the professional literature. In fact, he believed that the evolution toward
a paperless library was proceeding more rapidly than he had forecasted a decade earlier.
Personal computers were increasingly commonplace, as was electronic mail. Electronic
research databases allowed users easier access to information including newspapers,
scholarly journals, and encyclopedia emerged in the electronic environment. For the first
time, libraries offered a high level o f literature searching support to its users (Lancaster,
1985).
Whether in whole or part, many o f the predictions o f F. W. Lancaster (1978)
regarding the impact o f information technologies on academic libraries have come to

7

pass, no one was able to predict with any certainty the accumulative and holistic effects
on the library profession, either substantially or sequentially. The predictions were a
source o f great hope and equally great consternation (Sapp & Gilmour, 2002).
Regardless, one prediction has failed to manifest— libraries have not become museums
(Martin, 2001).
Lancaster (1999) expressed a lack o f enthusiasm for technological developments
and their implications for the library profession. In fact, he was downright hostile to
some o f these changes because he saw them as a trend toward dehumanization.
Lancaster (1999) further criticized library professionals for greatly exaggerating the
benefits o f technology in the area subject access. The researcher observed that the
paperless society that Lancaster (1978) predicted had arrived, and ironically, extorted an
emotional toll on the predictor. Lancaster (1999) asserted that the library profession
perceived technology to be glamorous, with the promise o f improving the librarian’s
image, status, and even salary. In fact, Lancaster (1999) believed that technology was an
endangerment to the library profession. De Solla Price (1979) and Roma Harris (1992)
echoed Lancaster’s (1999) concern that concentration on technology approaches caused
other areas o f expertise to deteriorate. De Solla Price (1979) asserted that technology
alone would not improve the perceived value o f library services to its users. Harris
(1992) used the term de-professionalization to signify what occurred when a profession
lost control over its knowledge base and its service ideal. Lancaster (1999) cited a
greater concern regarding the loss o f the ethic o f public service, i.e., concern o f the needs
and behaviors o f library users, o f interpersonal skills, and overall, the dehumanization o f
libraries.

8

Musman (1993) concluded his article that the most important innovation within
the library profession would be a change in attitude. In his book titled, Technological
innovations in libraries, 1860-1960: An anecdotal history, Musman (1993) assessed 100
years o f innovation in libraries, and chronicled some o f the attitudes o f librarians toward
technological change and the role innovations have played in shaping the development o f
library processes and services. He found that librarian were wary o f the new
technological advances in the early 20th century, believing that automobiles, movies, and
televisions would have a negative impact on reading. Musman (1993) learned that
librarians believed that the book represented the embodiment o f knowledge and that
technologies were distractions that did not bode well for the health o f society.
Statement of the Problem
The integration o f technology in the academic library throughout the last quarter
o f the 20th century unleashed predictions about the fate o f the library academy. The
litany o f predictions, speculations, and cautions voiced included:
Libraries will become museums. Libraries won’t contain books anymore;
everything will be in electronic form. Users o f information won’t come to
libraries any longer, because they will be able to access all the information they
need from their homes, dorm rooms, or offices. Libraries in universities will be
under the control o f the chief information officers or heads o f computing centers.
Libraries without walls will pervade. Publishers and other producers o f
information will bypass libraries to sell information directly to the end users.
Owners o f information will use the power o f computers to charge “by the
drink”— the honorable tradition o f public libraries (or academic libraries, for that

9

matter) providing reading matter to their entire communities, regardless o f ability
to pay, will be eroded (Martin, 2001, p. v).
Campbell (2006) asserted that the extraordinary pace in which information is
moving to the web makes it difficult to imagine the future o f the academic library in
another decade. In spite o f the academic library’s efforts to remain relevant, reports (e.g.,
Online Computer Library Center (OCLC)), are alarming in their assessment o f the
erosion o f the library’s place in the hearts and minds o f library users (Wood, Miller, &
Knapp, 2007). Many o f Lancaster’s (1978) prophecies about the impact o f technologies
in the library organization have come to pass (Sapp & Gilmour, 2002).
Much has been written about the evolving library organization and the
transformed roles o f academic librarians (e.g., Maloney, Stoffle, Morden, & Allen, 2003;
Michalak, 2012; Sapp & Gilmour, 2002; Sapp & Gilmour, 2003; Seal, 2001; Troll, 2002;
Young, 2008); yet, a paucity of research exists regarding the emotional memories of
research librarians whose careers were engulfed in a culture o f incessant change,
particularly in the last two decades. Smith’s (2013) dissertation research examined oral
histories from the Capturing Our Stories: A National Oral History Program o f Retired
and Retiring Librarians through the lens o f social or collective memory studies identified
elements o f the social memory o f librarianship from the last half o f the twentieth century
by collecting and examining thirty-four oral history interviews o f librarians at the end o f
their careers. Sapp and Gilmour (2003), Maloney, et al. (2003) even dared to
characterize the state o f librarianship as a crisis. Rahm Emmanuel, the former Obama
administration White House Chief o f Staff and the sitting mayor o f Chicago, Illinois has
been attributed with the saying, “You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I

10

mean by that is it’s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before”
(Shapiro, 2010, para 2). F. W. Lancaster continually implored the library profession to
confront the core question— can libraries survive in a largely electronic world (Young,
2008)? Moreover, there is a need to further explore and understand the perspectives and
experiences o f librarians because their voices were on the front lines o f change. The
veteran academic librarian’s memories are critical for understanding the personal and
organizational impact o f technology in the library. In addition to the historical value o f
the first-hand accounts o f the librarians who are at the threshold o f retirement, university
librarians’ memories o f the library in the midst o f technology-driven organizational
climate change could lead to greater sensitivity o f organizational managers in higher
education.
Methodological Framework
The methodological framework for the study was based on the 13-step
methodological framework for qualitative research, illustrated in Figure 1 (Onwuegbuzie
et al., 2012). The researcher observed steps 1- to 13 o f Onwuegbuzie’s et al. (2012)
methodological framework which addressed: (1) the goal o f the study; (2) the research
objective(s); (3) the rationale o f study; (4) the research purpose; (5) the research
question(s); (6) the qualitative sampling framework; (7);the qualitative research design;
(8) the data collection methods; (9) the data analysis; (10), the legitimation o f findings;
(11) the interpretations; (12) compilation o f the research report; (13) the reformulation o f
the research questions were included at the appropriate stage o f the research.

the rationale), (d) Step 4 (determine the research purpose), and (e) Step 5 (determine the
research question) (Onwuegbuzie et al. (2012). Additionally, Newman, Ridenour,
Newman, and DeMarco’s (2003) identified nine goals that should be considered in the
formulation phase: (a) add to the knowledge base; (b) predict; (c) measure change; (d)
have a personal, social, institutional, and/or organizational impact; (e) understand
complex phenomena; (1) generate new ideas; (g) test new ideas; (h) inform
constituencies; and (i) examine the past. The primary goal o f my study, to add to the
knowledge base, is articulated below; however, I also anticipated the research to impact
the organizational structure o f academic libraries, to inform constituencies, to understand
complex phenomena in the work environment, and to examine and to chronicle the
evolution o f the academic library and the library profession. Though some o f these goals
may be less viable than others, nevertheless their emergence should be noted.
Step 1: Goal of the Study. The overall goal o f the study was to add to the
knowledge base regarding research conducted on the emotional affects o f the library
personnel as a result o f technology. The scarcity and relatively narrow concentration o f
research in this area is even more concerning considering that Patton (2002) defined
qualitative research as attempting to understand the unique interactions in a particular
situation. The purpose o f understanding is not necessarily to predict what might occur,
but rather to understand in depth the characteristics o f the situation and the meaning
brought by participants and what is happening to them at the moment. The aim o f
qualitative research was to truthfully present findings to others and to add to the
knowledge base in the field o f study.

13

Step 2: Objective(s) of the Study. Johnson and Christensen (2012) outlined five
major objectives that are common to educational research: (a) exploration (i.e.,
attempting to generate ideas about phenomena; (b) description (i.e., attempting to
describe the characteristics o f a phenomenon; (c) explanation, (i.e., attempting to show
how and why a phenomenon); (d) prediction, (i.e., attempting to predict or forecast a
phenomenon; and (e) influence (i.e., attempting to apply research to make certain
outcomes occur). For my research study, I focused on description and explanation as the
primary objectives for conducting the research. The interrogative research questions
were framed to explore the phenomenon o f change and corresponding responses to
change o f selected veteran academic librarians. The changes that occurred in the
academic library in the latter decades o f the 20th century were examined within the
context o f societal changes, particularly regarding technology, and its potential impact on
the academic library. Descriptions o f the changes in the library organization allowed me
to identify various issues presented from the perspective o f selected veteran academic
librarians. Within each description, I looked for affective dimensions (i.e., feelings,
emotions) associated with change in the library organization.
Step 3: Phenomenology Rationale. Qualitative research is considered by many
scholars (e.g., Denzin & Lincoln, 2000; Domegan & Fleming, 2007; Richardson, 1994)
to be the methodology that supports human learning. Guba (1981, p. 76) posited that “it
is proper to select that paradigm whose assumptions are best met by phenomenon being
investigated. The forecasters o f imminent change (e.g., Dewey, 1876; Lancaster, 1978)
in the academic library were accurate in their predictions. As asserted by Stewart (2010),
it was unlikely that any other enterprise in higher education had undergone such dramatic

14

shifts in its fundamental structure over the past two decades, singly due to technology, as
the academic library. Transforming an institution with long traditions is difficult. Sacred
cows in the library profession (i.e., acres o f print collections; aging and inflexible
buildings, librarian’s perceptions and biases, outdated personnel) have tremendous power
to resist change (Michalak, 2012). Academic librarians, particularly veteran academic
librarians, have begun to focus on re-educating and reinventing themselves in the resolute
presence o f technology, as it dominates and alters traditional library services (e.g., library
catalog, research and instruction). Therefore, the researcher’s focus for the study was
twofold: (1) to capture the lived experiences o f veteran academic librarian’s in a library
environment marked with uncertainty and instability as they exit their careers and (2) to
understand the relationship between emotional salience and workplace events related to
technology change. My qualitative study was consistent with the theoretical
underpinnings o f phenomenology, including methods for collecting and analyzing data as
well as ethical and validity considerations specific to this research design.
Step 4: Purpose and Significance o f Study. The purpose o f the
phenomenological study was to examine the perceptions and lived experiences of
selected veteran academic librarians who worked as librarians during periods o f constant
change influenced by technology, in the academic library. Veteran academic librarians
working in libraries when disruptive technologies were introduced have been at the
forefront o f profound changes in the library academy; yet, a dearth o f scholarly research
exists related to the emotional responses o f librarians who experienced the many changes.
The memories o f individual research librarians who will soon leave the profession might

15

be o f tremendous value to historical researchers, as well as scholars in organizational
management.
Additionally, the study was significant in its contribution toward ensuring the
future intimate, first-hand accounts o f academic library professional by recording the
library profession’s past (Flannery, 2011). Extensive research has been conducted in the
field o f psychology on emotional memories; however, limited scholarly research existed
in the library science literature that focused on the emotions experienced by librarians in
an environment o f constant change. Although researchers have conducted studies on
emotional memories, a thorough examination o f the literature revealed few studies that
examined emotional memories in regards to the demographic, profession, or
organization. The significance o f this study was to bring an awareness o f the emotions
exhibited by veteran academic librarians and their coping strategies as communicated
through individual accounts o f the transformational events in the library organization.
My study also contributed to the extant body o f literature regarding organizational
change, particularly in the academic library organization. Sapp and Gilmour (2002)
suggested that the profession could benefit from research on the ideas and experiences o f
veteran librarians to provide models for planning, directing, and managing future
transitions. Existing library studies, primarily consisted o f short-answer questionnaires
and surveys regarding librarians’ attitudes about technology changes in libraries, have not
been juxtaposed with theories on change and associated emotions. Moreover, shortanswer questionnaires and surveys are inadequate to capture the richness and fullness o f
lived experiences o f the participants in the study (Polkinghome, 2005).

16

A paucity o f research exists regarding the conjunctive topics o f emotions and
organizational memory. Researchers from a variety o f disciplines have shown particular
interest in declarative memory (i.e., memory for facts, events, or propositions including
know-what, know-why, or know-when) and procedural memory (i.e., memory for how
activities are accomplished or can be accomplished, routines, or procedures. These two
types o f memory contents are important; however, most the emotional aspect o f studies
on organizational memory is absent (Akgtin, Keskin, & Byrne, 2012).
Gilstrap (2007) suggested that future studies that focus on the emotions of
librarians during periods o f constant change would be beneficial in the development o f
coping mechanisms and strategies in academic libraries. Additionally, the study
addressed the perception o f the library organization’s inability to be nimble in its
adaption to technological change. Although new technologies have disrupted the
traditional library organizational structure and invaded its long-standing model o f
autonomy, the library organization is still required to align with the expectations o f the
academic community to remain relevant.
The study broadened the collective understanding o f change and the consequences
o f change in a traditionally positioned organization through the emotional memories o f
veteran academic librarians who have experienced substantive change in libraries. From
a broader perspective, the study contributed to the study o f organizational change,
regardless o f the field o f study.
Step 5: Research Questions. A qualitative research question is an interrogative
sentence that seeks an answer about a process, issue, or phenomenon that is to be
explored. Generally, the researcher asks an overarching question followed up by an

17

associated or sub-question. The practice o f following an overarching question with a
sub-question will allow separate components o f the overarching question to emerge
(Creswell, 2009; Johnson & Christensen, 2012).
The central research questions addressed in my study was: What were some o f
the lived experiences o f veteran academic librarians in adapting to technological change
in academic libraries in the state o f Texas? The three sub-questions in the study were: (1)
To what extent do veteran academic librarians associate emotions with their memories o f
transformative changes that have occurred in the academic library organization in the last
three decades?; (2) How do veteran academic librarians describe their emotional
memories specific to technological changes in academic libraries?; and (3) To what
extent did the veteran academic librarians perceive that library administrators provided
them with necessary resources to adapt to changes?
Theoretical Frameworks
In my study, I ascertained from an extensive review o f the literature (e.g.,
Gilstrap, 2007; Seal, 2001) that the upheaval o f change elicited a range o f emotions in
librarians as they traversed personal professional as well as change within their library
organizations. With the focus on the emotional memories o f veteran academic
librarians, which resulted from affective events that occurred in the midst o f technologydriven organizational change in the academic library, two theoretical frameworks guided
my study: (a) affective events theory (Weiss & Cropanzano (1996), and (b)
organizational identity (Albert &Whetten, 1985).
Academic librarians possess a professional passion which is channeled into
energy and enthusiasm for the people and services they provide. In an effort to capture

18

the cascade o f emotions resulting from the disruptive nature o f technology in an
environment defined by tradition, I used these two theoretical frameworks to examine the
organizational dynamics o f the academic library as it was transformed by technology
(Bell, 2003). Additionally, Onwuegbuzie’s et al. (2012) 13-step methodological
framework for qualitative research will be utilized in the study to undergird the
methodological aspect o f the research.
Affective Events Theory. Weiss and Cropanzano (1996) posited that certain
aspects o f the work environment (e.g., environmental conditions, roles, job design)
initiate emotions in organizational settings. Weiss and Cropanzano’s (1996) affective
events theory proposes mechanisms by which change in the work environment can
influence the attitudinal and behavioral responses o f employees.
The most basic assumption o f the affective events theory is that job satisfaction
should be conceptualized as an evaluative judgment about one’s job. However, the
affective events theory makes a distinction between evaluative judgments regarding the
job in general or a facet o f the jo b in addition to the emotions or moods one experiences
on the job. The significant distinction exists because the causes o f mood and emotions
associated with the job are distinguishable from the causes o f evaluative judgment, (i.e.
job satisfaction) (Wegge, van Dick, Fisher, West, & Dawson, 2006). A more in-depth
discussion o f the affective event theory will appear in Chapter II.
Organizational Identity Theory. Albert and Whetten (1985) defined identity as
those aspects o f an organization that in the eyes o f its members are central to the
organization character or self-image and are viewed as having continuity over time.
Organizational identity theory has been conceptualized as a relational construct defined

19

by contrasts such as between ‘how we are’ and ‘how others see us’ (Albert &Whetten,
1985). Organizational identity theory is appropriate to guide my study due to the
constant change in the library profession and subsequent efforts o f the academic
librarians to redefine their role on the university campus and to reaffirm the library’s
position as the ‘heart o f the university’ (Euster, 1995, p. 2; Gyure, 2008, p. 107). The
origin o f this theory can be linked to the social identity theories o f Cooley (1902), Mead
(1934) and Goffman (1959). The use o f trusted theories will facilitate the researcher’s
understanding of the underlying principles and importance o f image in the library
organization.
Delimitations
There will be several delimitations to the study. The researcher delimited the
study to selected veteran academic librarians who had worked in academic libraries for at
least 30 years. Due to the likelihood o f varied positions in careers that will span three
decades and more (i.e., librarian and library administrator), the researcher did not make a
distinction between librarians and library administrators. Another limitation o f the study
was that it reflected a decidedly perspective o f the academic librarian in the United
States. Although the focus o f my study was limited in its national focus, I believed that it
served as a springboard for further conversations globally as well as from the perspective
o f other disciplines. In the study, I examined the emotional memories o f selected veteran
academic librarians for the purpose o f revealing the memories associated with technology
that disrupted the established service models in the 20th- century academic library
organization.

20

Limitations
The assessment o f the legitimation or validity o f a research study is the most
important step in the research study (Benge, Onwuegbuzie, & Robbins, 2012), and should
be considered at the research design/data collection, data analysis, and data interpretation
stage o f the research process (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2007b). Internal validity (i.e.,
credibility) is defined by Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2007b) as the truth value,
applicability, consistency, neutrality, dependability and/or credibility o f interpretations
and conclusions within the underlying setting or group” (p. 234), whereas, external
validity refers to the generalizability o f the findings o f a study across different
populations. Each o f the specific validity types will be expanded upon in Chapter III o f
my study.
Assumptions
The assumption exists that the participants in the study will accurately and
honestly self-report accounts o f their lived experiences in their roles as academic
librarians. According to Manen (1997), “The problem o f phenomenological inquiry is
not always that we know too little about the phenomenon we wish to investigate, the
problem is we know too much” (p. 46). I presented the problem o f knowing too much
about the topic o f the study since I also met the criteria o f the participants in my study.
Husserl (1970) used the term “bracketing” to describe the process researchers should use
to suspend (i.e., place outside o f their knowledge base) their beliefs and assumptions
about a particular topic. Tufford and Newman (2010) believed that bracketing would
allow the mitigation o f potentially deleterious effect o f preconceptions that could taint the
research. Drew (2004) defined bracketing as a continuous process used to suspend

21

preconceptions. The bracketing process elevate the potential to collect richer data,
research findings and interpretation - to the extent the researcher as instrument, maintains
self-awareness as part o f an ongoing process.
Definition of Key Terms
Academic Library. Hoare (1997) described the academic library as “libraries
attached to academic institutions above the secondary school level, serving the teaching
and research needs o f students and staff’ (p. 2).
Affect. Frijda (1988) and Isen and Baron (1991) used the term affect to describe
a range o f emotion-related constructs and the term is often used by researchers to
comprise both moods and discrete emotions. Duration and object are two characteristics
o f affect used to differentiate between mood (i.e., long duration measured in hours or
days) and emotion (i.e., shorter duration measured in seconds or minutes) (Stam &
Stanton, 2009).
Affective Events Theory. Weiss and Cropanzano’s (1996) affective events
theory proposes mechanisms by which change in the work environment can influence the
attitudinal and behavioral responses o f employees.
Baby Boomers. Baby boomers are those persons who were bom between the
years o f 1946 and 1964 (Gibaldi, 2013).
Emotions. Defining what emotions are has been an illusionary goal among
researchers (Ashkanasy, Hartel, & Zerbe, 2000); however, for the purpose o f this study;
the researcher has adopted Frijda’s (1988) empirically positioned definition o f emotions
as “responses to events that are important to the individual” (p. 351).

22

Emotional Memory. Emotional memory associates a memory o f a particular
event or thing to an emotion (LeDoux, 1992).
Organizational Identity. Albert and Whetten (1985) defined identity as those
aspects o f an organization that in the eyes o f its members are central to the organization
character or self-image and are viewed as having continuity over time.
Phenomenology. Phenomenology is the study o f conscious phenomena: that is, it
is an analysis o f the way in which entities or experiences show themselves (Sanders,
1982). Phenomenology describes the meaning o f lived experiences for individuals
experiencing a particular phenomenon or concept (Creswell, 2013).
Veteran Academic Librarian. For the purpose o f this study, the veteran
academic librarian has earned a master’s degree in library science (MLS) or its equivalent
from an American Library Association (ALA) accredited institution, who has worked in
the library profession for 30 years or more and who has spent the majority o f their
professional career working in the postsecondary segment o f higher education (Ashforth,

2000).
Organization of the Study
The dissertation comprises five chapters. Chapter I includes the statement o f the
problem, purpose and the significance o f the study, and the research questions. Chapter
II covers detailed reviews o f existing research studies relative to technology-driven
change in the academic library organization and research based on the theoretical
frameworks o f affective events theory (Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996) and organizational
identity theory (Whetten, 2006). Information about the research method, population,
sampling, data collection, instrumentation, and data analysis is presented in Chapter III.

23

Using Moustakas’ (1994) phenomenological reduction approach, the findings o f my
analysis appear in Chapter IV. In Chapter V, an overview o f my study, implications for
the academic librarianship, and recommendations for future research is presented.

24

CHAPTER II
Review o f the Literature
Introduction
The significance and the purpose o f my study was substantiated by the literature
review and related research. The purpose o f this research study was to examine the
perceptions and the lived experiences o f selected veteran academic librarians who
experienced one o f the most dramatic periods o f change in librarianship which was
largely influenced by technology. Academic librarians who worked in libraries prior to
the arrival o f the Internet have been at the forefront o f profound change in the postInternet age academic library; yet, a dearth o f scholarly research exists related to the
emotions that resonated throughout the library organization subsequent to unrelenting
technology-influenced change.
The literature review focused on four general areas that are salient to the research
topic. These four areas are (a) process o f literature selection, (b) organizational identity
theory, (c) the changing role o f academic librarians (e) affective events theory (f) the
concept o f emotions and emotions and memory in the and (g) the role o f librarians in the
21st century library organization. Furthermore, the literature review will inform the
study by providing both a 20th century context and a 21 st century overview o f the
academic library organization as a result o f the continuing disruptive nature of
technology. A summary of the literature will conclude the chapter.
Criteria for Literature Search
My search for scholarly resources to be included in the literature review involved
searching databases using broad keywords relevant to my topic (i.e., emotions and

25

memories, emotional memories, academic libraries, academic libraries and technology,
the transformation o f academic libraries, library organizational climate, and
organizational identity). The search for each theme revealed a plethora o f publications;
therefore, search strategies were designed using Boolean operators to achieve results that
were appropriately relevant and specific to my study. Additionally, significant
discoveries were revealed through references cited in located articles and books, searches
for authors whose publications were principal to the research. Searches were conducted
on the ProQuest discovery platform, Serials Solutions Summon Discovery Services,
which allowed me to search across multiple databases with a single search command.
The search parameters were to scholarly, peer-reviewed articles, excluding newspapers.
Table 2 displays the number o f hits for articles on the search terms indicated.

Note: Search Results Using Serials Solutions Summon Discovery Services
Additionally, two alerts were created for newly published research studies
through Google Scholar using the search phrases organizational climate in academic
libraries and organizational development in academic libraries which contributed

26

significantly to the revealing recently published literature related to my research topic.
The drawback was that the alerts were international in scope, whereas the scope o f my
study is primarily academic libraries in the U. S. specifically the state o f Texas.
The literature review was arranged into four sections. First, I utilized Interactive
Literature Review Process (ILRP) (Combs, Bustamante, & Onwuegbuzie, 2010) to reveal
similar and separate elements o f research findings and ideas relevant to the study. The
literature evaluative process was facilitated by the nine stages o f the ILRP framework
which included: (a) exploring belief systems; (b) initiating the literature review process;
(c) selecting a topic; (d) exploring the literature: identifying themes; (e)
selecting/deselecting themes; (f) analyzing/interpreting/integrating literature; (g) closing
the literature search after saturation; (h) writing the review o f the literature; and (i)
evaluating the process and product. A coalesced approach was utilized throughout the
nine stages to facilitate the emergence o f new ideas. Second, emerging interest in the
study o f emotions and subsequent studies on emotions and its effect on memory were
examined. Research on emotions and memories was included to elevate emotions as a
critical and valid component in library organization. Third, the concept o f affective
events theory and organizational identity as the theoretical frameworks for the study were
presented. The emergence of the affective events theory framework was examined
through studies conducted in disciplines outside o f library science, i.e., cognitive
psychology. Similarly, the second theoretical framework o f organizational identity,
which undergirds the transformative events in the academic library organization, was
chronologically presented research studies relative to the development o f the postInternet academic library. The concept o f organizational identity was examined,

27

juxtaposing the 20th century library organization and the 21st century library
organization. Finally, related research was presented on (a) the historical context o f the
late 20th century academic library, (b) the future o f the academic library, and (c) the
implications for strategies for managing organizational change in institutions ingrained in
tradition. A summary concluded the review o f literature.
Organizational Identity Theory
Due to the implicit role o f emotions in shaping organizational dynamics, the
researcher identified organizational identity (Albert & Whetten, 1985) as a
complementing theory for the study. Organizations are continually exposed to societal
and technological shifts, which makes it problematic for organizations to create and
maintain their identities (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Cheney & Christensen, 2001).
According to Anholt (2007), the image o f an organization is instrumental in gaining
competitive advantage and in attracting stakeholders with the intent o f influencing
positive financial gain (e.g., budget). The library organization’s image or its brand is a
strategic governance initiative rooted in a long-term strategic vision, because its service
creed and everything that happens in the academic library and its accomplishments,
communicates it image to the university institution.
Albert and Whetten (1985) conceptualized organizational identity as a relational
construct defined by contrasts such as between ‘how we are’ and ‘how others see us’.
Questions that are central to this theory are “Who are we?” “What are we doing?” and
“What do we want to be in the future?” Albert and W hetten’s (1985) foundational ideas
o f organizational identity can be traced to the social identity theories o f Cooley
(1902/1964) and Mead (1934) and Goffman (1959) who theorized social identity in

28

relation to personal identity. The three putative “pillars” o f organizational identity focus
on what is central (i.e., organizational characteristics that are essential to the
organization), distinctive (i.e., characteristics that distinguishes it from others), and
durable (i.e., the enduring nature o f organizational identify) (Boal & Hirsch, 2006; Gioia,
Schultz & Corley, 2000; Whetten, 1985).
Wrench and Punyanunt-Carter (2012) theorized four approaches to organizations
—functionalist, interpretive, critical and postmodern—which illustrate different views o f
organizational identity. The four approaches are displayed in Table 3. The functionalist
or postpositive views organizational identity as a variable in the organization that is
manageable to boost performance. The postmodernist views the concept o f
organizational identity as suspect. From the critical viewpoint, the concept o f identity is
entangled with societal structures o f power. The interpretive perspective is that
organization’s identity emerges from members’ communicative interaction

communication. Creative Commons, http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/anintroduction-to-organizational-communication/s 10-organizational-identity-and-di.html
Over the past three decades, the study o f organizational identity has become a
burgeoning domain within the field o f organizational study (Gioia, Patvardhan, Hamilton,
& Corley, 2013). The field o f study has moved from its traditional focus on determining
what constitutes identity to more contemporary issues such as how identity can be a
useful concept for addressing managerial choices and dilemmas. The refined theoretical
discussion on organizational identity examines how members o f an organization
reconcile conflicting internal and external driving forces that cause shifts in the
perceptual environment (Van Rekom, Corley, & Ravasi, 2008).

30

Hatch and Schultz (2002) proposed a model which identified the dynamic
between organizational identity, culture, and image. (See Figure 2). Employees within an
organization express their understandings o f their organizational culture through
organizational identity, which in turn, affects the perception o f others outside the
organization about the organization. The outsiders’ perception, or organizational image,
in turn, affects the organizational identity. In a practical sense, Hatch and Schultz (2002)
believed that knowing how organizational identity dynamics works helps organizations to
avoid organizational dysfunction and thus should increase their effectiveness.

According to Shuler (2005), today’s knowledge exchange in America has drifted
far from the nineteenth century library collective roots, when many o f the largest
collections (mostly academic or cultural institutions) were necessary communal
responses that transcended any individual’s ability to locate and purchase expensive
printed material. Shuler (2005) purports that up until the 1870s, much o f the output from

31

publishers did not enjoy a “ national market” or commercial distribution mechanisms
which made books, journals, government documents, and other printed material
exceedingly expensive to collect and organize on any large scale. However, because o f
technology, most Americans today can access, transmit, create, store, and integrate a
truly astonishing amount o f knowledge into their daily lives, and on a scale barely
imagined just a few short years ago. Organizational strengths once typified the academic
library; however, academic libraries are playing a losing hand in this game o f “best first
choice” in the daily race to locate or find desired information. The academic librarian is
no longer the intermediary between the creator o f information and the user. It is a game
that increasingly favors direct relationships between information users and producers, and
not the traditional information collectivism o f libraries (Shuler, 2005).
Organizational Identity Revisited. Albert and Whetten (1985) introduced
organizational identity as a defined construct; however, critics (Albert, Ashforth, &
Dutton, 2000; Haslam, Postmes, & Ellemers, 2003; Hatch & Schultz, 2002) asserted that
the theory had failed to measure up to its own definitional standard. This perception may
in part be caused by the lens through which researchers view organizational identity.
Some researchers propose that an organization’s identity consists o f fragmented,
incompatible elements, readily altered to reflect shifting environmental circumstances.
Whereas, a separate segment o f researchers see the consistent, coherent actions and
highly stable property o f the organization (Whetten, 2006).
Libraries and Theory
Lankes (2011) posited that the field o f library science is not rich in strong theory
because the theories tend to revolve around functional approaches (i.e., theories of

32

cataloging, reference). Professional journals are overwhelming focused on empirical
explorations and system building (i.e., surveys on catalog usage, information seeking
behaviors o f library users, content analysis o f digital reference questions). McGrath
(2002a) attempted to develop a grand theory o f library science; however, again, these
theories focused on library functions.
Affective Events Theory
The Affective Event Theory (AET) developed by Weiss and Cropanzano (1996)
proposed that organizational events are proximal causes o f affective, i.e., emotional
reactions. “Things happen to people in work settings and people often react emotionally
to these events. These affective experiences have direct influences on behaviors and
attitudes” (Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996, p. 11) suggest that a person’s attitude toward their
job can be influenced by the cumulative experience o f momentary positive and negative
feelings in the work environment.
Hochschild’s (1983) seminal work on emotional labor, i.e., emotions in the
workplace, is perhaps one o f the greatest contributions to our understanding o f emotions
in the organization (Bolton & Boyd, 2003). The work experience is saturated with
moments o f frustration or joy, grief or fear, to a lingering sense o f dissatisfaction or
satisfaction (Matteson & Miller, 2012). Given the breadth o f technology in changing the
library organization, it is anticipated that the range and depth o f emotions expressed in
the work organization is integral and inseparable part o f the daily work environment.
Weiss and Cropanzano’s (1996) publication, Affective Events Theory was also a
major impetus for the study o f affect and emotions in the work environment (Ashkanasy
& Humphrey, 2011). Theories o f attitude formation generally indicate that attitudes are

33

formed from a compilation o f deeply held beliefs and experiences (Eagly & Chaiken,
1993). Meyer and Allen (1991) suggested in their study that commitment contains an
affective domain, which is described as “an emotional attachment to, identification with,
and involvement in the organization” (Meyer & Allen, 1991, p. 67). Few researchers
actually have explored the specific events that arouse effect in the work environment
(e.g., Basch & Fisher, 2000); therefore, the researcher ascertained that the AET was
appropriate for the study.
Prior to the emergence o f the affective events theory, Fridja (1988) suggested that
the magnitude o f the change was analogous to the range o f emotions associated with the
change. According to LeDoux (1992), memories for the emotional significance o f events
are stored permanently and are mediated by different brain circuits than are memories for
events themselves. The affective events theory framework lends sustenance to the
purpose of the study in that affective events in the academic library environment were
substantive as the library organization evolved during the latter quarter o f the 20th
century.
The literature is filled with studies about job satisfaction as researchers and
practitioners alike, particularly in Industrial/Organizational Psychology (Judge & Church,
2000), seek to improve employees’ commitment to their jobs, thereby increasing
productivity. Work motivation theories and job satisfaction and its influence (e.g.,
Maslow’s (1943) Hierarchy o f Needs; Hertzberg’s (1974) Two-Factor (MotivatorHygiene) Theory; Adam’s (1965) Equity Theory; Porter and Lawler’s (1968) modified
version o f Vroom’s (1964) VIE Model; Locke’s (1969) Discrepancy Theory; Locke’s

34

(1976) Range o f Affect Theory; Bandura’s (1977) Social Learning Theory; and Landy’s
(1978) Opponent Process Theory).
In 1996, Weiss and Cropanzano presented affective events theory as a new
framework for studying emotions, moods and job satisfaction at work Since its
introduction, the affective events theory (Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996) has gained
recognition as a theoretically rigorous framework (Humphrey, 2006) and a prominent
theory relating to workplace affect (Ashton-James & Ashkanasy, 2005).
Elements o f Affective Events Theory. Affective Events Theory provides a
framework for examining the relationship between work events, emotions and the
resulting attitudes and behaviors. The point o f departure from traditional theories is that
AET focuses on the structure causes and consequences o f affective experiences at work,
with affective experiences as the more central phenomena o f interest with job satisfaction
begin one consequence. A second point o f departure from traditional theories is the focus
toward events as proxim al causes o f affective reactions. Events in the work setting often
cause people to react emotionally to these events. Time is another key parameter o f the
AET when examining affect and satisfaction. Finally, AET considers the structure o f
affective reactions which emphasizes the importance o f the structure o f the psychological
experience.
Wegge et al., (2006) tested the central assumptions o f AET in a study using data
from 2,091 call center representatives from 85 call centers in the United Kingdom (UK).
Affective Events Theory predicts that specific features o f work (e.g. pay, supervision,
autonomy) have an impact on the arousal o f emotions and moods at work that, in turn,
co-determine job satisfaction o f employees. In contrast with traditional job satisfaction

35

theories, AET proposes emotions and moods better predict affeetive-based behavior,
whereas job satisfaction is an evaluative judgment that mainly explains cognitive-based
behavior. The findings o f Wegge’s et al. (2006) study determined AET to be an effective
framework for explaining why and how specific management strategies used in the work
environment influence important organizational attitudes and well-being o f employees.
The review o f literature on emotions included a variety o f definitions developed
by researchers. Defining what emotions are has been an elusive goal among researchers
(Ashkanasy, Hartel, & Zerbe, 2000). Kleinginna and Kleinginna (1981) developed 92
definitions o f emotion. Researchers expressed skepticism in the research community’s
ability to satisfactorily define emotion, “aside from its manifestations in act or verbal
statements o f feeling” (p. 4). Arnold (1960) believed the study o f emotions to be “the
most difficult and confused fields in the whole o f psychology” (p. 10-11). One faction
o f researchers (e.g., Bloom, Lazerson, & Hofstadter, 1985; Damasio, 1994; Fischer,
Shaver, & Camochan, 1990; Izard, 1993) viewed emotions as involving the interaction o f
both cognitive and noncognitive systems, whereas, other theorists (e.g., Gray, 1990;
Rolls, 1990) argued that emotions are an outgrowth o f associative learning, defined by
the set o f stimuli that elicit them (Ashkanasy, et al., 2000, p. 4). The difference in these
two theoretical approaches, i.e., mental v. organic, lie in their emphasis on physiological
as opposed to mental processes. The mental domain sees physiological events as the
consequence o f psychic events, whereas in contrast, the organic domain views
physiological events, rather than thoughts, as the precursors o f emotion (Ashkanasy et al.,

2000).

36

Salovey, Bracket and Mayer (2004) viewed emotions as a social construct
(cultural) rather than universal (biological). Theories that view emotions as a social
construct tend to emphasize aspects that are related to the social environment. The
researcher determined that Salovey's et al (2004) view o f emotions as a social construct
were appropriate for the study. Additionally, Frijda’s (1998) empirically positioned
definition o f emotion as “responses to events that are important to the individual” (p.
351) fit within Salovey’s et al. (2004) theory.
For many years, researchers did not regard the study o f emotions as a major area
of scientific psychological research, which relegated it to an underprivileged area in
psychology. Scientific inquiry o f emotion was accomplished by Darwin (1985), who
explored the significance o f emotional expression. It was not until the late 1980s that
emotion became an important domain worthy o f attention (Frijda, 1988). Prior to the
1980s, the study o f emotions in the work place in the field o f organizational behavior was
once subsumed in “the normal science o f affect as job satisfaction” (Barsade, Brief, &
Spataro, 2003, p. 3). Rexford Hersey’s (1932) published research titled Workers ’
Emotions in Shop and Home still stands as the seminal piece on emotional reactions at
work. Hersey’s (1932) study revealed a definite relationship between emotional state at
work and productivity.
The findings o f numerous studies (e.g., Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, & Larkin,
2003; Waugh & Fredrickson, 2006; Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004; Huppert &
Whittington, 2003) revealed that positive emotions can lead to positive outcomes. The
study conducted by Philippe, Lecours, and Beaulieu-Pelletier (2009) identified the
characteristic o f psychological resilience with their examination o f how positive emotions

37

are self-generated. More specifically, individuals who display resiliency are believed to
experience positive emotions in the midst o f difficult events, resulting in positive
outcomes (Fredrickson, 2001).
Emotions in the Workplace
Traditionally, research in the field o f organizational sciences was based on the
Taylorian assumption that human behavior fit within rational rules legislated by job
descriptions, budgets, policies, and operating procedures (Ashkanasy, Hartel, & Zerbe,
2000). Frederick W. Taylor, the father o f scientific organization design (1856-1915),
methods were quite restrictive and focused on imposing discipline on the activities o f
employees (Mastenbroek, 2000).
Simon (1976) was one o f the first modem scholars to recognize that the Taylorian
paradigm did not fully represent human behavior. Even so, Simon (1976) described
behavior driven by the heart rather than the head as irrational behavior. Salovey, Bedell,
Detweiler, and Mayer, 2000 asserted that social scientists have relied on “glorified
analytic intelligence throughout much o f Western history” (p.505) and have not
sufficiently considered the role o f emotion in the workplace. In fact, emotional research
was not regarded as a major area o f scientific psychological endeavor that seemed to
deserve concerted research efforts or receive them (Fridja, 1988).
In the 1990s, researchers (e.g., Ashkanasy & Daus, 2002; Ashkanasy, Zerbe &
Hartel, 2002; Brief &Weiss, 2002; Briner, 1999; Payne & Cooper, 2001; Wegge, 2004)
became involved in in-depth analyses o f the causes and consequences o f specific
emotions and moods in the work environment. Earlier studies (e.g., George & Jones,
1997; Judge, 1992) did not provide coherent theoretical perspectives on the topic and

38

were believed hampered by the absence o f an integrated, multilevel model for studying
the role of emotion in the organization. The widely held belief in the social science
research community, which hindered serious research, was that the only things that
mattered were the things that can be seen and what people do (Ruth, 2004).
The range and depth o f emotions expressed in the work organization has become
an integral and inseparable part o f the daily work environment. Hochschild’s (1983)
seminal work on emotional labor, i.e., emotions in the workplace, is perhaps one o f the
greatest contributions to our understanding o f emotions in the organization (Bolton &
Boyd, 2003). The work experience is saturated with moments o f frustration or joy, grief
or fear, to a lingering sense o f dissatisfaction or satisfaction (Matteson & Miller, 2013).
In the work environment, emotions arise from some stimulus due to a visible
event or workplace feature such as a social interaction with a colleague or customer.
When this occurs, individuals automatically assess their perceptions among a variety o f
emotional dimensions, including “novelty, pleasantness, causal agent, control, certainty,
anticipated effort, and perceived goal obstruction” (Matteson & Miller, 2013, p. 54).
Consequently, the individual’s sensory process registers an emotion, which Elfenbein
(2007) classified as (a) approach (interest, hope, and anticipation); (b) achievement
(relief, satisfaction, pride, and joy); (c) deterrence (anxiety and distress); (d) withdrawal
(sadness and shame); and (e) antagonism (irritation, anger, and hate).
Stam and Stanton (2009) conducted a qualitative study that examined the
relationship between emotional salience and workplace events related to technology
change. Implications from the Stam and Stanton (2009) study indicated that emotions
should be taken into consideration when determining the plans, strategies and

39

communications with regard to the change in order to facilitate organizational transition
to new technology.
Matteson and Miller (2013) defined emotional labor as the “awareness o f the
emotional expression required o f a job and the strategies to express those emotions” (p.
55). Although emotions are expressed internally, they are contextually derived. For
example, an announcement o f the departure o f a colleague within the organization might
result in sadness for some employees and delight for others. The study focused on
emotions as they are recalled in association with a memory o f an event in the library
organization.
Emotions and Memory
The nature o f the cognitive-emotional interactions has been the subject of ongoing
debate in the field o f psychology (LeDoux, 1995). One area on research on emotion and
memory focuses on the question o f whether emotion enhances memory (Levine &
Pizarro, 2004). For centuries, scholars believed that emotion and memory were
separable. In fact, the belief was that emotional processes hijacked cognitive ones,
resulting in irrationality. Conversely, scholars theorized that rational thought curtailed
emotional processing (Kensinger, 2009). Researchers have since dismissed the
oversimplification that emotions are merely disruptive to rational thought and adaptive
action (Rush, 2004). Kensinger (2009) posited that the terms emotion and memory are
umbrella terms used to describe a series o f related, yet distinct, processes.
The Influence o f Affect on Memories. Emotions are present in virtually every
aspect o f our lives and provide meaning and signal value on life and property (Cacioppo,
Bemtson, Larsen, Poehlmann, & Ito, 2001). Memories that are associated with emotions

40

generally increase the likelihood o f a memory o f the event and remembered more vividly.
Flashbulb memories are one example o f this. According to research conducted by
Reisberg and Heuer (2004), emotional events are more likely to be recalled than more
neutral events. Numerous research findings have demonstrated that emotional words are
remembered better than are neutral words (Dewhurst & Parry, 2000; Hadley & MacKay,
2006; Schmidt & Saari, 2007; Talmi, Luk, McGarry, & Moscovitch, 2007). Kensinger
and Corkin (2003) posited that negative information is better remembered than is neutral
information. A broad array o f research has been conducted on the subject, emotional
memory, which focuses on how accurately people remember the events that elicited
emotions (Levine & Safer, 2002). Some investigators have claimed that, although
memory for events is subject to fading and distortion over time, memory for one's
emotional reactions to events is long lasting, vivid, and easily retrieved (LeDoux, 1995).
In various research studies, researchers have concluded that emotions can influence the
quantity o f remembered information as well as the quality o f remembered information
(i.e., the memory’s vividness) (Kensinger & Schacter, 2008). Emotional events often are
remembered with greater accuracy and vividness (though these two characteristics do not
always go together) than are events lacking an emotional component (Reisberg & Heuer,
2004). Reisberg, Heuer, McLean, and O ’Shaughnessy (1988) conducted a series o f
studies and they revealed in their findings that personal events are more vividly and
emotionally recalled than are public events but the ratings applied in the study to show
the relationship between vividness and strength o f affect were essentially the same for
both. Bluck and Li’s (2001) research findings support the findings o f Reisberg et al.
(1988) and Bomstein et al. (1998) regarding the relationship between strength the study

41

participants’ emotional feelings and vividness o f recall about the 0 . J. Simpson verdict 8
months later. Similarly, Bomstein, Liebel, and Scarberry (1998) reported that an R rated
movie was better remembered than was a comparable but neutral episode, which
correlates with the findings by Kensinger and Corkin (2003) about the easier recall o f
negative information. Kensinger and Schacter (2008) conducted a study with young and
older adults and revealed that both age groups were more likely to remember emotional
information than neutral information. Further, the findings o f a study conducted by Choi,
Kensinger, and Rajaram (2013) revealed that emotions continue to improve true memory.
Levine (1997) and Levine and Pizarro (2004) concluded from their research that neither
memory for emotional events nor memory for emotional feelings is indelible. The
vividness o f a memory does not necessarily elicit accuracy in recounting emotional event
(Reisberg & Heuer, 2004). Some researchers have claimed that memory for events
becomes faint and distorted over time, but overall, an individual’s emotional reaction to
an event is long lasting, vivid, and easily retrieved (LeDoux, 1996). LeDoux (1992)
posited that memories for the emotional significance o f events are stored permanently
and are mediated by different brain circuits than are memories for events themselves.
However, other researchers have argued that emotions are not stored in memory, but are
reconstructed based on the memories o f an emotion-eliciting event (Levine, 1997).
The Roots o f the Academic Library System
The history o f academic libraries in the United States closely parallels the history
o f higher education. Recognition o f librarianship as a profession coincided with the
educational reform movement that occurred with the establishment o f land-grant
institutions (e.g., for agriculture as a result o f the Morrill Land Grant Act) following the

42

Civil War. It was common practice for the president o f the college to serve as the
custodian o f the library, which elevated the library’s position on college campuses.
Charles William Eliot, president o f Harvard University from 1869-1900, is credited with
saying “The library is the heart o f the university” (Euster, 1995, p. 2). The elevated
stature o f the college library continued into the era following the end o f World War II,
when college enrollments burgeoned with returning war veterans, facilitated by the
Servicemen’s Readjustment Act o f 1944, commonly known as the GI Bill (Euster. 1995,
Rice-Lively & Racine, 1997; Branin, Groen, & Thorin, 2000).
Traditionally, the academic library was regarded as more than the buildings
housing the institutional archives and collections. After World War II, academic research
in the United States was broadened extensively beyond the Western canon and classical
sciences to an international scope. University library’s collections grew in response to
researchers’ interests as the collection size became a kind o f measuring stick for an
institution’s own ranking among competitors o f the region (Branin, Groen, & Thorin,
2000). Academic libraries focused their efforts on acquiring and maintaining great
collections which were meant to attract the promising student and faculty, which could
then elevate the university’s status (Kaufman, 2007). Until the latter two decades o f the
20th century, “Libraries are somewhat o f a microcosm o f a university, with large staffing,
operational, and program-driven costs” (Allen & Dickie, 2007, p. 172).
The Academic Library and the Emergence o f the Internet
Shuler (2006) observed “the academic library, as a growing organism, exists as a
place o f mediation; much like a barrier reef exists in a dynamic relationship to a
multitude o f other interdependent life forms. Through this complex o f relationships— the

43

living reef grows and changes.*’ (p. 540). Shuler's (2006) analogy is relevant to the
academic library’s allegiance to the print and paper as the binding agents prior to the
Internet. Schuler (2006) cautioned the academic library to either adapt to the changes in
the way information is through other delivery systems (i.e., search engines) or disappear.
The emergence o f the Internet and the development o f intelligent devices have
significantly displaced the mediating function o f libraries. The Internet fostered a way of
validation between the creator o f content and the users o f content. An excellent example
of this kind of digital social trust is EBay, where vast amounts o f goods and currency are
exchanged. Even Wikipedia has gained public trust in authority as a place users go for
information (Shuler, 2006).
The period from 1975 to 2000 in librarianship represented a coming o f age o f the
profession in which librarians began to realize that merely doing good and valuable work
did not ensure a successful future. The flurry o f predictions about the future o f
librarianship caused wary optimism in the profession. The outlook o f the library
profession during the last quarter o f the 20th century vastly contrasted with the outlook at
the turn o f the 20th century, which was then characterized by progressive improvements
and a bright future (Sapp & Gilmour, 2003). Technology, unleashed in the delivery o f
information, once mediated by librarians, ultimately was embedded in the daily fabric o f
U.S. society, profoundly altering how people interacted with libraries (Shuler, 2006).
Technostress. Technostress, a term was coined in 1984 by a clinical psychologist,
Brod (1984) as “a modem disease o f adaptation caused by an inability to cope with the
new computer technologies in a healthy manner” (p. 16). Brod (1984) asserted that there
are two distinct manifestations o f technostress: (1) the struggle to accept computer

44

technology and (2) an over-identification with computer technology. Melchionda (2007)
conducted an extensive literature review on the topic o f technostress (e.g., Agee &
Antrim, 2003, Bailey, 2005; Bierman, 2000; Coffman & McGlamery, 2000; Dougherty
1997; Ennis, 2005; Keller et al., 2003; Lamont, 1999; Liu 2001; Martell, 2000; Stover,
1999; Tennant, 1995; W ittw er, 2001), which focused on the professional literature from
1995-2005. Melchionda’s (2007) literature review revealed a vast amount o f literature
written on the topic, particularly regarding attitudes towards the changing technologies
and the role o f librarians. Since the development o f the World Wide Web in 1989 by Sir
Tim Bemers-Lee, a software engineer in Geneva, Switzerland, librarianship, in particular,
has registered a strong interest and an equal amount o f concern in networked
technologies (Zumalt & Smith, 2000).
The Internet as a Threat. As Zumalt and Smith (2000) observed that even
though academic librarians were the first to jum p on the Internet bandwagon, there has
always been a segment o f library professionals expressing skepticism, and sometimes
fear, for the future o f the profession. The traditionalist in the library profession resented
the huge, imposing force o f the Internet as it impacted their roles in the library. The
Internet was criticized for causing chaos due to its lack o f structure and o f knowledge
organization. Others feared their diminished role as library users acquired independence
in accessing information and services previously delivered with library intervention.
Others simply feared change, and were anxious for the future o f library profession
(Bierman, 2000). Stover (1999) asserted that “most o f the librarians and specialists who
are responsible for some aspects o f technology often come with no idea o f how to
manage, work in, and survive in these altered organizations, let alone lead them”(p. XII).

45

Gorman (1999) was among the main detractors o f a digital and fully networked future for
libraries and librarians, claiming that technology created an “age o f uncertainty”, further
complicating issues o f shrinking library budgets and overcrowded libraries (p. 43).
Reference librarians were perhaps the most vulnerable to technostress, as
technology increased the number o f systems and resources with which they had to
become conversant in order to maintain even minimal professional competence (Arthur,
1998). Some professionals perceived the Internet as an attack to the prestige o f their
careers. Some characterized the presence o f the Internet and the World Wide Web felt as
if a stake had been driven into the heart o f that librarian’s gatekeeper role (Mort, 2000).
Dougherty (1997) predicted the decline in circulation and reference services due to the
proliferation o f digital resources and remote access capabilities, which is a prediction that
has come to fruition in academic libraries.
A New Paradigm in the Academic Libraries. A shift in responsibilities for
reference librarians was revealed as early as the mid-1980s in a survey conducted by
Emmick and Davis (1984). The survey o f 500 randomly selected academic libraries in
the United States and Canada found that 96% o f the respondents participated in library
instruction whereas 66% of the respondents conducted online searching. In 1989, library
directors from a range o f academic libraries forecasted major organizational challenges
initiated by technological advances, which were expected to marginalize the distinction
between public and technical services, and cause a shift in the roles among librarians,
paraprofessionals, and clerical staff (De Klerk & Euster, 1989). The Association o f
Colleges and Research Libraries (ACRL) published a collection o f essays and case
studies titled Restructuring Academic Libraries: Organization Development in the Wake

46

o f Technological Change. The scope o f these writings focused on outsourcing library
services (Schwartz, 1997). According to Stoffle (1995), concerns about the financial
stability furnished the original impetus for many o f the changes in academic libraries.
Stoffle (1995) stated that the upside o f downsizing, if there is one, is that in a budget
crisis we can often gain support for hard choices and for radical changes that could not be
made in good budget times, even if they are sound and necessary changes (p. 11). Yuan
Zhou (1996) noted that the trend in library job advertisements increasingly required three
or more computer-related skills for the reference librarian positions in academic libraries
(70% in 1994), compared to positions in technical services (20%). Oftentimes, the
reference librarian and other public service positions were responsible for trouble­
shooting technical problems and for developing new instructional and systems-related
programs (Arthur, 1998). Mathews and Pardue (2009) noted a trend among academic
library administrators who are looking for librarians who possessed a wider range o f
information technology skills in order to meet the demands o f users. Another study
conducted by Cardina and Wicks (2004), which assessed the role changes for academic
librarians from 1991 to 2001, revealed an increase in the number o f online reference tools
used by librarians over the 10-year period. With the growing presence o f databases,
librarians have assumed a greater role as teachers, conducting formal desk assistance
while mediated online searches faded into the background as new technologies
transformed library services. Table 4 represents changes in the time spent performing
certain job activities over a 10-year period: 1991 to 2001. Seal (2001) and Cardina and
Wicks (2004) found that face-to-face reference and bibliographic instruction both
decreased, paralleled by an increase in web pages and online tutorials. Xu (1996)

47

conducted a content analysis of 574 job ads that appeared in American Libraries between
1971 and 1990 which revealed an increase in demand for computer skills for reference
and cataloging positions. A few years later. Lynch and Smith (2001) investigated the
changing nature o f library positions and looked at how computer technology impacted
job responsibilities and how technology had influenced the profession overall. A content
analysis was conducted on 220 job advertisements that appeared in the professional
publication College & Research Libraries News between 1973 and 1998 demonstrated
that by 1998 all academic libraries jobs routinely included computer technology as a
skillset required for most positions in the academic library.

librarians over a ten-year period. Reference & User Services Quarterly, 44, 133-142.
A number o f studies specifically addressed advertisements for academic library
positions. In a study conducted by Furuta (1990), job advertisements published in
American Libraries between 1970 and 1989 exclusively for cataloging positions

48

indicated a significant decline in cataloging positions due to the automation o f cataloging
functions. Towsey (1997) conducted a similar study involving 2700 cataloging positions
advertised in the United States and the United Kingdom from March 1995 through
February 1996, which suggested a shift away from duties primarily for cataloging toward
positions that blended other duties alongside the cataloging responsibilities. Zhou (1996)
reported that academic library positions advertised between 1974 and 1994 illustrated an
increase in required computer skills.
In a study conducted by Reser and Schuneman (1992), 1,133 unique job
advertisements for academic library positions published in 1988 were analyzed to
compare to levels of computer skills, foreign-language requirements, previous work
experience, educational requirements, and minimum salary offered between public and
technical services positions in academic libraries. Public services (i.e., reference,
circulation, library instruction) and technical services (i.e., cataloging, acquisitions, and
serials) were the two most common divisions in the 20th century academic library. Reser
and Schuneman (1992) revealed that positions in the technical services division required
more computer skills and previous work experience, whereas public services positions
required more advanced degrees. Entry-level salaries for both groups were similar, but
salary increases in the public services division was more frequent due to more
opportunities to move into administration.
Using the same research design and variables from the Reser and Schuneman
(1992) study, Beile and Adams (2000) examined academic library job announcements
advertised in professional publications in 1996 to determine changes in the academic
library positions. The results o f the Beile and Adams (2000) study indicated a significant

49

decrease (i.e., more than 20 percent decline) in the number o f unique academic library
positions advertised in comparison to the Reser and Schuneman (1992).
A year-long study conducted by Sierra (2012) provides insight into current library
staffing priorities in the academic library, and evidence o f emerging job specializations in
librarianship. Sierra (2012) created Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5 to illustrate the
evolution o f academic library positions in the 21st century library, as a corollary o f the
integration o f technology, illustrating a distinctive contrast in the types o f positions held
by academic librarians in the 20th century and the 21st century libraries.

The New Futurist View of the Academic Library. Without question, the
proliferation o f technology has substantially disrupted the ‘mechanistic environment’
(i.e., relatively stable conditions) (Malone, 2007) o f libraries. The library organization in
which veteran academic librarians were trained to work three to four decades ago is
fundamentally different from the academic library today. Unlike the largely print/analog
environment o f the 20th century academic librarian, the 21st century academic librarian

51

exists in both the print and the digital environment (Grealy, 1997; Seal, 2001). Jackson
(2011) examined the skills librarians in the twenty-first century required which were
different skills from their predecessors and how they correlated with new position
descriptions. Futurists envisioned a world where technology would supplant traditional
library structures and collections, but the reality is that librarians consider technology as a
supplement to traditional means o f scholarship and communication (Grealy, 1997).
Utilizing five years o f archival data in online job banks, Fu (2014) compared the
responsibilities o f systems librarians supporting the traditional integrated library system
(ILS) with anticipated responsibilities associated with supporting the next generation ILS.
The results o f Fu’s (2014) study demonstrated a shift in the primary roles and
responsibilities of systems librarians supporting the next-generation ILS toward
becoming more human/organizations related, whereas the positions supporting the
traditional ILS showed that top roles are concentrated on information technology. Fu’s
(2014) findings suggest that systems librarians are expected to manage much less in
terms o f tasks related to information technology and should therefore re-engineer
themselves to support critical issues in the library relative to human/organization skills.
New technologies continue to be integrated into the library organization as library
services such as digital data curation, digital preservation, demand-driven e-book
acquisitions, and mobile technology become standard services in the 21st academic
libraries (Association o f College and Research Libraries, 2012). According to Block
(2003), the Internet has become a mixed blessing for libraries and librarians. On the one
hand, it provides opportunities to add services and expand collections; on the other, it has
increased user expectations and contributed to techno stress. Today’s academic librarian

52

is involved in continuous training as they are presented with new problems related to
access and preservation, and shrinking materials budgets.
There is a growing diversity in the types o f jobs needed to provide the services o f
the library organization. Increasingly, positions no longer require the master’s degree in
library science (MLS). As results, two different libraries exist in one organization- one
traditional and one digital. The easy convergence o f these two may be next to impossible
in the near future (Mobley, 2000).
Pink (2006) refers to the twenty-first century as the conceptual age where creators
and empathizers are important. He noted that “as individuals grow richer, as
technologies become more powerful, and as the world grows more connected, [affluence,
technological progress, and globalization] eventually gather enough collective
momentum to nudge us to a new era” (p. 49). Pink (2006) envisioned the conceptual age
as one where workers are “pattern recognizers and meaning makers” (p. 50), and
suggested that academic library administrators should consider the creative and analytical
skills as essential in designing the roles o f the librarian in the digital age.
The 21st Century Academic Library
It must be admitted that there is a degree o f instability which is inconsistent with
civilization. But on the whole the great ages have been unstable ages. Alfred North
Whitehead, British Philosopher (Bridges, 2003)
A popular truism o f our time is that the only constant is change, which, ironically,
was advocated by Heracleitus, the Greek philosopher about 2,500 year ago (Bridges,
2003). However, because the library profession o f the 21 st century exists in an everchanging state, the researcher is encouraged by Alfred North W hitehead’s statement

53

about the existence o f instability in great ages. Technology has barged into the social
consciousness o f academic libraries with a dizzying array o f new developments: in 1994,
the Netscape browser and the first search engines (i.e., Alta Vista, Dogpile, and Excite);
in 1996, the Palm Pilot; in 1997, Internet Explorer from Microsoft; in 1998-9, Google; in
2001, Wikipedia; during 2000-5, iPOD; during 2004-5, Google Print (which became
Google Books); and in 2005, YouTube (Goetsch, 2008, p. 161). While these
technologies have wrought changes in people’s lives, society felt little perturbation over
the direction being actively charted with each new development (Goetsch, 2008). Unlike
previous generations o f college students, today’s traditional college student has never
known a world without personal computers, video games, and the Internet (Boss &
Schmidt, 2007).
Michalak (2012) described the 21st century, transformed academic library as “out
ward facing, de-siloed, technology diffused, collaborative, and operated by an engaged
staff who demonstrate leadership in small and large ways in all sections o f the
organization” (p. 411). The library community has a strong record o f reflecting about the
future, but in an editorial appearing in an issue o f College and Research Libraries, Neal
(2014) argued that recent deliberations among the profession are far more robust and
substantive. Librarians are questioning the authority and the sacredness o f tradition with
deeper thinking about what the profession is, what do librarians do, and how is the
profession viewed and understood. Librarians are “embracing a shifting vision o f library
as legacy, as infrastructure, as repository, as gateway, as enterprise and as public interest.
We are bringing more relevant and sophisticated data to our planning, setting aside our
reputation as a knowledge-poor knowledge profession” (Neal, 2014, p. 614).

54

The role o f the library in teaching and learning, in research and scholarship is the
focus o f discussions held among professional library organizations (i.e. ALA, ACRL, and
ARL). On May 2-3, 2014, the American Library Association (ALA) brought together 80
individuals from all types o f libraries and organizations that work with libraries. The
discussion, held at the Library o f Congress, focused on trends that librarians would need
in order to lead libraries into the future (Walker, 2014).
Inarguably, the proliferation o f information technology since the advent o f the
Internet has greatly influenced the role o f librarians as well as the library organization.
Sennyey, Ross, and Mills (2009) asserted in an article that in the digital environment of
the 21st century library organization, the physical building, the collections, and staff were
inseparably linked; however, these facets o f the library organization are diverging. The
impact o f clouding o f three key facets o f the library is the loss o f clarity when
envisioning a future for the library organization. This is critically hindering for
administrators to undertake strategic planning how to map out new initiative and where
new resources should be allocated. Lynch, Murray-Rust, Parker, Turner, Walker,
Wilkinson, and Zimmerman (2007) developed a study which considered whether the
metaphor o f the library as “the heart o f the university” which had gained currency in the
late 19th century, remained powerful enough to secure funding for the library. Lynch’s,
et al., (2007) study replicated Grimes’ (1993) which was an investigation into the
centrality o f the university library. Using Grimes’(1993) same research questions, plus
an additional question about technology, Lynch et al., (2007) interviewed several
university presidents and provosts, which revealed that major changes have occurred in
the attitudes o f university leaders toward the university libraries. The findings in Lynch’s

55

et al study strongly indicated that library administrators need to seek new models o f
library service and reshape old models to fit the current environment o f American higher
education. Using centrality as the pivotal aspect in her research, Hackman (1985)
defined how closely the purposes o f an academic unit match the central mission o f its
institution. The concept o f centrality was useful in defining academic units as core (i.e.,
core units are those whose functions are essential to the central mission o f an institution)
or peripheral (i.e., peripheral units are the non-central parts o f the institution).
The Plight of the 21-Century Academic Library. Chu (2014) described three
aspect o f U.S. higher education in relation to the development o f academic libraries: (1)
how changes from governmental responsibility for fiscal management to institutional
privatization have caused campus academic units, including libraries, to remodel
themselves toward self-sustainability; (2) how higher education fiscal priorities have
counteracted traditional library philosophy; and (3) how academic libraries are seeking to
redefine their roles on the university campus due to the new norms (Chu, 2014). The
state o f finance in U.S. higher education can be characterized as a steady decline o f
public funding, amidst greater demand for access to resources, shifting student
demographics, expanding university boundaries, and the need for remedial education
(Nemetz & Cameron, 2006, p. 41. Stoffle, Leeder, and Sykes-Casavant (2008),
summarized the effects o f the financial crunch on academic libraries as “Basically, our
costs are increasing faster than any other sector o f the higher education community, and
our institutions, especially public ones, are receiving fewer funds or at least less new
money than the yearly increased costs o f the entire enterprise” (p. 4).

56

The 21st century academic library has undergone substantial change in response
to technology, globalization, and increasing competition for students, faculty, and
research funds. Academic librarians continually regenerate their roles and
responsibilities, replacing traditional roles with positions that never before existed in the
library environment (Goetsch, 2008).
Greying of the Profession
According to Franks (2012), the issues relative to aging workforces across all
industries were raised in the late 1940s and early 1950s; whereas, the impact o f aging in
librarianship was not highlighted until the mid-1980s. The predictions o f workforce
shortages did not gain traction until the 1990s with the publication o f articles utilizing
demographic data. Based primarily on the o f data from the Association o f Research
Libraries (ARL) 1990 and 1994 annual salary surveys, Wilder (1995), found as a
profession, librarianship has had an age profile older than most comparable professions
since 1970. According to a report prepared by the American Library Association (ALA)
(2009) Office o f Research and Statistics, in the U.S. Census Bureau population, 178,000
people identified their professions as librarians. O f that number, about 105,000 are
presumed to be “credentialed” librarians, meaning they have completed a master’s or
doctorate degree. Based on its 2009 survey o f ALA accredited LIS programs, the
Institute o f Museum and Library Services (IMLS) determined that the average age o f
librarians at graduation is 30.6. The much-analyzed graying o f the profession as Janes
(2013) writes in his article "The Toxic Middle" is not due solely to the aging o f existing
staff, but also to the age o f librarians when they enter the field. Research related to
ageism in librarianship (e.g., Flowers, 1993; Franks, 2012) largely focused on challenges

57

that older librarians would face such as stereotyping— e.g. being inflexible or uncreative,
unwilling to accept change or new technologies— to discrimination in hiring, promotion,
and evaluations.
Younger women who traditionally supported the relatively low-paying careers
represented by nursing, teaching, and librarianship are taking advantage o f other career
options available to them. The theme is echoed by (Lenzini, 2002) that careers once
dominated by women (i.e., nurses, librarians, teachers) will see shortages. Using Census
data from 1970 and comparing to 1990, Wilder (2003) finds that the number o f women
under 30 choosing "librarianship" declined 9 percent in the 20-year period, while the
overall growth in the profession rose 62 percent. Similarly, for nursing, the overall gain
was 120 percent, but only 31 percent among women under 30. Emerson (2005) noted
that the nursing faculty similarly was experiencing a decline due to retirement and
insufficient numbers of new scholars entering academia. Comparable to the library
profession, the nursing profession is also dependent upon the ongoing generation and
dissemination o f knowledge. For elementary teaching, the overall gain was 106 percent,
but the number o f women under 30 declined 16 percent in the same period. In
comparison, Wilder (2003) also looked at two professions previously dominated by
males: lawyers (overall gain o f 179 percent, women under 30 up 131 percent) and doctors
(overall gain o f 106 percent, women under 30 up 388 percent).
Forty percent o f the library profession is made up o f early boomers in their 50s
and are on the precipice o f retirement (American Library Association, 2009). Lynch
(2002) wrote about an expected wave o f retirements in an article titled “Reaching 65:
Lots o f Librarians Will Be There Soon”. Lynch (2002) questioned the future position o f

58

the library profession following the wave o f retirements. Maloney et al (2003) projected
more than 83,000 librarians across North America would reach retirement age by 2010.
Stewart’s (2010) study involving 176 U.S. research universities revealed that overall
staffing levels declined at the participating institutions, with a modest increase in
librarian positions between 2000 and 2008. The approaching wave o f retirements o f the
older baby boomer generation librarians forecasts an incredible resource drain o f research
librarians whose expertise crisscross the print to the digital worlds o f research (Curran,
2003). However, W ilder’s (2003) update to his 1995 ARL report projected that about
half o f the 2000 U.S. ARL academic librarian population will very likely be gone by
2020. Figure 6 shows credentialed librarians by five-year age group from under age 25
through ages 70 and over for 1980,1990,2000, and 2005. Each bar represents the
number o f librarians in a five-year group. The chart depicts growth in the profession
from 1980 to 2000 even as the median age increases. The increase in the median age o f
the library professional is reflected as the larger bars shift from left to right over the 25
years.

Figure 6. Number o f Credentialed Librarians by Age, 1980-2006.

The Multi-generational Workplace. As the average age o f the U.S. workforce
continues to increase, a great deal o f attention focuses on the fact that the workforce is
largely comprised o f three generations (i.e., Baby Boomers, Generation X, and
Millennials (Eisner, 2005). There has been increased concern that failure to recognize
generational differences could lead to negative organizational outcomes such as
intergenerational workplace conflict, misunderstanding and miscommunication, poor
working relationships, reduced employee productivity, poor employee well-being, and
lower innovation (Adams, 2000; Bradford, 1993; Dittman, 2005; Fyock, 1990;
Jurkiewicz, 2000; Westerman & Yamamura, 2007).
Munde (2010) projected that the Baby Boomer generation, who were bom
between 1946 and 1964, will remain in the workforce beyond the traditional retirement
age. As they approach the traditional retirement age o f 65, some baby boomers are
digging in their heels at the workplace, remaining true to their live to work reputation.

60

Nearly half (49%) o f boomers who are still working say they do not expect to retire until
they are 66 or older, including one in 10 who predict they will never retire (Harter &
Agrawal, 2014). Reasons suggested for the delays in retirement were in part due to the
downturn in the global economy. Concerns about their finances play a significant role in
many baby boomers’ decision to remain in the workforce. Even before the 2008-2009
recession. Retirement accounts and social security would not provide sufficient income
to retire comfortably and independent o f assistance from children. Aside from financial
considerations, baby boomers possessed a hard-charging work ethic and drive to get
ahead which make it difficult for them to envision downshifting into the slower pace of
retired life (Harter & Agrawal, 2014).
Davis (2005) predicted “The greatest estimated retirement wave occurs between
2010 and 2020, creating a potential deficit o f library and information science graduates
between 2015 and 2019” (p. 16). However, Gibaldi (2013) posited that due to a range o f
factors (e.g. sociological, psychological and economic); the baby boomer generation will
instead redefine its role in the library profession, thereby redefining retirement age.
Whereas the generations before the baby boomers looked forward to retire, Baby
Boomers would instead remain in the work force.
Thusly, for the first time in our history, we have four diverse generations being
asked to work together in the workplace (Hammill, 2005). Baby boomers' were the
largest generation bom in U.S. history. The sheer numbers coupled with their reluctance
to retire will likely ensure that their presence in the workplace for many years to come.
According to 2013 Gallup data shown in Table 5, the Baby Boomer generation still

61

constitutes about one-third o f the workforce, similar to percentages o f the younger
generations o f Millennials and Generations Xers.

There is abundant literature on multiple generations in the workplace (e.g.,
Hansen & Luety, 2012; Kunreuther, Kim, & Rodriguez, 2008; Mencl & Lester, 2014;
Pritchard & Whiting, 2014;) which focus on challenges and opportunities in
organizations composed o f Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials and to a lesser
extent, Traditionalists who were also known as the Silent Generation. Each generation is
different, with different perspectives and agendas, requiring different approaches to
management and supervision, which causes them to not mix effectively in the workplace.
This situation is particularly pronounced when a person from one generation supervises a
staff mostly from another generation (Pankl, 2004; Topper, 2007). Glass (2007)
examination o f the literature on generational difference (i.e., Baby Boomers, Generation
X, and Millennials) found workplace strife rising out o f differing generational
expectations, work ethics, attitudes, perspectives, and motivators.
Topper (2007) suggests that the first step to managing intergenerational
communication in the library organization is to understand what influences each

62

generation. Bridging multigenerational gaps between employees can occur by
recognizing that (a) all generations have similar values, (b) it is important to build and
nurture relationships, (c) leadership must define library goals and objectives, (d) ongoing
feedback is essential, (e) it is necessary to stress library values, (f) there are differences in
the organization, (g) the strength o f the organization are throughout, (h) managing
differences is key, (i) everyone in the organization deserves respect, and (j) no one likes
change.
Using a sample o f 8,040 participants from three different generations (i.e., Baby
Boomers, Generation Xers, and M illennial), Becton, Walker, and Farmer (2014) tested
multiple hypotheses derived from commonly held generational stereotypes. The authors
hypothesized that (hypothesis 1) Baby Boomers would exhibit fewer job mobility
behaviors and (hypothesis 2) Baby Boomers would also exhibit more compliance related
behaviors in comparison with both GenXers and Millennials, while (hypothesis 3)
GenXers would be less likely to work overtime in comparison with Baby Boomers and
Millennials. The results o f the study provided support for hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 3
and partial support for hypothesis 2; however, the effect sizes for these relationships were
small. The results of Becton, Walker, & Farmer’s (2014) study suggested that the effects
o f generational differences on workplace behavior do not appear to be as strong as
suggested by commonly held stereotypes.
Voices of the Retiring Librarian. During her term as the president o f the
American Library Association (2007-08) Loriene Roy initiated an oral history program
for retiring librarians called ‘‘'Capturing Our Stories.” Capturing Our Stories, a national
oral history program available in the American Library Association Digital Archives, so

63

far has produced 35 recordings with full transcripts. The genesis o f the project began out
o f concern about the field o f librarianship and the “graying o f the profession.” As
veteran librarians prepare to retire, there was a fear that the practice o f librarianship
would lose important history, context, skills, and experience as newer, less-experienced
librarians assumed leadership roles vacated by retiring librarians. The project’s goal is to
record the life histories o f selected retired/retiring librarians and disseminate and interpret
these stories as lessons for the current and future librarian workforce.
The researcher recognized the importance o f capturing the stories o f retired and
retiring librarians. Whereas, Capturing Our Stories project includes the voices o f
librarians from different sectors o f the library profession, the study focused on retired and
retiring members o f the academic community. In as much, the purpose o f the
phenomenological study was to examine the perceptions and lived experiences o f
selected veteran academic librarians who experienced dramatic periods o f change in
librarianship over the past three decades, which were largely influenced by technology.
Summary
Much has been speculated about a dramatically transformed 21 st century library;
however, the literature is glaringly lacking regarding the memories and emotions
experienced by librarians during and subsequent to disruptive changes. Sapp and
Gilmour (2002) wrote about the academic library from 1975 to 1989, presenting what
they characterized as “essays, editorials, addresses, or “thought pieces” (p. 554). In the
following statement, Sapp and Gilmour (2002) expressed concern about the lack o f indepth studies relative to the impact o f change in the academic library.

64

If there is any quantifiable research, it is generally taken from attitude surveys.
Thus, the material examined herein provides glimpses into what librarians were
thinking about, what they viewed as the greatest challenges, threats, and
aspirations for their profession during a period o f massive transition, (p. 554)
A subsequent Sapp and Gilmour (2003) article, which covered the period o f time from
1990 to 1999, provided an analytical overview on how academic librarians saw and
attempted to shape the future o f their profession during a period o f constant and
unprecedented change. However, the sentiment that research had failed to capture the
emotional essence and impact o f change remained.

65

CHAPTER III
Methodology
Introduction
In Chapter III o f my study, I continue to apply Onwuegbuzie’s, et al. (2012) 13steps for conducting research, which comprised selecting the qualitative research design
(Sampling Design, Step 6), selecting the qualitative research design (Research Design,
Step 7), and determining the data collection process (Data Collection, Step 8). Following
an extensive review o f the literature, I posited that, with the advent o f the Internet, the
information world changed profoundly which led to complex, dynamic, and
multidimensional changes to the library environments in which veteran academic
librarians were expected to perform.
With semi-structured questions, I endeavored to uncover the memories associated
with the transformation o f the library organization in the advent o f technology.
According to Lincoln and Guba (1985), a semi-structured interview protocol allowed the
participants to reconstruct their past experiences that were the central purpose to the
study. Additionally, purposeful dialogue was used to obtain a clear understanding o f
viewpoints shared by the participants. The researcher explored the emotions that arose as
a result o f the vast and chaotic nature o f change in the library organization through a set
o f research questions.
The interviewee was the sole contributor o f information; therefore, social
constructivism was the identified research paradigm for this study. Williamson (2006)
described constructivism as being “concerned with the ways in which people construct
their worlds. The social constructivist researcher places emphasis on people developing

66

meanings for their activities or experiences, (that is, socially constructing reality). Guba
(1990) stated that “no research paradigm is without ethical problems” (p. 83). As a
constructivist, the researcher should assent to the system o f ethics that governs inquiry
and the relationship between the researcher and research participants. In keeping with the
commitment to safeguard the ethics o f the study, I properly addressed matters regarding
informed consent, privacy, and confidentiality.
Context o f Study
The purpose o f the phenomenological study was to examine the perceptions and
lived experiences o f selected veteran academic librarians who experienced dramatic
periods o f change in librarianship over the past three decades, which were largely
influenced by technology. Veteran academic librarians who were employed in libraries
when technology became the intrusive and disruptive force in the library environment
have been at the forefront o f profound changes in the library academy; yet, a dearth o f
scholarly research exists related to the emotional reactions o f librarians who experienced
the many changes and the ultimate redefining o f the library organization’s identity.
Theoretical Frameworks
The theoretical and methodological approach o f phenomenology were the most
appropriate framework for developing a research agenda and for unifying existing lines
o f research in the area o f affective memories o f veteran librarian experiences in the
library organization. To illustrate the promise o f this approach and to facilitate its
application, I described a research design unvarying with the theoretical principles o f
phenomenology, including methods for collecting and analyzing data as well as ethical
and validity considerations specific to this research design.

67

The research questions for this study were formulated using the Affective Events
Theory (AET), developed by Weiss and Cropanzano (1996) and the Organizational
Identity Theory (OIT), developed by Albert and Whetten (1985). Affective Events
Theory focused on the (a) structure, causes and consequences o f affective experiences at
work (i.e., satisfaction and affect are not equivalent constructs); (b) events as proximal
causes o f affective reactions (i.e., environmental features influence affect primarily by
making affective events more or less likely); (c) time (i.e., affect levels fluctuate over
time); and dimensional structures o f affective reactions (i.e., emphasizes the importance
o f the structure o f the psychological experience). Organizational identity theory was
used to inform further my study and to identify a core set o f commonalities among people
in a specific social group or profession. Constant change in the library profession during
the latter part o f the 20th century, continuing into the 21st century, required academic
librarians to continually redefine and expand their role on the university campus to
maintain the library’s position as the ‘heart o f the university’ (Euster, 1995, p. 2; Gyure,
2008, p. 107). Organizational identity theory can be linked to the social identity theories
o f Cooley (1902), Mead (1934) and Goffman (1959). Organizational scholars have
generally referred to potentially disrupting events (i.e., technology) as identity threats
(Elsbach & Kramer, 1996; Ginzel, Kramer, & Sutton, 1993).
Research Planning Stage
The research planning stage involved selecting the sampling design (Step 6) and
the research design (Step 7) o f Onwuegbuzie’s, et al. (2012) 13-steps for conducting
research. These steps were interactive and iterative because choice o f sampling design
affected the selection o f research design and vice versa.

68

Qualitative Instrument. Determining the research question(s) was an extremely
important step in the qualitative research process because these questions narrow the
research objective and research purpose to specific questions that researchers attempt to
address in their studies (Creswell, 2009; Johnson & Christensen, 2004). As such, I
created research questions that would ensure the interactive, fluid, emergent, and iterative
research process. The qualitative research questions were semi-structured “open-ended,
evolving, and non-directional” (Creswell, 1998, p. 99). Typically, qualitative research
questions are designed to gain insights into a particular educational, familial, and social
processes and experiences within a specified location and (Connolly, 1998; Onwuegbuzie
& Leech, 2006; Onwuegbuzie, et al, 2012).
Research Questions. The central research question addressed in my study was:
What were some o f the lived experiences o f veteran academic librarians in adapting to
technological change in academic libraries in the state o f Texas? Three sub-questions
underlying the central research were : (1) To what extent do veteran academic librarians
associate emotions with their memories o f transformative changes that have occurred in
the academic library organization in the last three decades?; (2) How do veteran
academic librarians describe their emotional memories specific to technological changes
in academic libraries?; and (3) To what extent did the veteran academic librarians
perceive that library administrators provided them with necessary resources to adapt to
changes?
Sampling Framework
A sampling framework defined the participants who were eligible to be included
in a given sample — in the sense o f drawing a boundary or frame around those cases that

69

are acceptable for inclusion in the sample (Miles & Huberman, 1994. Onwuegbuzie and
Collins (2007) and Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2007a) identified 24 sampling schemes,
which fall into one of two classes: random sampling (i.e., probabilistic sampling)
schemes or non-random sampling (i.e., purposive sampling) schemes. Furthermore,
Onwuegbuzie and Collins (2007) and Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2007a) theorized the
existence o f : (a) parallel sampling designs, which represent a body o f sampling strategies
that facilitate credible comparisons o f two or more different subgroups that are extracted
from the same levels o f study; (b) nested sampling designs, which are sampling strategies
that facilitate credible comparisons o f two or more members o f the same subgroup,
wherein one or more members o f the subgroup represent a sub-sample o f the full sample;
and (c) multilevel sampling designs, which represent sampling strategies that facilitate
credible comparisons o f two or more subgroups that are extracted from different levels of
study. Generalization to a specific population was not the goal o f my goal; but instead to
obtain insights into a particular phenomenon; therefore, I ascertained the appropriateness
o f a nonprobability or purposive sampling strategy for the study (Connolly, 1998).
Step 6: Selecting a Sampling Scheme. A criterion sampling scheme, which
involves identifying cases o f individuals who meet a certain criterion, was determined to
be appropriate based on the research purpose and research questions. According to Miles
and Huberman (1994), the criterion sampling scheme is used for quality assurance. The
participants in the study possessed the following characteristics:
1. Possessed a master’s degree in library and/or information science (MLS) from an
institution accredited by the American Library Association; and

70

2. Employed in the library profession for 30 years or more o f which the last 20 years o f
their professional career employed at the postsecondary segment o f higher education.
Veteran academic librarians who retired within five years o f the study were considered
for the study. Also, the researcher determined that there would be an opportunity to
obtain richer data if there were no discrimination in regards to the roles or positions held
by the librarians, i.e., reference librarian, cataloger, or library administrator.
In my study, I considered whether the sampling framework was ethical in regards
to informed consent and the relationship with the participants. The relevancy o f the
conceptual framework and the research questions were considered in determining the
sampling framework (Miles & Huberman, 1994). However, the goal o f the study was not
to generalize to a population, but to obtain insights into a phenomenon, individuals, or
events; therefore, I purposefully selected participants, i.e., non-random sampling strategy,
to maximize understanding o f the underlying phenomenon (Onwuegbuzie & Collins,
2007). Therefore, the criterion sampling scheme was determined to be the appropriate
method based on the research purpose and research questions.
According to Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2007b), generally, sample sizes in
qualitative research that are too large will make it difficult to extract thick, rich data.
Conversely, a sample that is too small will cause difficulty in achieving data saturation
(Flick, 1998; Morse, 1995), theoretical saturation (Strauss & Corbin, 1990), or
informational redundancy (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). According to Onwuegbuzie and
Collins (2007), the size o f the sample should be informed by the research objective,
research question(s), and, subsequently, the research design. The researcher utilized
interviews as the primary method for collecting data; therefore, five participants were

71

identified for the study (Guest, Bunce, & Johnson, 2006). The number o f participants for
a phenomenological study varies considerably; however, Polkinghome (1989) suggests
interviews with 5 to 25 participants, which is in line with the recommendation o f (Guest
et al., 2006) who demonstrated that six interviews may be “sufficient to enable
development o f meaningful themes and useful interpretations” (p. 78). More specifically,
participants in the study comprised five academic research librarians who have worked in
the library profession for at least 30 years.
The participants for the study were veteran academic librarians who have worked
in or have retired from the library profession for 30 or more years o f which the last 20
years o f their professional careers have been in a university library in the United States.
The researcher identified veteran librarians who were currently employed in academic
libraries or retired in the last five years utilizing the membership directory o f the College
and University Division (CULD) o f the Texas Library Association (TLA). Annual TLA
directory publications generally comprise approximately 700 librarians from 2-year and
4-year colleges, both public and private institutions (Texas Library Association, 2013).
However, I contacted potential research participants for my study primarily through the
professional network which I had developed over the course o f my career.
Overview of the Research Design
For the study, I utilized a phenomenological research design. According to
Janesick (2000), “The essence o f good qualitative research design turns on the use o f a
set o f procedures that are simultaneously open-ended and rigorous and that do justice to
the complexity o f the social setting under study” (p. 379).

72

Step 7: Research Design. Around the turn o f the twentieth century, Edmund
Husserl, a professor at Freiberg University in Germany, established phenomenology as a
philosophy—a way o f reaching true meaning through penetrating deeper and deeper into
reality. Husserl (1970) posited that there was a relation between consciousness and
objects o f knowledge. Husserl’s (1970) phenomenology sought to develop a science of
phenomena that would clarify how objects are experienced and how they are presented to
human consciousness (Spinelli, 2005). According to Husserl (1970), when a particular
phenomenon is examined, the phenomenon should speak for itself. Giorgi (1985) used
this perception as a basis for developing, systematizing, and even popularizing
phenomenology for the study o f psychological phenomena. The roots o f phenomenology
rest in philosophy but toward the latter part o f the twentieth century (Manen, 1997),
phenomenology as a methodology, was ascribed as a qualitative research method.
A phenomenological research design was used in the qualitative study because it
was the ideal method for understanding the lived experiences o f a small number o f
participants because the researcher was able to identify patterns and relationships o f
meaning through extensive and prolonged engagement (Moustakas, 1994). The
fundamental objective o f phenomenological research was to develop a greater
understanding o f individual’s experiences through the perception o f the experiencer
(Giorgi, 2009). Phenomenology is philosophically and epistemologically grounded,
systematic, well developed, and widely used methodology (e.g., Giorgi, 2009; Karlsson,
1993; Polkinghome, 1989). As a qualitative research method, phenomenology applies a
descriptive and reflective approach to analyze the implicit meanings that distinguish a
phenomenon, and searches for the interrelationships between these meanings in the form

73

o f a meaning structure (Langdridge, 2007; Zayed, 2008; Manen, 1997). As such, “the
main emphasis o f phenomenological research is to describe or to interpret human
experience as lived by the experiencer in a way that can be used as a source o f qualitative
evidence” (Mayoh & Onwuegbuzie, 2013, p. 92). The researcher focused on the lived
experiences o f the veteran academic librarians selected for this study and their
interactions within their lifeworld, which is the academic library organization (Morse &
Field, 1995).
Researcher’s Philosophical Stance
The phenomenology study was rooted in the interpretivist/constructivist paradigm
which grew out o f the philosophy o f Edmund Husserl's (1970) phenomenology study o f
interpretive understanding called hermeneutics (Mertens, 2005). As such, the researcher
for the phenomenological study sought to understand the experiences o f veteran
academic librarians as the academic library integrated technology, suggesting that reality
is socially constructed (Mertens, 2005) The researcher relied upon the
interpretivist/constructivist philosophical stance to focus on the study’s participants views
o f the situation being studied (Creswell, 2013).
Lincoln and Guba (1985) asserted that constructivism embrace a relativist
ontology, a transactional epistemology, and a hermeneutic, dialectical methodology. The
constructivist paradigm is oriented to the production o f reconstructed understandings o f
the social world. Nonetheless, there is no absolute way to categorize the various
philosophical and theoretical perspectives that typify types o f qualitative inquiry (cf.
Creswell, 1998; Denzin, 1998; Denzin and Lincoln, 1998; Lincoln and Guba, 2000;
Patton, 2002; Schwandt, 2000). The core premise that exists in qualitative research is

74

that its data can be constructed as text, whether amassed through documentation o f
observations, interviews, and diaries, visual and electronic data and existing documents.
Sensemaking occurs once researchers transform the data into a text that is ready for
interpretation (Ben-Ari & Enosh, 2011). According to Denzin (1998),
In the social sciences there is only interpretation. Nothing speaks for itself.
Confronted within a mountain o f impressions, documents, and field notes, the
qualitative researcher faces the difficult and challenging task o f making sense o f
what has been learned. I call making sense o f what has been learned the art o f
interpretation, (p. 313)
As such, the findings from the phenomenological study are understandable only within
the context o f the study. However, an amalgamation of the theoretical framework,
reflective processes, and analytical procedures facilitated knowledge production, without
the expectation for generalization (Ben-Ari & Enosh, 2011). However, the researcher’s
lens was not the only perspective that governed the validity o f the study. Richardson
(1994) used the metaphor o f a crystal as an image for validity: “Crystals are prisms that
reflect externalities and refract within themselves. What we see depends on our angle o f
repose” (p. 522).
Researcher Bias
Conducting Phenomenological Research. According to LeCompte (1993), the
research design focuses on the purpose o f the study, the research questions, and
determines what information will most appropriately answer specific research questions,
and the best strategy for obtaining that information. In spite o f the general agreement
regarding the central concern o f phenomenological research, deciding how to conduct a

75

phenomenological research is the area where debate abounds. Some researchers espouse
to the descriptive approach to phenomenology research and others ascribe to the
interpretive layers. Other researchers insist on a rigorous, scientific method; while others
a more poetic, artistic flourish. According to Finlay (2012), in spite o f the divergent
points o f view, there is a way forward through the seemingly divergent
phenomenological research approaches. The essence o f the phenomenological research
approach encompasses five mutually dependent and dynamically iterative processes that
diminish any differences. The phenomenological process includes (a) embracing the
phenomenological attitude; (b) entering the lifeworld (through descriptions o f
experiences); (c) dwelling with horizons o f implicit meaning; (d) explicating the
phenomenon holistically and dialectically; and (e) integrating frames o f reference.
Phenomenology is considered a process as well as a method. Subjectivity is a key
component in eliciting the deeply embedded meanings in everyday life and language; the
concern is to make the unspoken visible and audible. Phenomenological inquiry focuses
on interviewing and gaining understanding o f the meaning o f the participant's
experiences (Manen, 1997).
Role of the Researcher
“The crises o f representation, legitimation, and praxis make it important for
interpretive researchers to be aware o f the role that their biases can play in exacerbating
these crises during the course o f a qualitative study” (Onwuegbuzie, Leech & Collins,
2008, p. 2). As such, I recognized that my personal perspectives as a veteran may allow
the effects o f researcher bias. According to Miles and Huberman (1994), researcher bias
can emanate from two sources: (a) the effects o f the researcher on the study

76

participant(s)/key informant(s) and (b) the effects o f the study participant(s)/key
informant(s) on the researcher. In order to minimize the effect o f researcher bias,
bracketing o f my experiences was necessary to remain objective and capture the true
essence o f the participants’ experiences (Hammersley & Atkinson, 1995). “When we
enter into a phenomenological attitude, we suspend our beliefs and we bracket the world
and all things in the world. We put the world and the things in it, into brackets or into
parentheses” (Sokolowski, 2000, p. 49).
However, there is a lack o f consensus among qualitative research scholars as to
when bracketing should occur within the context o f research. Giorgi (2009) advocated
bracketing during the analysis phase, whereas, Glaser (1992) advocated developing
biases at the start o f the research study and Rolls and Relf (2006), Ashworth (1999), and
Peshkin (1988) encouraged bracketing throughout the research. As such, while
conducting my study, I embraced the position o f researchers who believed that biases
should be addressed throughout the phenomenological research process.
Although there are multiple methods o f bracketing, none are mutually exclusive
to the process and may complement one another (Tufford & Newman, (2010). One such
bracketing type is reflexivity. According to Hesse-Biber and Leavy (2007), the
researcher’s reflexive perspective begins with an understanding o f the importance o f
one’s own values and attitudes in relation to the research process. This recognition
begins prior to entering the field. Reflexivity means taking a critical look inward and
reflecting on one’s lived reality and experiences; this self-reflection or journey can be
extremely helpful in the research process. Reflexivity is the process through which a
researcher recognizes, examines, and understands how his or her social background and

77

assumptions can intervene in the research process. Reflexivity goes to the heart o f an indepth interview; it is a process whereby the researcher is sensitive to the important
‘situational’ dynamics that exist between the researcher and the researched that can affect
the creation o f knowledge (pp. 129-130).
Bracketing can be achieved by writing memo or journaling throughout the data
collection and analysis stages as a way for the researcher to examine and reflect upon the
data collected (Cutcliffe, 2003). Glaser (1998) viewed the journaling a process as one o f
freedom, as opposed to one of constraint, with the added advantage o f driving important
insights into the data. Bracketing can also be achieved by engaging in interviews with a
neutral party to uncover and bring into awareness preconceptions and biases (Rolls and
Relf, 2006). A colleague or research associate can participate in bracketing which serves
as an interface between the researcher and the research data. Another method of
bracketing is through maintaining a reflexive journal prior to defining the research
question, in which preconceptions are then identified throughout the research process
(Ahem, 1999). The maintenance o f ajoum al can enhance the researcher’s ability to
sustain a reflexive stance.
Prior to data collection, I bracketed my potential biases by positioning m yself in
my own narrative as a 35-year veteran academic librarian who is currently employed as a
library director at a medium sized higher education institution located in east Texas. I
also attempted to bracket biases during the data analysis and interpretation phase by
applying epoche as part o f the phenomenological reduction proves (Moustakas, 1994). I
have served in the administrative position o f library director for eight year and as

78

associate director for information services for five years at the same institution prior to
my appointment to library director.
Although I have spent the majority o f my professional career working in an
academic library setting, I have also worked in administrative position in a public library
system for seven years in northern Louisiana. From 1982 through 1989,1 worked as the
head o f children’s services for the public library system. In this position, there were very
few opportunities for me to work directly with new technologies. I was not directly
involved in the library systems’ migration to neither its first online catalog nor any o f the
early online reference searching tools, such as InfoTrac. Admittedly, I was quite content
in my primary role of developing children’s programs at the main library branch and the
10 branch libraries and 9 parish part-time libraries. A significant amount o f my time was
spent building relationships with parents and their children in the community and schools
and designing publicity campaigns. My responsibilities for book selection did not require
use o f technology to submit orders. The most advanced equipment that I used in this
position was a typewriter with memory.
The topic for this study was borne out o f my memory o f recoiling from the
mandate o f the public library director to begin to use a desktop computer. In 1989, an
IBM desktop computer was delivered to my office. I did not understand why it was
important for me to learn to use this computer. Years later, I acknowledged that I was
afraid o f it. I was comfortable in the manner in which I was conducting my
responsibilities as a children’s librarian. I had enjoyed a measure o f success in building
strong community relationships and increasing children and parents’ use o f the library
throughout the parish. I was fortunate to host a weekly 30-minute storytime which aired

79

on the local television station for several years. In hindsight, I resented the intrusion into
my comfort zone by a computer that I believed offered me no added value. My reaction
to this new development is still quite vivid. I submitted my two-week notice and left that
job. It took me a while to recover from this negative experience, so I did not work in the
library profession for over a year.
In June o f 1990,1 accepted a position as head o f access services, which included
circulation, interlibrary loan, and reserve services, at the medical library which served the
medical school and hospital in northern Louisiana. During the interview, there was no
mention o f computers or any expectations that I would need to learn any related
technology skills. When I entered my office on my first day o f work, there was no
computer. There was a computer in the common area in the department, but naively, I
gave that no thought. Imagine my surprise and utter dismay when one week later, a
desktop computer was delivered to my office! A bookshelf filled with computer manuals
accompanied it. This was so upsetting to me that I immediately marched into the library
director’s office and told him that I did not know how to use that computer. He very
calmly looked at me and said, “Well, go into your office, close the door, and learn.” I
looked at him, aghast. Fuming, I returned to my office and considered my options. The
future o f libraries had arrived and it was different from what I had experienced or
expected. I loved my profession, so I had no choice but to embrace the change. I did just
as the library director had told me to do. That was the best advice I could have received.
I have used that same mindset whenever I have faced something that looks and feels
different. Change does not always feel good, but for the good o f the profession and for
the good o f the public we serve, it is worth it.

80

Clearly, I am biased by my own experiences, both personal and professional. In
my current position of library director in an academic library, my focus is to implement
meaningful change and to balance that with bringing the staff along in the process. There
are limitations to change that are beyond budgetary concerns. I understand that
sometimes the most unyielding obstacles reside in the minds and heart o f the organization
and sometimes the people we serve. Patience can be a virtue, but sometimes a mandate is
the appropriate stance. Technology is going nowhere. The 21st century academic library
must be responsive and supportive o f the academic mission o f the university. The
manner in which that is accomplished; what that will look like, is very different in many
ways from the academic library o f 35 years ago. The roles o f the librarians, including my
role as library director, have changed. I must believe that change is worth doing, I have a
find a way to make it happen.
Research Implementation Stage
The research implementation stage comprised the following four steps: data
collection, data analysis, data validation, and data interpretation. These four steps are
extremely cyclical and interactive.
Step 8: Data Collection. According to Miles and Huberman (1994), one
characteristic of qualitative data is that it is more inclined to be collected in close
proximity to the specific situation, e.g., direct observation or interview, with the influence
o f the local context being taken into account and not being discarded. In his compendium
o f methods to collect data, Creswell (2009) lists four general categories: observations,
interviews, documents, and audiovisual materials for data collection. In this
phenomenological study, the in-depth, face-to-face interview was the primary method o f

81

data collection used to allow each participant to talk about their individual experiences as
they are remembered (Creswell, 2007). In addition to personal testimonials and
biographies, interview questions were developed to obtain what truly needed to be known
(Anfara, Brown, & Mangione, 2002).
It is generally accepted that theory, as an integral component o f research, forms
the basis for which a researcher decided which facets o f reality to investigate, which
methodology to employ, and how to interpret the empirical data. Accordingly,
researchers (see e.g. Charmaz, 2006; Glaser, 1992; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Mitchell &
Cody, 1993; Strauss & Corbin, 1998) believed the researcher must venture into the field
with as little theory as possible, and allow the phenomena to reveal themselves
(Bendassolli, 2014). However, in the qualitative research study, the researcher used the
two aforementioned theoretical frameworks, the affective events theory and
organizational identity theory, to direct the interview questions. The interview questions
were grounded in the extant literature about the transformation o f the academic library
from the 20th-century to the 21st-century.
Baker (2014) described the transformation o f the academic library as “moving
from a static, locational understanding o f the library as a place in space to a more
dynamic, process-oriented conception o f library” (p. 99). However, there is limited
research that examined how the veteran academic librarian navigated the driving factors
o f change such as networked technologies, ubiquitous search engines, social technologies
and digitization o f content (Michalak, 2012). As such, the underlying goal o f the study
was to unveil the undercurrents o f change by exposing the relationship between
emotional salience and workplace events related to technology change. Through the lens

82

of the affective events theory and the organizational identity, the researcher examined
affective behaviors such as anger, frustration, joy and other varying behaviors and their
implications in the work environment (Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996).
Additionally, formulating interview questions through the lens o f the
organizational identity theory (Albert & Whetten, 1985) allowed the researcher to
consider the organizational impact and even concerns for the future direction o f the
profession due to the integration o f technology into the academic library. The researcher
anticipated the study would contribute significantly to previous studies about technologydriven change in academic libraries. Gilstrap (2007) suggested that studies were needed
that focused on the emotions o f librarians during these periods o f constant change to
facilitate the development o f coping mechanisms and strategies in academic libraries.
Additionally, library science curriculum may be enriched by the acknowledgment o f the
relevance o f these memories. Another perspective considered by the researcher was the
vein of social theory that was applied in studying the academic libraries as a social
phenomenon in search o f a new identity on university campuses.
The procedure involved the researcher asking semi-structured, guiding questions
o f the six veteran academic librarians during the interview process to develop patterns
and relationships o f meaning. Librarians were interviewed individually to examine their
lived experiences while working in the academic library organization.
The interview questions in a phenomenology study were open-ended in nature, in
keeping with the tenets o f phenomenological research (Moustakas, 1994) and framed to
help the research participants report their experiences, as recalled, rather than to give
complex descriptions. Taylor (1980) suggested that the interviewing style should

83

preferably be in the form o f a conversation rather than an interrogative style to ensure
that the research participants feel comfortable and at ease. The semi-structured questions
were constructed by the researcher in advance; however, the prepared interview questions
were not necessarily asked if the participant shared his or her experiences within the
bracketed interview question (Moustakas, 1994).
The researcher acknowledged being a part o f the demographic group in the study;
therefore, during the interview process, the researcher set aside her own experiences as a
veteran academic librarian in order to understand those o f the participants in the study
(Creswell, 2009).
An interview protocol is more than a list o f interview questions, but is also a
procedural guide for directing the researcher through the interview process (Jacob &
Furgerson, 2012). Qualitative researchers interested in the ethnographic and oral history
traditions o f the field, ask people to share their stories. Polkinghome (1989) encouraged
the researcher to prompt participants to declare information that is experiential in nature.
The researcher used the following interview protocol with each participant:
1. Tell me about your professional career as an academic librarian? What positions/roles
have you held in the academic library organization?
2. What influenced your decision to become a librarian?
3. Describe the types o f technology that was part o f the library organization when you
first began your career.
4. Please share an early memory(s) once you learned that computers and other
technology would become part o f the library’s infrastructure?

84

5. How would you describe your level o f job satisfaction in the library organization
“before computers” era (BC)? In the “after computers” era (AC)?
6. Is there a particular event or decision that was technology-driven that directly or
indirectly impacted your job responsibilities? Describe whether the change initially
positively or negatively impacted you.
7. Please discuss whether at any point in your career you considered a career change due
to the changes that have occurred in libraries as a result o f technology.
8. Describe your perception o f the library profession’s identity and the status o f the
academic library on the university campus prior to the integration o f technology.
9. Has there been a shift in your perception regarding the profession’s identity and the
library’s status in today’s environment? If so, in what ways?
10. How would you describe your level o f job satisfaction before computers (BC)?
Describe your level o f job satisfaction after computers (AC)?
11. Now that we are in the 21 st century library, how would you rate your ability to
adapt/embrace to new technologies over the course o f your career? (a)
Slowly/Reluctantly (b) Average (c) Easily/Quickly
12. Have you experienced technostress, which is defined as a negative impact on
attitudes, thoughts, behaviors, or body physiology that is caused either directly or
indirectly by technology integration in the library organization? If so, what
mechanisms/strategies did you employ to reduce or overcome it?
13. What was the most effective communication strategy used in the library organization
to introduce a new technology?

85

14. What is your remembrance o f the technology that had the most unsettling affect on
library personnel in the course o f your career?
15. What character traits are needed to be a successful librarian in the face o f change?
16. What skill set(s) do you think are needed to be a successful librarian in the 21st
century library?
17. What new organizational structures/staffmg/positions have emerged as a result o f
technology?
18. Is there anything that you would like to add?
The data for the study were collected using the interview protocol. The strength
o f the interview protocol lies in the researcher’s ability to freely use probes or prompts to
obtain additional information or clarification (Johnson & Christensen, 2012). Each
interview lasted between 60 and 90 minutes and took place in a location that was
agreeable to the researcher and the participant. Interview data were captured using audio­
recording for later transcription and coding.
Ethical nature o f data collection. The researcher sought permission to conduct
the study from the Sam Houston State University Institutional Review Board (IRB), as
well as obtained the written consent o f participating veteran librarians. Once permission
was granted by the IRB to conduct the study, participants for the study were recruited and
the required informed consent documents were obtained. The researcher took the
necessary steps to ensure that confidentiality o f the interviews are observed and that
documentation obtained in the study were secured in a location for a period o f 5 years,
after which the documents will be destroyed (Sieber, 1998).

86

Timeline fo r data collection. The data collection process for the study took place
over a three-week period. During this phase o f the study, the researcher conducted
individual, semi-structured interviews with the librarians selected for the study
Step 9: Data Analysis. Hatch (2002) defines data analysis as the systematic
search for meaning, wherein, the researcher is the main tool for analysis, regardless of
whether a computer program is used to assist in the analysis (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005).
The data analysis process involved organizing and interrogating data to facilitate the
emergence o f patterns, themes, to discover relationships, develop explanations, make
interpretations, mount critiques, or generate categorization, hypothesizing, comparison,
and pattern finding. Throughout the process, the researcher’s own intellectual capacities
were engaged to make sense of qualitative data. More often than quantitative
researchers, qualitative researchers display a heightened sensitivity to how a social
situation or process is interpreted from a particular background and set o f values and not
simply based on the situation itself (Altheide & Johnson 1998). In their article about
reflexivity in qualitative research, Ben-Ari and Enosh (2010) cited four levels o f analysis
o f the phenomenon in question: observation, informants’ accounts, text deliberation, and
contextualization and reconstruction. At each level, the researcher went beyond the
descriptive data, as “attaching significance to what was found, making sense o f the
findings, offering explanations, drawing conclusions, extrapolating lessons, making
inferences, considering meanings, and otherwise imposing order on an unruly, but surely
patterned world” (Patton, 2002, p. 480).
Observation is one o f the earliest and most basic forms o f gathering information
and gaining knowledge, and is one o f the main sources o f gathering material about the

87

social world (Adler and Adler, 1998). The contextualization and reconstruction levels
focused on examining the relationships between the knowledge producer and the
informants, while contextualizing the phenomenon under study within the larger social,
political, ethical, ideological and historical context.
M oustakas’s (1994) modification o f van Kaam’s (1959, 1966) seven steps for
analyzing phenomenological data were utilized. The seven steps included: (a)
horizontalization (i.e., placing all participants' answers on one level and subsequently
eliminating redundant parts); (b) reduction and elimination (i.e., determine if the
participants' expressions emerge into a theme); (c) clustering and identifying core themes
(i.e., thematic labeling); (d) validation (i.e., themes are expressed explicitly and are
compatible with participants’ experiences); (e) Individual Textural Description (i.e.,
examples from the transcribed interviews); (f) Individual Structural Description (i.e., a
description o f the participants' words and analysis o f how the themes fit together); and (g)
Textural-Structural Description (i.e., capture the essence o f the phenomenon from steps 5
and 6).
Step 10: Data Legitimation. In qualitative research, both internal and external
validity are considered. Internal validity is defined by Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2007b)
as truth value, applicability, consistency, and neutrality during the analysis phase.
External credibility refers to the degree that the findings o f a study can be generalized
across different populations o f persons, settings, contexts, and times. Threats to internal
credibility and external credibility appear in the Qualitative Legitimation Model in Figure
7 (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2007b).

Limitations o f the Study. According to Morrow (2005), qualitative research,
which can originate from a variety o f disciplines, paradigms, and epistemologies,
embraces multiple standards o f quality, known as validity. According to Maxwell (1992)
validity “pertains to this relationship between an account and something outside o f that
account, whether this something is construed as objective reality, the constructions o f

89

actors, or a variety o f other possible interpretations (p. 283). Thusly, it is always possible
for there to be different, equally valid accounts from different perspectives o f a single
phenomenon. Maxwell (1992) identified five legitimation types, namely: descriptive
validity (i.e., factual accuracy o f the account as documented by the researcher (e.g.,
accuracy o f transcribed interviews), interpretive validity (i.e., the extent to which the
researcher’s interpretation o f the account represents an understanding o f the perspective
o f the underlying group and the meanings attached to the members’ words and actions),
theoretical validity (i.e., the extent to which a theoretical explanation developed from
research findings is consistent with the data), evaluative validity (i.e., the extent to which
an evaluation framework can be applied to the objects o f study, as opposed to a
descriptive, interpretive, or explanatory one), and generaiizability (i.e., the extent to
which a researcher can generalize the account o f a particular situation, context, or
population to other individuals, times, settings, or context).
Building upon the work o f Maxwell (1992), Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2007b)
developed the Qualitative Legitimation Model, (See Figure 7), which show threats to
internal validity and external. Threats to validity were possible at three major stages o f
the research process, (i.e., research design/data collection, data analysis, and data
interpretation). These stages in the phenomenology research design were iterative,
meaning that three stages were non-linear (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2007b; Onwuegbuzie,
et al., 2012). Onwuegbuzie & Leech (2007b) identify 29 elements o f legitimation, which
will be either internal (i.e., refers to the truth value, applicability, consistency, neutrality,
dependability, and/or credibility o f interpretations and conclusions within the underlying

90

setting or group) or external (i.e., refers to the degree that the findings o f a study can be
generalized across different populations o f persons, settings, contexts, and times.
In the design/data collection, data analysis, and data interpretation stages, the
researcher observed four o f Tashakkori and Teddlie’s (2010) six elements o f interpretive
rigor that are particularly relevant to qualitative research: (a) interpretive agreement (i.e.,
whether interpretations are consistent across researchers in the field and with
interpretations o f participants) (b) interpretive distinctiveness (i.e., whether
interpretations are the most credible based on findings and alternative explanations); (c)
interpretive consistency (i.e., whether the inferences are consistent with findings); and (d)
theoretical consistency (i.e., whether the inferences are consistent with the existent theory
and research in the field).
Increasing Legitimation. Guba and Lincoln (1989) discussed five authenticity
criteria that embody constructionist understanding and assist in increasing legitimation:

(a) fairness: the extent to which the researcher values the process o f evaluation, (b)
ontological authenticity: the extent to which the researcher assesses how the participant
has become more informed and aware, (c) educative authenticity: the criteria by which
those involved in the interview process have become more understanding o f others, (d)
catalytic authenticity: the extent by which actions are facilitated and stimulated by
participants, and (e) tactical authenticity: the extent to which participants are empowered
to act on the results and subsequent understanding from a given study.
From the five authenticity criteria, the researcher considered fairness criteria to be
the most pertinent authenticity criteria for the study. According to Guba and Lincoln
(2005), fairness is achieved by representing the balance and “the extent to which different

91

constructions and their underlying value structures are solicited and honored within the
evaluation process” (Guba & Lincoln, 1989, pp. 246-247). Through careful
interpretation, the research identified, navigated, and presented any contradictions in a
fair and balanced manner.
Threats to Internal Validity in Qualitative Research. Six threats to internal
validity were exposed as possible limitations to this study; however, any external
credibility threat (i.e. generaiizability o f findings) was considered to a lesser extent
because as with most qualitative studies, generalization o f findings was not a focus o f the
study. Among the 14 internal threats to credibility o f qualitative findings identified by
Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2007b), the researcher identified the following as possible
threats during the data collection stage: (a) descriptive validity, (b) interpretive validity,
(c) investigative validity, (d) history, (e) observational bias, and (f) researcher bias.
Descriptive validity. The researcher utilized interviews as the primary method o f
data collection; therefore, a primary concern for the researcher was to capture the factual
accuracy o f each participant’s account, avoiding errors o f omission as well as
commission (Maxwell, 1992). Polkinghome (2005) proffered that languaged data are not
simply single words but the interrelated words and interrelated sentences that require an
extensive exploration for meaning.
Interpretive validity. Interpretive validity refers to the extent to which a
researcher’s interpretation o f the participants’ accounts is captured during the interviews.
The main focus o f the qualitative phenomenological study was to authentically record the
lived experiences o f the research participants as they are communicated through their
memories.

92

Investigation validity. Investigation validity refers to the quality and ethical care
in which the researcher conducts the study. The researcher avoided investigation validity
by conducting an ethical study and by obtaining rich data, maintaining an audit trail
(Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2007).
History. The history threat is generally ascribed as a threat in quantitative
research; however, the nature o f the study presents history as a major threat during the
data collection stage in the qualitative research phase. The threat was minimized through
the thorough development o f semi-structured interview questions that will stimulate
recall. The threat was minimized through the thorough development o f structured
interview questions that stimulated recall.
Observational bias. Observational bias can occur at the research design/data
collection stage when the researcher does not collect the sufficient sampling o f behaviors
or dialogue from the study participants (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2007). The researcher
will minimize the manifestation o f observational bias, particularly during the data
collection stage by utilizing sources beyond the interviews for data (i.e. observations).
Researcher bias. Researcher bias is a possible threat to internal credibility in the
qualitative component o f the study because the researcher is a member o f the
participants’ demographic group, and meets all selection-criteria set forth in the study
(Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2007). The researcher has worked as an academic librarian for
the majority o f the 30 years of her career in librarianship. Throughout the study, the
researcher will serve as the evaluator and interpreter o f the data, and will endeavor to
maintain rigorous professional standards throughout the study to eschew any perception
o f researcher bias or conflict o f interest (Denzin & Lincoln, 2000). As cautioned by

93

Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2007b), the researcher will remain cognizant o f the researcher
bias threat during the data analysis and data interpretation phases, as well.
Threats to External Validity in Qualitative Research. Onwuegbuzie and
Leech (2007b) identified 12 possible threats to external credibility in qualitative research,
o f which the researcher identified the following as possible threats to external credibility
for the study: (a) interpretive validity, (b) evaluative validity, (c) researcher bias, and (d)
investigation validity.
Interpretive validity. Interpretive validity refers to the extent to which a
researcher’s interpretation o f the participants’ accounts is captured during the interviews.
The main focus o f the phenomenological study is to record authentically the lived
experiences o f the research participants as they are communicated through their
memories.
Researcher bias. Researcher bias can be prevalent as a threat to external
credibility o f the findings in this study, just as it can pose an internal threat primarily
because the researcher has a professional insider perspective o f the subject under
investigation. According to Onwuegbuzie (2003a), researcher bias occurs when the
researcher has personal biases or a priori assumptions that he/she is unable to bracket.
This bias may be subconsciously transferred to the participants in such a way that their
behaviors, attitudes, or experiences are affected. In addition to influencing participants
unduly, the researcher could affect study procedures (e.g., ask leading questions in an
interview) or even contaminate data collection techniques.

94

Generalization. Generalization as a threat to external validity is less o f a concern
since the sample size o f the research study will be relatively small, thereby dismissing the
practicality o f generalizations.
Investigation validity. Lastly, investigation validity refers to the quality and
ethical care in which the researcher conducts the study. The researcher can avoid
investigation validity by conducting an ethical study and by obtaining rich data,
maintaining an audit trail (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2007b).
Trustworthiness and Credibility
The researcher is responsible for taking the necessary steps to substantiate the
information in the study for trustworthiness and credibility (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
According the Johnson and Christensen (2004), research validity should signify “research
that is plausible, credible, trustworthy, and therefore defensible” (p. 249). The researcher
should adhere to the research design which includes a detailed method for data collection
and a process for data analysis (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Miles & Huberman, 1994)
Summary
In Chapter III, I presented steps 6 through 8 o f Onwuegbuzie’s et al, (2012) 13step Qualitative Framework. The phenomenological study provided an opportunity for
veteran academic librarians to give voice to their experiences in the library organization
as it transitioned from the 20th-century to the 21st-century library service model. This
study informed the literature o f the underlying affective behaviors o f veteran academic
librarians during the transitory period o f the library organization as well as the perceived
threats to the organizational nature o f the academic library.

95

CHAPTER IV
Findings
The purpose o f my phenomenological study was to examine the perceptions and
lived experiences of selected veteran academic librarians who worked as librarians during
periods o f constant change, influenced by technology, in the academic library. In this
chapter, I provide the steps that were undertaken during the coding, analysis, and
description o f individual interviews conducted on five Texas veteran academic librarians,
as well as the results o f this analysis. In conducting this research, I used the qualitative
research method, phenomenology, which allowed me to apply a descriptive and reflective
approach to uncovering implicit meanings in the lived experiences expressed by the
veteran academic librarians in my study. By taking a phenomenological approach, I also
was able to explore interrelationships between emerging ideas in the form o f a meaning
structure (Langdridge, 2007; Zayed, 2008). For my study, a descriptive or eidetic
phenomenology design (Husserl, 1983) was used. The descriptive or eidetic
phenomenology design is distinguishable from an interpretive or hermeneutic
phenomenology (Heidegger, 1962), which focuses on the researcher’s subjectivity in
understanding phenomenon. Conversely, descriptive phenomenology emphasizes the
descriptions o f the lived experiences o f the research participants (Creswell, 2013;
Husserl, 1983), which, in this study, included descriptions o f the lived experiences o f five
academic librarians who had worked in the academic library organization for 30 or more
years.
The veteran academic librarians in my study were identified through the
professional library network that I had developed over the course o f my 3 5-year career as

96

a professional librarian. I contacted the librarians by phone or by email to request their
participation in the study and subsequently, to arrange for a mutually agreed upon
location to conduct the interview. Each librarian expressed sincere interest in
participating in the study so I was not challenged with finding willing participants.
Data collection was accomplished by conducting individual, semi-structured,
face-to-face interviews with each veteran academic librarian. An interview protocol was
developed based on the results o f my systematic literature review and was grounded in
the theoretical frameworks applied in this study. The interview questions were designed
to encourage the librarians to describe their experiences while working in an academic
library over the last 30 or more years. Denzin (1978), Spradley (1979), Patton (1980) and
Lincoln and Guba (1985) defined the interview as simply a conversation with a purpose.
I chose to frame the interviews interactionally to enhance meaning and understanding o f
the librarians’ lived career experiences in the academic library organization (Warren,
2002). Creswell (2009) and Johnson and Christensen (2012) defined a qualitative
research question as an interrogative sentence that seeks an answer about a process, issue,
or phenomenon that is to be explored. According to Creswell (2009), prompts aid the
researcher in narrowing the focus o f the topic investigated, while retaining the
opportunity for additional inquiry.
Each interview was audiotaped to ensure that no data were missed. I also logged
observational notes during each interview to capture the interviewee’s non-verbal
communications, such as facial expression and hand gestures, that an audio recording
device was incapable o f recording. On average, interview duration was 45 minutes to

97

one hour. Once the data were collected, each audio recording was transcribed in
preparation for data analysis.
The central research question for my study was: What were some o f the lived
experiences o f selected veteran academic librarians in adapting to technological change
in academic libraries in the state o f Texas? Three questions ancillary to the central
research question were: (1) To what extent do veteran academic librarians associate
emotions with their memories o f transformative changes that have occurred in the
academic library organization in the last three decades?; (2) How did the selected veteran
academic librarians describe their emotional memories specific to technological changes
in academic libraries?; and (3) To what extent did the veteran academic librarians
perceive that library administrators provided them with necessary resources to adapt to
these changes?
In the conducting the analysis, I used Moustakas’ (1994) phenomenological
reduction approach which includes the seven prescribed steps: (a) bracketing o f biases
(epoche), (b) identification o f significant statements, and horizontalization, (c) reduction
and elimination of non-pertinent data, (d) clustering and thematic labeling (e)
identification o f emergent themes, (f) construction o f individual textural descriptions, and
(g) development o f composite meanings for each participant. The first step in
Moustakas’ phenomenological reduction approach, epoche, which is the bracketing o f
biases, facilitated the suspension o f my own personal experiences as a veteran academic
librarian as much as possible, which allowed the manifestation o f a transcendental
perspective during data analysis. “In the epoche, the everyday understanding, judgments,
and knowings are set aside, and phenomena are revisited, freshly, naively, in a wide open

98

sense, from the vantage point of a pure or transcendental ego” (Moustakas, 1994, p. 38).
To assure the continuation o f epoche throughout the process, I also maintained a
reflexivity journal to record opinions and thoughts before and after each interview.
Data organization and analysis were conducted manually, without the integration
o f any qualitative data analysis software. 1 began the horizontalization step by
identifying and color-coding the significant statements in each transcript, transferring the
color-coded statements to a spreadsheet which was organized by themes and subthemes
and descriptive terms. The horizontalization step was approached iteratively, as I
discussed the thematic possibilities with a fellow researcher. The collaborative, iterative
process was utilized to facilitate the emergence o f themes and subthemes. As each
interview transcript was studied, I applied descriptive or in vivo codes (i.e., in their own
words) to those meaningful portions in the transcript.
Characteristics o f Selected Veteran Academic Librarians
As declared in the Informed Consent Statement, fictitious names were assigned to
each o f my research participants to protect their real identities. Throughout my study,
each academic librarian will be referenced using the following pseudonyms selected by
me: John, Marvin, Beatrice, Neva, and Alexandria. Table 6 presents pseudonyms and
descriptions o f the five veteran academic librarians, three female and two male
participants. For four o f the five veteran academic librarians, the highest degree held was
a m aster’s degree in library science or its equivalent. One academic librarian completed
his formal education at the doctoral level. It should also be noted that at the time o f the
interview, four o f the librarians were employed in an academic library at a 4-year higher
education institution. One librarian had retired from a 4-year higher education institution

99

three years prior to the interview. Additionally, the various universities mentioned in the
interviews were assigned fictitious names to further protect the identities o f the librarians
and the institutions. The collected data were safeguarded and handled with
confidentiality (Merriam, 2009).

Individual Librarian Interviews
The five research participants were given the option to select the locations and
times for the individual interviews that were most convenient for them. Due to my
affiliation and experience in the academic library profession, my proportional knowledge
assisted me with asking follow-up questions at the appropriate time, as well as being
cognizant o f noteworthy non-verbal language during the course o f the interviews. Each
interview was audiotaped to ensure that no spoken data were missed. Observational
notes were also logged during each interview to capture the interviewee’s non-verbal

100

communications, such as facial expression and hand gestures, that an audio recording
device was incapable o f recording. On average, interview duration was 45 minutes to
one hour. Once data were collected, each audio recording was transcribed in preparation
for data analysis.
According to Reisberg and Heuer (2004), emotional events are more likely to be
recalled than more neutral events. During the interviews with each participant, I
observed the vividness and ease with which each librarian recalled his or her personal
experiences from several decades ago and reactions to the changes that occurred in the
academic library as technology emerged. The librarians traveled back in time through
their memories, recalling events that also triggered my own memories as a member o f
this beloved profession. It was apparent to me that each participant enjoyed talking about
events from their careers and as the researcher; the interviews were very enjoyable for
me, as well.
John’s Interview. The setting for the interview with John was the 2015 Texas
Library Association (TLA) conference in Austin, Texas, which was very timely and
convenient for both o f us. However, one inconvenient aspect regarding the setting was
that the interview was conducted where hundreds o f librarians attending the conference
were milling about in the background. This was a bit of a distraction; however, John was
so excited to have been chosen for my study, that he did not allow the setting to thwart
his enthusiasm to talk about his career journey o f over 30 years. I used professional
grade audio recording equipment, so the sound quality on the playback was not
diminished by any background noise.

101

In 1981, John was working as a library assistant at the University o f Gold Library
as he worked toward completing his master’s in library science (MLS) degree in the
library science program at that university. When he completed his degree in 1981, he
was hired as the assistant social sciences librarian at the University o f Gold Library
where he remained until 1996. During his tenure at the University o f Gold Library, John
held a variety o f positions, including database coordinator where he coordinated online
mediated reference search services and conducted training in mediated searching
techniques for the reference librarians on the staff. In the early days o f online searching,
the librarian conducted the searches for library users to retrieve the requested
information, hence the term mediated. Mediated searching was the precursor to today’s
search engines such as Google and Yahoo, which require no mediation to retrieve results.
When John was hired in his first professional library position in 1981 at the
University o f Gold Library, none o f the library services were automated, which was not
unusual in this period in librarianship. Libraries still had card catalogs to organize their
collections o f print materials. His first experience with library automation occurred when
he was introduced to cataloging library books an OCLC computer terminal. He also
learned how to fill out an IBM 80 slot key punch card. Around 1983, the University o f
Gold Library acquired its first IBM and Hewlett Packard desktop computers. He learned
to use Word Star application on an IBM desktop computer. As more and more
technology was integrated into the university library, John took the initiative to teach
him self how to use the technology. John’s initiative and affinity to technology did not go
unnoticed by university administration, so shortly thereafter; he was chosen to participate
in a productivity experiment on campus and was issued an IBM laptop that weighed 15

102

pounds! John and I laughed about the weight of that laptop compared to the substantially
reduced weight and size o f computers today.
In 1996, John accepted a position as library director at the Green State University
Library where he remains today. Soon after completing his master’s degree, John had
considered pursuing a doctorate in history; however, he chose academic librarianship as a
career once he observed how difficult it was for a friend and colleague to get a teaching
position, even though his friend had a PhD in history. John stated, “I wanted to get a
doctorate in history, but if he couldn’t get a job teaching, what were my odds [laughing]
o f getting a job teaching history? So, that’s when I decided to become an academic
librarian. I’ve never regretted that decision.” John told me that he had later completed his
doctorate in history before he turned 50 years o f age.
As the researcher, I was amazed at the accuracy and the level o f detail in which
John shared decade old memories o f his earlier years as a novice academic librarian. As
John recounted different events that occurred in the library organization, many o f which
involved technology, I realized that he had a propensity for challenges and risks. John
estimated that he had spent only one year as a librarian where technology was not a part
o f his duties and responsibilities. In fact, John admitted that he enjoyed the newness and
the adventurous aspects that technology generated in the academic library. Although, he
did not study computer science, he did not shy away from the technology as it was
introduced into the library.
John was one o f the first librarians at the University o f Gold Library who was
trained in the use o f the Dialog mediated search service. He attended the Dialog
Conference in California and the American Library Association Conference which was

103

held in either 1983 or 1984. As result o f this opportunity for extending technology
learning, he became the chief database searcher for the library and later trained other
librarians in the use o f this mediated online search skill. He offered that currently, the
Green State University library is often the test bed for new technologies, which is a
complimentary recognition of the skills and expertise o f the academic librarians.
John frequently had the opportunity to work collaboratively on research projects
with faculty members and graduate students. One rather comical incident occurred in the
early years o f technology when there was no such thing as automatic data backup. He
was working with two business faculty members who had asked him to create an
appendix for their new business textbook. John spent four hours entering the data and he
intermittently pressed save; however, his foot kicked the power cord and knocked it out
and lost everything!
John spoke about the new generation o f students and how with each incoming
freshman class comes even more changes in their information seeking behaviors.
Students are not readers. They are scanners. Spaces in the library that once held printed
materials were renovated to create a collaborative learning environment that blends
technology, information, and expertise whether it is to support students working with
other students or students who are working with faculty or staff. The technology and
information comes together in the library. The library has become a destination point on
campus for students to gather to use the resources and to socialize. John was not
resentful o f this change because it refocused the library as the heart o f learning, rather
than a place to warehouse books that will gather dust. John believed that librarians must
be out there on a daily basis advocating for the value o f the library and demonstrating

104

how the library contributes to student learning outcomes. “We are all in the recruiting and
retention business; we are part o f the university’s recruiting and retention efforts. The
more we do to assist in the recruitment and retention efforts, our primary constituents will
see the library as a vital part o f the campus.”
Marvin’s Interview. The interview with Marvin was also held at the 2015 Texas
Library Association (TLA) conference. Similar to the setting for John’s interview, TLA
conference attendees were milling about in the background, which was not a distraction
for either o f us. Texas is such a large state, that the distance between where Marvin and I
lived and worked was over seven hours by car. Marvin was very agreeable to the
location o f the interview.
Marvin was enrolled in a doctoral program in history at a Texas university when
he was offered a position as the regional archivist for the state o f Texas. It occurred to
Marvin to accept a paid position as an archivist rather than remain unemployed because
he was recently married with a child on the way. Marvin was hired as the first regional
archivist in the state. It was during this time that Marvin decided to obtain a master’s
degree in library science from the University o f Bluebird and he never looked back
Marvin began his professional career as an academic librarian in 1980 as an
assistant cataloger and assistant archivist at the University o f Blue Library. He remained
in that position for three years before accepting a position in a neighboring state as the
acquisitions and serials librarian at the University o f Red River Library. In subsequent
years, Marvin worked at three different university libraries in Texas and Arkansas in
positions o f leadership. Marvin is currently the library director at the University o f
Orange Library in south Texas.

105

Regarding technology in the academic library, Marvin stated, ‘i ’ve seen the
integration o f technology into the library organization as a significant challenge, but I
also see it as one o f the biggest assets for my career advancement.” He shared a
memorable saying o f his father’s from his childhood: “It is a poor carpenter who curses
his own tools.” He shared that saying with library personnel who failed to recognize
technology as a tool o f the profession. However, Marvin admitted that he was sensitive
to the varying paces in which librarians and other staff progressed in adapting to change.
There was no one size fits all philosophy. He believed it was important for the sake o f
organizational morale, to try and keep librarians and other staff members as content as
possible in their jobs. Marvin acknowledged that sometimes an employee’s job
performance was below what he wished it to be, but this approach led to greater job
satisfaction and ultimately greater productivity.
There was a significant advantage o f technology particularly for students and
faculty at small to medium-size institutions. Heretofore, the advantages o f having access
to a larger quantity and quality o f library resources were available primarily to students at
larger research institutions. To illustrate his point, Marvin explained that the student
enrollment at University o f Orange numbered about 7,000 students; yet these students
and faculty have access to over 60,000 full-text periodicals as well as about 300
databases. He characterized technology as “a great equalizer.”
However, things did not always turn out right with technology. Marvin shared
with me the time during a conversion from one library system to another when the data
on three o f the tapes were bad, so that data were lost, some o f which were irretrievable
due to the lack o f adequate back up. So while not perfect, technology has its downsides,

106

too. He stated that “things fail, but you don’t get upset about it. You just try to figure out
a way to work around it.” From M arvin's perspective, the extensive integration o f
technology into the academic library environment has been overwhelmingly positive for
the library organization and the library profession. He stated, “Looking back, I didn’t
realize the disadvantages o f not having computers because there was nothing to compare
it to. We quickly realized that there are better ways to do most o f these things and
they’re constantly improving them.” Marvin acknowledged that technology supported
the librarian’s ability to access and deliver information to users. As new technologies
emerged, users were empowered to access information directly without the mediation o f
a librarian.
Beatrice’s Interview. When the interview was conducted, Beatrice had been
retired for about three years after working 39.5 years as an academic librarian at the Blue
State University Library. The setting for the interview was in an office space, which
offered us comfort and privacy. Beatrice shared a series o f serendipitous events that led
to her becoming a librarian. While in high school, Beatrice worked in the school library.
She did not know if she could afford to go to college and therefore had not given any
serious thought to a career choice. The counselor told her that she could go to library
school since she had worked in the library as an honor student. The counselor asked her
if she had like library work to which Beatrice responded, yes. And then Beatrice added,
“But I like animals, you know, and I also thought about being a vet.” But at the urging o f
her high school counselor, Beatrice decided to get a bachelor’s degree in library science.
The high school counselor advised her that a career in librarianship would offer her many

107

opportunities for employment due to the impending retirements o f the traditionalistsgeneration librarians, who were bom between 1900 and 1945 (Harter & Agrawal, 2014).
Beatrice began her professional career in librarianship in 1970 at the Blue State
University Library when the bachelor’s degree in library science was recognized by the
university as the terminal degree for librarians. However, about a year and half into her
career, a university audit o f librarians and teaching faculty members’ education
credentials was conducted. As a result o f the findings o f the audit, the library director
was charged with aligning the credentials o f the professional librarians with the
recommendation o f the American Library Association (ALA) that academic librarians
have a master’s degree in library science (MLS) from an institution accredited by ALA.
Consequently, Beatrice was moved from a professional librarian position to a
paraprofessional library assistant position. Beatrice reported that Blue State University
grandfathered librarians who had worked in the library for over 10 years and possessed a
master’s degree in another discipline. Several librarians were allowed to retain their
professional librarian status even though they did not possess an ALA-accredited MLS.
After working for several years as a library assistant, Beatrice wanted to advance
through the ranks at the library; therefore, she decided to obtain an MLS, which she
completed in 1980. She commuted over a hundred miles one-way, for almost two years
to a Texas university that had an ALA accredited library science program. This was at
least two decades before the Internet and online library science programs.
Once Beatrice received her MLS, she was given many opportunities to move
around in Blue State University where she continued to work. The library director
recognized that Beatrice enjoyed diversity and opportunities to learn new skills. She had

108

the aptitude to learn by trial and error to implement a new technology. Beatrice was
working in the acquisitions department at a time when they were trying to electronically
integrate the acquisitions and cataloging systems. During that time, they were working
with punch cards. Beatrice recalled the tedious task o f looking through stacks o f punch
cards, one at a time, to verify that the correct book title was being ordered. Beatrice
proclaimed, “ Oh my gosh, and then we sent the punch cards over to the campus
computing department where they used a huge mainframe computer to read the punch
cards and to generate a printed list o f new book orders.” Beatrice recalled this being one
o f the first opportunities for the library to work collaboratively with the university
computer science department. At the time, there was a big discussion about how a
librarian should communicate with personnel in the computing services to convey what
was needed to create a database o f resources that could then be printed. Beatrice also
recalled this was a hot topic in the professional journals about computer techie types not
understanding the way libraries worked.
Around 1980 or 1981, Beatrice was writing an article to submit for publication in
the Texas Library Journal. She was composing the article on the typewriter with
memory capabilities, which was cutting edge technology at the time. The typewriter was
located in the acquisitions area, yet the power was controlled from the library director’s
office. Beatrice supposed it was set up this way because the typewriter was quite
expensive and for security reasons; the power was controlled from the director’s office.
Each workday, the secretary would turn the power on to the typewriter at 8 a.m. and turn
it off before leaving at 4:30 p.m. One day Beatrice was working on the article, oblivious
to the time, when the power to the typewriter was suddenly disconnected. The secretary

109

had planned to leave before 4:30 p.m. on that day, and she followed her normal routine
and turned off the power to the typewriter located in the acquisitions department.
Beatrice was so upset because she lost everything that she had written that day. But the
only thing she could do was to try and recreate what she had previously written.
Beatrice was accepting o f change as it occurred in the academic library. She said,
“I think reference librarians adapt to anything, and we were always used to change, but,
you know, certain individuals may not be, but I think as a whole, the reference librarians
were always ready for change. They know it’s going happen so, they are always out there
trying to figure it out before somebody comes and asks me about it.” Beatrice told me
that early in her career, she worked with several librarians who were much older. These
older librarians were hesitant o f the new technologies and felt as if they could not master
the electronic devices as easily as they had traditional resources. They would try, but
were not as flexible or willing to adapt as Beatrice was to new technologies. Beatrice
was responsible for training the librarians as computers became more prevalent in the
libraries. She was very patient with librarians and other staff members who were reticent
about using computers. She would tell them to just take it one step at a time. It is just
like a typewriter; just a little fancier.
In 1991, Beatrice was working in the web development office, which was a
recently created department in the library. The library was responsible for developing
and maintaining the university’s web presence. Beatrice’s primary responsibility was to
upload and update content to the website. One day in particular when her web colleagues
were away at a conference, she recalled, “I’ll never forget I lost the university’s website.”
[Laughter] She said, “It was gone for a little while. Oh my, gosh, talk about sweating.

110

And I don’t remember if the library director ever knew. I didn’t tell a soul and nobody
complained! [Laughter] But it came back, I found it. It was a lost file, and so I found it
and put it back up. Yes, I did that. That was just one o f the many crazy things that
happened way back then.
When 1 asked Beatrice about the character traits that would benefit an academic
librarian in the 21st century library, she said the following: “Don’t panic! Try to stay
calm and, you know, just keep on trucking, and embrace the change. It’s going to happen
whether you’re ready or not. So try to be flexible and try to be ready.” After Beatrice
retired, she was honored for her career contributions to the university and to the library
profession by becoming the first librarian to be awarded emeritus librarian status at the
university.
Neva’s Interview. The interview with Neva took place in an office at the library
where she was employed. The interview began comfortably, with a bit o f banter as we
eased into the interview. Neva was very agreeable to participate in my study. Neva
made the decision to become a reference librarian while in high school. She began her
career in 1977 in a library at a small institution in Louisiana. The staff consisted o f only
four librarians and she was the government documents and media librarian. After five
years at the library in Louisiana, in 1982, Neva moved to Texas to accept a positon as a
humanities reference librarian at the Blue State University Library. Neva told me in a
quiet but animated manner, “You know, o f course, that I love books and reading and so,
you know, I wanted to help people make the connections with the books. Now I would
say make a connection with information that they need. I collected everything under the
sun as a kid. Now I’m getting paid to collect [laughter] books!”

Ill

In 1982, when she arrived at the Blue State University Library, she encountered
her first online catalog. She had come from an institution that had refused to use OCLC
services to automate its cataloging and acquisitions functions. She found herself
immediately thrust into a situation where there was a lot o f technology. For a long time,
the Blue State University Library developed a reputation for implementing new, cutting
edge technology. Library staff from other libraries would visit the Blue State University
Library to see first-hand some o f the technologies that were part o f many o f the library’s
operations. The library was among one o f the first in the area to build large computer
labs in the library, which were largely funded through the state granting agency.
Neva shared with me an isolated incident that she described as perplexing at that
time. The library director observed Neva working on a Mac computer one day in the
computer lab designated for Mac technology. Neva was preparing for a class with a class
that used Mac technology. Since her familiarity with Mac devices was limited, she
thought it practical and responsible to practice on the device as part o f her preparation.
Rather than asking Neva directly, she learned later that the library director had demanded
o f her supervisor to know why she had a librarian on her staff who was “basically so bad
at computer technology that she had to use a Mac.” This was Neva’s first encounter with
the Mac vs PC debate. Years later, she found the incident to be humorous, but at the time
she found his stance to be rather puzzling since she needed to understand different
technologies in order to effectively work with faculty and students. In fact, she stated
that she had used her lunch break to teach herself to use the Mac computer.
Regarding the issue o f job satisfaction, Neva stated the following, “I started to
have some problems with my hands due to repetitive motions on computers. Symptoms

112

of carpel tunnel were aggravating and painful, so there was a time so I thought about
another kind o f career where I would not be using computers as heavily” . She admittedly
laughingly that she had a "love-hate relationship with computers.” Neva expressed some
timidity toward new technology; but, she recognized that a librarian needed the
qualifications o f flexibility, curiosity, and also to be a bit o f a risk-taking in order to be
successful.
Neva will retire in a few months from the time o f the interview, after attaining 38
years as an academic librarian. Throughout the interview, I realized that Neva was
satisfied that she had accomplished what she had initially set out to do as a reference
librarian: to positively impact students and faculty by connecting them with the
information that they needed. She said that her career was very satisfying.
Alexandria’s Interview. Alexandria’s decision to become a librarian was
influenced by her first job upon graduating from high school. As a high school graduate,
she worked for the Department o f Commerce in a middle Atlantic state in the department
with information specialists, not librarians. The information specialists compiled and
disseminated information about the state. She thought, “Oh gosh, I’d like to have a job
doing that kind o f work.” So upon completing her master’s degree in library science,
Alexandria began her career as a serials librarian in 1981, at a time when serials
(journals, magazines, newspapers) were available only in the print format or microform.
Her responsibilities in that position included checking in serials and a bit o f collection
development to find and replace missing print issues o f serials runs. For a short time, she
worked as a cataloger for a state library consortium that comprised academic, public, and
school libraries located in the northeastern part o f the United States. It was in her work

113

as a cataloger that she became aware o f the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC).
She was introduced to new technology that automated a part o f her cataloging
responsibilities. During that time, OCLC had positioned as a cooperative body with the
mission to further access to the w orld's information and reduce the rate o f rise o f library
costs. OCLC brought thousands o f libraries from around the world together to
cooperatively keep track o f the world's information (Elkington, 2009). Alexandria
recalled that the Ohio libraries contributed their MARC records to OCLC. “And I mean,
they had a lot o f records, but they were very basic records in the database, and I guess
libraries spent years and years adding to those records and cleaning up those records.”
One o f Alexandria’s earliest memories o f communication technology was a fax
machine that was located in the serials and interlibrary loan department. She described it
as
“a little primitive. It kind o f made funny noises, you know, when you made the
call. I think the paper printed out and it was that thick, but I don’t know if it was
coded paper. I guess it was and whatever it ran through would scratch the surface
o f the paper, then you would have your image. I think I’m describing it
accurately. This was in the 1980s. I think that was the first gismo that you
know, connected you with someone else other than the telephone.”
Alexandria admitted that after computers were integrated in many job functions in the
library, “you could see the big picture better than before. We conducted bibliographic
searches which required you to look for a record in a big, heavy book. And I mean it was
really time consuming to do that.” Alexandria moved to Texas in the early 1990s to
accept a position at Green State University Library in the cataloging department. She

114

continues to work there today, but her current position is a metadata librarian. As
metadata librarian, she is responsible for providing rich descriptions o f digital content to
facilitate its discoverability and accessibility. When asked if she had ever considered a
career change due to the technological changes in the library, Alexandria responded,
“I don’t really think so. I mean I think maybe if there hadn’t been the change to
the new technologies, I think I might have. I w on’t say that my job has become
easier. In some ways, it has become more complicated. But no, I don’t really
think so.”
The Central Research Question
In keeping with the purpose o f this study, here I address the central research
question: What were some o f the lived experiences o f selected veteran academic
librarians in adapting to technological change in academic libraries in the state o f Texas?
The central research question o f my study was to determine the emotions that veteran
academic librarians associated with their memories o f the transformative changes that
occurred in the latter decades in the 20th -century academic library organization and the
dawning o f the 21st-century academic library. According to Ashkanasy, Hartel, and
Zerbe (2000), settling upon a definition o f what emotions are has been an illusionary goal
among researchers for many years. Frijda (1988) and Isen and Baron (1991) used the
term affect to describe a range o f emotion-related constructs and the term is often used to
comprise both moods and discrete emotions. However, for the purpose o f this study; I
adopted Frijda’s (1988) empirically positioned definition o f emotions defined as
“responses to events that are important to the individual” (p. 351). The subjective or
experiential aspects o f emotions, as they relate to feelings o f excitement or

115

disconcertment or o f pleasure or displeasure, among other emotional charged memories.
Furthermore, the functional consequences o f emotions (Kleinginna & Kleinginna, 1981),
adaptive (i.e., the likelihood o f satisfaction) and maladaptive (i.e., the likelihood o f being
disruptive) will further illuminate the emotions assigned to a particular event or memory
o f the research participants.
In applying Moustakas’ (1994) phenomenological reduction process, three major
themes emerged from the first-hand accounts o f the five veteran academic librarians as
they addressed the central research question regarding their lived experiences in
academic libraries, particularly as it relates to technologically induced change. The three
major themes consisted o f (a) shifts in the role o f the academic library organization; (b)
shifts in the role o f the academic librarian; and (c) emotional memories o f the veteran
academic librarian. Descriptive results for the three emergent themes appear in Table 7.

Emotional
memories o f the
veteran academic
librarian

What do the veteran
academic librarians recall
from their 30 plus years
career as an academic
librarian?

The first spreadsheet I ever did
was on a TI computer that had
600K (Kilobits) o f ram. And we
had never seen a computer that
was that powerful that had 600K o f
ram. I can still remember we got
the first 8K processor. It was just,
or 8MB processor. Oh well boy we
couldn’t believe how fast it was.

Technology was central to every aspect o f the librarian’s roles and responsibilities
in the academic library, so I proposed it as an anchoring presence in relation to the three
emergent themes, as illustrated in Figure 8. In the mid-1960s, Licklider (1965) forecast a
mystical symbiotic relationship between librarians and technology. He believed that
computers would “rescue the human minds from its enslavement by mundane detail” (p.
68). Rice-Lively and Racine (1997) posited that the emergence o f technology during the
1960s signaled an irreversible convergence o f the librarianship and technology.

117

Technology facilitated the ushering in o f Lancaster’s (1978) prediction o f the withering
o f libraries, which in essence resulted in librarians redefining their roles in “libraries
without walls” (Young, 2008, p. 844). Martin (2001) acknowledged that the impact o f
information technologies on libraries has been obvious, but the agglomeration o f this
impact over the decades and the resulting alteration in the relationship between libraries
and their environments has been far from predictable, either in substance or in sequence.
After 40 years in the library profession, Martin (2001) reminisced about how
librarians in those early days had the forethought to look at the technology then in its
infancy, and discern a future made better, streamlined by the use o f these formidable
inventions. Librarians were relieved o f the mundane, manually repetitive processes,
which were streamlined with technology. During his interview, John talked about
learning to catalog on an OCLC computer terminal, which was a huge advancement in
cataloging library materials. The MARC format was developed in the late 1960s under
the guidance o f Henriette Avram when she worked at the Library o f Congress. Fred
Kilgour, the founder o f the OCLC consortium, envisioned reducing the rate o f rise o f
costs o f cataloging”— and then interlibrary loan, and reference, and acquisitions”
(Schudel, 2006).

Without question, the longevity o f the five veteran academic librarians is evidence
o f their ability to successfully adapt to decades o f changes that have occurred in the
academic libraries. Based on their accounts, they confronted complex challenges in
integrating technology, yet they embraced them as opportunities for the social good o f the
academic missions o f their respective institutions and for the library profession. Within
each o f the major themes, subthemes emerged which provided greater context to the
experiences o f the veteran academic librarians.

119

Theme 1: Shifts in the Role o f the Academic Library Organization. The
constructed meaning o f the first theme is that academic libraries reconceive and
reconstruct the ways in which they support faculty and students in research and
education. Contained within the first theme, shifts in the roles in the academic library
organization, were five identified subthemes: (a) heart o f learning; (b) university
administration support; (c) technology center; (d) repurposed spaces; and (e) discovery
and access tools. Figure 9 illustrates the relationship o f the first major theme and the five
subthemes.

Figure 9. Theme 1 and the five subthemes.

Without exception, the five veteran academic librarians acknowledged that a shift
in the academic library organization had occurred, but the shift was less about changing

120

the core mission o f the academic library than about the way in which services were
delivered and the use o f library spaces. Table 8 displays the five subthemes, their
constructed meanings, and significant statements that support the subtheme. The
academic library's mission remained staunchly unchanged in its role to support the
academic mission o f the university. In recent decades, librarians in the library
organizations were the early adopters o f technologies and were leaders in this regard,
often becoming the test bed at their university as new technologies emerged. Technology
was not an abstract concept, but was concretely embraced as the tool required o f the
librarian to do provide the academic support for faculty and students. The shift was
toward an integration o f technology that changed the way in which the user discovered
and accessed library resources. Increasingly, the digital format became the preferred
format for resources. Library spaces that were previously occupied by print books and
journals were repurposed for collaborative learning and social engagement. Computer
labs became standard in academic libraries and wired and wireless moved from the
unique into the mainstream o f the academic library with the proliferation o f mobile
technologies. John shared:
It refocuses the library as the heart o f learning, rather than it being a warehouse
for books that’11 gather dust. I’m sad about that because I love books but I also
have to be a realist, but that’s not what our users are looking for. They recreated
the first floor o f the library. They had moved a bunch o f stuff off and cleared out
for the computer lab and collaborative learning spaces, a cafe in the big atrium.
Alexandria expressed astonishment at the way in which students now use the library:

121

It’s kind o f jarring I think. I mean you look at a group o f kids and you think what
in the world. You know, are they studying or not? I mean it’s really hard to tell.
I mean everybody’s got their laptop, their IPhone, their earbuds and they're
talking to each other.
The advent o f the Internet and search engines such as Google and Yahoo! facilitated
instantaneous access to information; therefore, the perception among many, including
university administrators, was that the information was free. As a result o f the series o f
these events that occurred in the academic library, primarily ignited by technology, the
value o f the academic library was questioned.

[laughs].

Theme 2: Shifts in the Role o f the Academic Librarian. The second major
theme to emerge was the shifts in the role o f the academic librarian to which I assigned
the constructed meaning; the 21st century academic librarian must possess combined
research and technology skills. In their interviews, several librarians voiced their
commitment to adapt and to learn the technologies so that they could be prepared to help
students and faculty. Beatrice shared her commitment to helping students in the
following statement:
You know, it’s always been, for me it’s always been about the students. And I
love working with college students and, you know, that really makes my day. I
love helping people.
One o f my favorite statements during the interviews was the way John described how
library users viewed his ability to help them find information.

123

My nickname around campus is Paul Drake. So it’s like, you know, from the
Perry Mason television series. Yeah, anytime you needed information, you’d call
Paul Drake and he’d get it for you.
Extracted from the shifts in the role o f the academic librarian theme were the
following three subthemes: (a) librarian as a leader in early technology; (b) faculty
perceptions; and (c) student perceptions. The second emergent theme, shifts in the role of
the academic librarian, and the related subthemes are displayed in Figure 10.

Figure 10. The second emergent theme and three related subthemes.

The role o f the academic librarian changed as technology changed in the manner
in which resources and services were delivered and accessed. Academic librarians were
early adopters o f technology and remained at the center o f changes to accommodate the
changes in users’ information seeking behaviors as well as their expectations. Early in

124

his career, John expressed an eagerness to learn the new technology. He shared the
following during the interview:
I was one o f the first librarians at University o f Blue that was trained on the
Dialog system and went to the Dialog Conference in California as well as ALA in
either ’83 or ’84 whenever that was and then, like I said, I became the chief
database searcher and then trainer o f other librarians. In fact, I actually did in
house workshops.
Service desks that once insured the visibility and the accessibility to the librarian
disappeared as users began to access library resources remotely. When the library
catalog came online and as electronic resources increased, library users had access to
materials without going into the library building. Librarians created websites that could
be searched intuitively, so the need for assistance diminished. Libraries incorporated
technology to improve the users’ library experience, but with the loss o f visibility came
the decreased recognition o f the library’s value and contribution to the university.
Neva talked about the new roles that have emerged in academic libraries in the several
decades. “You hear about positions describing someone who works with digital archives
and things like that didn’t even exist when you and I first became librarians.”
Faculty and students’ perceptions o f the value o f the academic library have become
skewed due to the ease o f access to information. Oftentimes, users do not realize that the
library has subscribed to resources that they are using. Users are not cognizant o f the
barriers to access because they are not visible due to authentication by IP range or Proxy
access. Table 9 displays the subthemes o f Theme 2 and their constructed meanings and
examples o f significant statements.

come to the library because so
much can be done from a distance.

Student perceptions

Student's perceived value

I’m not sure it’s positive or
negative, but I think that they are
confused because no matter how
we advance in society, today
people, even young people will
have this stereotypical image o f the
librarian with a bun hairstyle,
sitting behind a desk and that
image has never changed. That is
so funny to me and even though we
have young librarians that are so
techno savvy.

Theme 3: Emotional Memories o f the Veteran Academic Librarian. The
third major theme to emerge in the analysis was the emotional memories o f the veteran
academic librarian for which the constructed meaning is what the veteran academic

126

librarians recalled from their 30 plus years career as an academic librarian. In the
analysis, the following three subthemes emerged: (a) career journey; (b) innovative tools
to conduct research; and (c) technostress. The third emergent theme and the related
subthemes are displayed in Figure 11.

The third theme, emotional memories o f the veteran academic librarians, was
principal to the study because it focused on what the veteran academic librarians recalled
from their 30 plus years career journey. It was with excitement and pride for their
accomplishments that the librarians recounted their initial encounter with technology.
Each interview was akin to a ‘walk down memory lane’. The third emergent theme and
the related subthemes are displayed in Table 10.

What are some
memorable events from
the academic librarian's
career?

The first spreadsheet I ever did
was on a TI computer that had
600K (Kilobits) o f RAM. And we
had never seen a computer that
was that powerful that had 600K
o f ram. I can still remember we
got the first 8K processor. It was
just, or 8MB processor. Oh, well.
Boy, we couldn’t believe how fast
it was.

Innovative tools to
conduct research

The employment o f
future focused
technology and expertise
to facilitate the delivery
o f innovative and
relevant services.

I believe passionately that
technology is another tool to
receive information, it is a
superior tool.

Technostress

An inability to cope with
the new computer
technologies in a healthy
manner

I guess it was a bit intimating for
me because I’m not one o f the
ones who took to it like a duck to
water. I had to do things, over,
and over, and over until I caught
on.

The librarians talked about the challenging aspects o f learning curve o f the new
technology; however, they readily acknowledged that technology was a significant
facilitator to the services and processes. John stated, “I believe passionately that
technology is another tool to receive information, it is a superior tool.” At John’s present
institution. Green State University, he stated that the library is oftentimes the test bed for

128

new technologies, “which is a complimentary recognition o f the skills and expertise o f
our academic librarians.” He enjoyed the newness and the adventurous aspects that
technology generated in the academic library. Without the benefit o f formal education or
training in computer science, John was not reluctant to investigate the promising
possibilities of technology to enhance traditional library services, particularly services
and processes relative to access and cataloging.
Marvin viewed the influence o f technology on his career, “as one o f the biggest
assets for my career advancement.” The introduction o f technology in the academic
library early in John’s career offered him opportunities to learn new skills and to assume
leadership roles in the library as well as working collaboratively with faculty outside o f
the library. However, Neva described her initial experience with technology in the
following manner:
It was a bit intimating for me because I’m not one o f the ones who took to it
[technology] like a duck to water. I had to do things, over, and over, and over
until I caught on.
Neva appeared to experience a condition that Brod (1984) described as technostress,
which was caused by the inability to cope with the new technology or the struggle to
accept computer technology.
Beatrice spoke about feelings o f vulnerability in needing to stay current in the profession:
You want to be prepared. Now if anything that’s what a reference librarian may
feel like that’s their vulnerability. They have to know, they need to know what it
is, and where it is, and what’s going on. Because people are going to ask them,

129

and they don’t want to feel like they don’t know. That person may look at the
librarian and say, well, you work here, so why don’t you know?
John shared a memory o f witnessing first-hand the acceleration in the development o f
computers.
The first spreadsheet I ever did was on a TI computer that had 600K (Kilobits) o f
RAM. And we had never seen a computer that was that powerful that had 600K o f
ram. I can still remember we got the first 8K processor. It was just, or 8MB
processor. Oh, well. Boy, we couldn’t believe how fast it was.
Subquestion 1: To what extent did veteran academic librarians associate
emotions with their memories of transformative changes that have occurred in the
academic library organization in the last three decades? Without question, each o f the
veteran academic librarians in my study understood that it was imperative for
transformative changes, precipitated by technology, to be embraced in the academic
library profession. During the last half o f the 20th century, many researchers and
practitioners (Bass, 1985; Budd, 1998; Stoffle, Renaud, & Veldof; 1996; Taylor, 1973;
Thompson, 1982) cautioned academic libraries to make dramatic changes or face the
possibility o f being marginalized. Atkinson (2001) believed that the 21st century
academic library need to shift from the traditional 20th century protocol o f quietness and
become the noisy, social gathering place on university campuses, with the added amenity
o f plenty o f coffee.
In John’s interview, he acknowledged, without indicating any begrudging attitude,
that the library where he was employed had created a collaborative learning environment
that blended technology, information, and expertise. Library users had the expectation

130

for technology and information to reside together in the library building. Students
gathered to work with students or students work with faculty or staff. Subsequently, the
library became the destination spot for students at John’s university.
However, there was not always agreement among the library staff about the best
direction for the library organization. Jantz (2012) stated that stress and conflict is
typical in a changing organization and can be used as an advantage by a transformative
leader. During a discussion at his university on the subject, John shared that a third o f the
campus and a third o f the library staff wanted what he was advocating, which was more
technology. This third advocated for greater collaboration among various campus
departments and shifting attention to adapting to what the new users wanted in the
academic library. Incredulously, John added, “That in 2005 another third o f the library
staff wanted to maintain the traditional library. And in fact one o f the librarians said “ah
yes, I still teach Readers Guide.”
Subquestion 2: How did veteran academic librarians describe their
emotional memories specific to technological changes in academic libraries? None o f
the veteran librarians in my study were critical o f the integration o f technology in the
academic library and were accepting o f the changes that were instituted as a result. Two
o f the participants spoke less passionately and were more careful in their recollection o f
their approach to technology. Neva said that she became a librarian because she wanted
to help people make the connections with the books. Neva retains that same desire to help
students and faculty, but she “now has to make a connection with the information they
need.” However, Beatrice, John and Marvin talked far more eagerly and adventurous in
their approach to new technology. Marvin quoted an appropriate saying o f his father’s

131

from his childhood: “It is a poor carpenter that curses his own tools.” From M arvin's
perspective, the wholesale integration o f technology into the academic library
environment certainly was a positive move. He stated that “looking back I didn't realize
the disadvantages o f not having computers because there was nothing to compare it to.
We quickly realized that there are better ways to do most o f these things that we do in
libraries and they are constantly improving them.”
Subquestion 3: To what extent did the veteran academic librarians perceive
that library administrators provided them with necessary resources to adapt to
changes? When talking about the early part o f their career when technology held a
mystery to libraries and other department on campus, communication and collaboration
emerged in several o f the interviews as the most critical in facilitating change. However,
once technology was mainstreamed with online catalogs and increasing online resources,
Neva expressed concern that university administrators, not library administrators,
believed that it’s all free and out there on Google and that, you know, maybe the library
shouldn’t be costing them as much. Avram (1980) in her speech at the IFLA conference,
expressed concern that technology which may result in legislation which in turn may
affect the operations and services o f libraries.
The participants in my study agreed that the core role o f the academic library
remained unchanged, to support the academic mission o f the university. Neva said, “And
for a while, the librarians were the information gods because we were some o f the first to
catch on how to use the Internet”. The library as an organization was engrafted into
participating in other aspects o f university initiatives such as the recruiting and retention.

132

The Essence o f the Research Study
The essence o f the lived experiences o f the five veteran academic librarians in my
study as it relates to my central research question was: What were some o f the lived
experiences o f selected veteran academic librarians in adapting to technological change
in academic libraries in the state o f Texas?” The interview questions in a
phenomenology study were open-ended in nature, in keeping with the tenets o f
phenomenological research (Moustakas, 1994) and framed to help the research
participants report their experiences, as recalled, rather than to give complex descriptions.
The phenomenological methodology allowed me to reveal the essence o f the lived
experiences o f five veteran academic librarians in the academic library organization in
the wake o f technological change.
Through the lens o f the affective events theory and the organizational identity, I
listened to and observed the participants’ affective behaviors such as angry, frustration,
joy and other varying behaviors as they shared their experiences in the library
organization in the wake o f constant change which was determined primarily by
technology. As a member o f the demographic group in my study, I will admit that it was
difficult at times to hold on to my objectivity. Proof o f that resides in my level o f
surprise at the commonality in the themes and subthemes that emerged in my analysis.
The three major themes consisted o f (a) shifts in the role o f the academic library
organization; (b) shifts in the role o f the academic librarian; and (c) emotional memories
o f the veteran academic librarian.
My wonderment was that none o f the themes were overshadowed with negativity
or complaints about the organizational or changes in their roles. The emotions that were

133

displayed upon being asked to participate in the study were eagerness, anticipation and
appreciation. No one cancelled, no one had to reschedule the interview time. Therefore,
the essence o f my study is that the five veteran academic librarians can be characterized
as (a) servant-leaders in the library profession; (b) risk takers in the profession; (c)
exhibitors o f intellectual curiosity and commitment; (d) early adopters o f new
technology; and (e) continued to embrace new ideas as they approached retirement.
Unlike the pessimistic attitudes o f the librarians in Musman’s (1993) study that covered
100 years o f innovation in libraries, the five veteran academic librarians in my study were
largely optimistic about the integration o f technology in the academic library. They
recognized technology as a tool o f the profession. Marvin said, “It is a poor carpenter
that curses his own tools”. He also characterized technology as “the great equalizer” in
terms o f it facilitating access for students and faculty at the smaller institutions.
Technology released librarians from the weight o f mundane repetitive processes that
were typical in the 20th century library. Alexandria implied that she might have
considered a change in careers if there had not been the changes brought about by new
technologies in libraries. She said that technology allowed her to see the bigger picture,
which suggested the benefits o f global connectivity with other academic communities.
Neva sounded reminiscent when she said, “Before technology, librarians were
seen as the information gods.” Many in the profession perceived Google as a threat
because it was able to deliver on the users ‘expectation o f instantaneous access to
information. However, the academic librarians in my study did not focus on about the
perceived threat o f Google and other search engines. Instead, the veteran academic
librarians incorporated these new technologies into their services, recognizing their value

134

in enhancing services that were most relevant to its users. John was given the nickname
Paul Drake on his university campus. “Yeah, anytime you needed information, you’d
call Paul Drake and he’d get it for you”.
The veteran academic librarians in my study are part o f the Baby Boomer
generation. Baby Boomers are often portrayed as a generation o f optimism, exploration
and achievement. This generation witnessed and participated in some o f the greatest
social changes in the country’s history during the 1960s and 1970s with the Civil Rights
Movement and the W omen’s Movement
(http://www.valueoptions.com/spotlight_YIW/baby_boomers.htm). The findings o f my
study do not suggest generalization throughout the library profession; but provide
descriptions o f the lived experiences o f the five veteran academic librarians framed to
help them report their experiences, as recalled, rather than to give complex descriptions
in my study.
Chapter Summary
A phenomenological research method was used to examine the lived experiences
o f five veteran academic librarians, who had worked in the academic library organization
for 30 years and more. In this chapter, I provided the findings o f my analysis which were
revealed using M oustakas’ (1994) phenomenological reduction approach. Chapter V will
include an overview o f my study, implications for the academic librarianship, and
recommendations for future research.

CHAPTER V
Overview, Implications, and Recommendations
In this chapter, I discuss the implications and recommendations based on the
results o f my study. Implications o f my findings as they relate to extant literature on the
two theoretical frameworks that guided my study are discussed, as well as implications of
my findings in relation to the literature review conducted for my study.
Recommendations for the library profession and university and library administrators are
also included.
As the end o f the 20th century drew to a close, academic libraries in the United
States were subjected to tremendous changes, largely driven by technology, which caused
many library professionals to question the fate and future o f the academic library as a
principal supporting component on U.S. university campuses (Jantz, 2012; Shupe &
Pung, 2011; Troll, 2002). The Oxford English Dictionary (2000) listed three distinct
definitions for the word library including: (a) a place, (b) a collection o f resources, and
(c) the library staff and the tools o f their trade. In a predominantly analog information
environment, these definitions o f library were relevant because users had to visit the
library building to access resources that were predominantly in print format. Librarians
were skilled in locating information using printed indexes and the card catalog; so library
users depended primarily on librarians to guide them in the search for information.
However, in the digital environment, access to library collections no longer requires the
physicality o f a library building, so the three distinct definitions for library in the analog
environment are no longer applicable in the digital information environment.

136

As a principal driver o f change, technology precipitated the repositioning o f
traditional library services, including the personnel demographics o f the library
organization (Shupe & Pung, 2011). With the emergence o f technology, the traditional
role o f the academic librarian and the repurposing o f space in library buildings once
occupied by printed materials, have changed remarkably and have been re-conceptualized
(Sennyey, Ross, & Mills, 2009). Parsons and Christenson’s study (2001) drew attention
to the hiring o f non-MLS employees into roles that were formerly held by librarians due
to the increased need for technology skills. According to their study, academic library
directors indicated that they needed to hire non-MLS librarians for subject expertise and
technical skills, such as Web design, data management, instructional design specialists,
rare book curators, and archivists. Michalak (2012) described the transformed academic
library as outward facing, de-siloed, technology diffused, and collaborative. As the
presence o f print materials diminished in the library building, spaces were redesigned as
common learning areas to accommodate collaborative learning activities. These learning
spaces are evolving away from being places for library instruction and presentations and
toward being places o f discovery, invention, and knowledge construction. A popular
example o f this trajectory is makerspaces where equipment is available for individuals or
teams to invent physical objects (Brown, 2015).
As new technologies were introduced into the library environment, the
conversation among library professionals shifted toward redefining the library academy’s
sustainable value within the framework o f the academic mission o f institutions o f higher
education. In the presence o f change, there is always a faction o f people who resist
change and seek to maintain the status quo (Baker, 1989). R. David Lankes (2011) stated

137

in the introduction of The Atlas o f New Lihrarianship, “Thousands o f years o f tradition
serve as inspiration for our future, not as a set o f shackles binding us” (p. 1). The
significance o f my dissertation study rests in its contribution to the literature on the effect
o f change in the library organization, which had been encased in centuries o f tradition.
Specifically, my study releases the voices o f five veteran academic librarians, with more
than 30 years o f professional services, to share their lived experiences in the library
organization amidst tremendous transformations in the academic library. Shupe and
Pung (2011) countered the popular perception o f librarianship as an “antiquated, stagnant
profession” (p. 413) characterized by long days spent sitting at a desk and shelving dusty
books. The role o f the 21st century academic librarian has become both dynamic and
challenging, with librarians frequently involved in outreach and management and
embedded in the classroom, providing instruction in person or via an online management
system. Shupe and Pung (2011) also noted that as technology continues to evolve,
academic librarians continue to acquire the sophisticated skills to function and manage
effectively in the digital environment. Library users continue to seek help from librarians
because they are inundated with information on the Internet is difficult to navigate.
However, when library staff faced challenges with implementing new programs
and systems into the organization, there was the risk o f what Michalak (2012) called
change fatigue. Organizational psychologists have long recognized work-related stress as
a very real concern (Shupe & Pung, 2011). According to Shupe and Pung (2011)
researchers have long recognized the inherent stress in the library profession.
Technostress, a term that was coined in 1984 by a clinical psychologist, Brod (1984),
who defined it as, “a modem disease o f adaptation caused by an inability to cope with the

138

new computer technologies in a healthy manner” (p. 16). Academic librarians were
expected to understand, use, and manage sophisticated and ever-evolving technology as
library users requested assistance in navigating and evaluating the explosion of
information available on the Internet.
Not only had the librarian’s role changed within the walls o f the library building,
but Lankes (2011) posited a new librarianship based not on books and artifacts but
instead focused on knowledge and learning. This represented a paradigmatic shift that
was a tremendous stressor for the traditional academic librarian, yet somewhat ironic
particularly because, librarians traditionally had been viewed as the original search
engines in that they were the collectors and organizers o f information (Atkins, 1991).
However, this new focus on information technology threatened to unseat librarians in this
role as society moved away from the industrial age into the information age. De Solla
Price (1979) asserted that technology alone would not improve the perceived value o f
library services to its users. Even Lancaster (1999), the author o f the Paperless Society,
believed that technology was an endangerment to the library profession. As such, library
professionals had to articulate the value their profession and validate its continued
existence in the new age o f information (Griffith, 1995). Housewright (2009) stated that
the academic library’s success could no longer be assessed by traditional measures such
as the number o f books in the collection, user satisfaction surveys, and efficiency o f
services. Institutional decision-makers in recent years no longer correlated success by
these measures.
It is against this ironic backdrop that I sought to learn, through the lived
experiences of the five veteran academic librarians in my study, how they believed the

139

transformative initiatives influenced the role o f the academic librarian and the academic
library organization, as well as how these select librarians responded to these changes.
Research (e.g., Housewright, 2009; Jantz, 2012) has supported the notion that the world­
view o f librarians to be materials-centered, and without collections, they felt they had no
value. However, the results o f my research characterize the librarians in my study as
resilient, flexible, resourceful, and committed to the library profession. Through their
lived experiences, I learned that they acknowledged the need to change, as they faced the
challenge o f unrelenting change o f great magnitude and immediacy. Also, their longevity
in the profession is testament to their belief in the value that the library organization
provides on university campuses.
Study Overview
In this study, I explored the lived experiences o f five veteran academic librarians
who each had attained a career o f over 30 years in the academic library. The purpose o f
the phenomenological study was to examine the perceptions and lived experiences of
selected veteran academic librarians who worked as librarians during periods o f constant
change influenced by technology, in the academic library. Much has been written about
the evolving library organization and the transformed roles o f academic librarians in the
United States (e.g., Maloney, Stoffle, Morden, & Allen, 2003; Michalak, 2012; Sapp &
Gilmour, 2002; Sapp & Gilmour, 2003; Seal, 2001; Troll, 2002; Wilder, 2003; Young,
2008); yet, a paucity o f research exists regarding the emotional memories o f veteran
academic librarians whose careers were engulfed in a culture o f incessant change,
particularly in the waning years o f the 20th century academic library. The mission o f the
academic library is to respond to the requirements o f its parent institution. That remains

140

the primary role o f the academic library; however, many o f the pressures for change are
external, emanating from the forces that have shaped society (Shera, 1965). The
implication from Shera's (1965) observations is that academic libraries are so bound in
tradition that they cannot respond to the forces o f change beyond the university setting.
In my study, data were gathered using individual semi-structured interviews and
analyzed using Moustakas’ phenomenological reduction approach which was informed
by two theoretical frameworks. Three major themes that emerged from the data analysis
communicated the experiences the veteran academic librarians were: (a) shifts in roles of
the academic library, (b) shifts in the role o f the academic librarian, and (c) emotional
memories o f the veteran academic librarian. Participants disclosed the events o f their
lived experiences in the academic library, which led to the emergence o f three themes,
which were also accompanied by subthemes within each o f the three themes.
Theoretical and Methodological Frameworks
The two theoretical frameworks, affective events theory and organizational
identity were appropriate lens through which to guide my study. The methodological
approach o f phenomenology was the most appropriate framework for developing a
research protocol that would allow the voices o f the five veteran academic librarians to be
heard. With the limited sample size in this study, generalizations were not a goal o f my
study, but to obtain insights into a phenomenon, individuals, or events.
Affective Events Framework. Weiss and Cropanzano (1996) suggested in their
affective events theory that people’s attitudes toward their job can be influenced by the
cumulative experiences o f momentary positive and negative feelings in the work
environment. The librarians in my study articulated how technology advances initiated

141

an avalanche o f changes in the library organization, causing a range o f personal emotions
to surface in relation to their work and their professional roles. Additionally, Meyer and
Allen (1991) noted that commitment contains an affective domain, which is described as
“an emotional attachment to, identification with, and involvement in the organization”
(Meyer & Allen, 1991, p. 67). The career longevity exemplified by the librarians in my
study was an indication o f the emotional attachments they had to the service they
provided to their universities. The librarian participants also described themselves as
servant leaders who navigated through the years o f transformation in the library
organization. Finally, the librarians saw themselves on the front lines o f change, because
o f their close involvement in learning and applying new skills.
Organizational Identity Theory
Albert and Whetten (1985) conceptualized organizational identity as a relational
construct defined by contrasts such as between how we are and how others see us. Hatch
and Schultz (2002) conducted a study in which they examined a connection between
organizational culture and organizational identity. According to Anholt (2007), the
image o f an organization is instrumental in gaining competitive advantage and in
attracting stakeholders with the intent o f influencing positive financial gain (e.g., budget).
I recognized organizational identity as appropriate for guiding my study particularly since
the academic library organization has a long history o f tradition and image. As a result o f
the onslaught o f change in the library organization as voiced by the librarians in my study
and appearing in the literature, suggested organization identity as a construct worthy o f
examining the lived experiences o f the veteran academic librarians. The academic library
organization’s image or its brand is a strategic governance initiative rooted in a long-term

142

strategic vision, because its service creed and everything that happens in the academic
library and its accomplishments, communicates its image to the university institution
(Anholt (2007).
Implications of Findings Related to Literature on Affective Events Theory and
Organizational Identity
There is a plethora o f related publications that chronicle the historical
development o f late 20th century academic library, the 21st century academic library, and
strategies for transforming library organizations that are deeply ingrained in tradition.
The published academic literature relative to my study revealed that studies that were
examined through the affective events theory were largely conducted in disciplines
outside o f the field o f library science. In fact, the field o f library science is not rich in
theory because the theories tend to revolve around functional approaches (i.e., theories of
cataloging, reference) Lankes (2011). However, studies that focused on the functions of
the library organization did apply organizational identity theory as a lens to examine the
academic library’s transformation away from the traditional service model. McGrath
(2002a) attempted to develop a grand theory o f library science, but it too was limited by a
focus on library functions.
According to data gathered through my interviews with the veteran academic
librarians, academic libraries at which they were employed, have successfully
reconceived and reconstructed the ways in which they supported faculty and students in
research and education. The librarians in my study shared varying details about their
lived experiences; however, a thread o f commonality subsisted throughout each o f their
lived experiences. For example, it became apparent through my data analysis that the

143

librarians clearly experienced a fulfilled and accomplished career in librarianship. As an
insider o f the profession, I sensed they knew that they had come through monumental
obstacles for which they received little formal training. Positions in libraries often
require certain skillsets, and without question, the librarians in my study were excellent
reference librarians, catalogers, web designers, and archivists. They were hired into their
respective organizations because they could execute their primary duties which required
these skillsets among others. They each voiced a sincere desire to help students and
faculty. Their paychecks did not lead to job satisfaction. No one ever mentioned their
salaries.
However, from a researcher’s point o f view as well as a veteran academic
librarian, the skills that saved the day were the soft skills that the librarians possessed.
Soft skills are those skills which tend to appear at the end o f job descriptions such as
flexibility and adaptability, intellectual curiosity, social interaction, collaboration, and
perseverance. The librarians in my study reminded me o f the story, H a n s B rin ker also
know n as S ilver Skates, about a Dutch boy who saved his country by putting his finger
in the leaking dike. According to the tale, the boy stayed there all night until help
arrived. A major criterion for the participants’ was to have worked in the library
profession, primarily in the academic library, for 30 or more years. These librarians have
lived through three decades o f change. The attempts at change and innovation in the
library were not perfect. Remember in Beatrice’s interview, she shared that she had lost
the university’s website! In John’s interview, he shared that he had knocked out the
power cord and lost irretrievable data. Marvin shared that he had not planned for enough
back up during a big data migration project. Therefore, based on their shared lived

144

experiences, I have surmised that these five librarians have remained steadfast in their
commitment to their respective institutions and to the library profession. They faced
many unknowns o f new technologies, shaping them into tools to enable them in the
creation and delivery o f services; and they continued when the technological tools in turn
began to reshape their roles and the role o f the academic libraries o f their respective
institutions. Each o f the librarians took different paths to arrive at their decisions to
become librarians, but what was absent in each o f the interviews was expression o f regret
about their career choice.
Implications of Findings Related to the Literature Review
I believe that the veteran academic librarians have carried the library profession’s
torch successfully as they have bridged the proverbial gap between the analog and digital
worlds o f information. These librarians have acquired new skills and expertise along the
way to remain effective in their academic support role in the academic library that
crossed from one century into the next and several generations o f students and faculty. It
was evident from the interviews; the veteran academic librarians in my study understood
the value o f the supportive services o f the academic library. Sometimes referred to as
generalists, they could adapt and adjust as needed to meet the needs o f their users. The
lived experiences and longevity bear out their continued love and commitment to their
calling.
For generations, the public’s popular perception o f a librarian has been a
bespectacled elderly woman who is short-tempered and dresses in ill-fitting clothes. On
the opposite end o f the spectrum, thanks to Carmen Electra, the librarian is the objectified
female who, labeled as the “naughty librarian” and can be identified by her plunging

145

neckline and schoolgirl skirt. Actually, neither perception has advanced the public’s
perception o f the librarian’s actual job with the general public (Knibbe-Haanstra, 2009).
Although there is a plethora o f literature related to the changed roles o f the
academic librarians since the widespread integration o f technology in libraries, there is a
paucity o f research regarding the affective and organizational identity dimensions for the
veteran academic librarian. Descriptive literature offers rich examples o f the technostress
experienced by librarians and is a good initial step toward understanding the affective
events in library organizations; however, it is not sufficient in terms o f a comprehensive
understanding o f the phenomenon (Shupe & Pung, 2011). Brief and Weiss (2002) noted
that recent research has shifted toward a conceptual focus on the production o f moods
and emotions at work, with an emphasis, on stressful events. Even though recent interest
in affect in the workplace has been intense, many theoretical and methodological
opportunities and challenges remain.
Implications for Future Studies
My principle interest is in fostering greater examination o f the constructs o f
affective events theory and organizational identity theory in conjunction with other
organizational studies constructs. However, there is a dearth o f scholarly research related
to the emotional stress o f librarians who experience ongoing change in the academic
library. I support Shupe and Pung’s (2011) recommendation for a more integrated,
comprehensive focus on role-related issues, and call for more collaborative efforts
between research psychologists and scholars in the field o f librarianship. The recognition
o f affective events theory and organization identity theory are essential in the
management o f organizations that are immersed in innovation and risk-taking integration

146

o f technology. Few studies exist that have particularized the interrelationship o f affective
i

events and organization identity in library organization as it tried to keep pace with
constant change. Due to the presence o f innovation in the academic library, studies on
the complexity o f innovation as perceived by academic librarians defined by their
generation or time in the profession or specialty. According to Hammill (2005), the
presence of four diverse generations in the workplace is a common occurrence; therefore,
implications for future research on generational bridging in the education-oriented
organizations exist. Further investigation is needed to inform and document the constant
change in the library organization, giving particular consideration to organizational
structure and leadership styles.
Recommendations for the Library Profession
David Lankes (2011) cautioned library schools and librarians in general to avoid
what he calls the Florentine Dilemma, which is analogous to the relationship between
Italian master artists and their students. The Academy o f Art in Florence, is considered
the epicenter of Renaissance art; yet because art students during that era could not
succeed unless they replicated the work o f the master artists. Creativity was not
encouraged. Art students from that time were expected to follow the prescriptive plan
developed by the master artists. If the master artists became stuck, and their creativity
diminished, then so did the students. Lankes (2011) believed there was no little to any
value in graduate library programs that required apprenticeships because the
apprenticeship or practicum in essence was asking the library student to replicate or
duplicate what already existed in the library. Instead, library schools and librarians
should encourage new librarians to go beyond what already exists and never to set limits

147

on themselves. If this recommendation is embraced by library schools and academic
libraries, the field o f librarianship will be enriched by the fresh infusion o f knowledge.
Eden (2011) challenged an audience o f librarians during a plenary session at a
library conference in Charleston, South Carolina, when he accused the profession o f
choosing comfort over an uncomfortable status. In the spirit o f F. W Lancaster, Eden
told the audience o f librarians that, “if we don’t get outside our comfort zones, we will be
become obsolete.” In other words, the status quo must go and go and go. No profession
has reached that pinnacle which allows them to rest on their laurels. About a decade
before Eden’s (2011) provocative presentation, Stoffle, Allen, Fore, & Mobley (2000)
observed that “We still have services that have taken on a ‘sacred cow’ status, such as
like face-to-face reference. If we let go o f these ‘sacred cows’, we would be free to
rethink how we create and perform our services” (p. 899). With the increasing focus on a
national conversation on assessment, accountability, and value, the Association o f
College and Research (2012) published a report to help academic librarians participate in
the conversation about value and to identify resources about how to demonstrate the
value o f academic libraries in clear, measurable ways (p. 8). According to the report, the
academic community needs to approach the issue o f value in the academic library with
(a) knowledge o f the extant literature on the academic library’s value; (b) an awareness o f
the professional organizations’ positions regarding the value o f libraries, (c) suggestions
for immediate steps that academic libraries should take to demonstrate their library value,
and (d) an agenda for articulating academic library value.

148

Recommendations for University and Library Administrators
In the midst o f shrinking funds for library operations and services, university and
library administrators encourage the exploration o f emerging technology trends and
intellectual curiosity in education. There are six trends identified in the New Media
Consortium Horizon Report: 2015 Higher Education Edition proposed to drive
technology planning and decision-making over the next five years. The research revealed
that traditional approaches to teaching and learning with roots in the 18th century and
earlier are still very common in many institutions and often stifle learning as much as
they foster it. The trends were divided into short-term, mid-term, and long-term
objectives. Library budgets and personnel will determine the pace o f change; but the
report suggests a strategy for getting started.
Johnson, Becker, Estrada, and Freeman (2015) conducted a study which revealed
that in the last decade university leaders’ attitudes had change toward the libraries at their
institutions. In an emblematic sense, academic administrators still view the library as the
heart o f the university, a symbol o f the intellectual purpose o f the institution. Anderson
(2011) stated the following:
As information becomes more and more divorced from physical formats, campus
administrators see less and less o f a meaningful distinction between the library
and general campus information technology infrastructure; library directors'
reporting lines begin shifting from provosts to CFOs, and the directors themselves
are serving (p. 290).
To secure support, the library must now demonstrate how it serves the university mission.
The results o f this study call into question the applicability o f the centrality concept to

149

libraries in universities and indicate the need for research that offers a relevant model for
use in those settings.
Conclusion
The purpose o f my phenomenological research was to examine the lived
experiences o f five veteran academic librarians, who had worked in the academic library
organization for 30 years and more. The affective events theory and the organizational
identity theory served as the theoretical frameworks o f my study. These frameworks
guided my examination o f the perceptions and lived experiences o f selected veteran
academic librarians who worked as librarians during periods o f constant change
influenced by technology, in the academic libraries in the state o f Texas. Using the
interview protocol, an instrument that consisted o f 17 questions, I conducted individual,
semi-structured interviews with five librarians in keeping with tenets o f
phenomenological research. Descriptive data in the form o f transcribed interviews and
observation notes were collected and analyzed using Moustakas’ (1994)
phenomenological reduction approach. Hatch (2002) defined data analysis as the
systematic search for meaning, wherein, the researcher is the main tool for analysis. As
such, I engaged in an interactive and iterative process with a fellow researcher. I was
able to construct meaning o f the data by listening to the voices o f the librarians as they
recalled events from their 30-year careers in the academic library. In the data analysis,
three major themes emerged to which I assigned the constructed meanings: (a) shifts in
role of the academic library organization (i.e., academic libraries reconceive and
reconstruct the ways in which they support faculty and students in research and
education); (b) shifts in the role o f the academic librarian (i.e., the 21st century academic

150

librarian must possess combined research and technology skills); and (c) emotional
memories o f the veteran academic librarian (i.e., what do the veteran academic librarians
recall from their 30 plus years career as an academic librarian?).
The summary implication for current and future academic librarians and
university administrators was articulated succinctly in a guest editorial o f the Journal o f
Academic Librarianship titled “The Crisis in Research Librarianship” written by
Anderson (2011). Anderson (2011) posits that the issue is not that libraries fail to offer
value to their constituents,, but rather the perceptions o f library users: (1) that library
materials are free due to the growing presence o f digital content, (2) that the assistance
from librarians is no longer needed to access information, and (3) the value o f the library
that is not valued, is not valuable. The library profession should acknowledge the library
user’s perception matters more than reality. Further studies are needed to determine
whether the transformations that have occurred in the academic library have positively
impacted the perceptions o f the library’s value.

R esearch Sum m ary
R esearch Sum m ary

Briefly state th e research hypothesis being explored by the current research. Include a
discussion of the present knowledge relevant to th e research and th e aims and significance
of the research. C ite appropriate literature to support the relevance and im portance of
this research.
Academic librarians who began their professional careers in the early to mid-1980s have witnessed sig­
nificant changes in their role in the library’ organization, with technology’ as the driver of the changes.
With each passing decade, the academic librarybecame increasingly enmeshed in constant change, as
technology moved into the mainstream of society.Acadcmic librarians withdecades of experience in the
20th-century’ academic library' were faced with redefining their roles on university campuses (Grealv,
1997; Jackson, 2011: Seal. 2001; Staley k Malenfant, 2010).The purpose of the proposed phenomenolog­
ical study is to examine the perceptions and lived experiences of selected veteran academic librariansin
Texas who worked as librarians during periods of constant change in the library organizationlargelv in­
fluenced by technology’.

Study Significance: The proposed study will contribute to the extant body of literature regarding orga­
nizational change, particularly in the academic library organization during the latter part of the 20th
century (Meyer. Bartunek, Lacey, 2002). The first-hand accounts of the lived experiences of academic li­
brarians during this periodwillprovide ahistorical perspectiveof the transformative events that oecurredin
the academic library which can be of historical value for future research conductedin librarianship as
well asorganizational management.

Please describe in chronological order all the task s/te sts or procedures subjects will be
asked to com plete in participating in this research.
Participants will be invited to contribute to this study if they meet the following selection criteria:

1) Possess a master’s degree in library and/or information science (MLS) from an institution accred­
ited by the American Library Association; and
2)Be currently employed in an academic library or retired in the last five years from an academic li­
brary and has achieved at least 30 yearsin the library profession in which AT LEAST 20 years of the
professionalemployment has beenaligned with an academic library’.

Statem ent of duration of subject participation:
During the data collection phase of the study, each participant will be invited to participate in an
interview sessionwith the Principal Investigator which will be recorded by audio. The interview isanticipated to last up to 1.5 hours. The interview protocol -will consists of 17 semi-structured, evolving,
non-directional questions. The interview transcript will be delivered by email to each participant to

192

confirm the accuracvof the contents. Ifany clarification is needed, the Principal Investigator will arrange
for a follow-upwhich will take place via the phone orSkvpe.Any additional information received will be
included in the dat a set .

A nticipated risks:
Thcprincipal investigator (Pl)anticipates the risks to be minimal. The researcher will ensure confi­
dentiality of all information connected to this research bv maintained files that areencrvpted and kept
in the possession of the PI in password-protected files.

A nticipated benefits:
The research study will bring awareness to the affective memories of veteran academic librarians and
their coping strategies as communicated through individual accounts of the transformational events since
the advent of the Internet. The study will contribute to the historical literature of the library profession’s
past told from the perspective of librarians who worked in pre-Internet libraries. The study can also
inform the literature related to aspects of change in organizations with established, traditional organi­
zational structures.

If th e research will require blood draws, bone marrow biopsy samples, o th er biopsies, or the
collection of other tissues, etc., perform ed solely because of participation in the research,
