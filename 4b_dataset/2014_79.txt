Factors influencing user-generated vocabularies: An investigation of the effects of resource and
genre on tagging
Studies of user-generated tagging (e.g., Yoon, 2009) argue that tag agreement across users is due to
wide-spread use of basic level category terms. This study investigated whether the superordinate,
subordinate or basic level of abstraction predominated in user-generated tagging vocabularies and
whether differences in level of abstraction were influenced by resource content or genre. Analysis of
7617 tags assigned by 40 participants to 36 online resources representing four content categories (i.e.,
TOOL, FRUIT, CLOTHING, VEHICLE) and three genres (i.e., news, blog, ecommerce) found no
overall preferences in assignment of superordinate, subordinate and basic level tags. However,
significant differences were identified in the frequency of occurrence of subordinate and basic level
tags assigned to resources in the FRUIT content category and of superordinate and basic level tags
assigned to resources in the CLOTHING content category. The study also found significant
variations in preferred levels of abstraction based on resource genre. Based on analysis of the tagging
vocabularies generated by participants, the study concluded that, within the framework of
Heidegger's (1953/1996) notion of handiness, observed variations in preferred level(s) of abstraction
are to be expected in that perception – and thus the meaning of “things” – arises out of the
individual's contextualized experiences of engaging with objects.

Introduction
Over the past few years, the proliferation of social bookmarking applications such as
Delicious1 and Flickr2 has sparked numerous studies on folksonomies and the tagging practices
of individuals. The term folksonomy was coined by Vander Wal (2007) to describe the set of tags
that an individual user assigns to resources for future retrieval. However, the idea of a
folksonomy is nebulous: The variety of definitions appearing in the literature reflects the lack of
a common understanding regarding tagging and user-generated vocabularies. For example,
Mathes (2004) argues that tagging is “user-metadata” that represents the “best and worst in the
organization of information” (Conclusions section, para. 1); Shirky (2006) defines tagging as
free-form labeling; and Glushko, Maglio, Matlock, and Barsalou (2008) characterize tagging as
“categorization in the wild” (p. 129). In a pioneering study of tagging, Golder and Huberman
(2006) argue that tagging is a process of sensemaking that allows users to categorize and identify
information through emergent meaning. In spite of the lack of terminological agreement, studies
of tagging behaviors and the folksonomies they generate have entered the mainstream of
scholarly research in multiple domains, including library and information science (LIS) and
computer science.
Overall, the evolution of folksonomic studies has involved three paradigms: early studies
focusing on defining the phenomenon and positioning it in the universe of knowledge
representation (e.g., Hammond, Hannay, Lund, & Scott, 2005; Kapucu, Hoeppner, & Dunlop,
2008; Lund, Hammond, Flack, Hannay, 2005; Quintarelli, 2005; Mathes, 2004; Peterson, 2006;

Shirky, 2005); research analyzing tagging vocabularies and users’ tagging behaviors (e.g., BarIlan, Shoham, Idan, & Miller, 2008; Golder & Huberman, 2006; Kipp, 2006; Marlow, Naaman,
Boyd, & Davis, 2006; Noruzi, 2006; Paolillo & Penumarthy, 2007); and studies proposing
further structural and functional development or the application of folksonomic systems (e.g.,
Abel, Baldoni, Baraglio, Henze, Krause, & Patti, 2009a; Abel, Henze, & Krause, 2009b; Chen,
Cai, Leung, & Li, 2010; Clements, de Vries, & Reinders, 2010; De Meo, Quattrone, & Ursino,
2009; Han & Yan, 2009; Yeung, Gibbins, & Shadbolt, 2009a).
In his highly cited paper, Shirky (2005) argues that user-generated vocabularies comprised
of tags assigned by multiple users offer the potential for “alternate organizational systems,
systems that, like the Web itself, do a better job of letting individuals create value for one
another” (Conclusions section, para. 1). The response has been an avalanche of studies
advocating the application of user-generated vocabularies as either an alternative to or a
complement for traditional systems of knowledge representation and organization (e.g., Dolog,
Krotzsch, Schaffert, & Vrandecic, 2009; Golder & Huberman, 2006; Gruber, 2005; Hammond et
al., 2005; Munk & Mork, 2007a; Noruzi, 2006; Panke & Gaiser, 2009; Peterson, 2006). In
particular, LIS studies have investigated both the functionality and subject representativeness of
user-generated vocabularies (e.g., Munk & Mork, 2007a; Munk & Mork, 2007b; Kipp, 2006)
and the level of agreement in tagging vocabularies generated by multiple users (e.g., Kipp &
Campbell, 2006), often comparing user-generated vocabularies to traditional systems of
information representation and organization (e.g., Bruce, 2008; Kipp, 2006; Noruzi, 2006; Yi &
Chan, 2009).
The basic questions underlying these studies are whether a user-generated vocabulary
facilitates the sharing of resources and whether such a vocabulary actually constitutes an

2

indexing language that can be used to represent the intellectual content of resources (Jacob &
Shaw, 1998). The research on user-generated vocabularies reflects the significant role of
language in knowledge representation that had been described by Blair (1990), who drew on
Wittgenstein’s theory of language use and the manifestation of meaning in forms of life
(Wittgenstein, 1953/1963) to argue that representation is “primarily a problem of language and
meaning” (Blair, 1990, p. 1).
Representation of a resource's subject content using descriptors from a pre-existing
vocabulary raises questions regarding the relationship between controlled vocabularies and
natural language (e.g., Buckland, 1999; Lancaster, 1977). Because a controlled vocabulary
strives to ensure consistent semantic representation of resources by normalizing the indexing
vocabulary (e.g., by identifying synonyms and homographs and defining preferred terms),
Lancaster (1977) characterizes controlled vocabulary as an “artificial language… in which the
terms… have assumed special meaning by the way they have been used in indexing” (p. 23). In
contrast to natural language, a controlled vocabulary frequently lacks both the currency of
natural language and the specificity of a domain language (Lancaster, 1977). However, studies of
user-generated tagging vocabularies consisting of natural language terms have found
inconsistency, instability, and ambiguity as well as homographs, acronyms, and synonyms (e.g.,
Monk & Mork, 2007b); and a number of studies have observed a significant use of temporal,
task-oriented and affective personal tags, such as toread and cool that do not represent the actual
content of a resource (e.g., Golder & Huberman, 2006; Kipp, 2006; Kipp & Campbell, 2006;
Kipp, 2007; Munk & Mork, 2007a).
Several studies of tagging vocabularies have referenced Rosch’s theory of basic level
categories (Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson, & Boyes-Braem, 1976) to explain what has been

3

identified as a tendency among users to assign basic level terms as tags (e.g., Golder &
Huberman, 2006; Munk & Mork, 2007a; Munk & Mork, 2007b; Noruzi, 2006). Rosch, Mervis,
Gray, Johnson, and Boyes-Braem (1976) propose that there is a basic level of conceptual
abstraction at which categories are most cognitively efficient, and Golder and Huberman (2006)
contend that “earlier tags in a bookmark represent basic levels, because they are not only
widespread in agreement, but are also the first terms that users thought of when tagging the
URLs in question” (p. 202). Taking into consideration that basic level terms may vary across
users, Lakoff (1987, p. 51) argues that basic level categories are “human-sized” and depend on
how people interact with the objects represented by a category label: the way people perceive
these objects and organize information about them. Although Golder and Huberman (2006) do
not explicitly acknowledge that basic level terms can vary across users, they do concede that, in
tagging systems, “conflicting basic levels can prove disastrous, as documents tagged perl and
javascript may be too specific for some users, while a document tagged programming may be
too general for others” (p. 200; emphasis in original). However, Golder and Huberman’s
hypothesis regarding the use of basic level terms as tags is based on little more than assumptions
drawn from earlier experimental studies (e.g., Tanaka & Taylor, 1991) rather than the empirical
investigation of tagging behaviors.
A number of studies have suggested that user assignment of tags to specific resources
demonstrates what has been called the power-law distribution, which stabilizes over time (e.g.,
Capocci, Baldassarri, Servedio, & Loreto, 2009; Ding, Jacob, Caverlee, Fried, & Zhang, 2009;
Munk & Mork, 2007a; Oldenberg, 2009). Golder and Huberman (2006) offer two reasons for
these observations of stabilization: imitation and shared knowledge. The Delicious interface
facilitates imitation by providing a list of the most popular tags that have already been assigned

4

to a given resource; but Golder and Huberman contend that shared knowledge, such as the strong
IT background of Delicious users, is also be an important factor contributing to stabilization. If
Golder and Huberman’s argument regarding the “widespread” (p. 204) use of basic level tags
can be supported empirically, it is possible that the use of basic level terms may also be a
primary contributor to the stabilization of tags.
Many of the tagging studies that reference Rosch's theory of basic level categories fail to
define what a basic level term is. The failure to operationalize the basic level terms can be
addressed by reference to Heidegger (1953/1996, p. 65), who offers a framework for
understanding the relational nature of basic level categories. Hiedegger’s notion of handiness
(i.e., zuhandenheit, or being “at hand”) represents the “ontological categorical definition of
beings as they are ‘in themselves’” (p. 67; emphasis in original): useful things that are handy on
“the basis of what is objectively present” (p. 67). Following Heidegger, basic level categories
can be expected to vary across individuals and cultures because of variations in “innerworldly
beings” and their relations to or understandings of the “thingly quality” (p. 65) of objects. For
Heidegger, variation is “phenomenological in that it comes out of our contextualized experience
of engaging [with objects]” (M. Gray, personal communication, April 30, 2011). Based on the
notion of handiness, then, a term at the basic level of categorization reflects either the
individual's contextualized experience of using an objects or her understanding of an object's
“thingly quality” (p. 65).
There has been much speculation about factors that may affect user-generated vocabularies.
For example, Marlow, Naaman, Boyd, and Davis (2006) have proposed that a user's social
relations will affect tag vocabulary formation and that the design of the tagging system itself
(e.g., tagging rights, system support for taggers) may also influence the quality and quantity of

5

tags generated: Some systems allow a user to tag only resources that she has contributed (e.g.,
Technorati3), while other systems provide options for free tagging that allow anyone to assign
any tag to any resource (e.g., Last.fm4). Veres (2006b) argues that the nature of shared
knowledge serves as a mental model or “mental architecture” for users and that a folksonomy
can be an “invaluable source of data for studying the mental processes of naive human
classifiers” (p. 329). And Lamere (2008) suggests that, unlike traditional indexing, which uses a
controlled vocabulary, users' assignments of genre-related tags provide an “extremely detailed
map of how ... [they] perceive and understand the complexities of overlapping genres” (p. 102).
Although some studies of user-generated tagging vocabularies have found a
preponderance of content-related tags (e.g., Heckner, Mühlbacher, & Wolff, 2008; Munk &
Mork, 2007b), Lamere’s (2008) study of the most frequently applied tags at Last.fm found that
tags representing musical genres were favored by taggers (see also Inskip, 2009); and some
researchers in LIS have suggested that representing the genre of a resource could facilitate
information retrieval (e.g., Crowston & Kwasnik, 2003; Rosso, 2005; Roussinov, Crowston, &
Nilan, Kwasnik, Cai, & Liu, 2001). For example, Beghtol (2001) argues that genre analysis
could be a useful tool for creating a “framework of analysis for a domain … [to] structure and
interpret texts, events, ideas, decisions, explanations and every other human activity in that
domain” (p. 19). Vaughan and Dillon (2006) suggest that the theory of mental models, which
attempts to explain human knowledge representation and processing mechanisms, provides a
“natural extension to genre studies” (p. 504) because genre represents the socially grounded
context in which resources are perceived. However, Rosso’s (2005) research on the implications
of genre for web search and retrieval found that search results that included genre identification

produced no significant improvement in a user’s ability to make relevance judgments about
retrieved resources.
This study investigates two of the factors that may affect the level of abstraction of tags in
user-generated tagging vocabulary: the intellectual content and the genre of resources. Based on
the theory of basic level categories (Rosch et al., 1976) and Heidegger’s (1953/1996) notion of
handiness, it explores the predominant levels of abstraction in user-generated tagging
vocabularies. Drawing on suggestions regarding genre and mental models, the study also
investigates whether the genre of a resource has an effect on the tags assigned by users.

Definitions
In this paper, a folksonomy is defined as a user-generated vocabulary consisting of the
tags that users assign to categorize or bookmark online resources; a tag is defined as an
alphanumeric string that a user has assigned to represent the subject content, format, utility, or
any other characteristic of an online resource; and a social bookmarking site is defined as a
service that allows users to save, organize and share online personal bookmarks. An entity is
defined here as a single, identifiable unit (e.g., a specific resource or an individual person) and a
category as a collection of entities that are considered to be similar in some respect. Categories
are designated by a name or label (e.g., the category ANIMAL5). A member or instance of a
category is an entity that is granted membership in the category on the basis of features shared
with other members of the category (e.g., canary is a member of the category BIRD). A property
of an entity may be a feature or an attribute: A feature is a characteristic of or information about
an entity (e.g., HAS SEAT is a feature of the category CHAIR); and an attribute is a type of feature

that can be represented by a range of values (e.g., MARITAL STATUS has the attributes SINGLE,
MARRIED, WIDOWED).

A hierarchy is a set of categories that are related to one another by means of subsumption
(i.e., class inclusion involving the genus-species or is-a relationship). A superordinate category
is a category in a hierarchy that subsumes other, lower-level categories rather than specific
entities; and a subordinate category is a category that subsumes entities and is subsumed by and
thus subordinate to another category (E. Jacob, personal communication, June 30, 2011). The
phrase level of abstraction refers to the level of inclusiveness of a category (i.e., superordinate,
subordinate or basic level): as Rosch et al. (1976) observe, “The greater the inclusiveness of a
category … , the higher the level of abstraction” (p. 383).
A controlled vocabulary is defined as an established list of preffered terms that used to
index or to represent the content or subject of the resource. A natural language defined as a
human language in which the structure and rules have evolved from everyday usage.
A genre is defined as a “category of discourse” (Miller, 1985, p. 163) that is situated
within a given context and typified by a particular form, style or purpose. Following Rosso’s
(2005) definition of web genre as a “pragmatic type (with corresponding form and substance),
recognized by the genre’s user group” (p. 27), a web genre is defined as a type of online resource
that is recognizable by a group of users who share a set of expectations for or mental model of a
resource based on its structure, purpose, form, and content. And a mental model is defined as a
“dynamic system” (Doyle & Ford, 1998, p. 17) that denotes an internalized representation of an
external event or a “system whose structure maintains the perceived structure of that system” (p.
17).

Literature Review
Studies of User-Generated Vocabularies
The emergence of the bookmarking service Delicious introduced social bookmarking and
tagging on the web. Combining the words folk and taxonomy, Vander Wal (2007) coined the
term folksonomy to represent a user’s tagging vocabulary:
Folksonomy is the result of personal free tagging of information and objects
(anything with a URL) for one's own retrieval. The tagging is done in a social
environment (usually shared and open to others). Folksonomy is created from the
act of tagging by the person consuming the information. (“Definition of
Folksonomy,” para. 1)
Although Vander Wal’s definition focuses on the utility of a folksonomy for the individual user,
Marlow et al. (2006) point out that user-generated tags not only connect users to resources but
also connect resources to other resources that are assigned the same tag and users to other users
through social networks based on assigned tags or the resources that have been tagged (see
Figure 1). Even though users of tagging systems can be seen as “connected”, motivations for
tagging range from “selfish” tagging, where the focus is on tagging resources for future retrieval
by the tagger, to more “altruistic” tagging, where the focus is on tagging resources for retrieval
by others (Hammond, Hannay, Lund, & Scott, 2005) (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Representation of the benefits of social tagging. The benefits of tagging range from
the ‘selfish’ (the lower-left quadrant) represented by Flickr, where users are mainly concerned
with tagging of their own content for their own retrieval, to the ‘altruistic’ (the upper-right
quadrant) represented by Wikipedia, where users are mainly concerned with categorizing others
content for retrieval by others. Most of the users of the social bookmarking tools tag others’

10

content for their personal use (the lower-left quadrant). The self/others category (the upper-left
quadrant) users (such as Technorati and Tumblr) are mainly concerned with tagging their own
content for others to retrieve. (Adapted from Hammond et al., 2005)
Mai (2011) contends that folksonomies and the phenomenon of social tagging can be
related to the notion of democratic indexing (p. 117) described by Brown, Hidderley, Griffin, and
Rollason (1996). As described by Brown et al., democratic indexing assumes that a user can
assign a descriptor or a tag to a resource; and that these terms will then be available to all users
of the system. Mai argues that, because there is no “institutionalized cognitive authority that is
used to justify the inclusion of terms” in democratic indexing and folksonomies, the authority in
systems such as folksonomies “comes from the users’ collective interpretations and meaning
production” (pp. 118-119). However, in contrast to democratic indexing systems as described by
Brown et al., Mai maintains that consensus in the process of tag assignment is not achieved
through “cooperation or collaboration among users, but is merely programmed into the system”
(2011, p. 120).
Mai (2011) argues that folksonomies have emerged, in part, in response to the “perception
that many classificatory structures represent an outdated worldview and in part from the belief
that since there is no single purpose, goal, or activity that unifies the universe of knowledge” (p.
115). Mai (2011) argues that
When everyone participates in bringing order to the universe of knowledge, the
abundance of interpretations and meanings that people might make of individual
information objects is brought forward. This plurality of opinions and viewpoints
can be celebrated and used to advance the goals of any knowledge organization
system, namely to ease the retrieval of information. (p. 120)
Mai’s argument reflects the significant role that language plays in knowledge representation and
organization: As Blair (1990) has observed, the “process of representing documents for retrieval

11

is fundamentally a linguistic process, and the problem of describing documents for retrieval is,
first and foremost, a problem of how language is used” (p. 122).
Studies of user-generated tagging vocabularies and user tagging behaviors are emerging as
a central focus in knowledge representation and organization, in particular, and in LIS research
general (Xu, Ma, Chen, & Ma, 2013). LIS studies have investigated the functionality and subject
representativeness of user-generated vocabularies (e.g., Golbeck, Koepfler, & Emmerling, 2011;
Kipp, 2006; Munk & Mork, 2007a); the stabilization and emergence of consensus in tagging
vocabularies (e.g., George, Jacob, Guo, Hajibayova, & Chuttur, 2008); the level of conceptual
abstraction of individual tags (e.g., Chen et al., 2010; Munk & Mork, 2007b); the relationship of
user-generated vocabularies to traditional systems of information representation and organization
(e.g., Bergman, Gradovitch, & Bar-Ilan, 2013; Bruce, 2008; Gerolimos, 2013; Lu, Park, Hu,
2010; Mathes, 2004; Noruzi, 2006;Yi & Chan, 2009); and the structural and functional
development of social tags to improve and/or complement the traditional systems of
representation and organization (e.g., Huang, Lin, & Chan, 2012; Pera, Lund, & Ng, 2009; Peters
& Stock, 2007; Sun & Lin, 2013; Syn & Spring, 2013; Yi, 2012; Yoo, Choi, Suh, & Kim, 2013).
The basic questions underlying these studies are whether user-generated vocabularies facilitate
the organization and sharing of resources and whether such a vocabulary constitutes an indexing
language.
It is generally recognized that identifying the “aboutness” or subject matter of a resource is
one of the most challenging aspects of the indexing process (Albrechtsen, 1993; Bates, 1986;
Beghtol, 1986; Chu & O’Brien, 1993; Hjørland, 1995; Hutchins, 1997; Jacob & Shaw, 1998);
but the process of translating aboutness into the terms of a controlled vocabulary raises questions
regarding the effective use of controlled vocabulary versus natural language (Buckland, 1999;

12

Lancaster, 1977). Because controlled vocabularies attempt to ensure consistent semantic
representation by pre-determining the specific set of descriptors that can be used to index
resources, they create an “artificial language … in which the terms … have assumed special
meaning by the way they have been used” (Lancaster, 1977, p. 23). However, because a
controlled vocabulary is a static language, it generally lacks the currency and specificity that is
possible with user-generated vocabularies that utilize natural language. In contrast to the
consistency found in controlled vocabularies, studies of folksonomies have identified instability,
and ambiguity in user-generated tagging vocabularies, which generally include homographs,
acronyms, and synonyms (e.g., Monk & Mork, 2007b).
Several studies have attempted to identify and categorize the functionalities of usergenerated vocabularies. In their seminal study of social tagging, Golder and Huberman (2006)
describe seven functions of tags in the Delicious bookmarking system: identifying what or who a
resource is about; identifying what kind of thing the resource is (e.g., book); identifying who
owns the content of the resource; making previously assigned tags more specific; identifying
qualities or characteristics of the resource (e.g., scary, funny); indicating the relation of the
resource to the tagger (e.g., mycomments, mystuff); and organizing resources or tasks related to
the resources (e.g., toread, jobsearch). Munk and Mork (2007b) elaborate on Golder and
Huberman’s study, suggesting several additional functions of tags: identifying the medium of the
resource (e.g., TV, book); identifying the genre of the resource (e.g., academic paper, reference
list); identifying a resource in relation to the tagger’s personal timeline (e.g., old, future); and
providing egocentric markers (e.g., non-semantic combinations of figures, letters and symbols).
While Golder and Huberman (2006) did not examine tag frequency except as it related to
individual resources, Munk and Mork’s (2007b) quantitative analysis of 178,460 Delicious tags

13

found that content tags predominated (79.1%), followed by tags for media (12.8%), genre
(3.8%), process description (1.4%), meta references (1.2%), copyright (0.8%), value judgments
(0.7%) and time (0.4%) (p. 122). However, Lamere’s (2008) study of the 500 most frequently
applied tags at Last.fm indicated that genre accounted for 68% of all tags assigned, perhaps due
to the nature of the resources being tagged. Unlike traditional indexing systems, which generally
assign a single descriptor for genre, a resource in Last.fm can be tagged with any genre tag that is
“potentially applicable” (p. 103), thereby providing for better representation of the “fuzziness at
the boundaries of [musical] genre categories” (p. 106). Zhang, Kipp, and Lee’s (2013) analysis
of 144 genre tags assigned to a sample of 400 CiteULike bookmarks also demonstrated a
complexity of user-generated genre tags: They suggest that genre tags can represent the form or
kind of a resource (e.g., an is-a relationship), the function or purpose of a resource (e.g., for
inclusion in a bibliography) or the aboutness of the resources tagged (e.g., survey).
Following analysis of the Connotea6 social bookmarking site, Heckner, Mühlbacher and
Wolff (2008) proposed two broad categories of tags: subject-related tags that represent the
resource (e.g., author, source, publication date) or its content (e.g., area of study, genre); and
non-subject-related or personal tags which can be affective (e.g., cool, boring, fun), time-related
(e.g., ea_16_05_2006) or task-related (e.g., readme, printed) (p. 7). According to Heckner et al.,
subject-related tags constituted 92% of the sample of 1,191 tags in their analysis, while only 8%
were categorized as non-subject-related; content-related tags (as a subset of subject-related tags)
accounted for 90.2% of all tags assigned, while resource-related tags (e.g., citeulike, CiteSeer)
represented only 1.5% of the dataset and genre tags (e.g., thesis, survey, conference proceedings,
tutorial, journal articles) represented only 0.8% of the dataset. In addition, 6.9% of non-subjectrelated tags were attributed to what the author's term “tag avoidance” (e.g., no-tag, testtag, test)

and 1.6% were time- or task-related (e.g., uploaded-ACM17012007, readme) (p. 7). However,
other studies have observed more general use of temporal, task-oriented and affective tags such
as toread and cool (Kipp, 2006; Kipp, 2007; Munk & Mork, 2007). For example, Kipp and
Campbell’s (2006) analysis of 18,904 unique Delicious tags found that 16% of all tags were
time- or task-related.
In a subsequent study, Heckner, Neubauer and Wolff (2008) examined the functionality of
tags in four tagging systems: Connotea, Delicious, Flickr and YouTube7. In line with their
previous findings, analysis of 4,012 tags (i.e., approximately 1000 tags from each system) found
that subject-related tags dominated: 94.2% of the tags in Connotea, 91.2% in Delicious, 76.4% in
Flickr, and 92.4% in YouTube were subject-related (p. 4). Dutta and Giunchiglia (2008)
identified similar categories of tag functionality, but their analysis of 5,181 Delicious tags
showed a slightly different distribution: 75% of the tags were identified as subject-related and
25% were identified as non-subject-related.
Veres (2006a) analyzed tags assigned to a random sample of 50 popular Delicious
bookmarks and compared them to the directory labels in DMOZ8 and Yahoo!9 with which the
bookmarked resources were associated. Each tag and directory category was assigned to one of
the goal-derived lexical categories developed by linguistic anthropologist Wierzbicka (1984):
taxonomic (e.g., parrot, flower, tree); functional (e.g., toy, vehicle, weapon); functional
collocation (e.g., furniture, cutlery, clothing); origin collocation (e.g., leftovers, refreshments,
groceries); and function with origin (e.g., vegetable, cereal, medicine) properties. Veres's
analysis found a clear difference between Delicious tags, which represented all of the goalderived categories, and the DMOZ and Yahoo! directory labels, which were predominantly

functional. Although Veres concludes that “folksonomies and the studied directories are involved
in similar categorizations” (p. 67), his results indicated that Delicious taggers “also
supplement[ed] the categories with descriptions” (p. 67; emphasis in original). He argued that
“taggers creat[ed] an ontology of categories and a list of property relations” (p. 67), a conclusion
that was subsequently propounded by Gruber (2007) (see also Kaipainen, Normak, Niglas,
Kippar, & Laanpere, 2008). Veres contends that “the way we characterize tag sets facilitates
their translation into ontologies which suggests a new methodology for automated ontology
extraction” (p. 68).
A number of studies of user tagging practices have claimed to find stabilization of tags
over time, sometimes interpreting this finding as an indication that users have reached consensus
on a tagging vocabulary (e.g., Lin et al., 2012; Lin, Beaudoin, Bui, & Desai, 2006; Munk &
Mork, 2007b). Golder and Huberman (2006) observed that tags for two popular URLs10 in
Delicious stabilized after approximately 100 bookmarks had been assigned. Kipp and Campbell
(2006) investigated tags assigned to one of Delicious’s most popular URLs11 and found
stabilization after the first seven tags. Ding, Jacob, Caverlee, Fried, and Zhang’s (2009) analyzed
approximately 12 million tags collected from Delicious, Flickr and YouTube and found
consensus in 85% of the top 20 Delicious tags assigned in 2006 and 2007, concluding that this
finding demonstrated the emergence of a shared social vocabulary. In contrast, George, Jacob,
Guo, Hajibayova and Chuttur (2008) did not observe convergence of the user-generated
vocabulary in their longitudinal study of 1,804,379 Delicious tags assigned to 7,845 unique
resources. They suggest that any observed stability is transitory and unrelated to convergence on
a shared vocabulary:

While it seems that there is a sometime [sic] appearance of stability in the application
of tagging vocabularies in [Delicious], further evaluation shows that these localized
events of stability are, in fact, transitory and fleeting and are not associated with
convergence of the vocabulary on a core set of tags common to all taggers. (p. 171)
A number of studies have explored the relationship between user-generated tags and
controlled vocabularies (e.g., Bates & Rowley, 2011; Daly & Ballantyne, 2009; Kakali &
Papatheodorou, 2011; Petek, 2012; Rafferty & Hidderley, 2007; Smith, 2007; Tennis, 2006).
Kipp (2006) examined a sample of 176 CiteULike12 bookmarks to determine whether assigned
tags and author keywords overlapped with INSPEC or Library Literature descriptors. Applying
Voorbij’s (1998) study, Kipp analyzed tags, keywords and descriptors according to the following
seven point scale: same (i.e., descriptors and keywords are the same or almost the same);
synonym (i.e., descriptors and keywords are synonyms and are related to USED FOR terms in a
thesaurus); broader term (i.e., keywords or tags are broader terms of descriptors); narrower term
(i.e., keywords or tags are narrower terms of descriptors); related term (i.e., keywords or tags are
related to descriptors); related (i.e., relationship between keywords or tags and descriptors is not
formalized in the thesaurus); not related (i.e., keywords and tags have no apparent relationship to
the descriptors) (p. 4). She found that one-third of user tags and author keywords (35%) were
related but not formally represented in the thesaurus. The most common thesaural relationships
that Kipp identified were hierarchical (22%), followed by equivalence (21%) and associative
(14%). These findings were supported in a subsequent study involving health and medical
resources (Kipp, 2007).
In a related study, Al-Khalifa and Davis (2006) explored how tags assigned by users varied
from descriptors assigned by human indexers and keywords generated by machines. They
concluded that user-generated tags were closer to the descriptors assigned by human indexers

(19.48% of overlap) than to machine-generated keywords (9.51% of overlap). However, in
contrast to Kipp's (2006) findings, they found that user-generated tags were less likely to fall into
equivalence relationships than hierarchical or associative thesaural relationships.
To determine if overlap occurred between user-generated vocabularies and controlled
vocabularies, Bruce (2008) examined tags and descriptors for journal articles that had been
bookmarked by CiteULike users and were also indexed in the Education Resources Information
Center (ERIC) database. Analysis of 3,176 unique CiteULike tags found that only 7.6 % (240
tags) matched ERIC descriptors. In a similar study, Lin, Beaudoin, Bui, and Desai (2006)
compared 540 Connotea tags, 1,034 Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) index terms, and 286
title-based automatically generated index terms for 45 PubMed resources. They found that 59
(11%) of the Connotea tags overlapped with MeSH terms and 102 (19%) overlapped with
automatically generated index terms. Lin et al. speculate that the relatively higher overlap
between user-generated tags and title-based index terms occurred because users assigned tags
based on titles. This is supported by Heckner et al. (2008), who found that 49% of tags assigned
to a resource matched a word appearing in the title of that resource. Although Lee and
Schleyer’s (2012) analysis of 76,968 CiteULike tags and 21,129 MeSH index terms assigned to
231,388 papers revealed little lexical overlap between two vocabularies, this finding can be
explained by the limitations of the study (e.g., restricting comparisons to tags assigned by at least
three taggers).
Spiteri (2007) compared 76 Delicious tags, 208 Furl13 tags and 229 Technorati tags against
the National Information Standard Organization (NISO) guidelines and found correlations
related to term structure: “the types of concepts expressed by the tags, the predominance of

single tags, the predominance of nouns, the use of recognized spelling, and the use of primarily
alphabetic characters” (p. 27). For example, tags representing the NISO category things were
predominant in all systems (i.e., 76% of Delicious tags, 82% of Furl tags, and 90% of Technorati
tags) while tags for activities (i.e., 12% of Delicious tags, 10% of Furl tags, and 4% of
Technorati tags) and properties (i.e., 8% of Delicious tags, 6% of Furl tags, and 4% of
Technorati tags) formed a distant second and third in importance (p. 18). However, usergenerated tags did not comply with NISO standards in that she found “inconsistent use of the
singular and plural form of count nouns” as well as “ambiguous tags in the form of homographs
and unqualified abbreviations or acronyms” (p. 21).
Yi and Chan (2009) investigated the relationship between user-generated vocabulary and
Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) based on word matching. A complete-word
comparison of 299 user-generated tags with 291,000 LCSH terms found that 182 tags (60.9%)
matched at least one subject heading in the subject authority file. A comparison of matched tags
to each node in the 28,136 LCSH sub-trees showed that about 96% of tags occurred in up to 67
different sub-trees and 4% occurred in from 68 to 160 sub-trees (p. 896). Rolla (2009) conducted
a similar study that compared LCSH subject headings and LibraryThing14 tags assigned to 45
titles and found that 75.6% of LibraryThing tags “brought out the same subject or concept [as the
LCSH subject headings], although often expressed in different terms” (p. 179). Echoing the
conclusions of previous studies (e.g., Munk & Mork, 2007a; Golder & Huberman, 2006), Rolla
contended that user-assigned tags “almost always include very general and broad subject terms”
(p. 179). He concludes that the “specific ways” in which tags and subject headings varied is
“instructive” (179), and, thus, “adding user tags to library catalogs could help improve subject
access to collections” (p. 179).

Comparative studies of user-generated tags and controlled vocabularies address one of
the central problems of information representation and organization: whether controlled
vocabularies or natural language terms more effectively represent the intellectual content of
resources (e.g., Buckland, 1999). Tennis (2006) contends that tagging is a “catalyst for
improvement and innovation in indexing” that “highlights the interstices of authorship,
intertextuality, and context in indexing, and asks us to fill in the gaps” (Conclusions section,
para. 1). However, it seems that the suggestion that user-generated vocabularies can complement
traditional systems of representation and organization is based, in large part, on matching usergenerated tags with controlled vocabularies. Thus, the question remains as to whether usergenerated vocabularies actually facilitate “findability” (Morville, 2005) and retrieval. Given the
vast number of web resources, the value of user-generated vocabularies should be studied
through the lens of findability.
A number of LIS studies have proposed further structural and functional development of
folksonomic systems or the extension of their application (e.g., Abel, Henze, Krause, & Kriesell,
2009c; Abel, Henze, & Krause, 2008d; Liu, Li, & Lv, 2009; Noh, Park, Yoon, Lee, & Park,
2009; Noll, Yeung, Gibbins, Meinel, & Shadbolt, 2009; Yeung, Gibbons, Shadbolt, 2009b). For
example, Pera, Lung, and Ng (2009) developed a library system (EnLibS) that can perform
similarity matches between keywords that were used to search in library catalogue and tags
assigned by LibraryThing users. De Meo, Quattrone, and Ursino (2009) have proposed
algorithms to identify similarity and degree of generalization of two tags and to create a
visualization of the hierarchical structure of related tags. Yeung, Gibbons, and Shadbolt (2009a)
investigated how the contexts in which individual tags were used could be revealed
automatically without consulting external resources. They developed a graph clustering

20

algorithm to analyze networks of tags and resources and discover groups of tags or resources
corresponding to the different meanings of an ambiguous tag. Abel et al. (2009a) introduced the
SocialHITS algorithm to adapt resource rankings to the user’s immediate context (p. 217): The
tag cloud of the resource a user has just visited is used as the context for a subsequent search and
resource rankings are adapted accordingly (p. 217). At this point, however, studies suggesting
further development and application of folksonomic systems do not intersect with traditional
library systems. Thus, even though traditional library systems and folksonomies share a number
of properties, more work is needed to understand the structural similarities and differences of
these two systems (Tennis & Jacob, 2008), and a more comprehensive understanding of the
practices associated with folksonomy creation could provide for effective reunion of the two
systems.
Several studies of online social tagging vocabularies have suggested that taggers may use
basic level terms to bookmark resources (e.g., Yoon, 2012). Although most of these studies lack
a formal definition of what a “basic level term is,” they are generally based on the assumption
that a taxonomic system contains basic level categories. For example, Golder and Huberman
(2006) speculate that “earlier tags in a bookmark represent basic levels, because they are not only
widespread in agreement, but are also the first terms that users thought of when tagging the
URLs in question” (p. 202), apparently echoing the idea that basic level terms are “cognitively
efficient” (Rosch et al., 1976; Tanaka & Taylor, 1991). However, Golder and Huberman
acknowledge that basic level terms may vary across users, observing that “different people may
consider terms at different levels of specificity to be most useful or appropriate for describing the
item in question” (p. 199). In their analysis of tags from Delicious, a bookmarking application
thought to be favored by taggers from the information technology (IT) field, Munk and Mork

21

(2007b) reiterate Golder and Huberman’s (2006) argument, suggesting that basic level terms are
the “most popular keywords” because they are “very general and may be said to belong to a
number of cognitive basic categories which many people working professionally in the IT field
will consider if asked to mention some IT terms off the top of their heads” (p. 121). They
identified the 245 most frequently used tags in their study, or 37.2% of their sample, as basic
level categories and argued that these tags were cognitively efficient because they were the
“shortest possible and most economical encoding[s] of a relevant category” that “everyone could
think of without giving it much thought” (p. 121). Based on their findings, they concluded that
the most popular tags used in Delicious represented the basic level of categorization: “[B]road
basic cultural content categories are predominant (such as: music, news, design), while broad
basic categories for everyone working professionally with IT are also frequent (such as:
programming, Linux, javascript, flash)” (p. 121).
Previous studies of basic level terms have suggested that domain knowledge may shift
the entry level from the basic level of categorization to the subordinate level (e.g., Tanaka &
Taylor, 1991; Jolicoeur, Gluck, & Kosslyn, 1984), and many of the the IT-related tags identified
as basic level terms by Monk and Mork appear to be subordinate terms, reflecting the IT
orientation of many Delicious users. Munk and Mork’s reference to “broad basic cultural content
categories” is also questionable because they offer no justification for their characterization of
terms such as “music”, “news” and “design” as basic level categories. Despite the claim that
their application of basic level category theory is based on Rosch's work (e.g., Rosch & Mervis,
1975; Rosch et al., 1976), Munk and Mork's conclusions are questionable and appear to be based
more on intuition than on evidence: They provide neither a clear definition of basic level

22

categories nor an explanation of how basic level categories were operationalized in their
research.
Yoon (2009) analyzed the semantic features of Flickr’s photo sharing and bookmarking site
to determine if user-generated tags could be used to develop a user-oriented and non-domain
specific thesaurus for images. The study found that 52% of unique terms represented generic
categories; 29% represented specific events, geographic locations or time; 4% were colorrelated; and 6% represented abstract categories (e.g., COLD, LAZINESS, LOVE). Based on
Rosch et al. (1976), Yoon’s analysis of generic and color-related tags indicated that Flickr users
generally employed basic level terms in these categories: 80.47% of 535 tags in the generic
category were identified as basic level terms; and color terms generally represented the 11 basic
level color categories identified by Berlin and Kay (1991) (i.e., BLACK, WHITE, GREY, RED,
YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, PINK, ORANGE, BROWN and PURPLE). Based on these
findings, Yoon suggests that the best approach for determining generic and color category
descriptors is to focus on terms at the basic level. Because she was unsuccessful in using the
hierarchical structure of the Thesaurus of Graphic Materials (TGM) to define category levels,
Yoon (2009) concludes that TGM is inappropriate for identifying superordinate, basic and
subordinate terms in the nine categories of objects used by Rosch et al. (1976) (i.e., MUSICAL
INSTRUMENT, FRUIT, TOOL, CLOTHING, FURNITURE, VEHICLE, TREE, FISH and
BIRD). She elected to identify basic level terms by examining subsumption relationships:
[In the] hierarchical structure of ‘Object-Furnishings-Furniture-Table-Dining
tables’ ‘Object,’ ‘Furnishings’ and ‘Furniture’ are classified as superordinate and
‘Table’ and ‘Dining tables’ are basic and subordinate levels, respectively. In the
case of an ‘Object-Food-Fruit-Apple’ hierarchy, the lowest-level word, ‘Apple’,
obviously satisfies features of the basic level, the upper three concepts belong to
[the] superordinate level, and this hierarchy does not include a subordinate level.
(p. 457)

23

Unfortunately, however, Yoon appears to have relied on her own intuitions about the hierarchical
structure of categories rather than defining operational metrics for discriminating between the
superordinate, subordinate and basic levels.
Other studies of user-generated vocabularies have also speculated about possible factors for
observed tagging patterns. For example, Marlow et al. (2006) point out that the design of tagging
systems and the affordances they offer users may affect the quality and the quantity of tags:
Systems such as Technorati allow users to tag only those resources which they have contributed
while systems such as Last.fm and Delicious support free tagging and allow anyone to explore
the tags previously assigned to a given resource, which may encourage users to imitate the
tagging patterns of others (e.g., Hammond et al., 2005).
Marlow et al. (2006) argue that social relationships may also affect a user's tagging
vocabulary. By pairing 2,500 randomly selected Flickr users with two other randomly chosen
individuals – one from the contact list of selected Flickr users and the other from the original
sample of 2,500 users – they found a larger overlap in common tags between users and their
contacts (p. 8). These findings are consonant with those of Fussell and Krauss (1989a, 1989b,
1992), who demonstrated that people who communicate with each other share greater common
ground (e.g., knowledge, beliefs, culture), which shapes their language use and comprehension.
However, Alsarhan’s (2013) experimental study of the effects of common ground on tag
assignment did not show statistically significant differences for either specificity or the number
of tags assigned.
Veres (2006b) argues that common ground, or shared knowledge, offers a “mental
architecture” or mental model that can influence tagging practices:
The mental architecture enforces the range of possible ontologies and
taxonomies that we can bring to bear on the understanding of our universe. All

24

humans share fundamental aspects of mental architecture and therefore
properties of possible taxonomies and folksonomies. Folksonomy, on this view,
becomes an invaluable source of data for studying the mental processes of naive
human classifiers. (p. 329)
Drawing on Bourdieu’s (1986) conceptualization of social and cultural capital as valuable assets
that can be acquired, accumulated, appropriated and exchanged like other physical capital, Lin
and Chen (2012) propose that social tagging is influenced by capital possession. Based on their
analysis of the tagging behavior of Delicious users, Lin and Chin found that “organizationoriented tagging” (p. 550) was influenced mainly by online and offline cultural capital: user
understanding of how social tagging works, the functionalities of the bookmarking system, and
user knowledge of information and communication technologies (p. 542). Golder and Huberman
(2006) also suggest that shared background, such as the shared IT background of many Delicious
users, may account for observations of stabilization in Delicious. Given Golder and Huberman’s
argument for the “widespread” use of basic level tags, it is possible that the stabilization of tags
may be due to a shared mental architecture that encourages user agreement on a vocabulary
comprised of basic level terms rather than reliance on basic level terms per se.
There has been much speculation about factors affecting user-generated vocabularies, but
few studies have actually investigated specific factors affecting the tagging practices of users.
Thus, questions about the factors that may influence user-generated vocabularies remain
unanswered, including: Does reliance on basic level categories underlie observations of
agreement in user-generated vocabularies? And do the intellectual content or particular
characteristics of the resource affect user assignment of tags?
Barsalou (2012) contends that categorization is central to processing both the structure and
the meaning of language. Furthermore, he (1987) proposes that how some “thing” is categorized
will vary across individuals because they use different characteristics to represent the same

25

category at different times and in different contexts. Tags assigned by users to represent the
content or characteristics of resources are best understood as “category labels” that make
manifest the individual’s understanding of her “encounters with the environment” (Jacob, p. 102,
1994) at a particular point in time or within a given context. Thus, tags embody the flexibility
and plasticity of the cognitive process of categorization (Jacob, 2004), and factors influencing
user-generated vocabularies should be analyzed through the lens of theories of categorization.

The Structure of Categories
Many of the distinctions individuals make in their daily lives reflect the mental ability of
humans to partition space and create categories by separating “things” from the context in which
they are embedded (Zerubavel, 1991). As Rosch (1978) argues that these categories are often
cultural formations that are encoded in a culture’s language at a particular point in time, and she
contends that the main principles of category formation are cognitive economy and the perceived
structure of the world. She reasons that cognitive economy is central to the primary functionality
of a category system: “[T]he task of category systems is to provide maximum information with
the least cognitive effort” (p. 28). Perceived world structure, in contrast, deals with the nature of
information: the “perceived world comes as structured information rather than as arbitrary or
unpredictable attributes” (p. 28). But how are categories formed? And why are some categories
well-defined while others are fuzzy? Although these questions have been studied for decades,
there are still no definite answers.
The classical theory of categorization, the dominant theory of category representation until
the 1970s, is based on the notion that a category is determined by a set of defining criteria.

26

According to Smith and Medin (1981, p. 25), there are three assumptions supporting the classical
view:
1. Summary representation;
2. Necessary and sufficient features; and
3. Nesting of features (i.e., inheritance of defining features).
The assumption of a summary representation mandates that a single definition applies to all
members of a category. Because all category members must exemplify the category definition,
all of the category members are equally representative and none of them can be more or less
representative (or typical) of the category than any other. Thus, according to the classical theory,
a robin, a parrot and an ostrich would be equally representative of the category BIRD.
The assumption of necessary and sufficient features holds that the defining features of a
category are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for membership in that category: Each
entity must display the complete set of features (i.e., the category’s intension) to be a member of
a category; and any entity that displays the full set of defining features must be granted
membership (i.e., the category’s extension). For instance, if the category BIRD is defined by the
features HAS WINGS, FLIES, and HAS FEATHERS, then any entity that exhibits these features must
be a member of the category BIRD. It follows that the assumption of necessary and sufficient
features entails that natural categories are never disjunctive.
The third assumption implies that if the category X is a subset of the category Y, the
defining features of Y are inherited by X (Smith & Medin, 1981). For instance, the defining
features of BIRD (i.e., HAS WINGS, FLIES, and HAS FEATHERS) must be exhibited by the category
ROBIN because ROBIN is a subordinate of the category BIRD.

27

There have been various criticisms of the classical view, including the inability of
individuals to identify defining features and the failure of the classical theory to account both for
typicality effects and for problems of ignorance and error in defining categories (e.g., Laurence
& Margolis, 1999; Murphy, 2002). One of the strongest arguments against the classical view is
the inability of subjects to identify the defining features of a category (Mervis & Rosch, 1981;
Murphy & Medin, 1999). In this regard, Wittgenstein’s well-known example of the category
GAMES exemplifies the resistance of ordinary categories to definition (Laurence & Margolis,
1999). Wittgenstein (1953/1963) argued:
Consider for example the proceedings that we call “games”. I mean board-games,
card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all?
– Don’t say: There must be something common, or they would not be called
‘games’” – but look and see whether there is anything common at all. (p. 31)
But Smith and Medin (1981) contend that there are many categories that do not have defining
features and that Wittgenstein’s argument is “nothing like a principled disproof of the classical
view; it is instead an empirical argument about the observed rate of progress of a theoretical
approach to concepts” (p. 31). They argue that “we have been looking for the wrong kind of
defining features – perceptual ones that are likely to be part of an identification procedure –
when we should have been seeking abstract, relational, or functional features that may well make
up the core of many concepts” (p. 30).
The nesting structure or “vertical dimension” (Rosch, 1978) of categories represents the set
inclusion relation between a superordinate and a subordinate category: between the superordinate
category ANIMAL and the subordinate category CANARY. Figure 3 illustrates that the
relationships (i.e., arrows) between categories (i.e., nodes) are transitive is-a relationships: For
example, if CANARY is a member of the category BIRD and BIRD is a subset of ANIMAL,
then CANARY is a member of the category ANIMAL (Collins & Quillian, 1969; Murphy,

28

2002). And, because the category BIRD is a subset of the category ANIMAL, the definition of
BIRD inherits the defining features of the superordinate category: Features of the category
ANIMAL (e.g., HAS SKIN, CAN MOVE AROUND, EATS, BREATHES) must apply to the category
BIRD and, by extension, to its subordinate category CANARY.

Figure 3. Illustration of the Collins and Quillian’s hypothetical memory structure for a 3-level
hierarchy. (Adapted from Collins & Quillian, 1969, p. 241).
	  

Based on the is-a relationship inherent in the vertical dimension of hierarchical structures
and assumed by classical theory of categories, Collins and Quillian (1969; Collins & Loftus,
1975) put forward the spreading-activation theory of semantic processing. This theory attempted
to explain how human memory functions to make predictions and retrieve information. For
example, in order to decide whether the statement “A canary can sing” is true activation starts at
the node CANARY in Figure 3 and retrieves all features stored with that node (e.g., CAN SING, IS
YELLOW).

To test the statement “A canary has wings” requires moving up the hierarchy to the

node BIRD to retrieve the feature “HAS WINGS.” Thus, semantic processing involves “activation

29

[that] constantly expands, first to all the nodes linked to the first node, then to all the nodes
linked to each of these nodes, and so on” (Collins & Loftus, 1975, p. 408).
Although the nodes in Figure 3 correspond to words, the definition of each category
represents a network of meanings. However, as Rogers and Patterson (2007) have noted, the
simple appeal of the spreading-activation theory “gets complicated when the stimuli to be
comprehended are perceptual representations of objects rather than words because it is less clear
which node in the network should be activated by a given stimulus” (p. 465). For example,
because CANARY is a member of both the BIRD and ANIMAL categories, it is unclear which
category is activated by a perceptual representation of CANARY. Rogers and Patterson contend
that to answer this question requires an introduction of an additional mechanism, external to the
processing hierarchy, which would determine appropriate assignment of a perceptual stimulus to
the nodes in the hierarchy (p. 465): “[A]ctivation of an initial node is accomplished by a
perceptual categorization mechanism, separate from the semantic network itself and providing
the means for visual stimuli to access the propositional information stored there” (p. 465).
In the spreading-activation theory of semantic processing, the hierarchical model
constitutes a primary assumption as to how categories are to be processed, but this assumption
has been challenged by several experimental studies, including those of Osherson, Smith, Wilkie,
López and Shafir (1990) and Sloman (1998). Sloman (1998) investigated the validity of the
spreading-activation theory by testing subjects on simple logical inferences. In one study, pairs
of arguments with identical premises but different conclusions were used to test the notion of
inheritance. Participants were asked to select an argument in which the conclusion represented a
proper subset of the premise category. Sloman’s experiments demonstrated that subjects applied
the principle of category inheritance inconsistently. Moreover, subjects failed to apply the rule

30

when categories were universally quantified unambiguously, such as “All plants are susceptible
to thrips, therefore, all roses are susceptible to thrips.” Sloman concludes that his findings
“clearly rule out models that assume strict class inclusion hierarchies” (p. 27), arguing that
“Inclusion relations are part of the set of rules that we can apply given the right conditions; not
the set of relations that comprise memory structure” (p. 28). He proposes that:
Inclusion similarity and premise specificity phenomena would follow from the
assumptions that (i) the likelihood that instances of the category come to mind is
proportional to their typicality; (ii) no instance always comes to mind; and (iii) the
probability assigned to the conclusion is a function of the typicality in the
conclusion category of those instances brought to mind by the premise. (p. 27)
The classical view has also been challenged by experimental findings regarding defining
features, typicality effects, determinants of typicality, and application of non-necessary features.
One of the earliest studies to demonstrate problems with the assumption of defining features was
conducted by Clark Hull in the 1920s (as cited in Bruner, Goodnow, & Austin, 1999). As
described in Murphy (2002), Hull used novel visual forms to “predict” what features would
occur in all instances of a category because, for many categories of objects, the defining features
were functional. Thus, Hull’s study of the child’s discovery of meaning in the word dog failed to
specify defining features of the category dog for the child:
At length the time arrives when the child has a ‘meaning’ for the word dog. Upon
examination this meaning is found to be actually a characteristic more or less
common to all dogs and not common to cats, dolls and ‘teddy-bears.’ (Hull, 1920,
p. 6, as cited in Murphy, 2002, p. 13)
The findings of Rosch (1973; Rosch & Mervis, 1975) further undermined the assumption that all
category members were equally representative. In her early studies on color (Heider, 1971;
Heider, 1972), Rosch observed young children’s preferences for best examples of colors or focal
colors, identified by Berlin and Kay (1969) (i.e., RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, PINK,
ORANGE, BROWN, PURPLE), over non-focal colors (i.e., internominal colors, which were

31

colors from the central regions of the innominate areas, and boundary colors, which were from
the parts of the innominate areas which bordered on the focal areas and received no choices of
best example of a basic color term in Berlin and Kay’s sample) in a study of color name
development (Heider, 1971). She found that focal colors that were most exemplary, most
linguistically codable, and most easily remembered. Her study of the color categorization patterns
of the Dani language speakers of New Guinea (Rosch, 1973) supported her earlier findings: Even
though Dani color terms were restricted to two basic colors – mili (dark colors) and mola (light
colors) – the study demonstrated that Dani subjects were able to learn names for the “presumed
natural prototypes” (p. 348) or central tendencies of the categories faster than for other stimuli
even though the natural prototypes were not the central members of categories and that they
chose the “natural prototype as the most typical member of the category even when it was
actually peripheral” (p. 348).
In an extended study of categories ranging from colors to physical objects, Rosch and
Mervis (1975) demonstrated that the internal structure of categories was comprised of prototypes
or “clearest cases [and] best examples of the category” (p. 574). These findings led to the
introduction of a new view of categorization known as prototype theory (e.g., Medin,
Wattenmaker & Hampson, 1987; Smith, 1990).
Rosch’s notion of category prototypes was closely aligned to Wittgenstein’s notion of
family resemblance. Indeed, Rosch and Mervis (1975) argue that prototypes provide “empirical
confirmation of Wittgenstein’s (1953/1963) argument that formal criteria are neither a logical
nor psychological necessity; the categorical relationship in categories which do not appear to
posses criterial attributes … can be understood in terms of the principle of family resemblance”
(p. 603). In other words, Rosch argues that a category is not governed by definitions but rather

32

by a “complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall
similarities, sometimes similarities of detail” (Wittgenstein, 1953/1963, p. 32). For Rosch, as for
Wittgenstein, family resemblance is a “thread twist[ed] fibre on fibre” and the “strength of the
thread does not reside in the fact that some one fibre runs through the whole thread – namely the
continuous overlapping of those fibres” (Wittgenstein, 1953/1963, p. 32).
In their 1975 study, Rosch and Mervis asked subjects to list the attributes of superordinate
categories, such as FURNITURE, and their subordinate categories (e.g., CHAIR, VASE) and to
assign typicality ratings, on a 7-point scale, to signify the extent to which an instance represented
their idea or image of the meaning of the category name. Each listed attribute was assigned a
score (from 1 to 20) to represent the number of items in the category credited with that feature.
Thus, each feature was weighted in accordance with the number of items in the category
possessing it. They then measured the family resemblance of each category by the sum of the
weighting scores of each of the features listed for that item. However, this measurement
possessed a potential distortion: each additional item with which an attribute was credited added
an equal increase of family resemblance. In order to avoid this distortion, a second measure was
derived: each attribute was weighted with the natural logarithm of the raw score representing the
number of items in the category credited with that feature, and the second measure of family
resemblance consisted of the sum of the natural logarithms of the scores of each of the attributes
listed for an item (p. 580). The study demonstrated a high correlation between the computation
of family resemblance for a category and the typicality ratings assigned by subjects. Rosch and
Mervis subsequently conducted a similar experiment in which they asked subjects to assign
visually presented strings of letters to artificial categories. The results demonstrated that, the
higher the family resemblance, the faster a string was learned and categorized and the higher the

33

typicality rating assigned by subjects. Overall, the experiment using artificial categories showed
typicality effects similar to those found in the experiments using natural categories.
Rosch and Mervis’s (1975) findings supported their hypothesis that the “members of
categories which are considered most prototypical are those with most attributes in common with
other members of the category and least attributes in common with other categories” (p. 573). In
contrast to the classical view, which required that an entity demonstrate the complete set of
necessary and sufficient features for category membership, the prototype view postulates that
category membership is contingent on satisfying a sufficient number of features, where some the
features might be more typical than others. For example, if the category BIRD is defined by the
features HAS WINGS, LAYS EGGS, FLIES, and NESTS IN TREES, then, on the prototype view, the
category ROBIN is a more typical member of the superordinate category BIRD than OSTRICH
because ROBIN has all of the listed features: robins have wings, lay eggs, fly, and nest in trees.
Even though the category OSTRICH does not have all of the “typical” BIRD features, it has
enough for membership in the category BIRD rather than membership in some other category
such as DOG.
Although the prototype view is relatively immune to some of the difficulties of the classical
view and can account for a wide variety of empirical data, several studies have questioned both
the scope and the interpretation of the prototype theory (Laurence & Margolis, 1999). One of the
more critical assessments of the prototype view was that of Armstrong, Gleitman and Gleitman
(1983). In their study of typicality effects in well-defined categories, Armstrong et al. adapted
the experimental design of Rosch and Mervis’s 1975 study and applied it to well-defined and
thus “non-prototypical” categories such as ODD NUMBER and EVEN NUMBER. Their study
indicated that subjects were able to rank well-defined instances for “goodness” of category

34

representation. For example, subjects judged 3 a better instance of ODD NUMBER than 501 and
mother a better instance of FEMALE than comedienne (p. 277). The study also demonstrated a
correlation between typicality and speed and accuracy of categorization. For example, subjects
responded to “An orange is a fruit” faster than to “A coconut is a fruit”; and they produced a
response for “18 is an even number” faster than for “22 is an even number” (p. 284). Armstrong
et al. concluded that, if members of well-defined categories could be ranked according to
typicality, then the notion of typicality effects should not be definitive of categories: If “fruit and
plane geometry figures have different structures, a paradigm that cannot distinguish between
responses to them is not revealing about the structure of concepts” (p. 280). In response to this
criticism, Lakoff (1983) suggests that Armstrong et al.’s “effects = structure” interpretation of
the prototype theory lacks coherence:
[S]uch prototype effects for numbers would not correspond to degrees of
membership. All numbers are equal with respect to membership in the category
number. But with respect to the various models we use to comprehend numbers,
certain numbers have privileged status. (p. 150)
While Armstrong, Gleitman, and Gleitman’s study is frequently cited as empirical
evidence supporting the classical theory of categories (e.g., Medin & Smith, 1984), it
fails to address one of the major criticisms of the classical theory of categories: That
membership within a category is not determined by a set of defining features that are
individually necessary and jointly sufficient for category membership (Jacob, 1991).
It is worth noting that Rosch (1973b) did not observe effects of typicality for categories like
ACTION. On the basis of Rosch’s findings, D’Andrade (1990) hypothesized that categorization
occurred by defining similarity distances between the object to be categorized and various
prototypes; but he added that the idea of situating an “object in the category belonging to the
closest prototype has encountered objections because there is evidence that in some cases a

35

prototype will be most similar to a particular [instance] that is not categorized under the same
term as the prototype” (p. 803). For example, subjects tend to categorize a paper cup like a
GLASS rather than a CUP even though they said that a paper cup was a kind of CUP
(D’Andrade, 1990).
Barsalou (1985) equates typicality with graded structure in categories. Barsalou (1985)
argues that graded structure “refers to this continuum of category representativeness, beginning
with the most representative members of a category and continuing through its atypical members
to those nonmembers least similar to category members” (pp. 629-630); and he contends that
graded structure is an important factor in predicting a number of categorization tasks:
identifying how long it takes to categorize an entity as a member of category, the frequency with
which people generate members of categories, and how easily people learn categories and make
category decisions (Barsalou, 1987, p. 103). Barsalou (1985) also argues that graded structure
within categories do not remain stable across situations but can shift substantially with changes
in context, including linguistic contexts. In contrast to the earlier studies of Rosch and Mervis
(1975) and Armstrong et al. (1983), Barsalou found relatively low levels of between-subject
agreement on typicality: Rosch and Mervis (1975) had reported over 90% agreement between
subjects, but, in studying more than 20 groups of subjects over an eight-year period, Barsalou
found that between-subject agreement averaged only 30% to 60% (1987, p. 108). For Barsalou,
this finding clearly indicates both that “people differ substantially in how they perceive the
graded structure of a given category” and that “graded structure [across individuals] is relatively
unstable” (p. 109). Furthermore, Barsalou (1985, 1987) also observed substantial instability of
graded structure within subjects over time:
[I]n terms of percent variance accounted for, subjects’ initial judgments accounted
for around 85 percent of the variance in their judgments an hour later, with this

36

value dropping to around 75 percent after a day, and to around 65 percent after a
week. (Barsalou, 1987, p. 112)
Rips (1989) found that subjects considered both similarity and variability when undertaking
categorization tasks. He provided subjects with a description of an object indicating a value on
only a single dimension, such as diameter, and asked them to identify which of two categories
the object was related to one of which was relatively fixed on the dimension while the other was
relatively variable. For example, one object was described as “three inches in diameter” and the
possible categories were PIZZA and QUARTER. Subjects appeared to take into consideration
the fixed size of a quarter and concluded that the object was more likely to be a pizza than a
quarter. Rips concluded that, “even if we grant that people have a stable sense of resemblance or
similarity and even if we can give this sense a correct psychological description, similarity still
will not be either necessary or sufficient for dealing with all object categories” (p. 23). The
findings of Rips's study provide support for Smith’s (1990) suggestion that, when people
encounter problems of categorization, they tend to use “deduction-type modes that involve
accessing additional beliefs” (p. 518).
Laurence and Margolis (1999) have identified four major criticisms of the prototype view:
typicality effects, given that even well-defined categories can exhibit typicality effects; ignorance
and error of subjects, which is as much a problem for the prototype theory as it is for the classical
theory; lack of established prototypes for a category; and lack of an adequate account of category
compositionality, in that the prototypes of complex categories are not generally a function of the
prototypes of constituent categories (p. 43). In light of these criticisms of the prototype theory,
Fodor (1981) argues that a number of categories are hard to define in terms of typicality:
There may be prototypical cities (London, Athens, Rome, New York); there may
even be prototypical American cities (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles), but
there are surely no prototypical American cities situated on the East Coast just a

37

little south of Tennessee. Similarly, there may be prototypical grandmothers
(Mary Worth) and there may be prototypical properties of grandmothers (good,
old Mary Worth). But there are surely no prototypical properties of, say,
Chaucer’s grandmothers, and there are no prototypical properties of grandmothers
most of whose grandchildren are married to dentists. (pp. 296-297)
And Barsalou (1991) introduces yet another problem for the prototype theory: For goal-derived
categories such as THINGS TO TAKE ON A CAMPING TRIP, the basis for typicality effects is
not a prototype but similarity to an ideal. Thus, for example, for the category of THINGS TO
EAT WHILE ON A DIET, typicality is determined by how closely an entity corresponds to the
ideal of zero calories.
The prototype view appears to be more relevant for natural categories like ANIMAL,
TREE and CLOTHING than for intricate or abstract categories like BELIEF and JUSTICE
(Osherson & Smith, 1999). It is worth noting that Rosch (1978) contends that, while the
“pervasiveness of prototypes in real-world categories and of prototypicality as a variable
indicates that prototypes must have some place in psychological theories of representation,
processing, and learning … [but] prototypes themselves do not constitute any particular model of
processes, representations, or learning” (p. 40).
Against both to the classical and the prototype theory of categorization, Medin and Schaffer‘s
(1978) have proposed the exemplar theory. The exemplar theory of category structure holds that
a category is represented by an exemplar rather than by any abstract definition or prototype.
However, the term exemplar is sometimes used ambiguously to refer either to any instance of a
category or to a particular instance that defines the category itself. For example, the exemplar of
the category CLOTHING could be either favorite pair of faded blue jeans or the subset of
CLOTHING corresponding to BLUE JEANS in general (Smith & Medin, 1981, p. 143). Smith
and Medin argue that a category is the representation of its exemplar(s), whereas the features of

38

the category are a summary of the exemplar’s features. As indicated in Figure 4, the exemplar(s)
can be represented either by category members (e.g., ROBIN, BLUE JAY, SPARROW) or by a specific
instance of the category (e.g., Fluffy). Thus, a category can be represented either by the
exemplar(s), by a description of its relevant features of the exemplar(s), or by both. If the
exemplar is an instance, such as Fluffy, it represents a feature description of the category.
Obviously Smith and Medin’s definition of exemplar relies on the notion of a summary
representation assumed by the classical view. However, it is worth noting that studies
investigating exemplars generally represent an exemplar as a remembered item.

Experimental studies investigating exemplars are generally based on the assumption that,
by “manipulating how similar an item is to a remembered exemplar … one may be able to
influence which category subjects think the item is in” (Murphy, 2002, p. 76). This assumption
reflects Brooks’s (1987) contention that remembering is triggered by the similarity of an object
to a learned exemplar and serves as a cue for membership in the category. Medin and Schaffer

39

(1978) have argued that categorization judgments are “based on the retrieval of stored exemplar
information, that this retrieval process is directly a function of the similarity of the probe item to
the stored exemplars, and that similarity derives from an interactive combination of component
cue dimensions” (p. 214). They suggest a multiplicative rule whereby a “pattern will be
classified more efficiently if it is highly similar to one pattern (differing in only one dimension)
and has low similarity to a second (differing in three dimensions) than if it has medium similarity
(differing in two dimensions) to two patterns in its category” (p. 212). In order to calculate
similarity, the mismatch of each feature is assigned a number between 0 and 1: Matching
features were assigned 1 and mismatched features were assigned a number less than 1, with 0
representing the greatest possible mismatch. Thus the multiplicative rule combined the
importance and the difference of a dimension in one score. For example, even though
mannequins resemble human beings, the effects of various dimensions of similarity can be
overcome by a dimension of difference such as animacy (p. 212). Overall, a new item that is
“similar to one member but dissimilar from another member of a category would be assigned to
that category with greater ease than a new item moderately similar to both category members”
(p. 233).
In a series of experimental studies, Brooks and his colleagues provided strong evidence
for the use of exemplars in categorization. Brooks, Norman, and Allen (1991) studied a group of
medical residents and general practitioners. They found that diagnosis of skin disorders was
facilitated by similar cases seen within the same context. In the first stage of the experiment,
subjects were asked to assess the typicality of slides of dermatological lesions and then to rate
the plausibility of each of three different diagnoses presented with each slide. Examples were
comprised of previously studied items, superficially similar items, and items that were not

40

superficially similar instances of studied items. Brooks et al. found that subjects were
considerably more accurate in categorizing slides that had been studied and those that were
similar to studied ones; and they concluded that exemplars “can and do influence diagnosis in
dermatology” (p. 284) by focusing attention on the similarity between known and learned
exemplars. However, the findings of Brooks et al. also demonstrated a typicality effect and could
therefore be interpreted through the prism of prototype theory.
One of the main limitations of the exemplar theory is assumption of long-lasting memories
for exemplars. Murphy (2002) expresses doubt that people have an explicit memory for
“uninteresting” exemplars, such as dot patterns; but he argues that, because “people do
remember single episodes or objects for very long periods of time when they are particularly
compelling, unusual, or interesting,” it is possible that “some form of nonpropositional skilllearning is accounting for this kind of [long-term] exemplar effect” (p. 91). Medin and Smith
(1984) also note that the exemplar theory does not offer a satisfactory statement of what
constitutes a category and lacks any constraints on what properties can be used to represent
categories.
Since the late 1980s, some researchers have advanced an approach in which “cognition
generally is assimilated to scientific reasoning” (Laurence & Margolis, 1999, p. 43). This view
has been dubbed the knowledge-based or theory-based view of category structure (Medin, 1989;
Murphy, 2002). According to the knowledge-based view, “[categories] are representations whose
structure consists in their relations to other … [categories] as specified by a mental theory”
(Laurence & Margolis, 1999, p. 47). In other words, the process of category identification is
tightly linked to our understanding and knowledge of the world or, in Murphy and Medin’s
(1999) terms, to our mental theories about the world. The knowledge-based view represents a

41

major shift toward Medin and Ortony’s (1989) psychological essentialism, which assumes that
categories are not simple representations of “surface features” but reflect “relation[s] between
surface similarity and deeper properties” (p. 180). For example, even though the categories
MALE and FEMALE are genetically determined, we rely on features such as CLOTHING, FACIAL
HAIR

and HEIGHT to determine whether someone is male or female (Medin, 1989). Laurence and

Margolis (1999) contemplate that “by holding that … [categories] are individuated by their roles
in mental theories, theory-theorists can tie their account of … [categories] to a realistic theory of
categorization – one that respects people’s tendency toward essentialist thinking” (p. 47).
A number of studies have investigated how knowledge affects the process of category
identification and learning (e.g., Kaplan & Murphy, 2000; Rehder & Hastie, 2001; Murphy &
Allopenna, 1994; Wattenmaker, Dewey, Murphy, & Medin, 1986). Lin and Murphy (1997)
examined the effects of knowledge on the speed of categorization for instances of well-learned
categories. In a series of four experiments, subjects learned a set of novel categories and then
were asked to categorize a new set of stimuli that were either consistent or inconsistent with the
background knowledge provided for the novel categories. The study demonstrated that a
subject’s knowledge about the features of a novel category affected her responses to new objects:
If a new object lacked features that background knowledge had highlighted as a feature of a
novel category, subjects generally did not consider the object a member of that category.
Pazzani (1991) studied the influence of prior causal knowledge on the rate of learning and
on category formation. Stimuli used in the experiment were photographs of a person doing
something with a balloon and varied in terms of the color of the balloon (YELLOW or PURPLE),
the size of the balloon (SMALL or LARGE), the age of the person (CHILD or ADULT), and the action
of the person (STRETCHING THE BALLOON or DIPPING THE BALLOON IN WATER). Pazzani compared

42

conjunctive categories (e.g., SIZE = SMALL and COLOR = YELLOW) and disjunctive categories
(e.g., AGE = ADULT or ACTION = STRETCHING THE BALLOON) formed according to the
following rules: “the color must be yellow AND the balloon must be small” or “the person must
be an adult OR the action must be stretching the balloon” (p. 417). In the first experiment, one
group of subjects performed a standard category acquisition task based on whether a stimulus
was an example of the category ALPHA. Another group of subjects used the same stimulus, but
were asked to identify whether the balloon would inflate when the person blew into it. Pazzani
hypothesized that in the inflate condition, the subject's prior knowledge about inflating balloons
would aid in application of the disjunctive rule. Pazzani found that instructions for the category
ALPHA (i.e., “predict whether the page is an example of an ‘alpha’”) demonstrated the usual
pattern of a conjunctive category being easier to learn. On the other hand, the inflate instructions
(i.e., “predict whether the balloon will be inflated”) were helpful in learning disjunctive
categories. Pazzani concluded that the results of this study “presented experimental evidence that
prior knowledge influences the ease of concept acquisition and biases the selection of hypotheses
in human learners” (p. 430).
Palmeri and Blalock (2000) examined how background knowledge affects perceptual
categorization by manipulating both the meaningfulness of labels associated with categories and
the amount of time provided to make a category decision. Subjects learned two categories of
children's drawings that were given either a meaningless label (e.g., drawings by children from
Group 1 or drawings by children from Group 2) or a meaningful label (e.g., drawings by
‘creative’ children or drawings by ‘non-creative’ children). One group of subjects was provided
unlimited time to respond, while another was asked to respond quickly. Palmeri and Blalock
hypothesized that, if the category labels had no influence on how subjects learned the categories,

43

there should be no difference in the speed of category decision between the two groups. Results
indicated that responses for subjects asked to respond quickly demonstrated a relatively larger
knowledge effect on categorization decisions of those subjects given meaningless labels but had
relatively little effect on categorization decisions by subjects given meaningful labels. Palmeri
and Blalock argued that the results suggested some forms of background knowledge can exert an
influence at relatively early stages in the time-course of a categorization decision (p. B45).
Overall, studies addressing the knowledge-based approach to categories have generally
demonstrated that prior knowledge can affect category learning, either indirectly by changing the
representation before categorization or directly by activating knowledge during categorization
(Boltanski & Thévenot, 1983; Murphy, 2002). However, Murphy argues that studies should go
beyond simple investigation of whether knowledge affects categorization and explore if
knowledge simultaneously facilitates category learning and aids learning of knowledge-related
features.
Nevertheless, the knowledge-based approach to category structure has its own challenges
for theorizing about categories. One major problem is the individual’s possible ignorance or
incorrect understanding of a mental theory for every category. Another problem involves
consistency in representation of a category following changes in an individual’s mental theory
“explaining” a category (Laurence & Margolis, 1999).
None of the major views of category representation provides a coherent theoretical
framework for understanding the actual process of categorization. Although the classical view of
categories has been challenged by experimental findings, there is currently no satisfactory
substitute that can explain how people navigate in the world and create “islands of meaning”
(Zerubavel, 1993, p. 5).

44

Basic Level Categories
Drawing inspiration from Brown’s (1958) observations and from Wittgenstein’s
(1953/1963) discussions of language use, Rosch and her colleagues (Rosch & Mervis, 1975;
Rosch et al., 1976) developed the theory of basic level categories. Rosch (1978) argued that, in
the perceived world, information-rich bundles of perceptual and functional attributes form
natural discontinuities and that basic cuts in categorization were made at these discontinuities (p.
31). Working from these assumptions, Rosch et al. (1976; Rosch, 1978) identified basic level
categories as the most inclusive categories because they “carry the most information, possess the
highest cue validity, and are, thus, the most differentiated from one another” (Rosch et al., 1976,
p. 383). According to Rosch and Mervis (1975):
Basic objects (for example, chair, car) are the most inclusive level of abstraction
at which categories can mirror the correlational structure … of the environment
and the most inclusive level at which there can be many attributes common to all
or most members of the categories. (p. 586)
Thus basic level categories provide a balance between informativeness and cognitive economy.
Experimental studies have suggested that superordinate categories lack informativeness
because they are represented by only a few attributes and that subordinate categories lack
cognitive economy because they are represented by too many attributes (Rosch & Mervis, 1975).
According to Rosch and Mervis
The correlational structure of the environment, modified by selective ignorance
and exaggeration of the attributes and structure of that environment, are mirrored
in categorization systems. Segmentation of experience occurs to form basic levels
which maximize the differentiability of categories. For categories of concrete
objects, basic objects are the most general classes at which attributes are
predictable, objects of the class are used in the same way, objects can be readily
identified by shape, and at which classes can be imaged. (1975, p. 435)

45

The arguments of Rosch and Mervis are supported by a substantial body of research indicating
that basic level categories are the first categories formed during perception of the environment,
the first categories learned by children, and the categories most used in language.
In a seminal paper, Jolicoeur, Gluck and Kosslyn (1984) suggest that there is a level of
nodes in the spreading-activation model that serves as an “entry point level” into the hierarchy.
They argue that an “object has one particular level at which contact is made first with semantic
memory” (p. 272); and they note that, for many entities, the “entry point level” may be the basic
level of categorization. However, this may not be the case for all entities: “If an object is a very
distinctive or atypical exemplar of a basic-level category, then that object may have its own entry
point into semantic memory defined at the subordinate level” (p. 272). They conclude that the
notion of entry point must be understood as an “attribute of individual exemplars rather than an
attribute of categories” (p. 272).
Mack, Wong, Gauthier, Tanaka, and Palmeri (2009) suggest a “straightforward” model of
basic-level advantage and entry-level shift. In their basic level advantage model, objects from
expert categories or atypical objects are categorized first at the subordinate level without being
processed at the basic level. In the model of entry-level shift, novel categories are categorized
first at the basic level and then at a more subordinate (or superordinate) level (see Figure 5).
Mack et al. argue that “basic-level categorization is faster than subordinate-level identification
because basic-level categorization occurs before subordinate-level identification begins – fastest
means first” (p. 1962). They conclude that, according to this account, “learning about expert
categories and atypical objects creates special-purpose machinery for rapidly recognizing
subordinate categories that bypasses an initial basic-level stage of processing” (p. 1962).

Early research on basic level categories
Roger Brown is often identified as the first researcher to have theorized the existence of a
basic level of categorization (e.g., Lakoff, 1986; Murphy 2002). In his seminal article, Brown
(1958) describes how parents teach their children to name and categorize objects and argues that
the “name of a thing, the one that tells what it ‘really’ is, is the name that constitutes the referent
as it needs to be constituted for most purposes” (p. 17):
The dime in my pocket is not only a dime. It is also money, a metal object, a thing,
and, moving to subordinates, it is a 1952 dime, in fact a particular 1952 dime with
a unique pattern of scratches, discolorations, and smooth places. When such an
object is named for a very young child how is it called? It may be named money
or dime but probably not metal object, thing, 1952 dime, or particular 1952 dime.
The dog out on the lawn is not only a dog but is also a boxer, a quadruped, an
animate being; it is the landlord's dog, named Prince. How will it be identified
for a child? Sometimes it will be called a dog, sometimes Prince, less often a
boxer, and almost never a quadruped, or animate being.” (1958, p. 14; emphasis
in original)

47

Brown contends that the names of things as they really are serve as true representations of the
referent while other names given to the object are “recategorizations” that represent “acts of
imagination” (p. 17). It is Brown’s notion of the names of things as they are that foreshadows
Rosch’s theory of basic level categories.
In a series of experimental studies, Rosch et al. (1976) observed that there was a particular
level in a category hierarchy where members of the category possessed significant numbers of
attributes in common, shared minimal characteristics with members of other categories at the
same level, had similar motor programs governing their interaction with individuals, and could
be generally identified by an average shape. She identified this level in a category hierarchy as
the basic level. Furthermore, Rosch’s study of the structure of categories demonstrated that these
basic level categories were
[the] most inclusive categories for which a concrete image of the category as a
whole can be formed, … the first categorizations made during perception of the
environment, … the earliest categories sorted and earliest named by children, and
… the categories most codable, most coded, and most necessary in language. (p.
382)
The pervasiveness of basic level terms had been observed by Rosch both in her early study of
color categorization (Heider, 1971) and in her cross-cultural study of the color naming practices
of speakers of Dani (Heider, 1972). These early observations of the predominance of basic level
terms evolved into Rosch's theories of prototypes and basic level categories.
The work of Berlin and his colleagues also contributed to the early research on basic level
categories (Lakoff, 1986). Berlin, Breedlove, and Raven (1974) studied how Tzeltal speakers
living in Tenejapa, Mexico, classified plants. They reported that Tzeltal speakers tended to name
plants at the level of genus (e.g., oak) rather than species (e.g., live oak). Berlin (1978) contends
that, “psychologically, generic taxa are highly salient and are the first terms encountered in

48

ethnobiological inquiry, presumably because they refer to the most commonly used, every-day
categories of folk biological knowledge” (p. 17). He also theorizes that the “generic rank
[provides] the core of the entire folk biological taxonomy” and that it is at this level that “plants
and animals appear perceptually most distinct to the human classifier” (p. 24).
To investigate how basic level terms were used, Rosch et al. (1976) asked subjects to list
attributes belonging to three levels of categorization (i.e., the superordinate, basic, and
subordinate levels) for nine categories: MUSICAL INSTRUMENT, FRUIT, TOOL,
CLOTHING, FURNITURE, VEHICLE, TREE, FISH and BIRD. They found that subjects
predominantly used basic and subordinate level terms, with subordinate terms (double knit pants,
Levis) employed only slightly more frequently than basic level terms (pants); furthermore,
subjects listed only a few attributes for the superordinate category (CLOTHING). In another
experiment testing implications of the theory of basic level categories for language, Rosch et al.
(1976) examined how subjects named objects in the same nine categories. Their results showed
that, even though subjects were aware of the superordinate and subordinate names for objects,
their use of basic level terms was statistically significant. The researchers posit two possible
reasons for this finding: “Basic level names are simply more [frequently encountered] than
superordinate and subordinate category names, and … in this name production task, subjects
simply replied with the most available (frequent) word for that object” (p. 424).
Rosch et al. (1976) also tested the hypothesis that basic level categories were the most
inclusive categories that could be represented by a code concrete enough to be called an image.
They presented subjects with a visually noisy image and asked them to identify the entity
embedded in the image that represented the category name. Their hypothesis was supported by

49

the finding that the basic level name of an object was the most abstract name that could aid
detection of the object in a noisy picture (p. 412).
Based on studies of everyday language, Lakoff and Johnson (1980) suggest that
“conceptual structure is meaningful because it is embodied, that is, it arises from, and is tied to,
our perceptual bodily experiences” [p. 267). For Lakoff, embodiment is coupled with “collective
biological capacities and … physical and social experiences [of individuals] as beings
functioning in … [their] environment” [(1986, p. 267). Lakoff and Johnson (1980) assume the
existence of an external structure in “our bodily experience” (p. 267), which arises from the
“preconceptual experiences” (p. 267) of individuals. Lakoff (1986) suggests that there are at
least two kinds of structure that are implicated in preconceptual experiences: basic level structure
and kinesthetic image-schematic structure. Basic level structures are comprised of categories
that represent the convergence of gestalt perception, the capacity for bodily movement, and the
development of rich mental images, while kinesthetic image-schematic structures are the external
structures that constantly appear in everyday bodily experiences -- structures such as paths,
containers, or front-back and part-whole relationships (p. 267). Lakoff and Johnson (1980) also
theorize that, through the use of metaphors and the projection of basic level categories to
superordinate and subordinate categories, individuals extend these basic level and imageschematic structures to create abstract conceptual structures (see also Giora, 2008; Kövecses,
2008). However, these assumptions do not address the relational and unstable nature of
preconceptual structures such as basic level categories: For example, the perception and
understanding of categories and category boundaries can differ substantially across individuals,
contexts, and cultures and can even change dramatically over time.

50

Lakoff (1986) summarizes the research on basic level categories and suggests that, overall,
categories are basic in four respects: perception, function, communication, and knowledge
organization. In terms of perception, he argues that members of a basic level category
demonstrate similar “overall shapes” that support a “single mental image” and facilitate “fast
identification” of category members (p. 47). With respect to function, he observes that the basic
level is the “highest level at which a person uses similar motor actions for interacting with
category members” (p. 46). With respect to communication, he posits that basic level terms are
the “shortest, most commonly used and contextually neutral words, first learned by children and
first to enter the lexicon” (p. 47). And he concludes that knowledge is organized predominantly
at the basic level:
[W]hen subjects are asked to list attributes of categories, they list very few
attributes of category members at the superordinate level (furniture, vehicle,
mammal); they list most of what they know at the basic level (chair, car, dog);
and at the subordinate level (rocking chair, sports car, retriever) there is virtually
no increase in knowledge over the basic level. (Lakoff, 1986, p. 47)

Operationalization of basic level categories
Rosch (1978) formalizes the concept of a basic level category in terms of the probability of
cue validity. She defines the cue validity of a given category as:
[T]he validity of a given cue x as a predictor of a given category y (the
conditional probability of y/x) increases as the frequency with which cue x is
associated with category y increases and decreases as the frequency with which
cue x is associated with categories other than y increases. (p. 30)
She operationalizes the cue validity of a category as the sum of the individual cue validities for
each attribute of a category, given that a category with high cue validity would be more distinct
from other categories than a category with low cue validity.

51

In her formalization of basic level categories, Rosch adopts Tversky and Gati’s (1978; see
also Tversky, 1977) definition of category resemblance as the weighted sum of the measure of a
category’s common features minus the measure of a category’s distinctive features. Rosch
(1978) postulates that basic objects such as chair and car are at the most inclusive level where
attributes are common to all or most members of the category and suggests that “both total cue
validities and category resemblance are maximized at that level of abstraction at which basic
objects are categorized” (p. 31). When compared with basic level categories, superordinate
categories possess fewer common attributes and, thus, demonstrate lower total cue validity and
category resemblance. Subordinate categories also have lower cue validity than do basic level
categories because they share many of their attributes with other subordinate categories (e.g.,
breads of dog) such that the “weight of the added common features tend[s] to exceed the weight
of the distinctive features” (Rosch, 1978, p. 31).
Several researchers have suggested alternative methods for formally defining basic level
categories. Jones (1983) proposes a category-feature collocation metric calculated as the product
of the probabilities that a “possessor of the feature is a member of the category” and a “member
of the category is a possessor of the feature” (p. 424). He contends that cue validity provides
only a “partial criterion for assessing the existence of a distinctive concentration of feature
possessors within a category” (p. 424) because it does not take into account other important
factors, such as the “density of possession of the feature within the category” (p. 424). He argues
that the density of feature possession “corresponds to the converse of cue validity: the probability
with which a member of a given category possesses a particular feature” (p. 424). And he
suggests that the conjunction of both of these factors is important for determining whether or not
a category is basic. For example, use of the probability of feature possession alone would deprive

52

BIRD of the feature CAN FLY. Because some birds do not fly (e.g., ostrich), the probability of
possessing that feature is higher within a subordinate (p. 424).
Corter and Gluck (1992) have developed the category utility metric to predict the preferred
level of categorization using subject reaction time to verify and name pictures. The category
utility metric is a quantitative measure that represents the goodness of a category in terms of
three basic factors: the probability or relative frequency of the category, the category validity of a
feature, and the overall base rate of the feature. Corter and Gluck define the category utility
metric as the “difference between squared category validity and the squared base rate, weighted
by the relative frequency of [the] category” (1992, p. 301). They argue that the factor of the baserate distribution of attribute values in the context population allows for “effects of such factors as
the distinctiveness of contrast categories and the nature of the context population of instances”
(1992, p. 295).
One of the major problems with all of these metrics is that they are based on the
frequency of feature occurrence, which complicates the specification of features (Murphy &
Lassaline, 1997). For instance, to define the cue validity of DOG, it is necessary to decide which
features should be included (e.g., BARKS, CAN SERVE AS A GUARD). Features should be prioritized
to assure that category instances in the environment are represented. Murphy (2002) argues that
defining which features of an entity actually occur “has not been adequately addressed by
metrics of the basic level” (p. 216) and suggests that performance measures may overcome the
shortcomings of cue validity, category feature collocation, and category utility metrics.
Several studies have attempted to provide a theoretical explanation for how basic level
categories are perceived and processed. Murphy and Brownell (1985) propose that the
distinctiveness and specificity of the category determine category differentiation: Specificity

53

refers to how specific and informative the category is, and distinctiveness refers to how
dissimilar the categories are in comparison to contrast categories. In a series of experiments with
natural language categories, Murphy and Brownell (1985) found that subjects could identify
objects faster when they were members of differentiated categories. In particular, an atypical
subordinate category (e.g., RACING CAR) was highly differentiated and, therefore, was
responded to as quickly as a basic level category during object recognition. They argue that
specificity and differentiation usually oppose each other: “[V]ery specific categories tend to be
very similar to their contrast categories, which differ in only one or two features; very general
categories tend to be distinctive” (p. 71); and they suggest that categories at the basic level are
most differentiated because they have relatively positive values for both factors rather than a
maximally strong value for only one.
In this vein, Murphy (2002) suggests a differentiation explanation for the preference for
basic level categories based on the assumption that basic categories are most differentiated in
terms of informativeness and distinctiveness. The informativeness of a basic level category refers
to the fact that the category communicates a large amount of information: When you know the
basic level category to which an object belongs, you can infer a significant amount of
information about that object. The distinctiveness of a basic level category refers to how
different a category is when contrasted with coordinate categories at the same level in the
hierarchy. According to the differentiation explanation, superordinate categories are distinctive
but less informative than basic level categories, whereas subordinate categories are more
informative but significantly less distinctive than basic level categories.
Differentiation explanations of basic level categories have been tested by several
experimental studies (e.g., Lassaline, Wisniewski, & Medin, 1992; Murphy & Smith, 1982).

54

Murphy and Smith (1982) theorized that distinctive perceptual attributes would explain why
objects are categorized fastest at the basic level. To test this hypothesis, they asked subjects to
learn the hierarchical structure of 14 categories of tools: two superordinate categories
(POUNDER, CUTTER), four basic level categories (HAMMER, BRICK, KNIFE, PIZZA
CUTTER) and eight subordinate categories (WIDE HEAD HAMMER, NARROW HEAD
HAMMER, ONE-PART HANDLE BRICK, TWO-PART HANDLE BRICK, STRAIGHT
EDGE KNIFE, SERRATED KNIFE, SHORT SHAFT PIZZA CUTTER and LONG SHAFT
PIZZA CUTTER). Timed categorization of objects using the learned categories demonstrated
that basic level categories were identified fastest, followed by subordinate and superordinate
categories, respectively. The differentiation explanation is consistent with experimental findings
that objects and non-objects are usually categorized fastest at the basic level (e.g., Rosch et al.,
1976). It is also consistent with two exceptions described by Rogers and McClelland (2004):
(1) when an object is an atypical exemplar of a basic-level category (i.e., its
subordinate is more distinctive than most subordinates from the same basic level), it
is categorized faster at the subordinate level than at the basic level, and (2) when
people are particularly knowledgeable about the features that distinguish subordinate
categories in a domain (i.e., they become experts), their subordinate-level
categorizations are as fast as their basic-level categorizations. (p. 479)
Rogers and Patterson (2007) propose an explanation of basic level categories that is based
on the theory of parallel distributed processing (PDP) of conceptual knowledge. PDP theory is
grounded in the assumption that knowledge of words and objects follows from the interaction of
various representations, including perceptual and motor as well as linguistic features. According
to PDP theory, the “ability to interpret and make use of new information depends on knowledge
that has previously accumulated in the semantic network through gradual learning; but neither
the information nor its interpretation is stored immediately in the network’s connection weights”
(Rogers & McClelland, 2004, p. 63). For example, the category COFFEE is associated with

55

various features, such as taste, flavor and smell, from which the definition of the category
emerges.
Rogers and Patterson (2007) build on the proposal of Barsalou, Simmons, Barbey and
Wilson (2003) that semantic memory consists of a set of representations associated with a “hub”
that facilitates interactions between perceptual, motor and language representations. The
semantic representation of a category is thus a hub that allows the “instantiation of a
representation in one modality to provoke the instantiation of associated words, actions, and
perceptual characteristics in other modalities” (Rogers & Patterson, 2007, p. 457). For example,
if an individual learns that an instance of PEAR HAS SEEDS, this acquired information would be
generalized to other members of the category FRUIT; however, this generalization would not
apply to a LIGHT BULB, regardless of the similarity in shape, because LIGHT BULB represents
a different pattern in the hub.
Rogers and Patterson (2007) emphasize that the “similarity structure in the hub comes to
mirror the similarities apparent across all of the different sensory, motor, and language
representations to which it is connected – so that items that have many different kinds of features
in common (similar shapes, movements, functions, colors, and so on) come to be represented as
similar” (p. 458), suggesting that basic level categories occur because of similarity of the
structure of representations in the hub. For example, while members of the categories ORANGE
and BALL share a similar shape, they vary in terms of use, purpose, etc.; however, although
members of the categories ORANGE and STRAWBERRY differ in color and shape, they are
similar in terms of use, purpose, etc. This explanation can be distinguished from the
differentiation explanation in that the emergence of the basic level “depends upon the pattern of
generalization fostered by these representations as the network learns to name” (p. 459). In other

56

words, a learned item is generalized to items with similar representations: For example, learning
that a canary is a type of BIRD associates it with other types in the category (see Figure 6).

Figure 6. Representation of activation of categories at different levels of specificity. The left
panel shows activation of categories in response to visual stimuli; and the right panel shows the
predicted time of activation for the different categories. (Adapted from Rogers & Patterson,
2007, p. 461)
Rogers and Patterson argue that “similarity-based generalization … promotes more rapid
learning of basic-level names for words of equal frequency” (p. 460). On the other hand, they
speculate that the entry level may shift depending on the “exact similarity structure of the
semantic representations and the frequency of the labels at different levels of specificity” (p.
460). They conclude that

57

basic-level advantages arise because names tend to generalize across items with
similar representations, so that names that apply consistently across a set of
tightly clustered and well-separated representations are easiest to learn; but the
robustness of naming at different levels of specificity also depends upon the
breadth of the representations spanned by the name once it has been acquired. (p.
460; emphasis in original)
	  

In contrast to the differentiation explanation, PDP theory can account for time of activation
at different category levels. Superordinate categories are activated sooner than basic level
categories because they “apply broadly across a wide range of semantically related items”
(Rogers & Patterson, 2007, p. 461). However, because of the broad application of superordinate
categories, full activation (i.e., activation sufficient to provide a response) will be slower:
“[B]roadly spaced representations to which [superordinate categories] apply do not foster much
generalization one to another so the name is slower to activate” (p. 461). In contrast, because
basic level categories represent a relatively narrower space; their activation starts later, but full
activation is achieved more rapidly. Thus, the predicted time of activation starts with the
superordinate category and moves to the basic category and then to the subordinate category.
Theorizing that the time to define category membership “depends upon one of the name outputs
exceeding a threshold” (p. 461), Rogers and Patterson suggest that, in the case of a high
threshold for responding, the basic level category will be verified first. However, when there is
the need to respond at increasingly shorter latencies, the “basic- over general-level
[superordinate] advantage should first vanish and then be reversed – so that, at very fast
latencies, people should be more accurate for superordinate relative to basic categorization” (p.
461).
Rogers and Patterson (2007) tested PDP theory using the categorization of object pictures
by two groups of subjects: One group of subjects consisted of healthy individuals and the second
group consisted of patients who suffered from semantic dementia (SD), a deterioration of the

58

anterior temporal cortex that disturbs the ability to activate specific features but does not affect
activation of more general features. In line with previous studies, analysis of the responses from
healthy subjects indicated the dominance of basic level categories. However, analysis of the
responses from the SD subjects indicated that they categorized more accurately at the
superordinate level than at the basic level. This finding suggests that “knowledge about an
object’s general nature does not depend on prior basic-level categorization” (p. 451). Rogers and
Patterson also tested the prevalence of basic level categories by measuring reaction times for
correct responses and subject accuracy in discriminating targets from distractors. In line with
PDP theory, they found that, like SD patients, healthy subjects tended to categorize at the
superordinate level when time was limited. They speculated that healthy subjects “responding
under strict time pressure are somewhat like patients with SD, in that they must generate a
decision about category membership from a poorly specified internal semantic representation
that does not correspond to the learned representation of a specific learned item” (p. 465).

Studies of basic level categories
In the years since Rosch first introduced the prototype theory of categorization and the
notion of basic level categories, her experimental approach has been applied in a wide variety of
domains, including word use and free naming (e.g., Tanaka & Taylor, 1991; Markman &
Wisniewsky, 1997; Blewitt, 1983), American Sign Language for the deaf (e.g., Newport &
Bellugi, 1978), and the categorization of images (e.g., Murphy & Smith, 1982) and
environmental scenes (e.g., Tversky & Hemenway, 1983; 1984).
Tversky and Hemenway’s (1984) study of subject perceptions of overall part-whole
configuration indicated that knowledge about parts is particularly salient at the basic level.
Based on the methods and data collected by Rosch et al. (1976), attributes provided for non-

59

biological categories (e.g., MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, FURNITURE) were reanalyzed and
separated into parts and non-parts. Analysis of the judge-amended attribute list showed that only
20% of the attributes were parts at the superordinate level, whereas 64% of the attributes at the
basic level and 60% of the attributes at the subordinate level were parts (p. 173). In the second
experiment, subjects were asked to list attributes for biological categories used by Rosch et al.
(1976) (e.g., PLANT, ANIMAL, FISH, FLOWER). In comparison with the findings of Tversky
and Hemenway’s previous experiment, the proportion of attributes listed as parts for biological
categories were relatively higher for superordinate categories and lower for basic and
subordinate categories: 40% of the attributes for superordinate level categories were parts,
whereas 52% of the attributes for basic level categories and 38% of the attributes for subordinate
categories were parts (p. 176). Calculation of the median weights for “parts” and “non-parts” for
each category showed that parts were more “distinctive of contrasting basic categories than nonparts” (p. 179). This finding supported the hypothesis that subjects would list more parts at the
basic level because parts represent distinctive features of objects.
Tversky and Hemenway (1984) suggest that their finding that categories at the basic level
differ from one another on the basis of parts but share other attributes indicates that perceived
natural breaks among categories at the basic level may be breaks between clusters of entities
with shared parts. They argue that the “part configuration is especially important because of its
role as a bridge between appearance and activity, between perception and behavior, between
structure and function” (p. 188). And they conclude that, because structure is related to function
via part configuration, “part configuration underlies the informativeness of basic level
categories” (p. 188).

60

Tanaka and Taylor (1991) investigated whether basic level categories could be modified by
experience. In three experiments, the performance of dog experts and bird experts was analyzed.
In the first experiment, subjects were asked to list features for 20 categories representing
subordinate level categories of BIRD (e.g., ROBIN, CROW, JAY, and CARDINAL) and DOG
(e.g., BEAGLE, DOBERMAN PINSCHER, COLLIE and POODLE); for the superordinate
category ANIMAL; for the basic level categories DOG and BIRD; and for additional category
fillers (e.g., FRUIT, MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, CHAIR, COFFEE TABLE). Analysis showed
that experts in each domain tended to list more features at the subordinate level for their own
domain of expertise. For categories outside the domain of expertise (e.g., DOG for bird experts),
subjects listed more features for the basic level categories than for subordinate categories.
Calculation of the degree of feature overlap at the subordinate level showed that non-overlapping
features constituted 75% and 74%, respectively, for expert and novice categories. Additionally,
dog experts (i.e., bird novices) listed more part features for BIRD (e.g., BEAK, FEATHERS), while
bird experts provided more behavioral features (e.g., HABITAT, FEEDING ACTIVITY).
In the second experiment, Tanaka and Taylor (1991) asked subjects to name, as quickly as
possible, pictures of dog and bird instances embedded in a large set of pictures drawn from
artifactual and natural kind categories (e.g., VEHICLE, FURNITURE, INSECT, TREE). Results
showed that 57% of the categories identified by experts represented subordinate level categories,
while 43% were at the basic level. In contrast, non-experts generally employed basic level terms:
76% of the categories assigned by non-experts were at the basic level and only 21% at the
subordinate level (3% were omitted because pictures could not be identified with the appropriate
subordinate level categories).

61

The third experiment focused on category verification. Domain experts were asked to
verify, as quickly as possible, category membership at both the subordinate level as at the basic
level (p. 477). Tanaka and Taylor found that “expertise enhances the speed at which subordinatelevel categories are accessed, making them at least as accessible as basic level categories” (p.
475); and they suggest that the “nature of expertise may vary as a function of domain in ways
that can affect the process of categorization” (p. 474). They explain their findings using the
theory of differentiation, suggesting that the degree of informativeness (or specificity) and
distinctiveness of a category contributes to how easily it can be accessed:
For example, a person who owns a collie and spends a lot of time with the dog
could be considered a “collie expert.” Such a person might be aware of the
distinguishing features of collies, but know very little about distinctive properties
of other breeds of dogs. Presumably, this person would refer to collies by their
subordinate-level name, but refer to other breeds of dogs simply as “dogs.” (p.
480)
In contrast, in a study of categorization and reasoning conducted with tree experts, Medin,
Lynch, Coley, and Atran (1997) found that the genus level was privileged. Their findings were
consonant with those of Berlin (1978), which demonstrated privilege at the genus level for
naming of plants by Tzeltal speakers.
Tanaka, Curran, and Sheinberg (2005) studied how subordinate-level learning contributed
to a change in perceptual expertise for novel exemplars and novel categories. Subjects learned to
name, verify and categorize wading birds and owls at the subordinate (species) and basic (genus)
levels. They were then asked to determine whether two birds (one a learned instance and the
other a novel instance) belonged to the same or different species. Although participants displayed
improvement in discrimination of birds at the species level, training at the subordinate level
produced greater posttest gains in discrimination. For example, subjects who learned to
categorize WADING BIRDS such as GREEN HERON at the subordinate level were better able

62

to differentiate novel species of WADING BIRDS such as WHOOPING CRANE than subjects
who learned to categorize wading birds at the basic level (p. 149). Although reaction times and
speed of verification for subordinate level categorization improved over the course of the
experiment, subjects were still slower for subordinate level categorization than for basic level
categorization. Based on these findings, Tanaka et al. (2005) suggest that “perceptual
categorization, not perceptual exposure per se, is important for the development and
generalization of visual expertise” (p. 145).
Mack et al. (2009) investigated whether the category level that was categorized faster was
also processed first. They tested a “fastest means first” hypothesis by computing the time for
basic and subordinate level categorization in two signal-to-response experiments. In the first
experiment, subjects were asked to verify categories of images representing three categories:
FACE (e.g., Bill Clinton), DOG (e.g., poodle) and BIRD (e.g., dove). Each category was
comprised of images from eight different subordinate level categories. The study also included
atypical category members, such as chihuahua and penguin. Subjects generally verified objects
at the basic level faster and more accurately than they verified objects at the subordinate level.
However, verification in the FACE category displayed a shift in speed and accuracy toward the
subordinate level. In the second experiment, a category verification task was conducted with the
inclusion of a signal-to-respond manipulation (p. 1965) – the times for categorizing expert and
novice objects at the basic and subordinate levels were compared to determine whether objects
were categorized at the basic level before identification at the subordinate level began. Although
basic level categorization was performed faster and more accurately in the first experiment, the
second study did not identify a significant delay in the onset of subordinate level identification
when compared to identification at the basic level. Mack et al. (2009) suggest that “basic-level

63

categorizations may be made faster than subordinate-level identification, but basic-level
categorization does not appear to be a stage of processing that precedes subordinate-level
identification” (p. 1967). Although they contend that, if basic level categories were to precede
subordinate level categories, a difference in onset should have been observed, they also note that
the study might not have had sufficient statistical power to identify “significant differences in the
onset when the exponential functions were fitted to the observed data” (p. 1967).
Anaki and Bentin (2009) found that familiar towers (e.g., Leaning Tower of Pisa) were
categorized faster at the instance level than at the basic level. Because the categorization of
familiar stimuli was slower and less accurate at the basic and superordinate levels than
unfamiliar stimuli, they suggest that, regardless of expertise, detailed semantic information may
stimulate a shift in the entry level of categorization from the basic to the instance level. Belke,
Leder, Harsanyi and Carbon (2010) also observed that art objects were more frequently
categorized at the subordinate level when compared to non-art objects. For example, expert
viewers were able to access artist-specific representations as quickly as basic-level
representations of everyday objects: A painting by Picasso was identified as an instance of a
Picasso within the same time frame as a depiction of a car was identified as an instance of a car
(p. 200). Belke et al. suggest that this may be because the “artist’s name has a special status in
the memorial representation of visual art and serves as a predominant entry point in recognition
in art perception” (p. 191).
Collin and McMullen (2005) theorize that object recognition at the basic level relies on
general shapes, while recognition at subordinate levels relies on finer visual representations:
“[S]low spatial frequencies are sufficient for basic-level category verification and … subordinate
category verification relies to a greater degree on high spatial frequencies” (p. 362). They

64

conducted an experiment in which subjects were asked to perform category verification of
images of objects (see Figure 7) at superordinate (e.g., VEHICLE), basic (e.g., PLANE, BOAT,
CAR), and subordinate levels (e.g., GLIDER, TRAWLER, CORVETTE) after low-pass spatial
filtering, high-pass spatial filtering, 50% phase randomization, or no image manipulation. Two
experiments showed that low-pass filtering had no significant effect on basic level category
verification. Collin and McMullen suggest that the “robustness of basic-level identification arises
at least partially from the easier availability and higher energy of coarse scale information in
natural images” (2005, p. 362). However, it is worth noting that their analysis was based only on
single levels of spatial frequency manipulation.

65

A number of studies have addressed the preference of children for basic level categories
(e.g., Blewitt, 1983; Greco & Daehler, 1985; Rosch et al., 1976). Mervis and Crisafi (1982)
studied the ability of children to categorize at the superordinate, basic, and subordinate levels.
Three groups of children – ages 2 to 6, age 4 and ages 5 to 6 – were asked to indicate which of
two nonsense stimuli (see Figure 8) were the same kind of thing as a standardized object at each
hierarchical level. The standard was depicted on a card positioned above the two novel stimuli
and were pointed out by the experimenter, who asked the child “Do you see this one? Can you
show me the one that is the same kind of thing as this one, the one that goes with it” (p. 261).
Results of the experiment showed that children aged 2 to 6 performed significantly better than
chance at the basic level, that 4-year-olds performed significantly better than chance for both
basic and superordinate levels, and 5 to 6-year-olds performed significantly better than chance
for all three levels (p. 259). The results supported Mervis and Crisafi’s hypothesis that
categorization ability is acquired sequentially, beginning with the basic level, through the
superordinate level to the subordinate level, as Brown (1958) had proposed.

Crisafi, 1982, p. 260).

In a second experiment, Mervis and Crisafi (1982) tested whether the degree of
differentiation of categories at the superordinate, basic, and subordinate levels could be used to
predict the order in which the ability to categorize at different levels of specificity is acquired (p.
261). Subjects were shown stimuli arranged in three rows, where the stimuli were numbered
from 1 to 8 for the top (superordinate) row, from 9 to 16 for the middle (basic) row, and from 17
to 24 for the bottom (subordinate) row. Subjects were given cards with the numbers of two
stimuli and were asked to judge the similarity of the two stimuli whose numbers were indicated
on the card. Statistical analysis revealed that basic level categories were more easily
differentiated from one another than were the categories at other levels. To confirm previous
findings, a third experiment was conducted using categories from Rosch et al. (1976) to assess
the degree of differentiation between categories at the three levels. As with previous findings, the
observed order of differentiation was identical with the order of acquisition. Mervis and Crisafi
argued that the “order of acquisition of the ability to categorize at various levels can be explained
by the degree of differentiation of the categories at a given hierarchical level: the more
differentiated categories at a given level are, the earlier categorization at that level will be
acquired” (p. 265).
Horton and Markman (1980) tested the hypothesis that perceptual similarity among
members of a basic category could facilitate a child’s ability to learn categories by exposure to
exemplars. They examined the relative utility of exemplar and linguistic information for
acquiring basic and superordinate categories. In line with Mervis and Crisafi’s findings
demonstrating the privileged status of basic level categories, Horton and Markman found that
perceptual similarity among exemplars of basic level categories supported acquisition, while the
perceptual diversity of superordinate categories made it difficult.

67

Although Behl-Chadha (1995) observed differentiation of basic and superordinate levels of
categories in early infancy, Mandler (Mandler & Bauer, 1988; Mandler, Bauer & McDonough,
1991; Mandler & McDonough, 1993) found no differentiation for basic level categories. Mandler
argues that
[t]he data we have presented suggest that in the domains of animals, plants, and
vehicles, and perhaps in other domains as well, basic-level categories, as formulated
by Rosch and Mervis (1975) and Rosch et al. (1976), do not form the entry level in
the development of hierarchical categorical systems. Rather, children appear to begin
categorizing at a more global level; only gradually do these global categories become
differentiated. (Mandler et al., 1991, p. 294)
In an attempt to generalize her findings, Mandler (1998) argues that “various differences
between perceptual and conceptual categories illustrate the insufficiency of the widely held view
that ‘basic-level’ categories are the first to be formed” (p. 289). She claims that the hypothesis
that basic level categories are the first to be leaned is incorrect because, according to her
findings, infants tend to form categories at the superordinate level. Furthermore, she claims that
Rosch’s experimental studies did not “constitute adequate tests of the hypothesis that basic-level
concepts are the first to be formed, nor did they work with young enough subjects” (p. 289).
Mandler (1998) contends that Rosch’s (Rosch et al., 1976) experiments using sorting
applied a too strict criterion when she mandated that sorting was judged to be “incorrect if a
superordinate class was subdivided, even though the subjects were not told how many divisions
to make” (p. 289): For example, placing shoes and socks in one category and shirts and pants in
another category would be considered incorrect. Mandler argues that, to test whether
categorization at the basic level is easier than at the superordinate level, it is not appropriate to
use the sorting of dogs and cars as the basic level and to contrast those with the sorting of
animals and vehicles: Even though dogs and cars are basic level categories, they entail what she
calls the “superordinate contrast” (p. 289; emphasis in original). She cautions that such extreme

68

contrasts should be avoided when testing for basic level categorization and suggests that
contrasting pairs should involve entities in the same hierarchy (e.g., dogs and rabbits or cars and
motorcycles) (p. 289).
Murphy (2002) points out that Mandler’s attempts to cast doubt on the theory of basic level
categories have not been widely supported. He argues that her criticism of basic level theory is
based on the assumption that the “basic level is an immutable property of categories that is
predictable from the ‘objective category’ itself” (Murphy, 2002, p. 235), an assumption that
could be easily falsified by identification of different basic level categories in other cultures or
developmental stages. Moreover, because the notion of basic level categories is a “psychological
construct, [it] depends on what people know about the categories [and] can only be identified by
behavioral tests” (Murphy, 2002, p. 235). Murphy contends that, for Mandler’s criticism of basic
level categories to be persuasive, it must be supported “by alternative, concrete proposals for the
phenomena Rosch, Mervis and their colleagues discovered” (2002, p. 235).
Several studies have applied Rosch’s findings in non-object domains. For instance, Tversky
and Hemenway (1983) studied basic level categories in environmental scenes. In the first of
several experiments, subjects were provided with the superordinate categories INDOOR and
OUTDOOR and were asked to generate relevant categories and subcategories for a taxonomy of
kinds of environmental scenes. To identify the preferred level of categorization, subjects were
then asked to generate a list of attributes or activities for each category they had created.
Analysis revealed that 95% of the listed attributes were parts of scenes. Tversky and Hemenway
argue that part configurations “underlie the coincidence of the basic level determined
perceptually and the basic level determined behaviorally” (p. 133). In the second experiment,
subjects were asked to name images of common and familiar scenes and to fill in sentences

69

describing an activity occurring in a particular setting (e.g., The Kingstons furnished their ____
with furniture they built themselves). Results demonstrated that subjects perceived the
superordinate categories INDOOR and OUTDOOR to have very few attributes, parts, or
activities in common. In contrast, basic level categories (e.g., BEACH, MOUNTAINS, HOME,
SCHOOL) shared many attributes, parts, and activities. Tversky and Hemenway suggest that
“knowledge about scenes, like knowledge about objects, has a hierarchical organization, in
which an intermediate level of abstraction is basic, or preferred, in measures of cognition,
behavior, and communication” (p. 144).
Morris and Murphy (1990) investigated whether routine social events had a basic level that
was preferred for verifying actions related to events. They found that similarity judgments of
stories about events were strongest at the superordinate level: For example, subjects identified
events that were kinds of the same superordinate event (e.g., SUBWAY TRAVEL and TRAVEL BY
SCHOOL BUS)

as rather similar. Overall, however, any observed basic level structure for social

events was found to be less clearly defined and less stable than that of object categories. Morris
and Murphy suggest that differences between their observations and previous findings on object
categorization might have been due to the social and functional nature of event superordinates.
Shaver, Schwartz, Kirson, and O'Connor (1987) explored the prototypes and hierarchical
taxonomy of five basic emotions. They conducted a hierarchical cluster analysis of categories
representing 135 emotions generated by subjects. Analysis indicated three distinct category
levels: general, intermediate and specific (p. 1067). The general level was comprised of
POSITIVE and NEGATIVE emotions. Six categories of emotions grouped at the intermediate
level represented LOVE, FEAR, JOY, SURPRISE,15 ANGER and SADNESS. The most specific
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
15

	  Due to the small size and poor showing of the category SURPRISE in previous studies, Shaver et al. (1987) found
it to be questionable as a basic level category.	  

70

level consisted of 25 subordinate categories clustered under the six intermediate-level categories:
For example, AFFECTION, LUST, CHEERFULNESS, PRIDE, and NERVOUSNESS were
nested under the category LOVE. Shaver et al. suggest that the three levels correspond to the
hierarchical representation of object categories, with the intermediate level representing the basic
level; and they argue that, “within each basic level category, one subcluster, containing the basiclevel term, appeared to designate a generic or core form of the emotion in question, whereas the
other subclusters seemed to designate more specialized forms” (p. 1081).

Basic-level categories through the lens of Heidegger’s notion of handiness
Studies of basic level categories have indicated that entry level categorization may be
modulated by two factors: the individual's domain-specific knowledge and the typicality of an
exemplar for a corresponding category. Jolicoeur et al. (1984) claim that the “level at which
objects are identified first depends on typicality” (p. 271); and Rips, Blok, and Newman (2006)
speculate that factors responsible for an individual’s preference for a basic level term “may
include not only those associated with its basic-level category but also the larger set of
background causes that govern the individual's environment” (p. 9). These factors may shift the
entry level of categorization from the basic level to the subordinate level (e.g., Rosch et al.,
1976; Jolicoeur et al., 1984; Tanaka & Taylor, 1991; Belke, Leder, Harsanyi, & Carbon, 2010).
As Brown (1958) observes:
It seems likely that things are first named so as to categorize them in a maximally
useful way. For most purposes Referent A is a spoon rather than a piece of
silverware, and Referent B a dime rather than a metal object. The same referent
may have its most useful categorization on one level (Prince) for one group (the
family) and on another level (dog) for another group (strangers). The
categorization that is most useful for very young children (money) may change as
they grow older (dime and nickel). (p. 20; emphasis in original)

However, it appears that the relational nature of basic level categories, which leads to problems
in applying basic level category theory across individuals, situations and cultures, has not yet
been addressed. In this regard, Heidegger’s (1953/1996) notion of handiness (zuhandenheit) (p.
65) offers a framework for understanding the relational nature of basic level categories.
Heidegger defines the notion of “handiness” or being “at hand” as the “ontological categorical
definition of beings as they are ‘in themselves’” (p. 67; emphasis in original): the representation
of being in relation to useful things that are handy on the “basis of what is objectively present”
(p. 67). For Heidegger, a useful thing is “ ‘something in order to…’ … such as serviceability,
helpfulness, usability, handiness, [that] constitute[s] a totality of useful things” (p. 64). He
argues that the structure of “in order to” includes a “reference of something to something” (p. 64;
emphasis in original). In particular, useful things “always are in terms of their belonging to other
useful things” (p. 64):
… writing materials, pen, ink, paper, desk blotter, table, lamp, furniture, windows,
doors, room[:] These “things” never show themselves initially by themselves, in
order then to fill out a room as a sum of real things. What we encounter as nearest
to us, although we do not grasp it thematically, is the room, not as what is “between
the four walls” in a geometrical, spatial sense, but rather as material for living. (p.
64)
Handiness cannot be grasped or explained “theoretically” because it represents an association
that “makes use of things” and “guides our operations and gives them their specific thingly
quality” (p. 65). For example, hammering is associated with a hammer, whereas the act of
hammering itself “discovers the specific ‘handiness’ of the hammer” (p. 65). In other words, the
handiness of a useful thing is discovered in association with the “work to be produced” (p. 65):
The shoe to be produced is for wearing (footgear), the clock is made for telling
time. The work which we primarily encounter when we deal with things and take
care of them—what we are at work with—always already lets us encounter the
what-for of its usability which essentially belongs to it. (p. 65; emphasis in original)

72

Applying Heidegger’s (1953/1996) terms, basic level categories are “useful things” that
“reveal” themselves by their handiness. Moreover, there appears to be a “thingly” (p. 65) quality
that underlies the predominance of basic level categories in our everyday vocabulary. Although
the thingly quality of basic level categories might be explained by a general understanding of
“work to be produced” (p. 65) Heidegger sees the work produced not only as a reference to the
“what-for of its usability” and the “whereof of which it consists” (p. 66), but also to the
“surrounding world of nature” (p. 67). He provides as an example the use of a clock:
When we look at the clock, we tacitly use the “position of the sun” according to
which the official astronomical regulation of time is carried out. The surrounding
world of nature is also at hand in the usage of clock equipment which is at first
inconspicuously at hand. (p. 67)
For Heidegger, the handiness of things in the “work world nearest to us” (p. 67) is based on
the function of “discovering” and depends on the “way we are absorbed[;] innerworldly beings
that are brought along together with their constitutive references are discoverable in varying
degrees of explicitness and with a varying [degree of] attentive penetration” (p. 67). In other
words, objects or “things” are used in relation to our perception and understanding of those
“things” and, as such, they do not have their own independent meaning. This explains how basic
level categories can vary across individuals and cultures due to variations in “innerworldly
beings,” particularly in their relation to or their understanding of the “thingly quality” (p. 65) of
objects. For Heidegger, variation across individuals arises from their experiences of interacting
with objects in different contexts and is thus phenomenological in its origins (M. Gray, personal
communication, April 30, 2011).
Applying the framework of Heidegger’s notion of handiness, basic level categories are best
defined within the individual’s contextualized experience of using objects or their understanding

73

of an object's utility – its “thingly quality” (p. 65). As Dewey argued (1997), it is the dependence
on human perception and understanding to ascribe meaning to a thing that represents the
knowledge enabling individuals to “adapt [the] environment to our needs ... [and] aims and
desires to the situation in which we live” (p. 217).

LIS studies of basic level categories
Jacob (2004) argues that cognitive categorization is the baseline for formal systems of
organization (see Figure 9), but she recognizes that the “organization imposed on cognitive
categories is so dynamic and responsive to changes in context that it cannot establish persistent,
knowledge-bearing relationships between categories” (p. 533). Conventional systems of
knowledge organization, such as the Dewey Classification System, are rigid structures that
cannot account for the fuzzy cognitive ways in which the world in general and information in
particular are perceived and organized by individuals. It is not surprising, then, that theories of
categorization and, in particular, the theory of basic level categories are rarely employed in LIS.

LIS researchers have tended to focus investigations of basic level categories to two areas of
investigation: How the basic level of categories is represented in knowledge organization
systems (Iyer, 1995; Fernandez & Eastman, 1990; Green, 2006); and how basic level terms are
used to represent the conceptual content of resources such as images (e.g., Jorgensen, 2003;
Rorissa & Iyer, 2008; Rorissa, 2008; Yoon, 2009; Schmidt & Stock, 2009).
Green, Bean and Hudon (2002) investigated the occurrence of basic level categories in four
different systems of knowledge organization: the Canadian Literacy Thesaurus, a bilingual
thesaurus; the Unified Medical Language System, a biomedical vocabulary; ThoughtTreasure, a
knowledge base supporting natural language processing; and WordNet16, a hierarchical
structured lexical database. Analysis of a random sample that included the semantic scope of a
term as well as its hierarchical placement demonstrated that equivalence across these four
systems occurred significantly at the basic level rather than at subordinate or superordinate
levels. Interestingly, basic level terms were observed most often in the Canadian Literacy
Thesaurus and least often in the Unified Medical Language System. Analysis using goodnessof-fit tests confirmed that, in these four systems, basic level terms were more likely to have
equivalents across systems than either superordinate or subordinate terms.
In a subsequent study, Green (2006) investigated the universality of basic level categories
in a sample of 28 thesauri from ten subject domains using a set of basic level terms that had been
collected from WordNet. By analyzing WordNet's structure, Green identified six general criteria
for identifying basic level categories:
•

Length and structure of lexical units (i.e., whether the lexical unit is a simple word, a
compound word, or a phrase);

Level of occurrence within the WordNet tree structure;
Number of links to parts;
Frequency of usage;
Total number of links to other categories; and
Number of immediate subordinate categories and number of all subordinate categories.
(2006, p. 8)

Analysis of the WordNet hierarchies using these measures led to the following generalizations
regarding basic level categories:
•
•

•
•

•

•

•

If a word is longer than 15 characters, it is unlikely that it names a basic level category.
If a lexical unit is a phrase (e.g., dress shirt, sports car), it is unlikely that it names a basic
level category. Furthermore, if a lexical unit includes more than two words, it can be
assumed that it does not name a basic level category.
If a category term is included within the name of a more specific category, that term
probably names the basic level category. For example, CAT within PERSIAN CAT.
If the frequency of occurrence of a category term is greater than the frequency of
occurrence of both its immediate superordinate and its immediate subordinate category, it
probably names a basic level category17.
If a category term has more than four levels of subordinates, it probably names a
superordinate category. For example, LIVING THINGS – ANIMALS –
MAMMALS – CARNIVORES – DOGS – SPANIEL.
If a term has more than one part listed, it probably names a basic level category. For
example, seat is part of chair; legs are part of chair; back is part of chair; therefore, chair
is a basic level category.
If a term has no subordinates, it is unlikely to be a basic level category and is more likely
to be a subordinate category itself. (Green, 2006, p. 8)

Green applied these assumptions to the WordNet noun network by analyzing every leaf node in
WordNet's 59,692 hierarchies and identified 7,168 basic level categories.
To investigate the hypothesis that categories at the basic level were more universal and
therefore more likely to co-occur across classificatory systems than either subordinate or
superordinate categories, Green identified 28 online thesauri for 11 subject domains (i.e.,
agriculture, education, engineering, environment, graphic materials, health, information science,
legislation, political science, population science, and water sciences). She then selected ten

This is based on data from SEMCOR, a semantic concordance. SEMCOR is comprised of short texts with all
open-classed words categorized according to WordNet senses (Green, 2006).

76

category terms at random from each thesaurus and then expanded them using the relational
structure of the thesaurus from which the term was taken. For each category term in these
hierarchical expansions, the closest corresponding category term was identified in each of the
other thesauri for that subject domain in order to generate category pairs consisting of one
category term from the hierarchical expansion in one thesaurus and the closest corresponding
term in a second thesaurus. These category pairs were then analyzed to determine if the two
category terms were equivalent, and basic level category terms were identified based on the
criteria for basic level categories generated from the analysis of WordNet.
Green's findings appeared to support her hypothesis that basic level terms were universal.
She suggests that the practical benefit of the study is that it provides direction for building
crosswalks between classificatory systems; and she argues that, if basic level categories are
significantly more likely to have exact equivalents across systems than categories not at the basic
level, crosswalks between classificatory systems should emphasize basic level categories so as to
generate the “cleanest mappings” (2006, p. 12). However, although the universality of basic level
categories in systems of knowledge organization would seem to be an argument for their utility
in indexing, basic level categories may not be an appropriate means for supporting collocation
precisely because they have such a high probability of occurrence.
Basic level categories have also been investigated in the indexing of images (Jörgensen
2003; Rorissa & Iyer, 2008). Jörgensen (1995; 2003) applied Rosch’s research on basic level
categories in a study of indexing and retrieval for images of perceptual class objects (e.g.,
clothing, body parts). Summarizing a series of studies on image retrieval, Jörgensen (2003)
reports that participants generally employed basic level terms in viewing, searching and memory
tasks (76.6%, 77.9% and 73.5%, respectively). When compared with the results for other tasks,

77

participants in the memory task employed fewer basic level terms and slightly more
superordinate terms (i.e., 14.6% for memory tasks compared to 11.8% and 11.7% for viewing
and searching tasks, respectively). Jörgensen's findings could be interpreted as support for earlier
studies indicating that objects are generally recognized at the basic level (e.g., Rosch et al.,
1976); however, her failure to provide specifics as to how the different levels of categories were
operationalized undermines the generalizability of her findings.
Rorissa and Iyer (2008) used free sorting of images to investigate prototypes and preferred
levels of categorization in image categorization. In two separate studies, they asked participants
to sort, name, and describe a sample of 100 images and then define a prototype image and its
features for each of the categories generated in the sorting task. Rorissa and Iyer found that, for
the categories generated in the two studies, superordinate categories predominated (54.17% and
58.88%), followed by basic level categories (42.5% and 36.42%) and subordinate categories
(3.33% and 4.70%). In addition to revealing a slight preference for superordinate terms when
defining group features, the analysis indicated that the categories and prototypes generated by
subjects included features of the images that could be useful for indexing and retrieval. For
example, the label used to name a group of images of people displaying some sort of emotional
behavior was EMOTIONS, and the significant feature suggested for the prototype image was
FACIAL EXPRESSION

(p. 1389). Rorissa and Iyer speculated that studies of image categorization

could help indexers understand the “cognitive space [of the user] and pave the way to fully usercentered indexing” (p. 1390).
In a follow-up study, Rorissa (2008) examined category terms assigned both to individual
images and to groups of images. In line with the earlier research of Rorissa and Iyer (2008),
categories assigned to groups of images tended to be at the superordinate level. However,

78

categories assigned to individual images displayed a preference for basic level categories
(63.29%) over both subordinate level (27.78%) and superordinate level (8.93%) categories. It is
worth noting that the studies conducted by Rorissa (2008) and Rorissa and Iyer (2008) adapted
Green’s (2006) criteria for operationalizing different levels of categorization.
Schmidt and Stock (2009) applied basic level theory to analyze categories commonly used
to represent emotion in images. Subjects were asked to express their perceptions of the intensity
of five fundamental emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness and sadness) evoked by 30
Flickr images. To indicate the intensity of emotion, subjects used a Likert scale ranging from
zero (no intensity) to 10 (very high intensity). Subjects were also asked to provide category terms
representing the content of each image as well as the impressions and associations evoked by the
image. Schmidt and Stock applied the coding scheme developed by Green (2005) and used by
Rorissa and Iyer (2008; Rorissa, 2008) to identify levels of categorization for the assigned terms
and found that participants tended to provide basic level categories to express emotions (e.g.,
HAPPY rather than its subordinates EUPHORIC or CHEERFUL).
In an early study, Fernandez and Eastman (1990) looked at the relationship between levels
of specificity and the MeSH hierarchical tree structure for the term endocrine disease. The study
observed that the highest number of terms and postings occurred at the middle level of the
MESH hierarchy. Fernandez and Eastman suggest that this is because most terms at the
intermediate level actually correspond to “fundamental concepts with respect to endocrine
diseases” (p. 63). They argue that this finding appears to contradict the commonly held belief
that specific terms are used more often to represent the conceptual content of a resource. This
finding would seem to controvert Iyer's (1995) contention that basic level terms fail to represent
the specificity of categories and therefore make poor search terms in information retrieval

79

systems (Iyer, 1995). Unfortunately, however, Fernandez and Eastman fail to provide
justification for why they equate the middle level of the MESH hierarchy with basic level
categories, thereby undermining the validity of their findings.
Iyer (1995) discusses the pros and cons of applying the theory of basic level categories in
knowledge representation and organization systems. She points out that criticism of the utility of
basic level categories for indexing and information retrieval focus on the lack specificity of basic
level terms, which is assumed to make them poor search terms. In contrast, arguments
advocating the use of basic level terms in indexing claim that, given their supposed universality,
basic level terms offer a means for “communicating” across different systems of knowledge
representation, a claim supported only by reference to Green’s research.
Although the universality of basic level terms is generally assumed to offer positive effects
for information representation and retrieval (Bates, 1998; Hoenkamp, Stegeman & Schomaker,
1999), few studies have actually tested the utility of basic level terms in the LIS environment.
Furthermore, studies that have investigated basic level terms generally have not accounted for
how basic level categories were operationalized. Several studies (e.g., Rorissa & Iyer, 2008;
Rorissa, 2008; Schmidt & Stock, 2009) have adapted the coding scheme that Green (Green,
Bean, Hudon, 2002; Green, 2006) devised based on WordNet. Although WordNet is a
hierarchically structured lexical database of English words that has become the “de facto
standard because it is freely available for research” (Ide & Wilks, 2007, p. 52; emphasis in
original), it was constructed based on paradigmatic relations between nouns and verbs, and this
can lead to difficulties when attempting to determine the appropriate semantic level of a term.
For example, because WordNet does not include adjectives, Schmidt and Stock (2009) were
forced to identify derivative nouns (e.g., happiness) to identify hierarchical relationships.

80

Basic level categories vary across individuals and across cultures because of differences in
the everyday experiences and activities of individuals. However, the operationalization of basic
level terms in LIS research, based on Green’s (2006) analysis of WordNet does not take into
account the relational nature of basic level terms as exemplified by Heidegger’s notion of
handiness. Furthermore, operationalization of basic level categories based on WordNet's
hierarchical structure not only presents challenges for the determination of a term's exact
semantic level but also discounts the importance of the context in which the term has been used.
The implications of Heidegger’s notion of handiness for basic level category research in
LIS is obvious: Operationalization of basic level categories based on the hierarchical structure of
normalized vocabularies cannot account for variations in the relational structures of individuals,
much less variations in shared conceptual structures across cultures. A more effective approach
to operationalizing basic level categories must take into account the contextualized experiences
of individuals actively engaging with objects in order to assess their understanding of an object's
“thingly quality” (Heidegger, 1953/1996, p. 65) and its relationship to other objects. An
approach to the study of basic level categories that eschews the structures of concretized
vocabularies and focuses instead on the handiness of basis level terms could lead to the
formulation of a framework for the effective integration of user-generated vocabularies within
formalized systems of representation and organization.

Mental Models

81

Clark (1999) contends that the efficient use of language “involves the development of a
type of code that minimizes contextuality … and allows easy rote memorization of simple
strings” (p. 210):
By “freezing” our own thoughts in the memorable, context-resistant, modalitytranscending format of a sentence, we thus create a special kind of mental object –
an object that is amenable to scrutiny from multiple cognitive angles, is not doomed
to alter or change every time we are exposed to new inputs or information, and fixes
the ideas at a high level of abstraction from the idiosyncratic details of their
proximal origins in sensory input. (p. 210)
Following Clark’s argument, the theory of mental models may provide an explanation for the
cognitive efficiency of basic level categories.
Johnson-Laird (1983) developed the theory of mental models to explain their role in
deductive reasoning. Johnson-Laird (1989) defined a mental model as a “representation of a
body of knowledge – either long-term or short-term” (p. 488) that satisfies the following three
conditions:
1. its structure corresponds to the structure of the situation that it represents. 2. It can
consist of elements corresponding only to perceptible entities, in which case it may be
realized as an image, perceptual or imaginary … 3. Unlike other proposed forms of
representation, it does not contain variables … In place of a variable … a model
employs tokens representing a set of individuals. (p. 488)
For Johnson-Laird, mental representations are comprised of at least three classes: propositional
representations denoting the strings of symbols that need some type of formal syntactic rules to
be combined; mental models that represent the actual world; and images that provide views of
the model.
Williams, Hollan and Stevens (1983) suggest that a “mental model is a collection of
‘connected’ autonomous objects” (p. 133), where autonomous objects are mental objects with an
“explicit representation of state” (p. 133) and their connections to other objects. For Norman
(1983) mental models emerge from the individual’s interaction with the environment and

82

“provide predictive and explanatory power for understanding the interaction” (p. 7). Based on his
extensive observation of people’s interactions with a number of technological devices (e.g.,
calculators and text editors), he contends that
1. Mental models are incomplete.
2. People’s abilities to “run” their models are severely limited.
3. Mental models are unstable: People forget the details of the system they are using
…
4. Mental models do not have firm boundaries: similar devices and operations get
confused with one another.
5. Mental models are “unscientific”: People maintain “superstitious” behavior
patterns …
6. Mental models are parsimonious: Often people do extra physical operations rather
than the mental planning that would allow them to avoid those actions…(p. 8)
And Holland, Holyoak, Nisbett, & Thagard (1987) observe that, even though mental models are
“based in part on static prior knowledge, they are themselves transient, dynamic representations
of particular unique situations” ( p. 14). However, the “inherently transitory nature” of mental
models is a “major source of inductive change in long-term knowledge structures” since “mental
models are built by integrating knowledge in novel ways in order to achieve the system’s goals,
model construction provides the opportunity for new ideas to arise by recombination and as a
consequence of disconfirmation of model-based predictions” (p. 14).
According to Jacob and Shaw (1998), the concept of mental models is a “cognitive
construct that subsumes” (p. 158) that covers the notions of schemata (Bartlett, 1932; Rumelhart,
1984), scripts (Schank & Abelson, 1977) and frames (Minsky, 1974). Based on experimental
studies of individual memory for stories and folktales, Bartlett (1932) proposed that
remembering is guided by a mental structure or schema, which he defined as an “active
organization of past reactions, or of past experiences, which must always be supposed to be

83

operating in any well-adapted organic response” (p. 201). Mandler (1979) offers a more detailed
description of a schema as
[A] spatially and/or temporally organized structure in which the parts are connected
on the basis of contiguities that have been experienced in space or time. A schema is
formed on the basis of past experience with objects, scenes, or events and consists of
a set of (usually unconscious) expectations about what things look like and/or the
order in which they occur. The parts, or units, of a schema consist of a set of
variables, or slots, which can be filled, or instantiated, in any given instance by values
that have greater or lesser degrees of probability of occurrence attached to them. (p.
263)
While Bartlett’s study exerted a strong influence on cognitive research, Schacter (1989) points
out that subsequent studies have contributed to the further development of schema theory by
proposing the notions of scripts and frames (p. 692). For example, Minsky (1974) describes a
frame as a representation of a stereotypical situation, such as going to a child’s birthday party -- a
“remembered framework to be adapted to fit reality by changing details as necessary” (p. 1). He
characterizes a frame as a hierarchical network of nodes and relations where the top levels are
fixed and represent what is “always true about the supposed situation” while the lower levels
represent “specific instances or data” (p. 1). In contrast, Wilson and Rutherford (1989) propose
that a frame might contain information that is not specifically encoded. They point out that a
restaurant patron may presume that there is a chef even if she has not seen him.
Rumelhart (1984) argues that a schema theory is essentially a theory about knowledge that
addresses how “knowledge is represented and … how that representation facilitates the use of the
knowledge in particular ways” (p. 163). For Rumelhart, the structure of a schema is similar to
the script of a play:
Just as a play has characters that can be played by different actors at different times
without changing the essential nature of the play, so a schema has variables that can
be associated with (bound to) different aspects of the environment on different
instantiations of the schema. (pp. 163-164; emphasis in original)
	  

84

In contrast, Schank and Kass (1988) describe a script as a “pre-packaged inference chain relating
to a specific routine situation” (p. 188). For example, the restaurant script corresponds to a
prototypical dining event at a restaurant: going to a restaurant, being seated, ordering, eating,
paying, and leaving the restaurant (Schank & Kass, 1988). A previous dining experience not only
facilitates a better understanding of the script but also allows the individual to make assumptions
about intermediate actions that may not be included in the script. However, Holland et al. (1987)
argue that, while schemas are valuable for “chunking information together” (p. 12), they are not
as useful when “events are highly atypical for a given context” (p. 13).
Johnson-Laird (1983) posits that schemas provide the procedures that facilitate the
formation of mental models. For him, a schema is a “model that underlies the ability to form an
image” (p. 190). However, Wittgenstein (1953/1963) questions whether an image can act as
schema:
I get an idea of the shape of a leaf, a picture of it in my mind. – But what does the
picture of a leaf look like when it does not shew [sic] us any particular shape, but
‘what is common to all shapes of leaf’? Which shade is the ‘sample in my mind’ of
the colour green – the sample of what is common to all shades of green? “But might
there not be such ‘general’ samples? Say a schematic leaf, or a sample of pure
green?” (p. 35; emphasis in original)
For Wittgenstein proposes that the meaning of a word is in its use. Similarly, he finds that
the meaning of “samples” – how schemas are to be understood – arises not from the
samples themselves but from “the way the samples are used” (p. 35).
In spite of this lack of terminological consistency, schemas, scripts, frames and
mental models represent minor variations on a single, underlying thesis that is supported by
research across multiple domains: the individual's need to identify patterns of experience
that allow her to organize and represent her knowledge of the environment. Similarly, the

85

LIS literature provides various definitions and operationalizations of the notion of mental
models. For LIS, Westbrook (2006) recommends Doyle and Ford’s (1998) definition of
mental models as most appropriate for information studies: “A mental model of a dynamic
system is a relatively enduring and accessible, but limited, internal conceptual
representation of an external system whose structure maintains the perceived structure of
that system” (p. 17). Westbrook (2006) argues that, because information systems are
dynamic and unique to each user, they are like “locks for which information professionals
strive to construct, not a key, but a set of lock-picks” (p. 565), suggesting that mental
models serve as the “lock-picks” that facilitate a user’s interaction with an information
system.
The theory of mental models has been employed in LIS to investigate such issues as
bibliographic retrieval systems (e.g., Dimitroff, 1992), digital libraries (e.g., Makri, Blandford,
Gow, Rimmer, Warwick, & Buchanan, 2007), the Internet and the web (e.g., Zhang, 2008),
search engines (e.g., Efthimiadis & Hendry, 2005), and databases (e.g., Holman, 2010).
Borgman (1986) investigated how mental models formed through training affected the use of a
prototype online catalog. She conducted an experiment using two sets of training materials:
model-based training materials relied on a system model analogous to the card catalog that
explained Boolean logic using sets of catalog; and procedural training materials similar to system
manuals that provided little guidance on how to actually perform searches detailing, instead, the
historical development of systems and their benefits over manual searching. 32 subjects were
divided into two groups representing the model-based and procedural experimental conditions,
and were asked to perform five simple search tasks requiring the use of one index and one
Boolean operator and ten complex tasks requiring the use of two or more indexes and one or

86

more Boolean operators. Analysis of results of the search tasks and of follow-up interviews in
which subjects described how they thought the system worked found that subjects exposed to
model-based training demonstrated better performance on complex tasks involving extrapolation
from the basic operations of the system. The study also observed a lack of correlation between
training conditions and model articulation; and Borgman suggests that one of possible reasons
for this is the “methodological difficulty of capturing a person’s mental model” (p. 60).
Dimitroff (1992) studied the relationship between the end user’s mental model of a
bibliographic retrieval system and the search outcome. She measured the completeness of the
end user’s mental model using eight criteria related to bibliographic retrieval systems: contents
of the database; interactive nature of the system; existence of multiple files; knowledge of
multiple fields within each record; knowledge of multiple indexes and/or inverted indexes;
Boolean search capability; keyword search capability; and use of controlled vocabulary (p. 146).
The study indicated that end users with more complete mental models found significantly more
items and made significantly fewer mistakes. However, even users with complete mental models
made errors, such as the use of too few search terms and incorrect subject-heading selection.
Like Borgman (1986), Dimitroff argues that a complete model does not “insure error-free
searching” (p. 146) and that successful searching is feasible “even when subjects are not able to
articulate a complete mental model” (pp. 146-147) of the system. One limitation in both of these
studies is the seeming failure to account for differences between the system model designed by
the study and an actual user's mental model since even models developed through training will
likely differ due to fundamental differences between the designer’s model of the system and a
user’s pre-existing model.

87

Makri, Blandford, Gow, Rimmer, Warwick and Buchanan’s (2007) study of mental
models of traditional and digital libraries demonstrated that subjects tend to employ their general
knowledge of Internet search to find relevant information in digital libraries. The study found
that a majority of subjects failed to make appropriate distinctions between different kinds of
digital resources (e.g., online catalogues, digital libraries, abstracting services, search engines).
Although the study was based on a homogeneous population of Library and Information Science
and Human-Computer Interaction graduate students, it employed only eight subjects, which
limited both its validity and its generalizability.
Zhang (2008) examined the effects of mental models of the web on the searching behaviors
of 44 undergraduate students. The mental models of each subject was operationalized as a
drawings representing the subject’s perception of the web and a verbal description of the
drawing. The study identified four different types of mental models exhibited by subjects:
technical, functional, process and connection. The technical model represented the web as a
network of computers, servers and other computer technology; the functional model depicted it
as a place for shopping, entertainment, research, communication and information seeking; the
process model treated the web as a search engine; and the connection model viewed it as a tool to
connect information, people, technologies and webpages. To analyze the relationship between a
subject's mental model and her search behavior, the study used four measures of search behavior:
the subject's navigation and performance; the subject's personal assessment of tasks and her
performance on them; the subject's query construction; and the subject’s search patterns. The
study found different patterns of navigation and querying associated with the different mental
models: For example, subjects using the connection model were more likely to navigate by

88

following links or typing URLs. However, none of the observed differences was statistically
significant.
Efthimiadis and Hendry (2005) investigated mental models of search engines. Over 200
undergraduate and graduate students were asked to draw their understanding of how a search
engine works. The “completeness” of a participant’s mental model was assessed based on a
predefined model of a search engine comprised of three “phases,” each with its embedded
“processing components” (p. 595): indexing with the components content, spidering/crawling,
parsing/inverted index creation, link analysis, and storage; searching with the components user,
user-need, query, and results; and matching with the components query processing, matching,
accessing inverted files, and ranking (p. 596). Analysis of the sketches demonstrated the
prevalence of “simple concepts” that emerged from “basic interaction” with the system (e.g.,
content, query, results, and matching) and the lack of “esoteric concepts” such as inverted files,
query parsing and link analysis (p. 596). However, the underlying assumption that subjects share
components of a predefined model does not take into account distinctive components of a
subjects’ mental models and thus misses individual differences among subjects, such as preexisting knowledge of a system, which Zhang (2009) suggests can affect a user’s mental model
of an information retrieval system.
Application of the theory of mental models is also a subject of controversy in LIS (e.g.,
Frohmann, 1990, 1992). Frohmann (1990) criticizes the mentalist view of indexing, arguing that
the “rule-governed” assignment of an index term is, in Wittgenstein’s terms, a practice rather
than a “mental operation explained by reference to internally represented and tacitly known
rules” (p. 81). For Frohmann, indexing is a social practice:
[C]onstruction of indexing rules institutes or facilitates particular kinds of retrieval
practices and depends, therefore, upon a preliminary understanding of the social

89

practices constituting text retrieval in the actual, historically real social world.
(Frohmann, 1990, p. 97)
In response to Frohmann and other criticisms of the mentalistic view, Jacob and Shaw (1998)
propose a sociocognitive approach to representation:
Sociocognitive research in information science will support the supervening goal of
efficient and effective retrieval by facilitating the development of representational
languages and organizational structures that reflect the needs of specific language
games or of specific knowledge domains or linguistic communities. (p. 170)
Rogers (2004) argues that one of the problems with the application of theories imported
from fields such as cognitive psychology is that they are often developed in a controlled
laboratory environment and do not take into account factors experienced in a real world
situation; and recent studies have articulated alternatives to cognitive interpretations of the
individual's representational and organizational behavior. For example, Suchman (2007)
proposes a theory of situated action, arguing that, instead of producing “formal models of
knowledge and action,” there is a need to “explore the relation of knowledge and action to the
particular circumstances in which knowing and acting invariably occur” (pp. 178-179).
Suchman assumes that the “coherence of action is not adequately explained by either
preconceived cognitive schema or institutionalized social norms” but, rather, by the
“organization of situated action …[as] an emergent property of moment-by-moment interactions
between actors and between actors and the environments of their actions” (p. 177). For Suchman,
emergent properties are neither predetermined nor random but arise from relationships between
“structures of action and the resource and constraints afforded by material and social
circumstances” (p. 177). Action is contingent on the “complex world of objects, artifacts, and
other actors, located in space and time” (p. 177); however, this “complex world” is not an

90

“extraneous problem” but the “essential resource that makes knowledge possible and gives
action its sense” (p. 177).
Affective computing studies suggest that cognition is not only rational but also emotional
and that systems based on cognitive models should also address the affective aspects of cognition
(e.g., Picard, 1997; Norman, 2004). Boehner, DePaula, Dourish and Sengers (2005) propose that
the emotions are not simply a constitutive part of information processing but also a “social and
cultural product experienced through … interactions” (p. 59). They suggest that adopting an
interactional approach would shift the focus from facilitating computer understanding of human
emotions to facilitating the individual's understanding and experience of her own emotions.
Thus, the success of such a system would not be measured by whether the system understood
users emotions but whether the system “encourage[d] awareness of and reflection on emotions in
users individually and collectively” (pp. 59-60). Boehner et al. (2007) argue that, in order to
address emotional experiences, there must be a “move beyond natural-scientific conceptions of
emotion, which tend to sideline people’s felt emotions in preference for objective measurements”
(p. 289).
Recent research suggests the growing popularity of the grounded theories of cognition,
which assume that cognition is “grounded in multiple ways, including simulations, situated
action, and, on occasion, bodily states” (Barsalou, 2008, p. 619). According to this view, there is
no central module for cognition and all cognitive phenomena are “ultimately grounded in (and
emerge from) a variety of bodily, affective, perceptual, and motor processes” (Pezzulo, Barsalou,
Cangelosi, Fischer, Rae, & Spivey, 2013, p. 612). Because cognition can be grounded in
multiple ways, Pezzulo, Barsalou, Cangelosi, Fischer, McRae, and Spivey (2013) propose the

91

formulations and testing of more specific hypotheses that identify factors influencing a cognitive
process (e.g., whether bodily state, situated simulation or both influence a cognitive process).
Indeed, whether human cognition is interpreted using a theory of mental models, of situated
action, of affective computing or of grounded cognition, there is a basic agreement on the idea
that an individual's representational and organizational behavior is neither fixed nor stable.
However, the underlying thesis that is supported by research across multiple domains is that the
individual's need for order and the identification of experiential patterns that allow her to
navigate, acquire, organize and represent knowledge. Questions remain as to how these patterns
are communicated and what factors actually influence knowledge representation. One possible
approach to understanding an individual’s personal representation and organization of
knowledge is to investigate her use of language. As Wittgenstein’s (1953/1963) contends that
language, in particular, the meaning it conveys is manifested in the forms of life in which the
individual participates – it is intimately interwoven with the individual’s specific world view and
understanding.

Genre
Egan and Shera (1952) propose that knowledge organization is a communicative tool in the
production, dissemination and use of knowledge. Andersen (2008) views knowledge
organization and representation as a “consequence of society’s attempt to organize itself through
its use of the various means and modes of communication” (p. 359) and argues that
“[o]rganizing knowledge in information systems can be considered a rhetorical action and thus
part of a rhetorical situation” (p. 359):
In much the same way it can be said that knowledge organization effects a
constitution of the documents registered (and thus of the genre and activity systems

92

they are used in) when choosing which documents to include for description and how
to describe them. This choice determines which documents can be retrieved and in
what ways they can be retrieved, and shows that the discourse of knowledge
organization is to some extent of a rhetorical nature. (p. 360)
Because the meaning of a document is constructed and produced through its genre or, in Miller’s
(1984) terms, through its “typified rhetorical actions based in recurrent situations” (p. 159),
knowledge organization cannot “ignore the role … [of the] genre …[in] the production,
dissemination, and use of documents” (Andersen, 2008, p. 360).
Genre has been investigated in various domains, including rhetoric (e.g., Jamieson &
Campbell, 1982), linguistics (e.g., Askehave & Swales, 2001; Bhatia, 1993; Schryer, 2002),
anthropology (e.g., Hanks, 1987), media (e.g., Corner, 1991; Neale, 1995), psychology (e.g.,
Mandler, 1984) and LIS (e.g., Crowston & Kwasnik, 2003; Montesi & Navarrete, 2008; Montesi,
2010; Rosso, 2005). Researchers in these domains study genre from unique disciplinary
perspectives, offering definitions of genre that are shaped by the perspective of their respective
domains. In rhetoric, for example, Jamieson and Campbell (1982) have defined genre as a
“dynamic fusion of substantive, stylistic, and situational elements and … constellations that are
strategic responses to the demands of the situation and purposes of the rhetor” (p. 146). Based on
Jamieson and Campbell's definition, Miller (1984) describes genre as a “conventional category
of discourse based in large-scale typification of rhetorical action; as action, it acquires meaning
from situation and from the social context in which that situation arose” (p. 163). From Miller’s
perspective, then, genre is a “rhetorical means for mediating private intentions and social
exigence; it motivates by connecting the private with the public, the singular with the recurrent”
(p. 163); and she argues that learning about genre helps us to “understand better the situations in
which we find ourselves and the potentials for failure and success in acting together” (p. 165).

93

From a linguistic perspective, Swales (1990) defines genre as a “class of communicative
events, the members of which share some set of communicative purposes” (p. 58). In contrast to
Miller’s (1982) contention that genre represents shared knowledge of situational types, Swales
argues that communicative purposes are shared among members of a given “discourse
community” and “constitute the rationale for the genre” (p. 58). However, Askehave and Swales
(2001) acknowledge that determining communicative purpose as a means for assigning genre
membership can be challenging, particularly for types of documents with multiple purposes. For
example, a company brochure may serve as promotional material as well as an internal document
that provides a better understanding of the company’s core values. Accordingly, Askehave and
Swales modified the rationale for using communicative purpose as the determinant of genre,
proposing that:
[P]urpose (more exactly sets of communicative purposes) retains the status as a
‘privileged’ criterion, but … [i]t is no longer privileged by centrality, prominence or
self-evident clarity, nor indeed by the reported beliefs of users about genres… its
status as reward or payoff for investigators as they approximate to completing the
hermeneutic circle. (p. 210)
Bauman (1999), a linguistic anthropologist, suggests that each genre is defined by its
“thematic or referential capacities, as a routinized vehicle for encoding and expressing particular
orders of knowledge and experience” (p. 85). He specifically points to the referential orientation
of genres as part of the “indexical field implicated in relationships of generic intertextuality” (p.
85). For example, curing chants within healing rituals can also be performed in other contexts for
entertainment, for the pleasure of the chanter, or for instructional purposes to teach a novice
healing practitioner (p. 85). Based on his study of sixteenth-century official Mayan documents
such as letters, chronicles, land surveys, and agreements, Hanks (1987) argues that genres
"derive their thematic organization from the interplay between systems of social value, linguistic
convention, and the world portrayed" (p. 671). For Hanks, genres are “open-ended and only

94

partially specified” (p. 688) with the source of this open-endedness residing in the “process of
reception” (p. 688) or “‘social evaluation’ of discourse, namely how it [is] was interpreted by
contemporaries and descendants” (p. 688); and Hanks contends that genres are “grounded in
social practices of production and reception, rather than having an independent existence of their
own” (pp. 676-677).
Hanks’s notion of genres is closely aligned to Bakhtin and Medvedev’s (1928/1985)
conceptualization of genre as an “aggregate of the means for seeing and conceptualizing reality”
(p. 137). For Bakhtin (1986), genres are kinds of practice that characterized by their
“addressivity” (p. 95): Different genres correspond to different “conceptions of the addressee”
and are “determined by that area of human activity and everyday life to which the given
utterance is related” (p. 95).
Working from the perspective of media studies, Neale (1995), argues that genre is not only
related to films, but also to the audience that interacts with the medium by means of
expectations. Corner (1991) contends that, for media studies, genre plays an important role in the
“directing of audience choice and of audience expectations” (p. 276) and the “organizing of the
subsets of cultural competences and dispositions appropriate for watching, listening to and
reading different kinds of things” (p. 276).
Overall, each discipline reflects in its definitions of genre, its particular purpose for genre
categorization. Thus, linguists employ genre to interpret specific features of language that are
relevant to different forms of writing; rhetoricians use genre to explain the social and cultural
factors of language in use, and psychologists examine the influence of genre on reading
comprehension and text categorization according to the mode(s) of cognitive processing
required by different types of text structure (Rosso, 2005). For example, Mandler (1984)

95

employs notions of story grammar and story schema to investigate the structure of stories.
According to Mandler, story grammar is a “rule system devised for the purpose of describing the
regularities” (p. 18) in a particular text (e.g., the units of a story, their constituent structure, and
the sequencing of constituents), whereas story schema is a “mental structure consisting of sets of
expectations about the way in which stories proceed” (p. 18). Based on previous studies (e.g.,
Rumelhart, 1975), Mandler suggests that traditional stories generally adhere to the following
order of constituents: the setting that introduces a protagonist and other characters, one or more
episodes that form the overall plot of the story, and a final episode that ends the story. Each
episode is based on a beginning constituent (one or more events), followed by a development
that covers the protagonist’s reaction to the beginning constituent, and her plan and/or goal to
respond to the beginning event(s). Furthermore, each constituent has a specific type of
connection with the next constituent that is either temporal or causal.
Although studies have observed the tendency of participants to apply some type of
structure even to non-meaningful sequences of digits and letters (e.g., Klahr, Chase, & Lovelace,
1983), no one structure can apply to texts as diverse as newspaper articles, journal articles and
recipes (Mandler, 1984). Questions remain as to how best to investigate whether individuals are
aware of textual structure and how this knowledge is used in processing text. Does textual
structure become incorporated in the individual’s knowledge system? Mandler (1984) contends
that, along with domain specific knowledge, the structure of a text facilitates both the acquisition
of meaning and a deeper understanding of a given subject or text.
In a pilot study, Mandler (1984) asked 15 subjects to identify natural units in 12 stories.
Each story represented one of three structural types: then-connected stories with two complete
temporally conjoined episodes; causally connected episodes; and ending-embedded stories in

96

which the ending of one episode forms the beginning of the next. Analysis using hierarchical
clustering to generate a tree structure of the clusters into which each sentence best fits revealed
that, overall, there is a strong resemblance between the structure expected by the grammar and
the structure obtained from subjects' judgments about stories. In particular, subjects
demonstrated agreement in identifying two episodes in the then-connected and ending-embedded
stories. Overall, the smallest units of the text, such as the setting and the components of the
episodes (i.e., beginning, complex reaction, attempt, outcome, and ending), were identified better
in successively structured stories than in episodic structures where one episode was embedded in
the middle of another. However, subjects indicated lack of agreement on the assignment of
terminal units to larger units within episodes, as suggested by the story grammar. Mandler (1984)
suggests that this lack of agreement might have been due to difficulties subjects experienced in
separating specific content from structural judgments.
In a similar study, Dillon (1991) conducted two experiments investigating perceptions of
the structure of a typical academic journal article and how that structure might be affected by
presentation. In the first experiment, Dillon asked 12 subjects, who were professional researchers
and experienced users of academic articles, to reassemble two academic articles that had been
cut into parts. He found that subjects recognized the introduction, method, results, and
discussion sections of the academic article with approximately 80% accuracy. However, subjects
tended to misplace secondary headings and figures/tables and to confuse paragraphs belonging
either to the introduction or discussion sections. In the second experiment, Dillon investigated
whether experienced users of academic publications and computer technologies could predict the
location of five paragraphs from an electronic academic journal article. Subjects were given 20
paragraphs and were asked to find the probable location of each paragraph within the

97

introduction, method, results, and discussion sections. Analysis did not demonstrate significant
differences in subject performance for the electronic text except that mean performance time to
complete a task was significantly faster with the text presented on paper than for the text
presented on-screen. Dillon argued that the ability of subjects to accurately predict the location
of text units shows that experienced users of this particular genre of text “possess a
superstructure or model of that text” (p. 922). Although the study lacks generalizability due to its
small sample size and highly experienced population, it demonstrates that scholars may share an
understanding or mental model of the genre of the academic articles.
In line with the theory of mental models, van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) propose a notion of
strategic discourse processing, which suggests that during the process of reading a reader creates
hypotheses regarding of the structure and meaning of a text: The reader constructs a textbase to
comprehend discourse, which, in the case of its successful development, facilitates the
establishment of a situation model in memory. In van Dijk and Kintsch’s terms, the situation
model is a “cognitive representation of the events, actions, persons and in general the situation, a
text is about” (pp. 11-12). The foundation of the textbase is a set of macrostrategies that brings
overall coherence to the text. According to van Dijk and Kintsch, headings, titles, opening
sentences, and other forms of organization in the text are direct manifestations of the
macrostructure of a discourse. Moreover, various types of discourse may stimulate
superstructures, and those which occur with greater regularity facilitate the reader’s schematic
processing strategy. Using this strategy, the reader attempts to “activate a relevant superstructure
from semantic memory as soon as the context or the type of text suggests a first cue” (p. 16). In
Clark’s (1999) terms, the structure of the text facilitates “‘piggy-backing’ on reliable

98

environmental properties” and the “exploitation of external structure” (p. 45), which he has
dubbed scaffolding.
Bakhtin points out that “text lives only by coming into contact with another text (with
context)” (1986, p. 162). For Bakhtin, contact with another text is a “dialogic contact between
texts (utterances) and not a contact of ‘oppositions,’ which is possible only within a single text
(and not between a text and context) among abstract elements (signs within a text), and is
necessary only in the first stage of understanding” (p. 162). Bakhtin introduces the notion of
heteroglossia , which ensures the prevalence of context over text and serves as a ground for
understanding the meaning of any utterance. He argues that
at any given moment of its historical existence, language is heteroglot from top to
bottom: it represents the co-existence of socio-ideological contradictions between the
present and the past, between differing epochs of the past, between different socioideological groups in the present, between tendencies, schools, circles and so forth,
all given a bodily form. (1981, p. 291)
Unitary language stands in opposition to heteroglossia in that a unitary language is “an abstract
grammatical system of normative forms, taken in isolation from the concrete, ideological
conceptualizations that fill it, and in isolation from the uninterrupted process of historical
becoming” (p. 288).
For Bakhtin (1981), literary language is “stratified… in the forms that carry its meanings”
by means of “specific organisms called genres (p. 288; emphasis in original). Bakhtin points out
that:
Certain features of language (lexicological, semantic, syntactic) will knit together
with the intentional aim, and with the overall accentual system inherent in one or
another genre: oratorical, publicistic, newspaper and journalistic genres… Certain
features of language take on the specific flavor of a given genre: they knit together
with specific points of view, specific approaches, forms of thinking, nuances and
accents characteristic of the given genre. (p. 289)

99

Thus genre not only intertwines with language but also provides a framework that facilitates
communication.
LIS genre studies draw heavily on Yates and Orlikowski’s (1992) conceptualization of
genre (e.g., Crowston & Kwasnik, 2003; Roussinov et al., 2001; Montesi & Navarreti, 2008),
Yates and Orlikowski posit that the “genre of organizational communication (e.g.,
recommendation letter or proposal) is a typified communicative action invoked in response to a
recurrent situation” (1992, p. 301). Building on the assumptions of the heory of structuration –
that the production, reproduction, and transformation of social institutions are enacted through
the use of social rules by individuals – Yates and Orlikowski argue that organizational
communication is not the “result of isolated, rational actions” but is “part of an embedded social
process that over time produces, reproduces, and modifies particular genres of communication”
(1992, p. 323).
Researchers in LIS have suggested that genre may have implications for knowledge
representation and organization (e.g., Andersen, 2008; Crowston & Kwasnik, 2003; Lee &
Zhang, 2013) and information seeking and retrieval (e.g., Kwasnik, Crowston, Nilan, &
Roussinov, 2001; Roussinov et al., 2001; Symonenko, 2008). Beghtol (2001) posits that genre
analysis could be used to create a “framework of analysis for a domain” that can help “structure
and interpret texts, events, ideas, decisions, explanations and every other human activity in that
domain” (p. 19). Crowston and Williams (2000) argue that it is important to understand how
genres enable communication, given that genre can either facilitate communication or “lead to
genre confusion” (p. 204) in the case of misunderstanding a newly introduced genre.
Crowston and Kwasnik (2003) suggest that “identification and use of document genre as a
facet of document and query representation” (p. 346) could improve performance and enhance

100

resource representation in information retrieval systems. Because “topical” (p. 353) and
hierarchical representation of document genre in top-down library systems, such as Dewey
Decimal Classification [DDC] and Library of Congress Subject Headings [LCSH], does not take
into account the social context, application of the facet analysis approach could provide
“multiple fundamental dimensions …[that] can be described and then clustered” (p. 357).
According to Crowston and Kwasnik, application of a faceted approach to genres would be
comprised of two preliminary phases: identification and labeling of important facets, such as
form, content, style, and relationship to other documents, and revision of identified genres to
“see the range of categories on which these facets are revealed” (p. 357).
Crowston and Kwasnik point out that genre identification “provides information as to the
document’s purpose and its fit to the user’s situation, which can be otherwise difficult to assess”
(p. 350). For example, a university professor may employ a similar search strategy to find
educational materials (e.g., syllabi, presentations) for developing a course or for writing a
research paper (e.g., scholarly articles); however, relevance of the retrieved documents for these
two searches are very different. Andersen (2008) argues that “this is a crucial argument in favor
of genre because much thinking on document representation in LIS has ignored the purpose of a
document and its fit to the user’s situation; that is, the information provided by genre” (p. 346).
However, for Crowston and Kwasnik, the efficacy of employing of genre is an “open question”
(p. 360) because the “extent to which the general inclusion of genre information will enhance
information access” (p. 360) is not clear.
Vaughan and Dillon (2006) studied the impact of digital genres on subjects’ mental
representations of structure. In the first phase of the study, expert news readers and humancomputer interaction professionals were asked to identify web page design, navigation, and story

101

categorization that either conformed to or violated the web news genre. Prototype websites,
created for the experimental study, reflected recommendations of the experts in web news page
design and navigation. For example, story categorization in the genre-conforming design
included traditional news categories (e.g., local news, national news, arts and entertainment),
whereas the genre-violating design used labels reflecting time and geography (e.g., few days ago,
future, very far away). In the second phase, a longitudinal study examined how 25 novice web
news readers, randomly assigned to one of the two designs, comprehended (i.e., recall and
recognition), used (i.e., time on task, accuracy, and user satisfaction), and navigated (i.e., path
length and category node hits) the web news sites. Subjects were given 20 minutes to read, recall
information from headlines and news stories and then perform six information-seeking tasks.
Subjects were also asked to indicate their satisfaction with the web newspaper design on a Likert
scale of 1 to 7. Vaughan and Dillon’s analysis revealed that subjects using the genre-conforming
design performed significantly better in comprehension (p< .001), usability (p< .01) and
navigation (p< .001). The study also showed a significant increase for the genre-violating group
in the breadth of navigation for different tasks (e.g., number of nodes visited). However, the
study did not find any correlation between website design and comprehension or usability.
Vaughan and Dillon suggest that better performance of the genre-conforming group indicates
that the “creation and maintenance of expectations has a basis in one’s cognitive processes,
particularly in facilitating the development of mental representations of structure” (p. 525). They
also contend that, over time, consistent structure—whether it is a “correct” or no— “will allow
users to build mental representations of an information space” (2006, p. 525). Vaughan and
Dillon conclude that understanding “individual thought processes,”and, in particular, “mental
representations of text structure suggest[ing] how a user’s mental representation of a text can

102

arise, the varying forms it can take, and how it can affect a user’s performance in information
processing terms” provides a “natural extension to genre” (p. 504). However, Vaughan and
Dillon comments appear to be limited to a notion of genre as textual resources and ignore the
dialogical and situational nature of genre.
Paolillo, Warren, and Kunz (2007) applied social network analysis to examine social
context of the emerging genres by investigating of user profiles and corpus-based quantitative
genre analysis of 160 randomly selected movies posted on Newgrounds.com. Genre analysis was
based on a register approach: Structural features were identified and then operationalized and
analyzed across the sampled artifacts. The study identified the following three criteria of genre:
“genres have shared forms or structural patterns,” “they have recurrent communicative
purposes,” and “they are socially recognized as categories of communication, often being named
by those who use them” (p. 1). Paolillo et al. identified two factors that contributed to the
emergence of a new genre: the importance of social position for gaining popularity in the
Newgrounds community, and discourse on Flash quality. They argued that the interplay of these
two factors through “sharing, rating, and reviewing Flash content in a massive, open forum” (p.
9) has created an avatar movie genre with subgenres. Moreover, the new genre is manifested in
“highly conventionalized forms” (p. 9), such as abstract avatars with noncanonical faces,
computer-generated voices, and “well-recognized messages of social positioning” (p. 9). In line
with previous studies, Paolillo et al. concluded that social processes play an important role in
understanding of the “genre emergence” (p. 9).
In a series of studies, Montesi (Montesi & Navarrete, 2008; Montesi & Owen, 2008;
Montesi, 2010) studied the effects of the web genre on information seeking and knowledge
representation and organization. Montesi and Navarrete (2008) investigated the role of web

103

genre in the information behavior of a software engineer. Analysis of 1,319 web resources
revealed that the genre of resources was mainly used for orientation, direction or introduction,
and problem solution (p. 1425). In a subsequent study, Montesi (2010) studied genre preferences
of users in bookmarking resources. Analysis of 833 bookmarks revealed that 42% of bookmarks
represented home pages; 26% represented the content type of resources (e.g., article/scientific
work, blog, FAQ), 18% were navigational (e.g., indexes, resource page, and table of contents);
and 12% were transactional (e.g., registration form, search interface, library catalogue).
Rosso (2005) investigated whether genre facilitated information seeking and retrieval. In
the first stage of the study, three users were asked to categorize, label and define the genre of
printouts of a sample of 100 web pages from the academic “.edu” domain. In the second stage of
the study, Rosso asked a group of ten subjects to refine the 48 genres identified in the first stage.
The process of genre refinement trimmed the original set of 48 genres to 18: article, course
description, course list, diary/weblog or blog, FAQ/help, form, forum or interactive discussion
archive, index or table of contents/links, job listing, other instructional materials, personal
website, picture or photo, poetry, product for sale or shopping, search start page, speech,
welcome or homepage, and none of the above. The third stage of the study was conducted online
and asked 257 users to categorize a new set of 55 web pages using the list of 18 genres identified
previously. In the fourth and final stage, 32 users were asked to evaluate the relevance of 40
search results provided either with or without genre-annotation. Rosso found that genreannotated search results did not significantly improve a user’s ability to make more consistent or
faster relevance judgments:
Overall, this study was unable to detect any quantitative evidence that genreannotated descriptions had on the decision process. Neither indicativity nor decision
time was improved, either overall or by task … only 17 of 32 participants reported

104

even noticing the genre label in the descriptions! Even just looking at the data …
from those seventeen, the pattern of results was unchanged. (p. 176)	  	  
It appears that Rosso’s treatment of genre as form and text type, ignored users’ perception
and/or understanding of resources, in particular, their genre.
Even though it seems that LIS scholars have agreed with the importance of
representing genre in the systems of knowledge representation anda organization, LIS
studies lack of a theoretical framework within which LIS implementation and research
could proceed. Because genre is part of a social process or context that ultimately
represents, produces, reproduces, and modifies a particular genre, questions remain as to
how to integrate genre and situation, or text and context, in systems of knowledge
representation and organization. Given Devitt’s (1993) argument that “our construction of
genre is what helps us to construct a situation” (p. 577), representing genre as “typified
rhetorical actions based in recurrent situations” (Miller, 1984, p. 159) might be
implemented in the form of genre tags generated by a particular group or community of
users. In this regard, Devitt (1993) suggests that:
rather than looking at human membership to define community, perhaps discourse
membership – that is, genre sets – can better define the nature and constitution of a
discourse community, just as the community better defines the nature of the
discourse. (p. 582)
Application of user-generated genre tags could potentially provide a better resource
representation, which, in turn, might lead to improved search precision.

Research Questions and Hypotheses
Research on user-generated tagging vocabularies has yet to investigate two important
assumptions on which many of these studies have been based: that a user-generated vocabulary

105

constitutes a shared indexing language which can be used to represent the intellectual content of
resources; and that a user-generated vocabulary facilitates the identification and retrieval of
resources relevant to user’s need. Comparative studies of user-generated tags and indexing
languages have been based, in large part, on attempts to match user-generated tags with
controlled vocabularies (e.g., Lin et al., 2006; Rolla, 2009; Wetterstrom, 2008). For example,
Kipp (2006) claimed to be able to relate 92% of the tags in a user-generated vocabulary with
terms in the INSPEC and Library Literature thesauri18. Based on word matching of usergenerated tags with LCSH, Yi and Chan (2009) have suggested that user-generated tags tend to
include narrower or more “specific terms” (p. 892) such as “names of software applications,
hardware products, or technologies” (p. 892). However, questions remain as to how “broad” is a
broader term and how “narrow” or “more specific” is a narrower term.
More important is the issue of basic level categories, which have been suggested by Golder
and Huberman (2006) and Munk and Mork (2007b) as a primary source of perceived agreement
in user-generated vocabularies. Rosch et al. (1976) claim that categories at the basic level of
conceptual abstraction are more cognitively efficient and therefore more accessible to users; but
the contextual nature of basic level categories leads to problems in applying Rosch's theory
across individuals, situations and cultures. Thus, while some researchers accept the thesis that the
preferred level of abstraction for tags assigned by users is the basic level, this assumption has not
yet been investigated in user-generated vocabularies. One reason for this may be the inability of
researchers to adequately define what a basic level category is. For example, because Green’s
(2006) operationalization of basic level categories was based on WordNet's hierarchical
structure, it not only fails to establish each term's exact semantic level but also ignores the
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
18

	  According to Kipp (2006), 22% of user tags were hierarchically related to terms in the thesauri; 21% were
equivalent terms; 14% were associated with thesauri terms; and 35% were related terms but were not formally
represented in the thesauri.	  

106

context in which the term originally occurred, which could significantly affect its relationships to
other terms in the WordNet vocabulary.
Studies attempting to identify and categorize the composition of user-generated
vocabularies have claimed to find a preponderance of content-related tags (e.g., Heckner,
Mühlbacher & Wolff, 2008; Munk & Mork, 2007b); but research on user tagging of musical
resources finds that tags representing musical genre are generally favored (e.g., Lamere, 2008;
Inskip, 2009). This raises further questions as to whether the content or the genre of a resource
influences the level of abstraction in user-generated tagging vocabularies.
This study was designed to investigate if there is a predominant level of abstraction in usergenerated vocabularies and if there are differences in the preferred level of abstraction of usergenerated tags based on either the intellectual content or the genre of the resources tagged. The
research investigated the broad question “Is a particular level of abstraction dominant in usergenerated tags?” More specifically, the following research questions were investigated:
1. Is there one level of abstraction (i.e., superordinate, subordinate or basic) that is
predominant in the set of tags comprising a user-generated vocabulary?
2. Does the level of abstraction of tags vary, either within or across subjects, based on the
content category of the resources being tagged?
3. Does the level of abstraction of tags vary, either within or across subjects, based on the
genre of the resources being tagged?
The proposed research project tested three null hypotheses. To determine if the basic level
of abstraction is predominant in user-generated tagging vocabularies, the following null
hypothesis was tested:

107

1. The frequency of occurrence of basic level tags in a user-generated vocabulary is the same,
both within and across subjects, as the frequency of occurrence of superordinate level tags
and subordinate level tags.
To determine if the category of a resource's intellectual content influences selection of tags by
users, the following null hypothesis was tested:
2. The frequency of occurrence of superordinate, subordinate and basic level tags assigned to
resources representing one category of content is the same, both within and across subjects,
as the frequency of occurrence of superordinate, subordinate and basic level tags assigned to
resources representing other categories of content.
To determine if the genre of a resource influences selection of tags by users, the following null
hypothesis was tested:
3. The frequency of occurrence of superordinate, subordinate and basic level tags assigned
to resources representing one genre is the same, both within and across subjects, as the
frequency of occurrence of superordinate, subordinate and basic level tags assigned to
resources representing other genres.

Method
The study was conducted to investigate whether there is a level of abstraction (i.e.,
superordinate, subordinate or basic level) that is predominant in the terms comprising a usergenerated vocabulary and whether the intellectual content (i.e., content category) or genre of a
resource affects a user’s tagging vocabulary. Because prior suggestions that basic level terms are
predominate in folksonomies (e.g., Golder & Huberman, 2006; Munk & Mork, 2007b) were
based on tagging vocabularies generated by users of the Delicious bookmarking application, who

108

were assumed to share a strong interest in information technology (IT), this study was designed
to investigate levels of abstraction in tagging vocabularies generated by a potentially more
diverse population.
The study design was based on a one-shot case study in which a single group of
participants were studied once (Campbell & Stanley, 1963). Campbell and Stanley contend that,
because the one-shot case study lacks control it has a little scientific value. However, taking into
consideration an exploratory nature of the study, the case study provides a better understanding
of a causal mechanism or interplay between general knowledge of the world with empirical
knowledge of how particular phenomenons are interrelated (Gerring, 2004). Thus, the study
reported here involved presentation of carefully selected set of online resources that were used to
elicit responses from participants. As such, it is an appropriate method for data collection and in
line with the exploratory purpose of this study: observation and comparison of the levels of
abstraction represented in tags generated by participants in response to stimuli that represented a
controlled set of content categories and genre types.
Volunteers were recruited from the population of students and faculty at Indiana University
Bloomington (IUB). Subjects were asked to assign tags to a set of 36 online resources, each of
which represented one of three resource genres identified by Rosso (2005) (i.e., news article,
blog, ecommerce) and one of four content categories used by Rosch et al. (1976) (i.e., TOOL,
CLOTHING, FRUIT and VEHICLE). To determine if a particular level of abstraction was
predominant in user-generated tagging vocabulary, each unique tag assigned by one or more
subjects was analyzed to determine its level of abstraction (i.e., superordinate, subordinate or
basic level). To validate the analysis, the level of abstraction assigned to each unique tag was
evaluated by a group of judges who were asked to rate the level of abstraction of each tag.

109

Frequencies of occurrence for superordinate, subordinate and basic level tags were determined
for each resource and an analysis of frequencies was conducted to determine if there was any
association between the level of abstraction of tags and either the content category of a resource
or its genre. Analysis of frequency of occurrence was conducted for both the set of tags assigned
by individual subjects (i.e., within subjects) and the entire tag vocabulary generated by all
subjects (i.e., across subjects).

Subjects
A group of 40 native speakers of English was recruited from the population of students and
faculty at IUB. To recruit participants for the study, notices were posted on public bulletin
boards in each building on the IUB campus and in the Herman B. Wells library (see Appendix
A). In addition, a request for participation was posted on various listservs provided by IUB
schools and departments (see Appendix B). Participants in the study were given a one-time cash
payment of $20.00.
Of the 40 subjects who participated in the study, 25 (63%) were female and 15 (38%) were
male. As shown in Table 1, two subjects (5%) were between 17 and 20, 20 (50%) were between
21 and 25, and nine (23%) were between 26 and 30. The other nine subjects were between 31
and 45.

A majority of participants identified library and information science (LIS) as their main
area of study. Of these, six participants indicated a dual degree combining LIS with another area
of study: African studies (1), art history (2), East Asian studies (1), Russian East European
studies (1), and musicology (1). Another 15 participants represented a relatively wide range of
domains in the social science and humanities (see Table 3). One participant did not indicate an

Materials
To identify the online resources to be used in the study, Google19 searches were performed
to identify a preliminary set of 15 resources for each of six non-biological object categories used
in Rosch et al.’s (1976) study: MUSICAL INSTRUMENT, TOOL, CLOTHING, FURNITURE,
VEHICLE, and FRUIT. The category FRUIT was considered a non-biological category based on
previous research of Berlin (1972), Rosch et al. (1976), and Tversky and Hemenway (1984), who
had justified treatment of FRUIT as a non-biological “object category” because it is a “humandefined part of a tree, engineered, packaged, and marketed much like a manufactured object”
(Tversky & Hemenway, 1984, p. 172).
Identification of the preliminary set of online resources was also based on the genre of the
resources. Based on an analysis of web materials found in the “.edu” domain, Rosso (2005)
identified 17 genres of online resources20. Three of the genres identified by Rosso – news article,
blog, and ecommerce – were chosen for use in this study because each provided a distinctive
representation of the “genre ecology of the Internet” (Herring, Scheidt, Bonus, & Wright, 2004,

p. 7). For each of the six content categories, a preliminary set of five resources was identified for
the news article genre, the blog genre, and the ecommerce genre using the following definitions:
• News article – textual material, issued or distributed by someone other than the
author, that reports on an event and includes supporting facts;
• Blog – a weblog entry that presents the personal opinion of the author;
• Ecommerce – an offering by an online retailer that describes or advertises a
product that is for sale online.
For each of the six content categories, the preliminary set of resources included 15
resources (i.e., five resources for each of the three genres), for a total of 90 resources. Selection
of the set of online resources to be used in the study was based on an evaluation of how well
each of the 90 preliminary resources represented both the category and the genre with which it
had been identified. To evaluate the representativeness of the resources, five judges were
recruited from faculty and doctoral students at IUB. Judges were asked to rate the
appropriateness of the content of each resource for its assigned category using a Likert scale
from 1 to 5, where 1 indicated “Not appropriate” and 5 indicated “Highly appropriate.” Judges
were also asked to rate the typicality of the genre assigned to each resource using a Likert scale
from 1 to 5, where 1 indicated “Not typical” and 5 indicated “Highly typical” (see Appendix C).
To collect judges’ ratings Qualtrics software was used: Judges were provided with an
anonymous link to the Qualtrics site, which provided them with access to the 90 preliminary
resources, and the Qualtrics software recorded the judges' ratings for the appropriateness of
category content and the typicality of genre (see Appendix D).
Judges' ratings for the category appropriateness of resource content were summed to
provide a rating score for each of the 90 resources (see Appendix E). The rating scores for all
resources representing a single content category were then summed to generate a rating score for

113

each of the six non-biological content categories used by Rosch et al. (1976). The four content
categories with the highest rating scores for content category appropriateness were then selected
for use in the study: TOOL, CLOTHING, FRUIT, VEHICLE. For resources associated with
each of the content categories selected for the study, judges' ratings for content category
appropriateness and genre typicality were summed and an overall rating score was computed as
an average of appropriateness and typicality. For each genre type (i.e., news article, blog, and
ecommerce) associated with one of the four content categories (i.e., TOOL, CLOTHING,
FRUIT, VEHICLE), the three online resources with the highest overall rating scores were
selected for use in the study.
The outcome of this process was a final set of online resources. For each of the four content
categories (i.e., TOOL, CLOTHING, FRUIT, VEHICLE) three resources were selected for each
of three genres (i.e., news article, blog, and ecommerce) for a total of 36 resources to be used in
the study (see Appendix F).

Qualtrics Software
Qualtrics21 is a web-based service that supports the data collection and analysis. The
Qualtrics software was selected for use in the study because it provided a secure and anonymous
environment for collecting and recording tags assigned to resources by participants as well as
evaluation data provided by judges. Access to the study materials was provided through a
Qualtrics generated anonymous link that directed participants to the study page. The study page
instructed participants to read/scan each resource and then assign to the resource as many tags as
they thought were appropriate for retrieval of the resource at some point in the future. Subjects
were also asked to respond to a set of demographic questions, including gender, approximate

age, area of study or expertise, and highest level of education completed that provided
instructions (see Appendix G).
All responses collected by the Qualtrics software were anonymous, including both the
tagging vocabulary generated by each participant and her demographic information. Following
completion of data collection, Qualtrics made data available both at the level of individual
response(s) and as aggregations across all subjects and generated a basic statistical analysis of
the collected data.

Procedure
The study was conducted in the IUB LIS doctoral students’ computer lab over a period of
two months. Access to the study was provided through a Qualtrics generated anonymous link
that directed subjects to the study page. The Qualtrics study page instructed subjects to read/scan
each resource and then assign to the resource as many tags as they thought were appropriate for
retrieval of the resource at some point in the future. Subjects were also asked to respond to a set
of demographic questions, including gender, approximate age, area of study or expertise, and
highest level of education completed (see Appendix H). All responses collected through this link
were anonymous.
Before beginning the actual experiment, each subject was given an informed consent form
that described the experiment and any expected consequences (see Appendix I). The participant
was asked to read the informed consent form and then sign and date two copies of the form.
After both copies of the informed consent form were signed and dated by the researcher, one was
given to subject and the other was kept by the researcher.

115

After the consent forms had been signed and dated, the researcher provided subjects with
an overview of the experiment and step-by-step instructions on how to assign tags to a resource
(see Appendicies J, K). Actual examples of resource tagging were also provided by the
researcher. A hard copy of the study instructions was also provided to the participant. The
researcher then provided the participant with a sample resource and asked her to work through
the process of assigning tags and to ask any questions she had about the tagging process before
beginning the task of assigning tags to the 36 resources used in the study, which were
randomized for presentation to each participant. After assigning one or more tags to each of the
resources, each participant was asked to respond to set of demographic questions. Each
participant was then given a one-time cash payment of $20.00 and asked to sign a receipt for the
payment.

Data Analysis and Results
Data collected in the study were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) to test the equality of means and analyze variances between groups (Aron, Aron &
Coups, 2006). The repeated measures paradigm is typically adopted as a means for reducing
error variability and for measuring certain factors (Landau & Everitt, 2004). In research using
the posttest-only control group design, effects of independent variables giving rise to the
repeated measures are assessed relative to the average responses provided by the participant on
all conditions (Landau & Everitt, 2004). Because each subject serves as her own control,
variability arising from differences in average responsiveness of participants is removed from the
extraneous error variance. This results in increased power to identify the effects of within-

116

subjects experimental factors compared with testing in a between-subjects design. However, it
may result in the lack of independence of the repeated measurements.
Repeated measures of variance is an example of a linear mixed effects model, which leads
to a separation of the overall variation in the observations into parts due to within- and between
and subject variations. Within- and between-subject variations can be further partitioned to
generate F-test scores for within- and between-subject factors and for interactions between
factors. Repeated measures assumes adherence to three criteria for validity of the F-tests:
normality of the distribution of the residuals, homogeneity of variance, and equality in the
variances of the differences between all pairs of repeated measurements (i.e., sphericity). The
assumption of sphericity is important for assessing within-subject factors. If the assumption of
sphericity is not met, calculations of variance may be distorted and the F-statistics positively
biased, leading to an increase in Type I error (Landau & Everitt, 2004). However, because tests
of sphericity (e.g., the Mauchly’s Test of Spherecity) do not have the power to detect large
violations of sphericity in a small sample size (Mauchly, 1940; Cornell, Young, Seaman, & Kirk,
1992), they were omitted.
Because an overall F-test signifies either rough equality of all group means or the existence
of some significant difference among groups and does not indicate which groups are different
from which other groups (Page, Braver, & MacKinnon, 2003), a post hoc comparison was
conducted. Post hoc tests compare each group’s mean with the means of other groups to
determine where pairwise differences lie and to show which group differences are driving the
significance of the overall F-test (Page et al., 2003). This study adopted Tukey’s Honestly
Significant Difference (HSD) test, which is one of the more common post hoc tests used to
determine which groups differ significantly (Page et al., 2003).

117

Because the assumption of the normality of the distribution of residuals was violated in the
CLOTHING and VEHICLE content categories, as demonstrated in the boxpots in Figure 10 and
Figure 11, data transformation was performed to normalize positively skewed data. Square root
transformation was applied to map tagging data for the CLOTHING content category into a more
symmetric distribution (see Figure 12). However, due to an excess of zeros and outliers in the
distribution of tags in the VEHICLE content category, normalization was unsuccessful (see
Figure 13).

Generally, failure to account for an excessive number of zeros in the count data results in
overdispersion in the marginal distribution of the count, leading to a Poisson regression model
that introduces heterogeneity based on observed characteristics (Long, 1997). The zero-inflated
Poisson (ZIP) regression model for count data that has an excess of zero counts generates two
separate models: the binomial model, which uses a logit link function, and the Poisson model,
which uses a log link function. The binomial model predicts structured zeros, or “certain zeros”,
for cases in which participants did not assign a tags specifying one of the three levels of
abstraction, while the Poisson model predicts the counts for those tags that were not “certain
zeros” or for cases in which assigned tags were not interpreted as representing one of the three
levels of abstraction. Because an excess of zeros was observed mainly with tags representing the

120

three resource genres, the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model was used to
analyze variances in the frequency of superordinate, subordinate and basic levels of tags for the
VEHICLE content category. Like the ZIP model, the ZINB model also a binary model,
comprised of a logit model and a count or a negative binomial model.

Tagging Vocabulary
A total of 7617 tags were assigned to the 36 online resources for an average of 212 tags per
resource. Of the 7617 tags, 6201 tags (81%) consisted of a single term and 1416 (19%) were
phrases. Table 4 shows the distribution of assigned tags by content categories and genres. The
distribution of tags across the four content categories was relatively even: 1989 tags (26.1%)
were assigned to resources in the CLOTHING category; 1896 tags (24.9%) were assigned to
resources in the FRUIT category; 1894 tags (24.9%) were assigned to resources in the TOOL
category; and 1838 tags (24%) were assigned to resources in the VEHICLE category.
Distribution of tags by genre showed that more tags were assigned to resources representing the
blog genre (2763, or 36.3%) than to resources representing the news (2581, or 33.9%) and
ecommerce (2273, or 29.8%) genres.

On average, each participant assigned 190 tags to the 36 resources. The maximum number
of tags assigned by a single participant was 383, or 10.6 tags per resource, and the minimum was
89 tags, or 2.2 tags per resource. The largest number of tags assigned to a single resource (281
tags) was for a resource from the CLOTHING category representing the blog genre ;22 and the
smallest number of tags assigned toa single resource (164) was for a resource from the
VEHICLE category representing the ecommerce genre. 23 Of the 40 participants in the study, 14
assigned over 200 tags. Most of these “heavy taggers” were in the 21-25 age group (n=10), had
completed a bachelor’s degree (n=9), and were female (n=10).
Analysis of the tagging vocabulary generated by study participants identified the eight
categories of tags (see Table 5): content related tags (Content); non-content related personal tags
(Non-Content/Personal); tags specifying the genre of the resource (Genre); tags specifying the
manufacturer or brand (Manufacturer/Brand); tags representing the source of the resource
(Source); tags specifying a geographical location (Geographical Location) or date (Date); and
tags identifying an individual responsible for the intellectual content of the resource (Author).
In line with previous studies of folksonomies (e.g., Munk & Mork, 2007b; Heckner et al.,
2008), content-related tags dominated with 5120 tags, which accounted for 67.2% of the total
vocabulary generated by participants. Content-related tags were comprised of tags that
represented the subject of the resource (e.g., tool, ice-cream truck, Satsuma orange, denim shirt)
or described characteristics of the subject or the resource itself (e.g., easy to use, convenient,
growing, luxury). As Table 6 demonstrates, more content tags were assigned to the resources in
the FRUIT content category (1495, or 19.6%) than to resources in the TOOL (1326, or 17.4%),

CLOTHING (1306, or 17.1%), or VEHICLE (993, or 13%) content categories. Interestingly,
participants assigned a total of only 28 Non-Content/Personal tags, or 0.37% of the total tagging
vocabulary to indicate the tagger’s opinion of or affective response to a resource (e.g., mom’s
stuff, ridiculous).

In contrast to Lamere’s (2008) study, which had found that genre tags predominated in
representations of musical resources, Table 5 shows that the 921 genre tags assigned to resources
in the study (e.g., news, blog, review, online shopping) made up only 12.1% of the tagging
vocabulary in the current study. Of the remaining tags assigned by participants, 815 (10.7%)
represented a manufacturer or brand (e.g., Weidmuller, Old Navy, Lamborghini); and a total of
773 (9.6%) represented either a resource’s web page URL or title (e.g., syracuse.com and
NYTimes), a geographical location mentioned in a resource (e.g., Los Angeles and China); a
date associated with a resource (e.g., publication date, vehicle model year), or an author
responsible for the intellectual content of a resource. Assessment of the tagging vocabulary in
relation to the functions of tags identified by Golder and Huberman (2006) and Munk and Mork
(2007b) revealed that participants had not assigned tags indicating a resource’s relation to the
tagger, tags organizing tasks, or tags representing egocentric markers. Possible explanations for
this finding could be the artificial nature of the current study, the lack of personal relevance of
resources for individual participants, or the instruction to participants to tag the resource for
future retrieval.

124

As shown in Tables 7, more content tags were assigned to resources representing the blog
genre (1826, or 35.7%) than to resources representing the news (1782, or 34.8%) or ecommerce
(1512, or 29.5%) genres. However, there were slightly more content tags assigned to ecommerce
resources in the TOOL category (432, or 8.4%) than in the CLOTHING (401, or 7.8%), FRUIT
(373, or 7.3%) and VEHICLE (306, or 6%) categories.

Comparison of the tag distributions reported in Table 8, Table 9, Table 10 shows that as
with distribution of content tags across the four content categories, the distribution of content
tags across the three genres showed that a greater number of content tags were assigned to
resources in the FRUIT category (1495, or 29.2%). Genre tags were more frequently assigned to
resources representing the blog genre (353, or 38.3% of total genre tags) than for resources
representing the news (294, or 31.9%) or ecommerce (274, or 29.8%) genres. However, the
greatest number of genre tags was assigned to news resources in the CLOTHING content
category (114, or 12.4%), followed by the number of tags assigned to blog resources in the
VEHICLE category (107, or 11.6%), and to ecommerce resources in the CLOTHING (82, or
8.9%) and FRUIT (80, or 8.7%) content categories.

Tags representing source (172, or 42.3% of all source tags), author (46, or 56.8% of all
author tags), and date (44, or 21.2% of all date tags) were more likely to be assigned to resources
representing the news genre. Tags specifying manufacturer or brand (327, or 40.1% of all
manufacturer tags) and geographical location (66, or 47.8% of all geographical location tags)
were more frequently assigned to resources representing the blog genre.
The set of tags generated by participants was analyzed to identify variant forms of
individual tags: plural and singular forms (e.g., tool – tools); different spellings (e.g., sanguinelli
– saguinelli), numeric versus letter representations (e.g., half inch drill – 0.5 inch drill); order of
terms in a phrase tags (e.g., acura mdx – mdx acura); and abbreviations (e.g., do it yourself diy). Based on this analysis, the tagging vocabulary was normalized and 1219 of the tags
assigned by participants, or 16% of the original set of 7617 tags, were identified as unique tags
or tag phrases (see Appendix L).

127

Of the 1219 unique tags, 262 tags drawn primarily from the content tag category category
were identified with one of three levels of abstraction: superordinate, subordinate or basic. A
panel of five judges was recruited to evaluate the appropriateness of the level of abstraction
proposed for each unique tag. Using Qualtrics, judges were given a list of the 262 unique tags for
which a level of abstraction that had identified by the researcher. For each tag, judges were
presented with the normalized tag, the content category for which it had been generated by
participants, the proposed level of abstraction of the tag, and a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1
was equal to “Not at all appropriate” and 5 was equal to “Highly appropriate” (see Appendicies
M, N). Judges were asked to indicate how appropriate the proposed level of abstraction was for
each tag, and ratings of appropriateness were averaged across judges to provide an
appropriateness score for each of the 262 unique tags.
Cohen’s (1960) kappa inter-rater agreement coefficient (k) was used to assess agreement
on the ratings of level of abstraction assigned to each of the 262 tags by the five judges and the
researcher. Landis and Koch (1977) published the following standards for assessing strength of
agreement based on for the kappa coefficient: from 0.40 to 0.59 indicated moderate agreement,
0.60 to 0.79 indicated substantial agreement, and over 0.80 indicated outstanding agreement. The
overall kappa coefficient for inter-rater agreement on levels of abstraction was substantial (k=
0.75), with the kappa coefficient ranging from 0.47 to 1 across the four content categories:
agreement on the FRUIT category was outstanding (k= 1); agreement on the TOOL and
CLOTHING categories was substantial (k= 0.68 for each); and agreement for the VEHICLE
category was moderate (k= 0.45).
There were 31 tags with an average appropriateness score less than 2.5, and these tags were
excluded from the analysis of levels of abstraction. This left a total of 231 (20% of the 1219

128

unique tags) which had been identified as superordinate level terms (e.g., tool, cloth, fruit), basic
level terms (e.g., orange, car, hammer), or subordinate level terms (e.g., ice-cream truck,
Satsuma orange, denim shirt). Appendix O contains a list of the 231 unique tags and the
associated level of abstraction.
As shown in Table 11, more of the unique tags identified with one of the three levels of
abstraction were assigned to resources in the TOOL content category (93, or 40.3%) than to
resources in the CLOTHING content category (50, or 21.6%), the VEHICLE content category
(45, or 19.5%), or the FRUIT content category (43, or 18.6%). Overall, unique tags representing
the subordinate level were more numerous across all four content categories and accounted for
just over two-thirds (156 tags, or 67.5%) of the unique tags identified with one of the three levels
of abstraction.

When analyzing all assignments of the unique tags, a different picture emerges.
Participants assigned the 231 unique tags a total of 2393 times. Of these 2393 tags, basic level
tags were assigned more frequently than either subordinate or superordinate tags: participants
assigned 898 basic level tags, which accounted for 37.5% of all tags identified with a level of
abstraction; 785 subordinate level tags, which accounted for 32.8%; and 710 superordinate level

129

tags, which accounted for 30%. As Table 12 demonstrates, more tags identified with a level of
abstraction were assigned to resources in the FRUIT content category (831, or 34.7% of all tags
identified with a level of abstraction) than to resources in the TOOL content category (711, or
29.7%), the CLOTHING content category (451, or 18.8%), or the VEHICLE category (400, or
16.7%).

As demonstrated in Table 13, analysis of the superordinate, subordinate and basic level tags
assigned to resources representing the three genres of resources showed that more tags
representing the superordinate level of abstraction were assigned to resources representing the
ecommerce genre (284, or 40% of all tags associated with a level of abstraction), most of which
(50 tags) were assigned to the resource for GAP children’s clothing. More tags associated with
the basic level of abstraction were assigned to the resources representing the news genre (384, or
42.8% of all tags associated with a level of abstraction), followed by basic level tags assigned to
resources representing the blog genre (264, or 29.4%) and the ecommerce genre (250, or 27.8%).
In line with the distribution of basic level tags across the four content categories, more basic
level terms were assigned to resources representing the FRUIT category across all three genres:
170 (18.9%) were assigned to resources representing the news genre, 96 (10.7%) were assigned
to resources representing the blog genre, and 86 (9.6%) were assigned to resources representing
the ecommerce genre. The largest block of basic level tags (170 tags) was assigned to resources
in the FRUIT content category representing the news genre.
Tags identified with the subordinate level of abstraction of tags were more frequently
assigned to resources representing the news genre (295, or 37.6% of all tags associated with a
level of abstraction), followed by tags assigned to resources representing the blog genre (265, or
33.8%) and the ecommerce genre (225, or 28.7%). In contrast to the distribution of subordinate
tags across the four content categories, however, subordinate level of tags assigned to resources

131

representing the three genres were relatively more scattered, with slightly more assigned to blog
resources in the FRUIT content category (149, or 19.0%) than to news resources in the
VEHICLE content category (119, or 15.2%) and ecommerce resources in the TOOL content
category (92, or 11.7%). The largest block of subordinate tags (149 tags) was assigned to
resources in the FRUIT content category representing the blog genre.

Hypotheses Testing
Hypothesis	  testing:	  H1	  	  
	  

To determine if the basic level of abstraction was predominant in user-generated tagging
vocabularies, the following null hypothesis was tested:
H1. The frequency of occurrence of basic level tags in a user-generated
vocabulary is the same, both within and across subjects, as the frequency of
occurrence of superordinate level tags and subordinate level tags.

As shown in Table 14, results of analysis of variance of the 2393 tag assignments identified
with three levels of abstraction did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in the
frequency of occurrence between superordinate, basic and subordinate levels of tags. However,
Table 15 demonstrates that combined repeated measures of variances for frequency of
occurrence of superordinate, basic and subordinate tags both between- and within-subjects were
statistically significant, F (df=2, 119) = 3.011, p = .05. Although there was a significant variance
within groups, F (df=2, 119) = 5.959, p = .016, there was no significant variance between groups.

In order to determine pairwise differences lie and to determine which group differences
were driving the significance of the overall F-test, post-hoc tests were conducted. Tukey’s HSD
test was used for comparison of the frequencies of occurrence of superordinate, basic and

133

subordinate tags, both between- and within-subjects, but the results did not demonstrate
statistically significant variances, as reported in Table 16 and Table 17.

Results indicate that the frequency of occurrence of basic level tags, both within and across
subjects, does not vary significantly from the frequency of occurrence of either superordinate
level tags or subordinate level tags. Therefore, null hypothesis H1 cannot be rejected.

134

Hypothesis	  testing:	  H2	  
	  

To determine if the category of a resource's intellectual content influenced the assignment
of superordinate, subordinate and basic level tags by participants, the following null hypothesis
was tested:
H2. The frequency of occurrence of superordinate, subordinate and basic level
tags assigned to resources representing one category of content is the same, both
within and across subjects, as the frequency of occurrence of superordinate,
subordinate and basic level tags assigned to resources representing other
categories of content.
Analysis of variance demonstrated overall significant differences in the assignment of tags
representing superordinate, basic and subordinate levels of abstraction across the four content
categories. As shown in Table 18, the frequency of occurrence of tags at the superordinate level
of abstraction between subjects was statistically significant at p < .000, F(df=3,35) =17.004.
Table 19 shows that the frequency of occurrence of tags at the basic level of abstraction between
subjects was statistically significant at p = .002, F(df=3, 35) = 6.170. And Table 20 shows that
the frequency of occurrence of tags at the subordinate level of abstraction between subjects was
statistically significant at p = .05, F(df=2, 35) = 2.834.

Results of repeated measures of ANOVA between- and within-subjects demonstrated
statistically significant differences in the frequency of occurrence of superordinate, subordinate
and basic levels tags across TOOL, FRUIT, and CLOTHING content categories. As shown in
Table 21, the frequency of occurrence of superordinate, subordinate and basic level tags for the

136

TOOL content category was significant at p = .05, F (df=2, 117) = 3.020; for the CLOTHING
content category at p = .000, F (df=2, 115) = 32.946; and for the FRUIT content category at p =
.000, F (df=2, 117) = 14.647.

Table 22 and Table 23 report results of post-hoc pairwise comparison of the means for
frequency of occurrence of superordinate, subordinate and basic tags representing in the TOOL,
FRUIT and CLOTHING content categories. Tukey’s HSD test indicated that tags in the TOOL
content category did not differ significantly. However, Tukey’s HSD test showed that the
frequency of occurrence in the FRUIT content category was significant for both basic level tags
and subordinate level tags at p = .00. Tukey’s HSD also showed that frequency of occurrence in
the CLOTHING content category was significant for both superordinate level tags and basic
level tags at p = .00.

Because of the excessive number of zeros and the resulting overdispersion in the marginal
distribution of count data for the VEHICLE content category, the zero-inflated negative binomial
(ZINB) regression model was used to model data collected for this category. The results were not
statistically significant indicating that there is no significant relationship between the
superordinate, basic and subordinate level tags assigned to resources in the VEHICLE content
category (see Table 24).

Because analysis showed significant statistical differences in the frequency of occurrence of
basic level tags when compared to superordinate and subordinate level tags in the TOOL, FRUIT
and CLOTHING categories, null hypothesis H2 is rejected.

Hypothesis	  testing:	  H3	  
To determine if the genre of a resource influenced the assignment of tags by participants,
the following null hypothesis was tested:
H3. The frequency of occurrence of superordinate, subordinate and basic level
tags assigned to resources representing one genre is the same, both within and
across subjects, as the frequency of occurrence of superordinate, subordinate and
basic level tags assigned to resources representing other genres.

As shown in Table 25, Table 26 and Table 27, analyses of variance did not demonstrate
any statistically significant differences in the frequency of occurrence of superordinate,
subordinate or basic levels of tags across news article, blog and ecommerce resource genres.

Repeated measures of ANOVA was used to test the frequency of occurrence of superordinate,
basic and subordinate level of abstraction of tags between- and within-subjects. As Table 28
demonstrates, statistically significant differences were identified in the TOOL content category
for resources representing the news genres, F(df =2, 117) = 8.014, p = .001, and the blog genre,
F(df=2, 117) = 5.807, p = .004. In the FRUIT content category, there were similarly significant
differences for resources representing the news genre, F(df=2, 119) = 33.468, p = .00 and the
blog genre, F(df=2, 119) = 13.452, p = .00, as shown in Table 29. Differences were not observed

141

in the frequency of occurrence of superordinate, basic, and subordinate level tags representing
the ecommerce genre in either the TOOL content category or the FRUIT content category.
Statistically significant variations across the three levels of abstraction were also observed for
tags in the CLOTHING content category to resources representing the news genre, F (df=2, 119)
= 6.665, p = .002, and the blog genre, F (df=2, 118) = 50.571, p = .00, and the ecommerce
genre, F (df=2, 118) = 72.222, p = .00, as shown in Table 30.

Tukey’s test was conducted for post-hoc comparison of the frequency of the occurrence of
superordinate, basic level and subordinate tags in the TOOL content category. As shown in Table
31 and Table 32, the results of Tukey’s test indicated a significant difference in the occurrence of
the superordinate level tags, p = .052, and basic level tags, p = .00, for the news genre. However,

143

frequency of occurrence for subordinate level tags was not significant for the news genre. Posthoc analysis of the blog genre also indicated that the superordinate level tags differed
significantly, p = .03, but comparison of tags representing the three levels of abstraction
indicated no significant differences for the ecommerce genre in the TOOL content category. The
p-values were significant after using the Tukey HSD adjustment.

Post-hoc comparisons of the frequencies of occurrence were conducted for the FRUIT
content category using Tukey’s HSD test. Analysis of the three levels of tag abstraction assigned
to resources representing the news genre indicated that both basic level tags, p= .00, and
subordinate tags, p= .00, were statistically significant and assigned more frequently than
superordinate tags, p = .05. Post-hoc comparison of frequencies of occurrence of superordinate,
basic level and subordinate tags assigned to resources representing the blog genre in the FRUIT
content category showed that subordinate level tags, p = .00, basic level tags, p = .01 and
superordinate level tags, p = .05, were all statistically significant. However, post-hoc comparison
of the frequencies of occurrence of the three levels of abstraction for tags assigned to resources

145

representing the ecommerce genre in the FRUIT content category demonstrate no significant
differences (see Table 33).

Post-hoc comparisons of frequency of occurrence were conducted for the FRUIT content
category using Tukey’s HSD test. Post-hoc comparisons of frequencies of occurrence were
conducted for the CLOTHING content category using Tukey’s HSD test (see Table 35 and Table
36). Analysis of the three levels of tag abstraction assigned to resources representing the news
genre of the CLOTHING content category indicated that basic level of tags, p = .00 and
subordinate level of tags, p= .03, were statistically significant and occurred significantly more
frequently than superordinate level of tags. Post-hoc comparisons of the frequencies of
occurrence of the three levels of abstraction in tags assigned to resources representing the blog
genre of the CLOTHING category demonstrated that the frequencies of occurrence of
superordinate tags, p = .00, and subordinate tags, p = .00 were statistically significant. Post-hoc
comparisons of the frequencies of occurrence of the three levels of abstraction in tags
representing the ecommerce genre in the CLOTHING content category demonstrated significant

147

difference in the frequencies of occurrences of tags representing the superordinate, p = .00, and
the basic level, p= .00, were statistically significant. The p-values were significant after using
the Tukey HSD adjustment.

Based on the zero-inflated Poisson regression model, an increase in one unit for frequency
of tags representing the ecommerce genre of the VEHICLE content category would lead to an
increase in the frequency of tags representing the news genre of the VEHICLE category by a
factor of exp(.1864636)=	  1.20498076, while holding all other variables in the model constant
(see Table 37). In other words, the higher the frequency of tags representing the ecommerce
genre of the VEHICLE content category, the more likely would be a corresponding increase in
the frequency of tags representing the news genre of the VEHICLE content category. The zstatistic for the predictor VEHICLE/Ecommerce is (.1864636/.0522621) = 3.57 with an
associated p-value of .000. Thus, the regression coefficient for resources representing the
ecommerce genre of the VEHICLE content category (VEHICLE/Ecommerce) is statistically
significant when the alpha level is set up at .05. If there were increase of one unit in the

149

frequency of tags representing the blog genre, the expected frequency of tags representing the
news genre would increase by a factor of exp(.0101515) = 1.010203201, holding all other
variables in the model constant; however, it would not be statistically significant.
The inflate coefficient for the resources representing the blog genre in the VEHICLE
content category (VEHICLE/ Blog) suggests that, for each unit increase in the frequency of tags
representing the blog genre, the expected frequency of tags representing the news genre would
actually decrease by a factor of exp(-2.242367) = 0.106206815. The z test statistic for the
predictor VEHICLE/Blog is (-2.242367/ .9001078)= -2.49 with an associated p-value of .001.
Therefore, the regression coefficient for VEHICLE/Blog is statistically significant. The
regression coefficient for VEHICLE/Ecommerce did not differ statistically.

Because differences in the occurrence of superordinate, subordinate and basic level tags assigned
to resources representing the news, blog, and ecommerce resources in the four content categories
have been demonstrated to be statistically significant, null hypothesis H3 is rejected.
	  

Discussion
In line with previous studies of folksonomies (e.g., Heckner et al., 2008), this study
observed prevalence of content-related tags (5120 tags, or 67.2% of the total of 7617 tags) in
user-generated vocabulary. Out of 5120 content-related tags, 2393 tags (or 46.7%) were subjectrelated tags and 2727 (or 53.3%) were descriptive tags. Subject-related tags were predominant in
the FRUIT content category (831 tags, or 16.2% of the total of 2393 subject-related tags) and
descriptive tags in the CLOTHING content category (855, or 16.7% of the total of 2727
descriptive tags). Analysis of the data generated in this study did not find statistically significant
variance in the assignment of subject related tags at the superordinate, subordinate and basic
levels of abstraction. Although there were significant within-subject variances for frequency of
the occurrence of tags at the three levels of abstraction, p = .016, Tukey’s HSD test for
comparison of the frequencies of occurrence of superordinate, basic and subordinate tags, both
between- and within-subjects did not find statistically significant variances.
The study found overall differences in the frequency of assignment of superordinate,
subordinate and basic level tags (p = .00; p = .05, and p = .002, respectively) across four content
categories. Post-hoc analysis revealed statistically significant variances in the frequency of
assignment of superordinate, p = .00, and basic level tags, p = .00, for resources in the
CLOTHING content category and in the frequency of assignment of basic level, p = .00, and

151

subordinate levels of tags, p = .00 for resources in the FRUIT content category. However, no
significant variances were found for tags assigned to resources in the TOOL and VEHICLE
content categories.
Although assignments of the 231 unique tags demonstrated prevalence of basic level tags
(i.e., 898 basic level tags or 37.5% of the 2393 tags identified with one of the three levels of
abstraction), unique tags were mainly comprised of subordinate level tags across four content
categories (156 tags, or 67.5% of the 231 unique tags identified with one of the three levels of
abstraction). Overall, these findings do not support the suggestions of previous research (e.g.,
Golder & Huberman, 2006; Munk & Mork, 2007b) that basic level categories were the primary
source of the perceived agreement on tag assignment that was observed in user-generated
vocabularies.
The findings of this study also raise questions regarding Green’s (2006) operationalization
of basic level categories based on WordNet's hierarchical structure: Because the study found that
predominant levels of abstraction in tags varied across content categories, operationalizing the
basic level of categories (i.e., tags) based on a structure that fails to establish a term’s exact
semantic level and ignores varying context in which it may be used is problematic.
Although the theory of basic level categories proposes that categories at the basic level of
conceptual abstraction are more cognitively efficient and therefore more accessible to users, the
contextual nature of basic level categories leads to problems in applying the theory across
individuals, situations and cultures. In contrast to Rosch’s (Rosh et al., 1976) study of basic
level categories, which was based on naming and sorting of images and listing of concrete
objects, whereas this study attempted to simulate a real-time world tagging experience using
links to actual resources representing four content categories (TOOL, CLOTHING, FRUIT,

152

VEHICLE) and three genres of the resources (news article, blog and ecommerce). Thus,
observed variances in the assignment of superordinate, subordinate and basic level tags across
the four content categories suggest that the use of “things” (Heidegger, 1953/1996) is directly
related to the individual's perception and understanding of those things: that “things” do not
have an independent meaning that exists outside the individual's understanding. As Dewey
argued (1997), reliance on human perception and understanding to ascribe meaning to a thing
represents the knowledge that enables individuals to “adapt [the] environment to our needs ...
[and] aims and desires to the situation in which we live” (p. 217). Thus, how individuals will
represent a “thing” is influence by not only what “we are now conscious of” but also the
“dispositions we consciously use in understanding what now happens” (p. 217).
The process of identifying levels of abstraction for tags also revealed that the meanings
ascribed to terms and level of abstraction ascribed to a particular term are contingent upon their
use in the forms of life (Wittgenstein, 1953/1963) and interwoven with an individual’s specific
point of view and experience. For example, in contrast to Rosh et al.’s (1976) study, judges did
not agree on defining the tag Levi’s as a subordinate level of abstraction in the category
CLOTHING even though use of the manufacturer’s name is routinely used to represent a
distinctive type of clothing. Similarly, brand names for cars (e.g., Honda, Chevrolet) were not
recognized as subordinate level tags in the VEHICLE category even though they figured in
Battig and Montague’s (1969) findings for items belonging to the category VEHICLE that were
commonly generated by participants in their study.
Overall, the study did not show statistically significant variances in the frequency of
assignment of superordinate, subordinate and basic level content related tags across the news,
blog and ecommerce resource genres. However, post-hoc comparison of frequencies of

153

occurrence for levels of abstraction of tags assigned across the three resource genres and the four
content categories indicated statistically significant variances in the frequency of superordinate
tags assigned to resources representing the news genre in the TOOL content category, p = .05,
and in the FRUIT content category, p = .05; to resources representing the blog genre in the
TOOL content category, p = .03, and the CLOTHING content category, p = .00); and to
resources representing the ecommerce genre in the CLOTHING content category, p = .00.
Frequency of assignment of subordinate content related tags was statistically significant
for resources representing the news genre in the FRUIT content category, p = .00, and in the
CLOTHING content category, p = .03, and for resources representing the blog genre in the
CLOTHING content category, p = .00, and in the FRUIT content category, p = .00.
Frequency of assignment of basic level tags was also significant for resources representing
the news resource genre in the TOOL content category, p = .00, in the CLOTHING content
category, p = .00, and in the FRUIT content category, p = .00; for resources representing the
blog genre in the FRUIT content category, p = .01; and for resources representing the
ecommerce genre in the CLOTHING content category, p = .00). The ZIP regression coefficient
for resources in the ecommerce and blog genres of the VEHICLE content category was also
statistically significant. Observations of significant variations in the frequency of occurrence of
superordinate, subordinate and basic level tags across the three resource genres and the four
content categories suggest that utilization of genre is “situated” and grounded in language – in
particular, on the meaning a genre carries for a particular group of individuals, or its
“addressivity” (Bakhtin, 1986, p. 95). Since each genre corresponds to a particular conception of
the “addressee,” it determines an area of human activity and everyday life to which the given
utterance is related. For Bakhtin (1986), certain features of language (such as lexical, semantic

154

and syntactic) are “knit together” with the genre, providing a framework that facilitates
communication.
In addition to content related tags, the tagging vocabulary generated by participants was
also comprised of tags representing genre, source and author (see Table 5). It is worth noting
that, in line with previous studies (e.g., Lamere, 2008; Inskip, 2009), subjects assigned genre tags
that not only represented predefined resource genres (e.g., news, blog, ecommerce) but also
provided enriched representations of the news, blog, and ecommerce genres of the resources. For
example, tags assigned to an online news article about the history of citrus fruits ranged from
news article to column, fact, and history. Tags assigned to resources representing the blog genre
also revealed participant’s understanding of overlapping genres. For example, the genre tags
assigned to a fashion blog by participants included not only the actual genre of the resource
(blog) but also genre tags that emerged from the context of this particular blog resource: review,
look book, tips, catalogue, photographs (photo albums). Although there were relatively fewer
genre-tags assigned to ecommerce resources, there was no agreement on a single genre tag. For
example, tags assigned to ecommerce resources in the TOOL content category ranged from
advertisement and synopsis to review and shopping. As has been observed by previous
researchers (e.g., Dillon, 1991; Rumelhart, 1984; Vaughan & Dillon, 2006), recognition of
predefined resources genres suggests that mental representations of text structure and design
serve as cues allowing individuals to quickly identify, select and make use of the resources.
Based on the statistically significant variations observed in the tagging vocabulary
generated by participants, this study suggests that the content and genre of resources affects the
composition of user-generated tagging vocabularies. More importantly, the study results indicate
that the three levels of conceptual abstraction – superordinate, subordinate and basic level – may

155

be equally important for the taggers, and that assumptions linking agreement on tags in a usergenerated vocabulary to the basic level of conceptual abstraction may not be appropriate.

Limitations
Several factors may have affected the results of this study. For example, all participants in
the study were members of the academic community of faculty and students on the Indiana
University Bloomington campus and thus may not provide a representative sample of the broader
population of taggers. And, because all participants were volunteers, it was not possible to assure
that various demographic characteristics were equally represented in the study population: There
were more women (n=25) than men (n=15) in the study population; half of the participants were
in the 21 to 25 age group, and there were no participants who were 46 or older; with the
exception of one individual, all participants indicated they had some college while 19 had earned
a bachelor's degree and 15 held advanced degrees; and more than half of the participants (n=24)
declared library and information science as their area of study.
Another possible limitation of the study was the use of only four content categories and
three online genres in the composition of the stimulus materials. However, the number of
categories and genres used in the study was dictated by the nature of the task. Participants were
asked to read each of the 36 resources before assigning tags, and the task generally took
participants one hour to complete. The inclusion of even one more content category or one more
online genre in the set of materials would have increased the time necessary for participants to
complete the task and introduced confounding effects related to maturation.
The use of the one-shot case study in the design of this research introduced additional
limitations, including lack of a pretest or control group to serve as a basis for comparison, which
undermines the generalizability of the study. However, the one-shot case study offers an

156

appropriate method for data collection and was therefore justified by the exploratory nature of
the research, which sought to record the tags generated by participants in response to stimuli that
represented a controlled set of content categories and genre types and to conduct a preliminary
analysis of the levels of abstraction represented in those tags. Further, case study method offered
a venue for detailed and accurate analysis of the generated tagging vocabulary. As such, the
study provides a foundation for development of hypotheses that can be tested in future studies
that compare different populations with respect to differences in tags due to resource content as
well as levels of abstraction in tags.

Conclusions
One of the underlying findings of this study is captured in by the title of Roger Brown’s
article published in 1958: How shall a thing be called? Categories and the hierarchical
relationships between them vary across individuals and cultures because of differences in the
everyday experiences and activities of individuals. This study suggests that user-generated
vocabularies can be quite dynamic and multifaceted and will generally be comprised of terms at
multiple levels of abstraction, thereby controverting suggestions that the basic level of tags are
predominant and “widespread in agreement” (Golder & Huberman, 2006, p. 202). This study
shows that, while the assignment of tags representing the three levels of conceptual abstraction
can be equally useful for representing the content of resources, their importance of tags at any
level of abstraction can vary across content categories and resource genres both between and
within subjects.
Although taggers employed tags that were categorized as genre, manufacturer/brand, or
even date, among others, a majority of tags were identified as content related – as representing

157

the intellectual content of resources. Within the framework provided by Heidegger's (1953/1996)
notion of handiness, variation in the concepts represented and in the level of abstraction of
content related tags is both natural and phenomenological in that perception and understanding –
and thus and thus the meaning of “things” – arise out of the individual's contextualized
experiences of engaging with objects. Although this study focuses on the tagging vocabulary
generated by a small group of participants, its controlled focus on a limited number of content
categories with a predetermined set of online genres underscores the heterogeneity of
representation that characterizes user-generated tagging vocabularies. It also points to the need to
account for users’ understandings of an object’s “thingly quality” (Heidegger, 1953/1996, p. 65)
within a given context when attempting to operationalize concepts such as basic level term.
In addition to variations in the tagging vocabulary assigned to resources in the predefined
content categories, the study also revealed multifaceted representations of the resource genres –
no single genre representation was observed across the four categories and three genres. Bakthin
(1986) observes that the understanding of a genre is intimately intertwined with both the
language or the context that produces, reproduces and modifies that particular genre. In line with
Bakhtin’s (1986) notion of genre, the results of this this study suggest that a genre should be
defined within a specific content category or particular context that is shared among members of
a given language group. This approach could provide greater opportunity for “making sense” of
resources and, eventually, for building systems that can “understand” an individual’s information
ecology.
Before accepting the utility of representations at the basic level of abstraction, future
studies should analyze the use of superordinate, subordinate and basic level representations
across a wide range of language groups and domains. Studies of user-generated vocabularies will

158

further this effort and could facilitate the development of user-centered systems of knowledge
representation and organization, potentially providing more “organic” integration of controlled
or “artificial” (Lancaster, 1977, p. 23) and user-generated vocabularies and improve the
“findability” (Morville, 2005) and effective use of the knowledge resources.
Future studies may include a comparative analysis of the preferred level of tags generated
by varioius language groups and domains as well as investigation of variations in the preferred
level of tags across a wide range of content categories and resource genres. Furthermore, future
studies may explore additional factors that may influence tagging vocabulary, such as knowledge
or educational background. Another avenue for future research is investigation of how usergenerated tags may compliment traditional systems of representation and organization. For
example, building crosswalks on a basis of preferred level of terms.

Appendix C: Rating typicality of the content category and genre of resources
	  

Listed below is a collection of 90 resources, each of which represents one of six categories (i.e.,
MUSICAL INSTRUMENT, TOOL, CLOTHING, FURNITURE, VEHICLE, AND FRUIT ) and
three genres (home page, blog and ecommerce).
You are asked to rate each of these resources as to how well it represents both a specific category
and a specific genre. Using a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (1= “Not appropriate” and 5 = “Highly
appropriate”), indicate how representative you find each resource by placing an X on the line.
Please open each link, read or scan the linked resource, and then rate it as to:
1. How well the content of the resource represents the specified category.
2. How well the resource represents the specified genre.
For example:
1. http://www.oddmusic.com/index.php
How well the content of the resource represents the category MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS?

Appendix J: Study script
Thank you for participating in this study. Dr. Elin Jacob is the principal investigator for
the study. I am Lala Hajibayova, and I will be the investigator conducting this session. The
purpose of the study is to explore user-generated vocabularies. In particular, the study will
examine the terms or tags assigned by users in order to retrieve the resource at some point in the
future. The study will take approximately 60 minutes.
Please read the informed consent form, sign both copies and then return one copy to me.
Before we start the actual study, I will provide an overview of the study and answer any
questions you may have. The study consists of two tasks. The first task involves assigning tags to
a set of online resources. The second task consists of a brief set of demographic questions: your
gender, approximate age, area of study or expertise, and highest level of education completed.
You will access the study using the link indicated on the screen:
https://iucsr.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_0DOcOnOJWDXOdCI.
In the first task, you will read or scan a resource and then assign to that resources as
many tags as you think appropriate to retrieve that resource at some point in the future. A tag can
either be a word or phrase. However, as is common in most online social tagging systems, a
single tag should not include any spaces between words. Words with spaces between them will
be interpreted as individual tags. For example, if you wanted to assign the phrase “cat in a bag”,
you should use the tag “catinabag”; if you used “cat in a bag” as a tag, each word would be
considered a separate tag: “cat”, “in”, “a”, “bag”.
To assign tags to the resource that is on the screen
[http://princeton.patch.com/articles/shedding-light-on-a-misunderstood-instrument], you would
read or scan the resource and then assign as many tags as you think appropriate to help you

199

retrieve this resource at some point in the future. Let’s assign tags to this resource now. Please
read or scan the resource now and then assign one or more tags by typing them in the text box
directly below the resource. If you have any questions on how to tag resources, please ask me
now.
Each of you has been provided with step-by-step instructions on how to complete the first
task. When you have finished tagging the 36 resources, you will be asked to respond to a brief
set of demographic questions. If you have any questions when you are answering the questions in
the second task, please ask me. After you have submitted responses to the demographic
questions, “Thank you” will appear on the screen and the session will end.
To begin, you will log into your IU account and then access the link to the study
webpage.
You may ask any questions you have about the study at any time.
Please follow the instructions you have been provided to begin the task of tagging
resources.
Thank you for the participating in the study.

Appendix K: Study sample instruction
You are being asked to assign tags to a set of 36 online resources. Please assign to each resource
as many tags as you think appropriate for retrieval of the resource at some point in the future. It

Please follow these steps to complete the task:
1. Log into your IU account.
2. Open the link <https://iucsr.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_0DOcOnOJWDXOdCI>
3. To tag each resource, open the link provided on the screen and read or scan the resource.
Then enter in the text box directly below each link as many tags as you think are
appropriate in order to access the resource at some point in the future. Please remember
that a tag can either be a word or phrase but that words with spaces between them will be
interpreted as individual tags.
4.

There will be 36 resources. A link provided for each resource will open in a new tab.
Please open one link at a time and close the link to the resource once you completed
tagging.

5. After completing the tagging task, answer the demographic questions in the second task.

Appendix M: Rating of the proposed level of abstraction of unique tags
	  

Listed below is a collection of ___tags (i.e., descriptors) that were assigned to online
resources whose content dealt with items from four categories: [category 1], [category 2],
[category 3] or [category 4]. Each tag has been identified as exemplifying a specific level of
abstraction: that is, the tag has been identified as either a superordinate term, a basic level term
or a subordinate term.
An example of each level of abstraction is provided below. In the first example, the tag
orange is identified as a basic level term under the superordinate term FRUIT. In the second
example, the tag fruit is identified as the superordinate term; in the third example, the tag navel
orange is identified as a subordinate term.

You are asked to evaluate the appropriateness of the level of abstraction identified for
each tag below. Using a Likert scale of 1 to 5, where 1 = Not at all appropriate and 5 = Highly
appropriate, please make an X on to indicate how appropriate you think the assigned level of
abstraction is for each tag.
For example:
Tag: pomegranate
