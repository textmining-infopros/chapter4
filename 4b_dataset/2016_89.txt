ABSTRACT
In July 2013, the social media Facebook campaign, Save the Miami-Dade Public Libraries (SMDPL)
sought to influence the Miami-Dade County Mayor and Board of County Commissioners to reverse
proposed budget cuts and maintain existing library funding levels. In this study, I examined the SMDPL
campaign by conducting a discourse analysis of Facebook discussions that included posts, comments
and any artifacts referenced such as other websites, mainstream media, public official memoranda and
public documents, among others. I examined the expressions of value and the policymaking process
using Moore’s Creating Public Value Theory.
This study found that Creating Public Value offered an examination of public institutions as subsets of
public sector governance. The study found that discourse is an element of the public value created that
resulted in expression of public value outcomes and operational capacity for communities. However the
study also found that public library advocates missed opportunities to demonstrate rather than assert,
specific public library values. Information sharing using social network sites can be important sources of
what a community values in their libraries and their public sector institutions. Future research could
examine how these values influence the actions of public officials and the discourse can become a
source of examining what all types of communities’ value in libraries.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
Library Funding Advocacy
In this study I examined the information shared using the social network site, Facebook, during
the discourse generated by the Save the Miami Dade Public Libraries social media campaign. The study
examined information sharing in the context of human communication in the public sector, which is a
sphere of activities and resources that are available to all in a community of interest, local or global,
virtual or physical, and that serves as an authorizing environment for policy making. “The public is made
up of individuals – individual citizens, voters, and taxpayers – and of collective bodies and institutions
such as the voting constituencies of elected public executives, the legislatures elected to guide and
oversee the government’s executive branch, the courts responsible for protecting the rights of individuals,
and those who influence the actions and decisions of these institutions (such as interest groups and the
media)” (Moore, p. 36, 2013). Disciplines of focus include public sector communication, including policymaking, specifically problem definition, agenda-setting, solution proposals and consensus building
(Kingdon, 2003; Mintrom, 2012); and, information sharing via social network sites, providing an
opportunity to examine information sharing and conversations in public spheres, with a focus on the
creation of public value.
I framed this study using the semantic domain of CPV (Moore, 1995; Benington & Moore, 2011),
a public sector management theory that focuses on the public sphere made up of the “continuously
created and constructed” sphere of participants – people of many interests, who gather together to
discuss, define, refute and revise ideas and values to create a sphere that is a “web of values, places,
organizations, rules, knowledge, and other cultural resources held in common by people through their
everyday commitments and behaviours, and held in trust by government and public institutions”
Benington, 2011, p. 43). My research purpose was to understand what the public values about libraries,
and public sector governance in general. CPV’s values include the universal, public sector and public
library values shared in the discourse, and constitute the meaning making through the choices of value
statements shared as it is assumed that “discourse involves speaker choices” (Herring, 2004, p. 4). In this
study, I examined the individual values in the context of and with the assumption that these contribute to
a larger, collective ‘public value’ in which, many interactions, such as e-government services, health and
welfare programs and other daily civic activities are provided to the public, are increasingly participatory
and often geared toward public expression of personal views (Smith, 2013), resulting in a new networked
community governance and the co-production of public value (Benington, 2011; Mulgan, 2011).
The policymaking processes of problem definition, agenda-setting, and solution creation were
also explored using the semantic expressions in the Facebook messages. Adopting the multi-disciplinary

1

framework of public administration and management and library and information studies can provide
diverse contexts in which to examine information sharing, “whose essentially contested meaning focuses
on activity which contributes to the making of an everyday world beyond and outside of the boundaries of
information science as an intellectual discipline” (Raber, 2003, p. 42).
The units of analysis were defined by threads of discourse topics identified by theme, time, and the
Facebook structural organization that places post replies in proximity to the original message in order to
make relevant the successive posts. Paradata included Facebook ‘shares’ and ‘likes’, which are common
social media interaction metrics. In bounding the analysis by thread, the discourse revealed the
associations between the social network platform and the policy making processes of problem definition,
agenda-setting and solution creation, examining the discourse as “shaped by the technological features
of computer-mediated communication systems” (Herring, 2004, p. 4). The purpose of this study was to
identify public values expressed in a library-funding advocacy discourse, to explore the problem definition,
agenda-setting and solution creation as policy making processes, and also examined how these emerge
using the Facebook social network site, SMDPL.
Background
On July 17, 2013, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez, and a majority of county
commissioners, agreed to a proposed budget that would close 22 libraries throughout Miami-Dade
County, with layoffs for over 400 county employees. No public referendum was needed for the cuts to
take effect. The libraries threatened with closure included many with multiple socio-economic risk factors
such as linguistic isolation, minimal educational attainment, low median income, low average home value
and use of library services such as Internet and computer access as a social safety net (iMapLibraries,
2013). Miami-Dade County commissioners would take a final vote on September 10, 2013.
In response to Miami-Dade County Mayor Gimenez’ announcement that the “age of libraries is
probably ending” (McCorquodale, 2013, para. 1), two Florida graduate students created the Save the
Miami-Dade Public Libraries (SMDPL) Facebook page and Twitter account, @MIALibraries. These social
media sites quickly transformed a grassroots, community outcry into what has been cited by at least one
Miami traditional news source as a social media campaign that may be responsible for organizing the
successful protest (Castillo, 2013): a popular source for Facebook social media research is fanpage
karma (http://www.fanpagekarma.com/) which reports that the median fan page (page follower) growth
rate is 0.64% per week, or about 25 fans per month for a page with 1000 users; the top ten percent of
pages experience a 2.22% weekly growth rate (Eyl, 2013). However, within three weeks, the number of
SMDPL Facebook fans, or supporters of the page who ‘Like’ the page itself, not just a particular post,
grew to 3142, spurred by an embedded Change.org petition, one of several online petitions protesting the
library closures. Joining the SMDPL Facebook discourse were the Friends of the Miami-Dade Public
Libraries and other groups such as EveryLibrary.org and iMapLibraries.org.
The protest became a conversation on July 24, 2013, when several county commissioners
engaged with several of the Facebook participants, including the group page administrators. Key library

2

advocacy groups and journalistic organizations linked online to the Facebook page, including Huffington
Post, School Library Journal Online, lj.libraryjournal.com, miamiherald.com and the popular Miami New
Times and Diarios Las Americas.
By September 10, 2013, the day of the Miami Dade County commission vote, the County Mayor
and the county commissioners reversed their plan for deep financial cuts and agreed to use reserve funds
to maintain current levels of service and staffing at all 49 locations in Miami-Dade County.

Problem Statement and Significance of the Research
In the 2011-2012 Public Library Funding and Technology Access Study (PLFTAS), the American
Library Association (ALA) reported that public library systems average total operating expenditures
decreased for the fifth year in a row, with an anticipated decline of 5.3% in FY 2012-2013. While funding
cuts are down from the high of 41.8% decrease reported in FY2009-2010, it is still twice the amount of
funding cut from the previous year (Hoffman, Bertot & Davis, 2012).
Almost half of the U.S. states report cuts in state funding to public libraries, reduced spending for
collections, a decrease in full-time equivalent staffing for three years in a row (23.2%) and 21.5% of
libraries reporting a decrease in public service hours (ALA, 2014). This reporting on public library
wellness is part of public library data collected since 1994 by the ALA, as part of its support to “help
library directors and library IT staff benchmark and advocate for technology resources in communities
across the nation. The data are also of importance for policymakers at local, state, and federal levels,
manufacturers of information and communication technologies, and the communities served by public
libraries (ALA, 2014).
While use of online social network sites may be disruptive in disseminating or implementing an
unpopular policy that is desired by public officials and may be an inefficient way to obtain consensus, the
pursuit of social equity may outweigh the potential obstacles and challenges facing public agents
navigating participatory collective networks (Hale, 2011; Mintrom, 2012). While the purpose of this study
was to identify public values expressed in a library-funding advocacy discourse, this analysis also
examined the information sharing as policy making using a social network site, specifically in examining
problem definition, agenda-setting and solution creation, assuming that “problems and solutions come
intertwined” (Mintrom, 2012, p. 4).
In the public sector, “public opinion informs the government, and the government makes it
policies known to public opinion – public opinion reigns, but it does not govern” (Fraenkel as cited in
Habermas, 1989, p. 239). Thus, public interactions using social network sites can be important sources of
the wishes of a community but they may not direct the actions of public officials. The undesired or lack of
action on publicly communicated information can become a source of community conflict. The
interactions involved in information sharing in the public sector can be understood better both by public
sector officials and managers, and by library advocate leaders.
Specifically, this study is significant because it:

3

•

Examined the use of social network sites for advocacy;

•

Examined the use of social network sites in the public sector (since the public officials engaged
with the Facebook and Twitter page using their official social media accounts);

•

Examined participant roles in the library funding advocacy campaign;

•

Increased understanding of how values are shared in networked publics;

•

Explored the theory CPV as a way to understand what the public values and what adds value to
the public sphere; and

•

Provided a greater understanding of what the public values in public libraries.

With the increase of the use of social network sites that extends the reach of governance networks
and the transparency of government actions, it becomes important to understand their use in
information sharing toward policy making.

Purpose of the Research
The purpose of this study was to:
•

Examine the use of social network sites for library funding advocacy;

•

Examine the use of social network sites by public sector officials;

•

Identify the values expressed in a library-funding advocacy discourse and determine how these
emerge using the Facebook social network site, SMDPL;

•

Explore the theory, CPV, as a framework to understand what the public values about libraries;
and

•

Examine the relationship of online/offline activities of a networked public.
In this study, I identified values expressed in a library-funding advocacy discourse, explored the

problem definition, agenda-setting and solution creation as policy making processes, and also
determined how these emerge using the Facebook social network site, SMDPL. Assuming that
although the sample was not representative of the Miami-Dade community at large, it may have
influenced policymaking with public officials because it gained a great deal of media attention from
social and traditional media. I also sought to validate findings of the discourse analysis using webbased survey distributed to political/public agents, library advocates, librarians, library administrators
and resident participants.
Use of social network sites may offer avenues to greater levels of public trust and has been
extensively exploited by the private sector for marketing, company communication, customer feedback
and reinforcement of brand loyalty programs (Cockerill, 2013). While business has realized the benefits of
extended customer relationships, public agencies have been reluctant to integrate social media
applications (Durant, 1999; McDonough, 2012). Kent emphasizes that public agencies have neglected
the opportunity to use social media to frame issues, set agendas or develop relationships (2008). Most
uses have mimicked traditional one-way communication and broadcast features of traditional print and
mainstream media.

Facebook is a social network site which is defined as “web-based services that allow individuals
to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile with a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users
with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by
others within the system” (boyd & Ellison, 2007, p. 211). Ellison, et al., add that on Facebook, individuals
also have the opportunity to “join virtual groups based on common interests” (2007, p. 1143) and this
study addresses the growing “intensive interaction with citizens” (Charalabidis & Loukis, 2012, p. 79) that
is characterized by grass-roots political activity initiated by individuals outside government agencies
(Charalabidis & Loukis, 2012) and is observed on the Facebook page, SMDPL. Facebook also represents
an “offline to online trend” which means that it exhibits a network with an origination that is a
“geographically-bound community” (Steinfield & Lampe, 2007, p. 1144) and the phenomena observed
during the SMDPL campaign will be examined in context of this ‘offline to online’ context.
Social network sites can be considered a subset of social media, a “set of online tools that are
designed for and centered around social interaction” (Bertot, Jaeger & Hansen, p. 30, 2012) and can
include “blogs, microblogs (e.g., Twitter), social sharing services (e.g., YouTube, Flickr, StumbleUpon,
Last.fm), text messaging, discussion forums, collaborative editing tools (e.g., wikis), virtual worlds (e.g.,
Second Life), and social networking services (e.g. Facebook, MySpace) (Bertot, et al., 2012, p. 30).
Further, because social networks represent the “formal properties of social relations that result from the
interweaving of actions in social encounters” (Carrington & Scott, 2011, p. 1), this study includes artifacts
from emails, websites. While this study does not include a social network analysis of the SMDPL
community, the underlying offline-to-online network relationships are present as the analysis examined
discourse of artifacts that originated in one context (offline/online) and migrated into the other.
Online advocacy for social movements in general, and library-funding advocacy in particular, are
recent phenomena. Further study is merited, given the abundance of library-funding crises that occur both
nationally and globally, as evidenced by the 2014 national election activities that included 77 libraryfunding initiatives that resulted in funding approvals in at least 55 local and state referenda (Chrastka,
2014).
The results reported here will contribute a beginning understanding about using the public
management theory, CPV (Moore, 1995; Benington & Moore, 2011) to explore what the public values
about libraries, and public sector governance and in general as public libraries are generally authorized
and managed by a community’s public sector governance. CPV examines the intersection of the mission
of public sector agents such as government administrators, local and state politicians and other civil
servants with the needs and desires of the communities they serve, to determine how to identify, account
for and increasingly build community competencies that result in the creation of public value (Benington,
2011).
Overview Of The Conceptual Framework
The framework, CPV is the result of Mark Moore’s research into the behaviors individuals that
function as leaders in public service roles (1995). Moore’s work began as a prescriptive case study

5

provided as a public management graduate school text. But the concepts that Moore presented became
the subject of both private and public sector management and administrative discussions, particularly
because CPV is a “strong conceptual framework that guide the newly emerging paradigm of networked
community governance (NCG)” (Benington, 2011, pp.31-32), much like theory of public goods served the
traditional public administration (TPA) and rational choice formed the basis of new public management
(NPM). In CPV Benington (2011) articulates a proactive response to systemic change, the fundamental
and underlying organizational and operational framework, in political, economic, technological, social and
ecological structures of society and seeks to answer more basic questions about the role of governance
and the emerging citizen involvement in democratic and public spheres.
Public value is the manifestation of the “desires and perceptions of individuals” (Moore, 1995, p.
52) as those things desired by individuals but unavailable due to market failure; and, belonging to the
realm of those activities conducted and resources provided for the whole of the public sector. Public
value contributes “to the public good” or uses public monies to “pursue a purpose that has been
authorized by the citizens and representative government” (Moore, 1995, p. 53). Examples of public
value include public sector education, public libraries, and municipal safety and services, all of which are
in part or in whole, created by and for with funding from public sources and governed in part by public
policy or management.
Benington and Moore expand the concept of public value from an applied planning strategy to a
theoretical framework to examine the nature of value in general, and its constitution in the public sphere.
Value is best understood in this study as that which is contributed to the public sphere by the power
vested in the state by citizens – the public sphere is “the web of values, places, organizations, rules,
knowledge, and other cultural resources held in common by people through their everyday commitments
and behaviours, and held in trust by government and public institutions” (Benington & Moore, 2011, p.
43). It is this “sprawling and amorphous public” (Moore, 2013, p.37) that expresses what it would like to
produce with government assets and how much it is willing to value it by granting it an acceptable cost.
Moore’s model offers a “strategic triangle” in which public value is defined and characterized and
in which sources of authority that provide legitimacy and support are identified, and operational
capabilities for deployment are described. In Moore’s model:
1) Sources of authority are identified, legitimized and are acknowledged to be politically sustainable,
attracting sufficient support from stakeholders;
2) Operational capacity and administrative feasibility is described; and
3) Defining public value is achieved through deliberation of all three nodes of networked governance
– clarifying and specifying the strategic goals and public value outcomes for a specific context (Benington
& Moore, 2011, p. 4; Alford & O’Flynn, 2009). Figure 1-A illustrates how the first two component parts,
authority that provides legitimacy and support, and operational capacity to implement deployment, must
work together to deliver public value.

6

Figure 1. Moore’s strategic triangle, 2011.
Yang extends the strategic triangle into a logic model by integrating the community governance
processes (deliberation, legitimization and implementation) that produce, assess, revise and evaluate
government performance with the strategic triangle components of authorizing environment (institutional
authorization and accountability), operational capacity (processes, resources and performance measures)
and public value outcomes (end outcomes and measurable indicators); Yang identifies the values
components on two levels, universal values and public sector values (see Figure 1-B for Yang’s Logic of
the Public Value Creation).

Figure 2. The logic of the public value creation (Yang, in press).

7

In this study, I focused on the deliberative process of information sharing using social network
sites, with values and policy-making processes identified in the discourse. The values realms included a
subset of values that are specific to the public library context (see Figure 1-C). The revised model uses
CPV was used as a mechanism to understand information sharing for library-funding advocacy in the
creation of universal, public sector and public library values; and the process of deliberation that includes
the policymaking processes of problem definition, agenda-setting, and solution creation. The areas in
bold outline signify the areas of focus for this study.
The importance of the public value framework to information sharing for library-funding advocacy
rests in the evolution of the public manager’s role and purpose in its creation. Rather than a singular
mission of policy implementation, the public manager’s success requires “the ability to adapt to, and
shape, the external environment. Furthermore, public value cannot be delivered without ongoing public
engagement and dialogue as the continuation of funds depends on this ‘renewal of citizen consent’”
(Williams & Shearer, 2011, p. 6). In spite of the vigorous nature of some public sector funding discourse,
implementation belongs to the political/public agent (Yang, in press). CPV is used to guide the methods
employed in this study to provide a forum to assess the comments of participants as values that may
have greater importance to policymakers.

Research Questions
Using a concurrent, exploratory, mixed methods study design, I answered the following research
questions:
RQ1: In what ways, if at all, does the use of social network sites for library funding advocacy
demonstrate what the public values about libraries and public sector institutions?
RQ1.1 -What universal values, public sector values, or library values, if any, are shared
using the SMDPL Facebook page?
RQ 1.2-Which participant roles are observed among those sharing information?
RQ 1.3 -What is the relationship between the values shared and the various participants?
RQ2: How do social network sites used for library funding advocacy contribute, if at all, to the
policymaking process?
RQ 2.1 -In what ways are Agenda-setting and problem definition expressed?
RQ 2.2 -What solutions to the library-funding conflict, if any, were proposed?
Answering these questions provided a structured view of the discourse that surrounds public libraryfunding issues in local communities and in considering the views of diverse stakeholders, and provided a
way to explore the values expressed by the community and its leaders. Further, the questions examined
specific policymaking processes and constraints that influence the information shared. Finally, these
questions addressed the use of digitally-infused networks, the whole of online and offline community
interaction, to understand how discourse conducted using social network sites can influence the content
of the information shared and the relationship between the values and processes shared and the various
participants.

Definitions
The theory of CPV (CPV) is a concept that can be defined as both a collective noun, which can be
defined as a noun that denotes a collection of individuals regarded as a unit (Oxford American Dictionary)
and as individual noun, identified as a member of the collective group. Both forms of the term are used as
I examined the values as expressed by participants in the library-funding advocacy campaign that
comprise one of many units that make up the collective version of public value. A complete list of
definitions of public value and other concepts used in this study can be found in Appendix A. The
definitions of the key concepts were used to create the codebook by which values were categorized and
analyzed in this examination of discourse; the intangible and abstract nature of the values required a
simultaneous coding approach that allowed the application of two or more codes to describe qualitative
data (Saldana, 2009); a value may have a universal nature but distinctly different implementation when
used in context of the public sector or the public library settings.

Overview of the Research Design
The study used a concurrent, multi-method approach (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011) examined
library-funding advocacy by participants sharing information using social network sites. Multiple methods
included two stages of the research process that collected and examined discourse derived from artifacts
created in multiple media formats that were analyzed quantitatively for an empirical, network view of the
phenomenon but were also captured qualitatively to provide descriptive details provided by participants
with individual categories of meaning (Tashakkori & Teddle, 2003).
Concurrent, mixed methods approaches also explored the theory, CPV that guided the framework
of the investigation and explores the phenomena of library advocacy using social network sites. Using
qualitative and quantitative research together resulted in a more comprehensive view of the phenomenon
and provided more complete knowledge that will help to understand theory (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie,
2004; Tashakkori & Teddle, 2003).
In the case of the Miami-Dade library-funding conflict, mixed methods were used to qualitatively
and quantitatively collect and analyze social media posts from the Facebook page, Save the Miami Dade
Public Libraries (SMDPL), using a discourse analysis framework structured on Yang’s decomposed
model of CPV, that features three value contexts - universal, public sector and public library values - and
the policy-making process attributes that include problem definition, agenda-setting, solution proposal,
and consensus building.
The concurrent, exploratory discourse analysis included the following methods:
•

Phase One: A discourse analysis of the Facebook page activity and related events promoted on it
to understand the content of the messages, specifically in terms of expressions of what people
value universally, in public sector contexts and about public libraries; how individuals used social
network sites for policymaking especially the problem definition, agenda-setting and solution
creation processes; and

•

Phase Two: A web-based survey of the social network sites’ participants to understand their roles
in the discourse and their perspectives about the values shared and the process of library-funding
advocacy conducted using social network sites.
The Facebook posts and survey data were analyzed using the semantic domain identified by

computer-mediated discourse analysis, using both the axial codes provided by the CPV theory and the
open codes that emerged. The Facebook sample was bounded by threads of posts, or those that were
formatted as replies to an originating message and also typically featured a primary theme or topic
(Lavrusik, 2013). The threads were identified as well to their relationship to offline/external events and
links. This approach afforded the research both a deep semantic description of the use of social network
sites for library-funding advocacy and an understanding of how the discourse connected the offline events
to the online format.

Summary
Political officials and/or public sector managers continue to be the ultimate arbiters of the public
policy implementation pursued using government action (Benington, 2011; Yang, in press). It can be
assumed that these choices contribute to the creation of public value outcomes as reflected in
government actions. The study explores perceptions of whether citizen participation through online social
network sites like Facebook create a strong sense of what the public values and what the public thinks
adds value to the public sphere. Miami-Dade County continues to be challenged by funding deficits and
claims of library irrelevance; this study analyzed the statements of participant values made in the
discourse, to explore the problem definition, agenda-setting and solution creation as policy making
processes, and to also determine how these emerge using the Facebook social network site, SMDPL.

CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW
This section presents relevant literature that covers library funding advocacy; social network sites
and participatory information sharing; public sector structures and policymaking; the theory CPV
(Benington & Moore, 2011) and the methodological approaches provided by discourse analysis
frameworks.
Library Funding Advocacy
Advocacy, as a form of information sharing, is the process of educating and influencing decision
makers and the public to support causes of all types. Advocacy efforts may focus on influencing public
opinion, sparking legislative action and identifying the needs of communities; often these targets are
interrelated and interdependent (Hoover, 2012). “Fundamentally, advocacy is about speaking out and
making a case for something important…‘advocacy’ encompasses any activity that a person or
organization undertakes to influence policies. There is great latitude in this definition, and some people
consider advocacy to be all activities that are not specifically lobbying, such as public demonstrations, or
the filing of friend of the court briefs” (NPAction, as cited in Nelson, 2009). Information sharing for
advocacy efforts may occur over a variety of social network sites.
Library funding advocacy can be framed from multiple perspectives, with arguments that range
from the civic and cultural role of libraries (Wiegand, 2000; Harris, 1973); the ideological divisions that
frame community governance principles that administer to libraries and create local, legal mandates
(Jaeger, Gorham, Bertot, & Sarin, 2014); and to the values assessments that can be anchored in public
good, economic resource or local funding challenges (De Rosa & Johnson, 2009; Shubik-Richards &
Dowdall, 2012). All of these discourses can become politically polemical when they surface as tough
choices during times of revenue shortfalls with the potential to cause job losses. Library funding advocacy
is usually a discourse rebutting the negative aspersions that describe an outdated institution that has
been replaced by modern technological affordances and an educated citizenry.

Evolving Role of the American Public Library
The history of the American public library portrays an ingrained dichotomy of an institution that
has responded to the needs of communities and the intellectual tastes of the American elite (Harris, 1973;
Wiegand, 2000); however, the public library is a complex, dynamic social and cultural agent that reflects
the forces of communities, both local and larger, that it is compelled to respond to (Jaeger, et al., 2014).
The roles of libraries and librarians have been either descriptive, modeling the community served and
meeting the needs, tastes and desires of the stakeholders within; or prescriptive, serving a more

12

leadership-oriented role by with collections designed to enlighten, educate and otherwise cultivate a high
purpose (Harris, 1973). Serving both roles may challenge the personal mission of librarians, public agents
who are charged with funding the costs of libraries within a publicly-obtained budget, and communities
that may only be able to fund a limited scope of service. Measuring the success of these two roles has
historically overlooked the assessment of the user, as historical library use is not heavily documented
(Wiegand, 1999); whereas in the past, libraries were assessed based on collection size and quality; tools
to evaluate library efficiency and quality now focus on measures of service to communities, program
outcomes and satisfaction of user expectations (Hernon & Altman, 2010).
There are many prevailing views of current library missions as community-based social information
service agencies, with their role of general information providers becoming increasingly supplanted by
private sector innovations. Library information and service is not free, and yet as a public good, it is made
freely available to all; therefore a tension exists about how to measure the cost of information as a
commodity, the cost of delivering information to a variety of users (Prentice, 1996) and the overall value
of the library to a community of users.
The American public library system can thank Andrew Carnegie’s initial $3 billion investment that
built 1689 libraries across the nation (Public Agenda, 2006, p. 5). Together with local community support,
libraries have become a fundamental fixture in a community’s landscape. Many cite the American public
library for its contribution to building an educated American populace, inhabiting a role as “a significant
public institution” that is fixed “in the American consciousness” (Public Agenda, 2006, p. 5), and it is clear
that libraries continue to rely on “broad public support” (Public Agenda, 2006,p. 5). The library-funding
situation in Florida and specifically, in Miami-Dade County, mirrors that of funding trends across the
nation (Public Agenda, 2006; De Rosa & Johnson, 2009), deriving 85.39% of its fiscal year 2012-2013
funding from the local tax base (Division of Library & Information Services, 2014).
More recently, the introduction of technology added a role to libraries to function as intermediaries
for those who lack access to and are challenged by digital technologies’ access barriers such as digital
literacy, expensive devices and inconsistent or costly service provision (Jaeger, Bertot, Kodama, Katz, &
DeCoster, 2011; Prentice, 1996). Public libraries have embraced the role of information technology
facilitator, providing computer access, training, digital collections and virtual entertainment. According to
the Public Library Funding and Technology Access Study, 2011-2012, libraries are the “ lifeline to the
technology resources and digital skills essential to full participation in civic life and in the nation’s
economy. Libraries continue to transform lives by providing critical services and innovative solutions to
technology access” (Hoffman, Bertot & Davis 2012, p. 6).
Today, public library use is driven by the need to provide access to burgeoning and pervasive
technologies as well as the provision of costly resources and proprietary content (Hernon & Altman,
2010). However, this need is no longer required or desired by those in the community most able and
willing to pay but is increasingly necessary for those community members who cannot aspire to the
private possession of goods and services required for participation in many aspects of American and

13

global society (De Rosa & Johnson, 2009; Jaeger, et al., 2014). As Shera indicated, libraries are going to
adapt to the prevailing social winds and tailor services to the public for whom the political sway is
embodied (1949).
Library advocates are regularly required to demonstrate library relevance in a time in which “new
information technologies alter the existing landscape [and] bring disruption” (Gleick, 2011, p. 411).
Libraries need advocates to maintain the continued support of the services they provide. In its simplest
expression, “Fundamentally, advocacy is about speaking out and making a case for something
important.” (NP Action, 2005, para 1). Currently, the challenge for library advocates is to change the
image of an oft-depicted ‘irrelevant’ library to be seen as “more than an expensive warehouse” (Hernon &
Altman, 2010, p. 3) and change the perception of libraries’ value. Advocacy is the process of educating
and influencing decision makers to support libraries of all types and advocacy efforts focus on influencing
public opinion, sparking legislative action and identifying the needs of communities (Hoover, 2012). These
advocacy tasks are interrelated and interdependent, and library advocates must speak to them all. A
library needs all aspects that each represents: relevant services that meets the immediate, public good;
active representation in decision-making bodies; and, a receptive environment (Nauratil, 1985).

Measuring Library Value for Effective Advocacy
Studies suggest that the biggest problems facing library advocacy efforts are that the full scope of
the library environment’s politics, policy, advocacy, history and services, and its integration into larger
society is rarely portrayed well (Jaeger, et al., 2014). “The ultimate goal of demonstrating library value
and advocating for the support of libraries is to change the current political and policy discourse into an
environment far more supportive of public libraries and their contributions” (Jaeger, et al., 2014, p. 118).
While prevailing political, social and economic realities shape and that limit the service provision
of public libraries to the resources of local governmental budgets, much of the literature demonstrates the
value of sustaining quality service for a diverse population (De Rosa & Johnson, 2009; Hoffman, Bertot &
Davis, 2012; Knight Foundation, 2009; Shubik-Richards & Dowdall, 2012). Further, traditional library
service measures may contribute to an inadequate description of the value of libraries in supporting their
communities, especially with the proliferation of electronic government and health resources requiring
online access and populations requiring increasing technological literacy support and training (Jaeger, et
al. 2011). The ways in which data are collected often do not provide community-specific, market-based
data that are relevant to a particular library; while these data are created at the library level, the collection
and analysis is conducted at the administrative system level, which in many cases, aggregates and
reports data at county levels, disguising important characteristics of individual locations (Koontz, Jue, &
Lance, 2005). As diversity in the U.S. population continues to increase, needed services may not be
provided, or may be underfunded because their contributions to their communities are simply not
recorded or reported (Koontz, & Jue, 2002; Koontz, Jue, & Lance, 2005).

14

Based on consistently decreasing public funding to libraries, the message from decision-making
stakeholders is that public libraries are viewed as consistently underperforming the expectations and the
cost of their operations (Prentice, 1996). While public libraries can serve a useful and important public
service, there is dissension about what that service looks like and how to pay for its increasingly
expensive manifestation. Questions are asked such as whether the library relies upon outreach for the
benefit of the unserved and the underserved, or as a means for self-propagation (Jaeger, et al, 2014).
Does service provision occur in a reality vacuum, failing to clearly align needs with any accountability? Or
is it that traditional library service measures fail to identify many uses of the modern library?

Role of Librarians and Libraries in Advocacy Efforts
While the purpose and daily activities of today’s public library may be understated by traditional
library service measures and thus provide insufficient data to support funding arguments (Lyons, 2013),
advocacy for funding is also dependent upon a full description of the value of libraries in supporting their
communities. A better way is needed to understand and align the values libraries provide with those that
the community declares are important. Overall, library advocacy is hampered by:
•

Belief on the part of librarians that advocacy is not a part of their job that results in a lack of
organization and/or intention (Comito, Geraci & Zabriskie, 2012);

•

Inadequate awareness of or training in marketing in library advocacy, especially in the use of
accurate, in-depth or meaningful statistical information (Lyons, 2013; Mandel, 2013);

•

Insufficient, inadequate or obsolete use measures employed to indicate productivity,
performance standards or use measures when assessing library systems in flux (Jaeger, et al.,
2014; Koontz, Jue, & Bishop, 2009; Lyons, 2013)

•

A sense that the position of neutrality required by professional and objective information provision
standards extends to the task of creating a voice for the library and denies the librarian a
contribution to the public conversation;

•

Fear of reprisal from or outright denial of rights to participate by library management (Comito,
Geraci & Zabriskie, 2012);

•

Systemic policies that deter library worker advocacy and that preclude all but certain types of
public agencies from advocating for library causes (Chrastka, 2012);
Library advocacy can be compared to ‘lighthouse advocacy’, in which the costly value of the

community benefit from a lighthouse is the same no matter how many ships are guided safely into shore
(Jaeger, et al., 2014). This metaphor suggests that libraries’ value is marginalized by focusing only on the
cost of information provision and does not provide the full portrayal of the mission and outcomes of public
library service, in part because advocacy for libraries often lacks crucial volume or content because of
inadequate or elusive measures; or the value of librarian professional neutrality turns into the spectre of a
lost stakeholder voice, as professional requirements for adherence to information provision objectivity is

15

mistakenly transferred to a passive, victim’s role of voiceless service provider. Some argue that a librarian
practicing neutrality in an age of “increasingly partisan cultural atmosphere…denies him or herself the
opportunity to definitively reverse the tide of negative educational trends” (Alighieri, 2006, p. 28) and
leads to further denigration of the library’s relevance.

Advocacy Research
Advocacy research examines efforts to demonstrate community value through library use
measures and library value calculators but efforts often fall prey to the lure of misleading visual statistical
data or the lack of data about their particular situation (Lyons, 2013). Further, Sin & Kim (2008) found that
while the scope of library research has increased, the sophistication of analysis has not included control
of user characteristic variables that examines library services variables such as geographic siting relevant
to community statistics. Bishop and Mandel (2010) champion the use of geographic information systems
(GIS) as a more visually pleasing and effective manner in which to display library service data and
support library service decision making, tying service to funding areas and to characteristics of the
population served. Mandel (2013) suggests the use of “seating sweeps”, a method that collects the hereto-fore elusive in-library use data, as a means to further evidence library value to a community. Library
service market data visualized and explained by iMapLibraries attempted to both isolate branch level data
and visualize its community reach to better identify the impact of library funding decision making (Mon,
2013). Spilioti has distinguished between online and offline interactions of library use employing discourse
analysis to encompass a blended ethnographic approach with both modes receiving equal attention
(2011). If advocacy as a form of information sharing occurs over a variety of online and offline channels
including social network sites, then it follows that research into library funding advocacy must extend to
examinations of advocacy conducted via social media and the interrelationship of online and offline social
networks.
In Hussey and Velasquez’ examination of 56 library and information science school course
curricula, only two programs offered courses with the word ‘advocacy’ in the title. (2011). Advocacy was
demonstrated to be of little focus in library and information studies education. Thus, the information
sharing for advocacy in communities lacks a librarian workforce that is trained for advocacy. In their
discussion of findings, the authors related this lack of librarian awareness to the case of the Los Angeles
Public Library system, in which the authors report a lack of community response until after the librarian
workforce was reduced by 30% and library service hours were cut to five days per week from seven days
per week, at which time librarian advocates increased their participation (Hussey & Velasquez, 2011).
The benefits and outcomes of libraries are dynamic and fluid. The framing of library benefits
needs to be more immediate and personal: it is not simply an abstract public good but is more
importantly, a fundamental community good that constructs a more organized discourse. Understanding
the complex tension of the librarian’s adherence to notions of neutrality is important to an examination of
advocacy using social network sites, in which the library professional may have access to an anonymous

16

forum but may yet identify systemic or professional constraints that confine their comments to generalities
mirroring the vague effectiveness of lighthouse advocacy. Factors that enable library funding advocacy
include a clear strategic plan, a network of diverse stakeholders and a well-reasoned appeal to
policymakers who have limited funds, limited time and outdated understanding of the library’s current
place in their community.

Social Movements Online
Advocacy, public protests, natural disaster responses and public sector communication, carried
out within the online, participatory media ecosystem (Tufekci, 2013) is growing. From the Egyptian
uprising and Occupy movement (Skinner, 2011), the Spanish insurgency of 2011 (Gonzalez-Bailon,
2013) to the use of social media for natural disaster recovery networking (Merchant, Elmer & Lurie, 2011),
social network sites have emerged alongside traditional media platforms, providing forums for crowd
sourced solutions, drawing on social capital and engaging multiple actors with diverse roles of agency
into a conversation about social phenomena. Increasing numbers of studies indicate that social media in
particular, is playing a more prominent role in the communication between government and citizens
(Hong, 2013; Reddick & Norris, 2011). Williams and Shearer (2011) indicate that much communication
remains one-way broadcasting in spite of expectations that social media will afford greater interaction and
transparency. While governments may be expected to increase transparency and efficiency in information
dissemination using social media (Sadeghi, 2012), it is unclear if participation in the policymaking
processes of problem definition, agenda-setting, and solution creation occur in social media with tangible
results and a clear mandate for public officials about the wishes of the citizenry.

Participatory Networks
Participatory networks are defined as connections between users that facilitate conversations
between individuals and include both face to face, print and online social network sites that are software
applications that allow individuals to construct personal profiles, lists of users with whom they share a
connection, and to “view and traverse” (boyd & Ellison, 2007, p. 211) both their own and others’
connections. In the public sector, this can be thought of as e-democracy, democratic participation, or as
Benington suggests “networked community governance” in which the state and the markets are
compelled to engage with civil society in the act of policy making (Benington & Moore, 2011). The
spectrum of network participation in a public sector can range from use of static e-government websites
to obtain information and services, to more wide-ranging and reciprocal and interactive activities such as
Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest and other social sites.

Networked Publics

17

Social network sites function as networked publics that “are restructured by networked
technologies” (boyd, 2010, p. 39) that provides a new online space where “an imagined collective” (p. 39)
results from the convergence of people, technology and practice and offers innovative capacities for
participation. The use of social network sites and in this case, the social media platform Facebook, is
better understood by a discussion of publics viewed from different disciplines including political
(Habermas, 1964)) in which it is renamed public sphere for those who have a civic and collective interest
in sharing; culture and media (Livingstone, 2005), in which the public is a form of 'audience'; or de
Certeau, who says the consumption and production of cultural objects creates an intimate bond which
results in a public (2002); and Fraser's public, which is created for individuals to form and act out social
identities (1992). Ito's definition combines elements of community with technology, and may be most
applicable specifically for an examination of the information sharing in the social network sites used
during the Miami-Dade library funding crisis: a networked public is "a linked set of social, cultural, and
technological developments that have accompanied the growing engagement with digitally networked
media" (2008, p.2) to which boyd adds the notion that publics exist "both in terms of space and
collectives" (boyd, 2010), extending the reach of the collective of library advocates from the physical
library to the virtual advocacy campaign.

Social Network Sites
Social network sites, also referred to as social network services (Zhang & Leung, 2014), function
as “popular online hangout spaces for both youth and adults. People flock to them to socialize with their
friends and acquaintances, to share information with interested others, and to see and be seen” (boyd,
2010, p. 39). boyd identifies three fundamental forces that shape networked publics: invisible audiences,
which are not visible nor always ‘co-present’; collapsed contexts that exist without specific spatial, social
or temporal boundaries; and, “blurring of public and private, “meaningless binaries, scaled in new ways,
and difficult to maintain as distinct” (boyd, 2010, p. 10). Social network sites like the Facebook page,
SMDPL, meet the criteria of a networked public as a space produced by the networked technology of a
social media page that provides opportunities to share, and create and further, transforms the space into
one in which individuals can engage and participate with others unknown to them in ways previously
unavailable, possible forging new social, cultural and civic outcomes.

Online/Offline Relationships
Multiple studies demonstrate the interrelatedness of online and offline networks (Ellison,
Steinfield, & Lampe, 2007; Lampe, Ellison & Steinfield, 2006; Lankes, Silverstein & Nicholson, 2007;
Parks & Floyd, 1996). Users migrate their offline relationships into online relationships and build a
“differentiated tool-kit to support a variety of interaction modalities” (Wellman, 2002, p. 18) because

18

relationships matter, this study is concerned with the holistic approach to information sharing and will
include examination of the interaction between the online and offline relationships.
Traditional offline channels include face-to-face environments such as public discussion,
television journalism, print journalism, and organized demonstrations in public locations. These channels
can be impacted by mobility, access and time availability, which in the online environment is mitigated by
the ubiquitous nature of digital access (given an Internet connection) and mobile technology.
Online channels include search engines (Google, Bing), website directories (Yahoo), information
aggregators (Google Alerts, Feedly, Google News/Reader, Pulse, any other RSS feed) and content
management (Diigo, OneNote, Evernote) and social “commons-based peer production” (Benkler, 2006)
sites in which individuals select preferences and alternatives are suggested by social network peers
(Google Alerts, RSS Feeds, Diigo, Tumbler, Twitter, del.icio.us). Many public sector websites embed links
to these services on their homepages. The interactivity of the mechanisms provide a way for users to
gather, co-create, re-assemble and share information in a peer production based on shared interests
(Mergel, 2013).
There are unique Internet dynamics that affect information sharing online and this is a different
affordance than the ability to note body language and facial cues of an in-person engagement (boyd,
2010). Thus, being able to loop two individuals into one conversation, asking personal questions in
anonymous online environments and sharing embedded messages into forwarded messages are all
elements of information sharing online that speeds up communications and expands the participatory
network (Wellman, 2002).
This description of online/offline phenomena is based upon the premise that social network sites’
users share information in multiple formats and in both digital and non-digital dimensions. Relationship
infrastructures are the building blocks of advocacy and these are the resources that produce strong online
advocacy using online information sharing networks (Berkman, 2008; Day, 2002; Hoffman & Fodor, 2010;
Hussey & Velasquez, 2011; Kent, Carr, Husted & Pop, 2011; Kho, 2011; Sachs, Eckel, & Langan,
2011;Wellman, 2002).
Online examples drawn from online categories of social network systems include social media, which
is “new digital media phenomena such as blogs, social network sites, location-based services, microblogs, photo- and video – sharing sites, etc., in which ordinary users (i.e. not only media professionals)
can communicate with each other and create and share content with others online through their personal
networked computers and digital mobile devices” (Bechmann & Lomborg, 2013, p. 767).

Online Public Movement Discourse
Online public sector discourse exhibits a the evolution of communication in from a single node
broadcast to the multi-node, multi-media, often user-generated, crowd-sourced information sharing that
can be found in the broad digital environment that includes social network sites such as official
government websites along with social media such as micro-blogs, sharing services, discussion forums

19

and other virtual worlds (Hale, 2011; Jaeger, Bertot & Shilton, 2012; Mintrom, 2012). The growth of egovernment services increases democratic participation and engagement, stresses the valuable coproduction of public goods and the immense benefits provided by crowd sourcing solutions and
innovations (Alford, 2009; Benington & Moore, 2011; Bertot, Jaeger & Hansen, 2012; Johnston, 2010).
Social media has simply “become an important component of e-government “(Bertot, Jaeger & Hansen,
2012, p. 31).
In addition, social media use is seen as one way to facilitate the change mission of government
agencies’ infrastructure resulting in a more flexible information management style that uses technology to
enhance the role of citizens in governing (Hale, 2011; Johnston, 2010). Social media use by government
agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) not only increase access to
authoritative information but have spawned interactive dialogues between health care providers, public
health organizations and consumers (Harris, Mueller, & Snider, 2013). The participatory social network
has already expanded beyond the one to many platform of public information dissemination to the many
to many, dis-intermediated dialogues that Hand and Ching claim has the power to remove the
“hegemonic discourse that equates a lack of participation with an individual’s apathy” (2011, p. 364).
In describing the Spanish movement of the Indignados or the American version of the Occupy
movements, Castells suggests that these online, networked movements are leaderless in large part and
hard for the media to cover with out one consolidated source of reliable information. In the May 2011
Spanish Indignados movement, media outlets relied on Twitter messages and Facebook posts to
disseminate information that they had little ability to filter yet capacity to amplify (2013). This increasing
participation, user-generated discourse, has resulted in a “language ecosystem expressive of new
subjectivities” (Castells, 2013, p. 125) fueled by access to digital networks that multiply content and
diffusion, message and medium.

Creating Public Value Through Public Discourse
The importance of information sharing using social network sites as viewed through the public
value framework rests in the evolution of the public manager’s role and purpose in its use. Rather than a
singular mission of policy implementation, the public manager’s success relies on “the ability to adapt to,
and shape, the external environment. Furthermore, public value cannot be delivered without ongoing
public engagement and dialogue as the continuation of funds depends on this ‘renewal of citizen
consent’” (Williams & Shearer, 2011, p. 6).
Social media’s user participation theories contribute additional descriptions of value creation.
Bechmann & Lomborg describe social media value creation as both economic and socio-political value
creation and as personal expression and individual sense-making (2012). “Management of the social
relationships in everyday life and the use of social media for power, marketing, business and individual
creative endeavours are cited as user-centric perspectives that are influencing the conception of “the
media user as a participatory agent” (Bechmann & Lomborg, 2012, p. 765). CPV seeks to identify the

20

ways the user participation contributes value to a public sphere, either through value or purpose-laden
discourse that seeks greater sense-making, or through the creation of public sector resources that are
economic or socio-political in nature (Bechmann & Lomborg, 2013).
Benkler claims that the use of online participatory sharing sites legitimized the "salience,
acceptability, and recognition of fan-created videos" (2011, p. 746). This is similar to the legitimizing of
citizen-created information that is gaining momentum through social media supported online advocacy
and protests. Social networks “contribute, alongside the fan sites, to alternative distribution channels and
mechanisms for creating social meaning. Though these networks did exist prior to this period, they were
greatly facilitated, on one hand, and had their coverage extended to many new fans, on the other, by
networked communications" (Benkler, 2011, pp. 746-747).

Networked Community Governance
Arguments for increased citizen participation usually focus on the benefits of a progressive
process and a belief that active participation is preferred to passive acquiescence (Arnstein, 1969; Irvin
and Stansbury, 2004; Putnam, 1995). “The state is more than an allocator of services and values; it is an
apparatus for assembling and managing the political information associated with expressions of public will
and with public policy’’ (Bimber, 2003, p. 17). Often, citizen participation results in a popular mandate that
supports a controversial policy shift but “opening the process to meaningful public input, the department is
empowered to make decisions it could never make unilaterally” (Applegate, 1998, p. 931). This implies
altering the policy-making process.

Policy Making Process
While many frameworks and concepts have been proposed identifying policy-making in a variety of
contexts, here formal policy analysis comprises six policy-making steps including problem definition (that
often incorporates agenda-setting), alternative responses (solutions), evaluation criteria, projected
outcomes for each alternative, cost-benefit analysis of alternatives and selection (Mintrom, 2012). But
policy-making is often haphazard (Hale, 2011) and conducted as if combining the multiple streams of
problems, policies and politics that converge at a point in time and propel an issue to stakeholders’
attention (Kingdon, 2003). This analysis will examine the policy process elements of problem definition,
agenda-setting, solution creation; Yang’s revised model (in press) of CPV discusses the element of
consensus – the attempt by stakeholders to agree on alternatives that are mutually satisfying – as an
addition to the deliberative process of discourse as examined in this study.
Most policy-making descriptions begin with the articulation of a generally unfavorable condition
warranting attention and the related contextual factors (Mintrom, 2012) labeled here as Problem
Definition. Agenda-setting is the list or set of problems to which stakeholders are paying attention –
stakeholders can include government officials and others outside of government (Kingdon, 2003) and can

21

be viewed separately from Problem Definition (Mintrom, 2012) as will be done in this analysis. Solution
creation is considered attendant to problem definition (Kingdon, 2003; Mintrom, 2012; Hale, 2011) and is
the proposed antidote that addresses a problem or condition (Mintrom, 2012).
Though collaborative policy-making and implementation can be costly in terms of time spent in
facilitating multiple viewpoints and resolving conflicts (Hale, 2011), the process creates trust, informs
citizens, builds strategic alliances, establishes the legitimacy of decisions and potentially discourages
long-term litigation costs (Irvin and Stansbury, 2004). In spite of a lack of guidance (Mergel, 2013;
Mosteller, email correspondence, 2013), the use of online social networks in community governance
offers robust examples of information sharing for various uses by a diverse sample of participants. The
convergence of public governance with social network sites can be aligned with the deep systemic
change in political, economic, social, technological and economic environments (Benington, 2011;
Castells, 1996; Mergel, 2013). In response, governments employ greater numbers of professional
specialists (Hale, 2011) but also engage in network building that cuts across boundaries of agencies,
disciplines and expertise in areas such as different sectors (public, private and civil), different levels of
government, different types of services, and various resource providers and users (Alford, 2009;
Benington, 2011). This results in forms of “co-production between public service workers and their clients
and communities” (Benington, 2011, p. 33) and government seeks to benefit from diverse and greater
resources required in continuously changing context but also engages and empowers through networks
and partnerships. This empowerment and engagement of civil society, or the “sphere of social interaction
between economy and state, composed of the family, voluntary associations, social movements, and
forms of public communication” (Cohen and Arato, 1992, p. 38) aligns with discourse that Habermas
describes in the public sphere (1974) and which Benington indicates as “emergence of new patterns of
networked community governance [that] reflects and implies a shift in the centre of gravity of governance
away from the state and towards civil society” (2011, p. 36).

From e-Government to e-Democracy
Charalabidis and Loukis (2012) recount research that describes the evolving landscape of social
network sites used by government agencies, as different missions and purposes extend uses: 1) core
service provision (what is often termed e-government), regulation, law enforcement, information
dissemination and cross-agency collaboration; 2) transformational use by government that seeks to
improve and shift activities to citizen-centered platforms (or e-democracy) and can affect all domains of
government; and 3) crowdsourcing and co-production of resources that Brabham calls “a new web-based
business model that harnesses the creative solutions of a distributed network of individuals through what
amounts to an open call for proposals” (2008, p. 76).
Use of online social network sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, increases the
transparency of governance actions as it extends the reach of governance networks and is therefore a

22

phenomenon to be well understood. For instance, users of Facebook report that they are twice as likely
to attend political meetings, more likely to attempt to influence someone’s vote (78% more), and 53%
more likely to vote or intend to vote (Hampton, Goulet, Rainie & Purcell, 2011). A recent Pew Internet
survey of political conversations on Twitter identified six common network structures – divided, unified,
fragmented, clusters, inward and outward hubs and spoke structures – which are created by the
respondents’ choice of who to reply to or mention in their posts. These findings suggest that these
structures create a narrative about the conversation, such as when polarization takes effect in political
conversations and the types of content shared (Smith, Rainie, Shneiderman & Himelboim, 2014).
Drawing from Agranoff and McGuire (2003), “with the exception of agency boundary spanners,
many public agency administrators spend as little as 15 to 20 percent of their time in all types of crossagency work, including involvement in networks” (Agranoff, 2014, p. 197). Public managers spend little
time in intergovernmental networking and remain little disposed to conducting policymaking outside their
own domains. In part this is due to the inability to address fundamental issues of the place of networks
within their legally drawn areas of authority and the ability of agencies to use their contributions (Agranoff,
2014). However, governance models continue to experience a flattening, or absorption of hierarchical
structures into less rigid, more flexible, intergovernmental, multipurpose and temporary sub-organizations
that organize around programs and projects rather than processes.
In using online social network sites, public officials and administrators face new challenges for
which they may not be effectively supported or trained. While traditional public relations for agencies
include developing relationship protocols with the legislature, the established media and
intergovernmental agencies, “the new skills of external relations” (Denhardt, Denhardt, and Aristigueta,
2009, p. 386) in which public managers and officials are advised to develop skills that include listening to
“the voices of citizens, clients, and customers” (p. 386), working toward increasing involvement with all
stakeholder groups. But social media is a tool best used with purpose and strategic planning. Mastering
new applications can be time-consuming, maintaining conversations can be challenging, and monitoring
the fast-moving social media landscape can be all encompassing. Participation in social media is enticing
but as with all activities, organizations must be able to measure its impact on their core missions and
goals.
Public sector officials and agencies incorporating social media into the problem definition and
agenda-setting aspects of policy making face the same challenges with online social network systems as
those faced in offline situations that include accessibility (to technology), ease of use, affordability, user
privacy, and literacy challenges (Jaeger, Bertot, and Shilton, 2012). Other technology specific challenges
include the need to establish acceptable use policies with third party providers, identifying user privacy
and record retention requirements and usability and digital literacy challenges faced by users (Jaeger, et
al., 2012).
Jaeger, Bertot and Shilton suggest that the principles of universal service, equity of access and
literacy best serves the transformation of policy making using a flattened governance structure and social

23

media as its tool because “the goal of making technology equally available to all, focusing on challenges
such as infrastructure and geography” would be addressed by this practice. (2012, p. 19). This still does
not address the issue of affordability and the digital divide. To address the issue of inclusion, use of
universal design would ensure consideration for both the disabled and “an imagined average user”
(Jaeger, et al., 2012, p. 19).
Social network sites offer an expanding channel of feedback that is often unpredictable in its
diffusion and potent in its ability to provide power to a collective voice (Alford, 2009). It is the
unpredictable and uncontrollable nature of networked communication that can challenge public
administrators’ and officials’ ability to define policy problems and steer conversations to alternatives and
solutions that are within the realm of public agencies to address. Participatory networks’ swift sharing of
information can contribute unparalleled miscommunication in matters where public participation may be
viewed by public administrators as little more than a “necessary evil” (Timney, 1998, p. 96).

Governance Structure in Miami-Dade County
The structure of Miami-Dade county government can be traced back to a 1956 Florida state
legislative constitutional amendment that created the Miami-Dade home rule, in which “the electors of
Miami-Dade County were granted the power to revise and amend the Charter from time to time by
countywide vote” (Miami-Dade Office of Management and Budget [MD OMB], 2014, p. 32). Charter
governments in Florida are considered to provide greater democracy to their residents since the county
maintains the right to tailor the government structure to meet county needs (Florida Association of
Counties, 2012).
The current makeup of the Miami-Dade government is considered two-tiered, in which
incorporated municipalities operate separately alongside the county structure, which also governs the
unincorporated regions of the county that represent 43.84% of the total county population (MD OMB,
2014). The County maintains preeminence with the Board of County Commissioners (BCC) retaining the
right to assume a city’s operations if deemed necessary.
The County structure was further amended in 2007 when the County Charter was amended to
provide for a ‘Strong Mayor’ form of government, who may serve two terms but while in office, has veto
power over any local legislative, “quasi-judicial” (MD OMB, 2014, p. 32) or zoning decisions passes by the
BCC. The BCC is made up of one member each from the 13 single-member districts and may serve two,
four-year terms. The BCC may override the mayor’s vetoes with a two-thirds vote. In Miami-Dade
County, Home Rule has provided for the reorganization of three elected officials, Sheriff, Supervisor of
Elections and Tax Collector, to become positions appointed by the mayor. Along with the County
Attorney, the Office of the Mayor and the Board of County Commissioners are considered the “Policy
Formulation” (MD OMB, 2014, p. 33) entity of the county.
According to the Miami-Dade County employee guide to the county government, 2.496 million
residents live within Miami-Dade’s 35 municipalities and unincorporated regions (Miami-Dade County

24

Human Resources Department Training and Development Unit [MDCHR], 2015). The county
encompasses over 2000 square miles, bounded by the Everglades National Park, Biscayne Bay, the
Atlantic Ocean and Broward County. The county’s budget is over $6 billion and Miami-Dade County is
both a recreational destination as “the cruise ship capital of the world” (Miami-Dade County, 2015, p.15)
and the 2nd largest U. S. air transit station, home of the Miami-Dade International Airport. Miami-Dade
County boasts 1.247 million registered voters (Miami-Dade County, 2015).
The Miami-Dade Library system is funded by an annually-renewed millage rate applied to
property taxes and is designated for operations purposes. The proposed millage rate is subject to two
BCC votes and up to six public meetings are to be held at conveniently located and accessible locations,
advertised in print newspapers circulated both generally and as community-based periodicals.

Miami-Dade County Libraries
The Miami-Dade County library system expanded from a reading room in Lemon City to the
current 49 outlets, beginning with the efforts of local women’s clubs and culminating in the countywide
expanse resulting from an ambitious 2001 Capital Plan. The library touts an award-winning program
called “The Five-Star Commitment” based on ‘Attitude, Resources, Expertise, Empowerment and
Environment’(Miami-Dade Public Library System[MDPLS], 2015, para. 7). The library system serves a
population of almost 2.5 million people based on a taxing district that is 1,921 square miles with over 1
million registered borrowers that result in 6.7 million visits each year (MDPLS, 2015).

Creating Public Value
This section identifies fundamental elements of the theory CPV (CPV) including a brief
background of the development of the framework; the theoretical composition; the strengths, weaknesses
and limitations of the approach; and, how it can contribute to analyzing values shared using social
network sites in an advocacy campaign using public sector participatory collective networks. The aim of
this section is to examine library funding advocacy using social network sites to share information through
the public management framework of CPV, assuming that there is a relationship because public libraries
are generally governed by public sector agencies. The library funding advocacy discourse examined here
is considered a form of deliberative democracy (Nabatchi, 2012; Roberts, 2008; Yang, in press) and can
“assist with identifying and understanding public values, and consequently, improving decision making
and outcomes” (Yang, in press, p. 6). This deliberative process, the information sharing using social
network sites or discourse, contributes to Moore’s strategic triangle of values outcomes, authorizing
environment and operational capacity, by developing: a public perspective on what is of value in the
public sphere; adding a transparent process to the authorizing environment; and potentially igniting
innovation through information sharing that is an element of crowdsourcing that builds on networked
community governance’s operational capacity (Benington, 2011).

25

CPV is a dynamic product of Mark Moore’s research into individuals’ behaviors that function as
leaders in public service roles (1995). Examples of Moore’s inductive study describe the challenges of the
Belmont, Massachusetts’s library director as she attempted to resolve the problem of dealing with
‘latchkey children’ afterschool at her public library branch; and, of the Houston chief of police, Lee Brown,
who was hired to transform a department that had seen seven previous directors exit the job in the
previous eight years (Moore, 1995). Moore’s work began as a prescriptive case study provided as a
public management graduate school text. But the concepts that Moore presented became the subject of
both private and public sector management and administrative discussions, particularly because CPV is a
“strong conceptual framework that informs the newly emerging paradigm of networked community
governance (NCG)” (Benington, 2011, pp.31-32), much like theory of public goods served the traditional
public administration (TPA) and rational choice formed the basis of new public management (NPM). In
CPV, Moore articulates a community-wide, proactive response to systemic change, the fundamental and
underlying organizational and operational framework, in political, economic, technological, social and
ecological structures of society (Benington, 2011) and may answer more basic questions about the role of
governance and the emerging citizen involvement in democratic and public spheres.

Assumptions of the Theory
Understanding theory begins with identifying the concepts, assumptions and propositions that
underlie the theory’s paradigmatic principles (Fawcett, 2005). Transparency of the theory’s assumptions
means that these have been tested empirically or accepted by a number of other theories or prior
research (Meleis, 1991). In the case of CPV, its inductive birth as a prescriptive framework rather than a
detailed and developed theory, has made it susceptible to criticisms of perspectival ethnocentrism
(Rhodes & Wanna, 2007). Therefore, the theory is ready for examination of its precepts and development
of models that can be operationalized and explored. Benington lists the assumptions as:
•

The individual is no longer the arbiter of the value of a representative democracy

•

The public, through the example of social network systems, exhibits the ability and desire to
collectively make choices.

•

Networked community governance is an alternative to the choices of TPA and NPM as a way to
address the complexity of problems facing a changing global landscape. These problems are
often called ‘wicked problems’ because they are “complex, cross-cutting and often contested
issues” (Benington and Moore, 2011, p. 13) and they can manifest as child abuse, climate
change, ageing and community care; and fear of crime, among others.

•

The citizen as consumer, exhibiting behavior in which individuals expect choices and adequate
responses for public problems but also expect accessibility to government responsibility and
accountability.

Finally, while NCG recognizes that the line between what goods and services are expected to be handled
by the public and private sectors is blurred, and often is best handled by a third party actor, can it be

26

assumed that the product of this interaction is a result held in the public sphere? While the private and
public sector negotiate the landscape of the consumer and citizen spheres, the concept of public value
failure also emerges as a factor in moves to privatize institutions like libraries, schools, prisons and public
safety. But this has proved to be a constantly shifting scene, as market-based institutions and services
also fail to meet societal expectations as countries bail out banks (the U.S., Greece, Italy), among other
failures.

Public Sphere
“The public is made up of individuals – individual citizens, voters, and taxpayers – and of
collective bodies and institutions such as the voting constituencies of elected public executives, the
legislatures elected to guide and oversee the government’s executive branch, the courts responsible for
protecting the rights of individuals, and those who influence the actions and decisions of these institutions
(such as interest groups and the media)” Moore, p. 36, 2013).
The public, and the publicness of organizations like public libraries comprise the public sphere
possessing some inviolable characteristics that make any consideration of their interchangeability with
private sector functions or forms, and adoption of each other’s operating model, generally a dissatisfying
endeavor (Arns & Daniel, 2011; Bozeman, 2010; Bozeman & Bretschneider, 1994).

Public Goods
Public goods are those uses which require public monies to “pursue a purpose that have been
authorized by the citizens and representative government” (Moore, 1995, p. 53). Public value contributes
to the public good by manifesting the desires of the community. Examples of public value creation from
the provision of public goods include public sector education, public libraries, and municipal safety and
services, all of which are in part or in whole, created by and for with funding from public sources and
governed in part by public policy or management.

Public Value
Public value is the manifestation of the “desires and perceptions of individuals” (Moore, 1995, p.
52) as those things desired by individuals but unavailable due to market failure; and, belonging to the
realm of those activities conducted and resources provided for the whole of the public sector. Public
value contributes “to the public good” or uses public monies to “pursue a purpose that has been
authorized by the citizens and representative government” (Moore, 1995, p. 53). Examples of public
value include public sector education, public libraries, and municipal safety and services, all of which are
in part or in whole, created by and for with funding from public sources and governed in part by public
policy or management.

27

The deliberation over what adds to and detracts from public value “involves a constant battle of
ideas and values, because the public sphere is heavily contested territory, and there are many competing
interests and ideologies in play” (2011, p. 43). Because the process involves iterative and continuous
information sharing, Yang’s (in press) operationalization of the ‘deliberative’ stage of the process can be
examined using discourse analysis framed by the semantic domain. Mulgan (2011) examines the various
methods for determining public value, including economic indicators that require that public value
outcomes be monetized in the form of cost-benefit analysis, welfare economics, environmental
economics, social accounting and value-added measures among other examples. Each of these metric
systems attempt to determine what people really value, but again, it is difficult to gain consensus on
priorities and further, measurements are complex and “social science is not robust enough to make hard
predictions about what causes will lead to what effects (Benington and Moore, 2011, p. 28). Thus, Mulgan
arrives at a more direct premise, concluding that something is of value “if citizens…are willing to give
something up in return for it” (2011, p. 215). The use of values expressed in discourse analysis of the
Save the Miami Dade Public Libraries Facebook campaign may offer a glimpse of what that ‘something’
that citizens are willing to give up is, and can be examined using categories of values that include
universal, public sector and public library values.

Universal values.
Universal values can be defined as “enduring beliefs that influence the choices we make among
available means or ends” (Rokeach, 1973, p. 5). Kernaghan makes the distinction that ethics and values
are not synonymous; ethics are a subset of values and values can be ethical, unethical or non-ethical and
the table below suggests examples, some overlapping, of each type. Universal values are based on four
categories that include Ethical, Democratic, Professional and People as their descriptors (2003). Based
on Schwartz’s value dimensions (1994), universal values can be considered to represent the values
governing the “instinct to harmony among people” (Fleischmann, 2013, p. 12) and are the criteria by
which broad social aspirations can be understood.

Public sector values.
Williams and Shearer ground universal values in the public sector describing them as “aims that
will bring measurable benefit to the public sphere and which address the expressed or revealed priorities
of a given population (2011, p. 6). Adding value to the public realm through the generation of economic,
social, cultural, political, and environmental activity, public sector values result in products and services
tailor-made to satisfy unmet human needs. (Benington, 2011). These are mission and agency specific,
internal and subjective and comprise five categories of value that include economic, social, cultural,
political and environmental/sustainability values.

28

Public library values.
The public library value framework chosen to operationalize the initial axial codes of the analysis
codebook for this study are based on those articulated by the American Library Association including
Access, Confidentiality/Privacy, Democracy, Diversity, Education and Lifelong Learning, Intellectual
Freedom, The Public Good, Preservation, Professionalism, Service and Social Responsibility (2004).
These values represent the aims of the librarian profession toward inclusion and social equity
(Fleischmann, Wiegand, 1999). While a public library can be considered a subset of public sector
institutions, public library values in practice may experience tension and come into conflict with the
implementation of public sector values (Jaeger, et al., 2014).

Recognizing Public Value
Values expressions from the Facebook discourse in this study act as surrogates for value indicators.
As Moore acknowledges, establishing clear, widely accepted indicators of public value is a shifting and
context-dependent function and does not have strong commitment by the public sector (2012). Further,
the move away from measures of input and outputs to the capture of clearly related outcomes poses a
costly, time-consuming and elusive challenge for many public sector institutions including government
agencies, education and libraries.
Finally, the identity of public sector management has ranged from passive monitor to proactive agent
to vilified intruder on private freedoms and rarely as a source of value creation (Moore, 2012). In viewing
the public sector from the networked community governance perspective, CPV becomes a way to
examine the process by which actors in the public sphere (citizens and public agents) legitimize a
particular public value concept and thus establish their roles in the authorizing environment; and,
identifies those values the community considers important in the public sphere. These are the values
upon which the community desires their public agents to base community governance. Who will be
arbiters and what values will be identified are the questions that CPV proposed to answer.
But understanding the roles and values is just a part of the whole idea of networked community
governance. Being able to understand the components of policymaking in the discourse as an example of
the Deliberative sphere of the Strategic Triangle is a way to examine how the discourse fits into the
structures of public sector discourse. This study examines just this one sphere of the Strategic Triangle,
but it benefits the context of the study to provide the full view of the CPV theory, as the expression of
values is just one step in the creation of the social outcomes that the wider public has agreed to pay for
through taxes and regulations.
CPV seeks to understand government agency performance by applying the private sector concept of
performance management, with values satisfaction replacing the profit metric. In doing so, public
organizations are compelled to scan the external environment of the community they service and find a
“fit” for the organization (Moore, 2012). This means aligning the organization strategically with a mission

29

that delivers “high-value uses of the assets that had been entrusted to them” (Moore, 2012, p. 7). This
would align the activities of government organizations with the desired effects of the participants acting as
the public’s arbiters. In this study, the desired effects are represented by the values and the arbiters are
the participants in the social network advocacy discourse.
As Yang suggests, creating public value does not occur until the values are implemented (in press).
In Recognizing Public Value, Moore extends the theory to provide a tool to evaluate the performance of
values implemented that serves as a metric for public value creation. The tool, a “public value account”
(Moore, 2012, p. 11), presents a costs-benefit comparison, in which both the costs and the benefits are
not always financially measurable elements but may also comprise material effects that are hard to
measure and difficult to compare. The tool is complemented by a description of a public sector “value
chain” (Moore, 2012, p. 14) made up of six steps to guide data-gathering needs at certain points along
the value creation process that affords the organization and the public a way to identify the satisfaction of
the public and “articulate a particular conception of public value for a given public agency at a particular
time (Moore, 2012, p. 63).
While this study does not conduct this evaluation exercise, it is worth noting that CPV offers a way to
understand the role of the participants’ discourse as they seek to legitimize library values as contributions
to a larger, value environment in the public sphere. Choosing the values are a preliminary step in
creating public value but also offers a means of accountability for government performance.

Limitations of Creating Public Value
Hale suggests that often, nongovernmental and public actors in informal collectives, or public
sector networks, offer the capacity to improve policy making and implementation in ways that neither
governments or markets can (2011). From a public administration and management perspective, the
information environment in the public sector can be described as an "intersectoral policy environment, or
web of policy communication relationships" (Hale, 2011, p. 2) which includes the public administrator
(manager or official), the citizen public and other nonprofit stakeholders. The importance of identifying
these relationships is to describe how the public/political agent experiences an information sharing social
network site. Therefore, an accurate and appropriate description of the public/political agent, his/her role
including job scope and authority, as well as the particular structural environment in which he/she operate
must be considered as a key limitation to the generalizability of CPV. Other limitations include:
•

When Moore first published CPV in 1995, the theoretical concepts were challenged in part
because the model was presented as a normative prescription for public sector management
rather than an empirical theory (Alford & O’Flynn, 2009). Rhodes and Wanna in particular, took
exception to the theory, suggesting “The criteria for evaluating aspirations differ from those that
seek to assess evidence” (2007, p. 408) and they therefore reject it as a summative instrument.
But others responded that Rhodes and Wanna’s criticisms misrepresent the theory and

30

disregard the dynamic environment of political/public agents who more frequently engage with
larger groups of increasingly diverse stakeholders (Alford, 2008).
•

Collective decision-making is time-consuming, prone to corruption and theoretically problematic.
(no clear authority, no clear accountability, susceptible to special interest, less efficient which
conflicts with agency mission).

•

Philosophically, the criticism focuses on the questions of virtue and the public good not being
linked to political-economic questions of governance, power and control (Morrell, 2009) and being
discounted by ‘new pragmatism’ (West and Davis, 2010) for not taking a more rational approach
to what is good for society and avoiding moral and ethical shading of the issues. Also, Meynhardt
(2009) argues that the concept of the ‘public’ is merely an individual notion and can only be
objectively derived at the ‘basic needs’ level. Alford and O’Flynn concern themselves with the
concept of public value itself but argue that the misgivings it possesses for being vague and
tentatively defined are redeemed by its broad scope of inclusion of situations where market
mechanisms fail to meet public needs or “individual citizens’ welfare, negative externalities,
natural monopolies or imperfect information (2009); further, public values encompasses more
than inputs and outputs by attempting to measure outcomes and prioritizes the development of
deliberative discourse.

•

How to measure the effects of public value? Which outcomes get measured? Better metrics by
themselves do not necessarily ensure better outcomes. Mulgan (2011) examines the various
methods for determining public value, including the obvious one of economic indicators, which
requires that public value outcomes be monetized, using cost-benefit analysis, welfare
economics, environmental economics, social accounting and value-added measures. Each of
these metrics attempt to determine what people really value, but again, it is difficult to gain
consensus on priorities and further, measurements are complex and “social science is not robust
enough to make hard predictions about what causes will lead to what effects (Benington and
Moore, 2011, p. 28). Thus, Mulgan arrives at a more direct premise: something is of value if
citizens are willing to give something up in return for it. This type of question is especially valuable
to understanding the discourse as conveyed by the information sharing using participatory
collective networks in the case of the Miami-Dade Public Library funding conflict. Key questions
to ask are if the entire community is truly represented by the vocal library advocacy network, or, if
the community is willing to tax itself for this specific purpose.

•

Establishing use of social network sites for information sharing can result in increased division
between various stakeholders and the deliberative process of discourse in creating public value
can be divisive; this is particularly disconcerting as even with increased democratic online
platforms of social network systems, traditional forms of power, money and media players
significantly influence politics” (Mansbridge, 1983; Shapiro, 2003; Sunstein, 2002; Yang, in
press). Given social network systems relatively youthful tenor, legitimation of the discourse would

31

also be questioned. Yang also argues that “deliberation cannot replace administrative neutrality
and expertise, nor can it replace the checks and balance of the representative system” (in press,
p. 6).

Public Sector Community Governance
The research on public governance illustrates how public administration and management
evolved from a hierarchical, traditional public administration (TPA) model, comprised of mostly
professional public policy agents; into a market-influenced new public management (NPM) model that
evoked a consumer-oriented service approach; and finally, into the current networked community
governance (NCG) model, in which a horizontal, self-organizing intergovernmental and extra-agency
network approach embraces greater collaboration across agencies and reaches out toward coordination
with both market-driven and civil society (Alford & O’Flynn, 2009; Benington, 2011). The evolution of the
governance paradigm exhibits a convergence of ideas and concepts toward a new model that integrates
government agencies, private sector and civil society into multiple forms of networks with varying
purposes. Figure 2-A illustrates the interrelationships between traditional concepts of state, market and
civil society, with civil society emphasized in the center, signifying the emerging, citizen-centric nature of
governance in which policymakers and others with state authority must govern in collaboration with formal
and informal third sector organizations (i.e., not public, not private), community groups and often
individuals.

Governance Models
Public governance evolved from a ‘rational actor perspective’ to more ‘pluralistic process’ model
of public policy decision making and implementation in which two perspectives dominate: networks as a
stakeholder mediating and facilitating process and an alternative form of governance structure (Goldsmith
& Eggers, 2004; Keast, Mandell, & Agranoff, 2013). Governance networks are defined as “more or less
stable patterns of social relations between interdependent actors, which take shape around policy
problems and/or policy programmes” (Kickert, Klijn, & Koppenjan, 1997, p. 6), noting that the
development of the governance network paradigm for public policy administration and management
examinations allows a broader scope of actors to be engaged in policy making and provides ways to
address problems with more diverse resources and in a “locally flexible way” (Keast, Mandell & Agranoff,
2013). This approach acknowledges the need for inter and extra-governmental agency collaboration and
supports the move to less hierarchical forms of management that more effectively develop and implement
public policy.
The concept of networked governance is a recent form of governance described as being fairly
untapped by public agency managers (Keast, Mandell & Agranoff, 2013). As government agencies share
policy problems and programs across intergovernmental networks and with extra-governmental
organizations, public agents often function as network managers to enact outcomes (Keast, Mandell, &
Agranoff, 2013) but the process can often be complex, volatile, and diverse (Benington, 2011). Rhodes
(2003) notes that the use of network is a common, everyday term used by officials, citizens, consumers,
politicians and journalists, among others, to describe a “web of relationships” (Keast, Mandell & Agranoff,
2013) in which these actors find themselves embedded.
In the TPA and NPM, the public administration, management and policy disciplines can be
described using two main network concepts: 1) a network that uses the minimal definition of a policy
network, “two or more organizations working together” (O’Toole, 1997); and 2) a network that
encompasses inter-organizational networks which are comprised of relatively independent organizations
for the fundamental purposes of advancing their own purposes, which usually have a profit focus and are
generally bound by contractual agreements (Keast, Mandell, & Agranoff, 2013). From a policy
perspective, these two types of networks are differentiated by “different/independent policy actors” (Keast,
Mandell, & Agranoff, 2013, p. 8) who collaborate for limited missions.
In contrast, the network governance concept, or transformational network arrangement is
distinguished by its “bonds of interpersonal relationship, trust, mutuality, and reciprocity” (Keast, Mandell,
& Agranoff, 2013, p. 8), which are reflected in both the process and actors involved are as much a
definitive outcome as is the mission achievement (Keast, Mandell, & Agranoff, 2013). Theories describing
the formation, operation and theoretical underpinnings of the transformational network are relatively few
and the public sector literature has generally disregarded the multidimensionality and multifunctional
nature of networks, which Keast, Mandell and Brown suggest limits the power to explain the impact of
networks on policy making and government agency innovation, and to explain why some succeed where

33

others flail (2006). It is the network governance concept that underlies the emerging paradigm of
networked community governance that has as its guiding theory, CPV (Benington, 2011).

Table 1 illustrates the functional differences between state, market and civil society as conceived in
NCG. Regulation types include ‘voice’ for the state, defined as voting or interest group pressure; ‘exit’ is
the means by which consumers choose or ‘exit’ a market and seek another supplier; and, loyalty, which in
collaborative networks is established by trust. The state is coordinated through hierarchies, the private
market through competition and civil society through collaborative networks While boundaries blur to
create broader notions of state, market and civil society, policymakers are still required to negotiate
regulations and institutional and organizational forms of coordination (Benington, 2011).

Public Sector Information Sharing and Networked Communities
Information sharing in the context of human communication in the public sector is a sphere of
activities and resources that are available to all in a community of interest, local or global, virtual or
physical, and that serves as an authorizing environment for policy making.
Public sector information sharing has been traditionally understood as communication and includes
policy-making and administration. Denhardt, Denhardt and Aristigueta define communication “as the
transmission of information from one party to another” (2009, p. 238). Considered a ‘broadcast’ (Berlo,
1960), this model of one-way communication implies a ‘one to many’ type of information sharing in which
a figurehead or information gatekeeper disseminates static information to an audience larger than one
(boyd, 2010). The purpose of public sector marketing and strategic communication has traditionally
promoted policies and organizational strategies and assist in the implementation of activities to bring
about a desired result (Moore, 1995). Tactics can include information to make actions comprehensible
and accepted to a wide variety of stakeholders who may have divergent interests in the outcome. Often
framed as
Adopting a multi-disciplinary framework using public management theory and library and
information science can examine diverse contexts for sharing information, “whose essentially contested
meaning focuses on activity which contributes to the making of an everyday world beyond and outside of

34

the boundaries of information science as an intellectual discipline” (Raber, 2003, p. 42). The environment
of the public manager or political agent includes social networks advocating for any type of policy change
or social issue unfolds from the traditional communication model and mirrors the slowly evolving
governance, administrative and policy-making structures in public sectors.
Even a traditional model of communication must include the understanding that it is a process
that is often not linear or finite but is dynamic and fluid. Berlo observed that “The ingredients within a
process interact; each affects all the others” (1960, p. 24). This is truly reflective of communication that
occurs on the Internet, and especially as produced and distributed through social media.
A mark of communication today is the instantaneous dissemination and feedback that occurs in
online social network sites; the feedback portion of the process occurs as quickly as an individual check,
his/her status on a network or is prompted by a push notification. Given the ‘one to many’ nature of social
media, there are many more receivers who may quickly become sources of the same message (using a
‘share’ function), a revised version of the same message, or may simply provide a response through a
comment.
In the context of the public sector, information sharing can be defined as the exchange of words,
ideas, and concepts that not only “convey meanings that can characterize and define the cultural life of a
society” (Williams, 1983, as cited in Raber, 2003, p. 7) but also create state authority to deliver public
value. As e-Government services, health and welfare programs and other daily civic activities are
provided to the public via the Web, many interactions are increasingly participatory and often geared
toward public expression of personal views (Pew, 2010), resulting in a new networked community
governance and the co-production of public value (Benington, 2011; Mulgan, 2011).
As a result of online, electronic information exchange that is facilitated by technological change
and increasingly networked government programs, all participants in social network sites are able to
“collaborate in decision-making processes and to incorporate broad involvement across groups of
individuals and organizations” (Hale, 2011, p. 10). In the public sector, information generated by networks
manifests as policymaking capacity for public agencies, and delivering public service to address public
problems (Hale, 2011) and includes four main types of networks, information networks, developmental
networks, action networks, and outreach networks (Agranoff, 2007).
While much of the information sharing in the Miami-Dade library funding conflict was conducted in
online settings, the social network sites possess offline components that appear to interact and possibly
influence the intensity and frequency of online information sharing. Social media’s user participation
theories contribute additional descriptions of value creation. Bechmann and Lomborg describe social
media value creation in terms of economic and socio-political value creation or in terms of value creation
in personal expression and individual sense-making (2012). “Management of the social relationships in
everyday life and the use of social media for power, marketing, business and individual creative
endeavours are cited as user-centric perspectives that are influencing the conception of “the media user
as a participatory agent” (p. 765).

Discourse Analysis
Several methods that best may examine the information sharing in participatory collective
networks include content analysis conducted on the text of the messages sent via any of the online
media. Content analysis is defined as “any technique for making inferences by objectively and
systematically identifying specified characteristics of messages” (Holsti, 1969, p. 14). While content
analysis can prove to be a complex and time-consuming endeavor in developing dictionaries for new and
dynamic phenomena, the study contributed to expanding roles for participatory media that are
increasingly used in public sector communication (Bertot, et al., 2012; Mergel, 2013). Hamdy and
Gomaa’s examination of the Egyptian uprising in January 2011 is an example of a quantitative content
analysis comparing government controlled newspaper stories, independent news stories and posts from
social media sites based on various frames of sentiment. And, Wallsten (2007), analyzes the relationship
between mainstream media and political blogs, using a content analysis of 35 issues raised in the 2004
U.S. presidential campaign describing a “complex, bidirectional relationship” (p. 567) through comparison
of two media.
Discourse analysis, as a form of content analysis, involves the examination of “any form of
language use manifested as (written) text or (spoken) talk-in-interaction” (van Dijk, 2009, p. 116). Van
Dijk’s use of discourse analysis in context extends the examination to “sounds and visuals in many hybrid
multimedia discourses” (2009, p.116) with context defined by the subject participant, rather than the
social situation. A discourse framework analyzes the broader policy process as a formative assessment
mechanism to identify biases in the policy-making process and to suggest ways to ensure that policy
accurately reflects the interest of the community stakeholders. This framework scrutinizes the influence
of policy predispositions on public sector activities (White, 1994), especially as policy implications are
exogenously imposed. Discourse analysis has traditionally been concerned with influences of informal
networks, which examines initiatives that are, in part, regionally developed, managed and dependent for
their success on grassroots acceptance. As Couldry suggests, media is less the text artifact, institution or
organization but is more a “complex space of social practice” (2006, p.31) that is a noisy environment
filled with conflicting messages, multiple forms of media and changing user practices that the information,
communication and management literature all describe as moving from a passive to an interactive
exercise (Barzilai-Nahon, 2008). Examination of the discourse of public value surrounding public library
funding using social network sites can reveal what the networked community considers desirable
governance and how public/political agents operate with that kind of community relationship.
Discourse analysis can focus on the iterative process of a discursive event – one based on the
use of language, talk and text (e.g. van Dijk, 1997) - and the changes that result throughout to examine
the reaction of communities to policies that may or may not be consistent with community values in
helping people deal with broad, immediate social problems (White, 1994). Discourse analysis research
relevant to information sharing for advocacy in public sector participatory collective networks has included
Apthorpe’s (1996) work on discourse analysis of policy making and Bardici’s (2012) examination of the

36

media representation of the Egyptian popular social media use, compared with Papacharissizi and de
Fatima Oliveira’s (2012) examination of the same events’ news values, dramatic tools and crowdsourcing
outcomes through a textual analysis of Twitter messages. Discourse analysis can expose terms indicating
hegemony, social capital, public value and citizen participation in analyzing information sharing for
advocacy in public sector networks.
Shirazi (2013) examines social media used during Middle-Eastern political uprisings, based on
the notion that the “conversation is the site where the process of sense-making occurs and where agency
and text, symbols, speech and other communicative objects are generated to better understand
discourse” (p. 30). Discourse is not just the language or speech used but is a transformational process
and meaning is the thing or place that is created. Social cognition used here is defined as “a socially
shared system of social representations, which includes a set of strategies for their effective manipulation
in social interpretation, interaction and discourse” (Van Dijk, 2009 p. 166).
Using discourse analysis enables one to provide context to the variety of messages and the
content of the information shared (Stevenson 2009), providing richer details about the information
ecology, which, in a basic sense, studies the relationship of organisms to their environment (Ramos,
2000). Fairclough’s work in textually oriented discourse analysis has been used to analyze information
control related to struggles for power and for understand the framing of public policy problems,
demonstrating that discourse analysis is a tested analytic method for understanding the complex
environmental factors involved in the Miami-Dade library funding conflict (1992). Thus, it was important to
analyze the text of discourse both within documents but also ex parte and from diverse channels and in
multiple media.

Discourse Analysis in Library and Information Studies
Budd and Raber connect the applicability of discourse analysis for information research and the
importance of communication, both written and spoken, to the discipline of library and information science
(LIS) because of an inherent, sensitive relationship of information to LIS, especially in “matters of
articulations of purpose and practice of information study” (1995, p. 217). The utility of discourse analysis
is that it examines the form and function of language “above the sentence” (p. 217) and therefore accepts
the variability and interpretative nature of language, providing tools to extract both the implicit and explicit
meanings. Further, discourse analysis provides a way to understand the duality that is the text and the
context, through the form and function of the language used.
Solomon looked at information seeking conversations in school library and public library settings
to understand the nature of conversation domains (formal/informal) and how these can be used in
practical applications to better prepare information professionals (1997). Johnson interviewed 15 library
staff from three branches to determine the kinds of social interactions held in libraries that contribute to
the creation of social capital (Johnson, 2012). Talja employed discourse analysis to analyze interview
data to study users’ library conceptions as they form ‘interpretive repertoires’ or systematized ways of

37

producing knowledge and meanings, thereby constructing or revising social reality (1999). Both Talja and
Johnson stressed that participants’ discourse exhibited inconsistency at the individual level and that
construction of consistent perceptions happens at the group or community level of analysis as
perceptions are linked to viewpoints (Talja, 1999)
Frohmann (1994) emphasized that discourse analysis is a valuable tool for LIS research in
understanding the construction of information, the user and the uses of information in theory building and
study but Talja presses that it is also an important tool to understand the interpretive repertoires, the
practices employed to construct meaning, as a means to influence social and institutional functions
(1999). Discourse in online networked movements like a library funding advocacy campaign presents an
opportunity to understand the movements’ profile and the position of the participants in relation to their
surroundings and the issues (Castells, 2012; Serrano Casado, 2011). Serrano’s table of terms that
describe the orientation of participants in the Spanish Indignados movement provides a view of discourse
emerging from the movement’s network (Serrano Casado, 2011). Because much of the data collected
are text-based drawn from online social network sites, a closer look at the use of discourse analysis for
computer-mediated texts follows.

Computer Mediated Discourse Analysis
Computer mediated discourse analysis is defined as “predominantly text-based human interaction
mediated by networked computers or mobile telephony “(Herring, 2007, p. 1860) with the aim of
understanding both the technical and social aspects of talk in text interaction. Use of CMDA framework to
analyze the values statements from the Facebook page, SMDPL, embraced the 1) impact of online/offline
relationships; and, 2) provided a strong semantic approach that illuminates values expressed, with a
means to understand the discourse’s demonstration and assertion approaches. CMDA also allows for a
flexibly taxonomy of classifications of values, acknowledging that values may not be exclusive to a
category, nor may categories always be hierarchical (Herring, 2007).
In a study similar to that proposed in this research focusing on public sector perceptions of public
libraries, Gazo conducted a discourse analysis of municipal cultural policies concurrently with interview
transcripts of city councilors in Quebec. Findings suggested a lack of consistency among the city
councilors but study authors were able to compose a model of the discourse of the participants revealing
a view of libraries lacking an appreciation for the influences of the networked information society (2011).
Carlo and Yoo conducted a study of both face to face and computer-mediated reference transactions in
an academic library focusing on participants’ use of politeness strategies in chat reference concluding
that CMC is a transformative platform offering dynamic interaction between sense making, language use
and forms of life (2007).
Chat reference is a frequent focus of discourse analysis using Sacks and Schegloff’s
conversation analysis (Koshik & Okazawa 2012); Park, Guisu and Burger’s analysis of interactive
elements such as openings and closings (2010); and Westbrook’s use of discourse analysis to identify

38

syntactic content in a public, academic university chat reference system (2007). Other studies of library
settings with discourse analysis include evaluation of library web sites (Shropshire, 2003), examining
citizen access to community networking initiatives in the library literature to discover how other academic
libraries operate their websites.
More broadly, Stevenson examined the hegemonic use of information in Community Information
Centres (CIC) from 1969-1002 using textually oriented discourse analysis to distill identities, relations and
knowledge and belief creation (2001). Stevenson’s use of Fairclough’s three-dimensional analytic
framework allowed individual texts to contribute to an ongoing discourse of the struggle of the state to
implement successful policy in the form of the CICs. Discourse analysis of public documents and semistructured interviews revealed user perceptions of learning through the Internet in a Singapore public
library system, suggesting a generalizable method for librarians to use to understand the views of users
toward Internet access (Heok, & Luyt, 2010).

Domain Analysis
In this study I used discourse analysis to examine and develop values into a meaningful and
explicit coding scheme but also examines the social media phenomenon of ‘threading’, which Herring
describes as an “interactional phenomena” which can be identified on structural grounds but in this study,
may provide a glimpse into the meaning statements which provoked public official engagement.
Assuming that discourse implies speaker choices that “reflect cognitive (Chage, 1994) and social (Sacks,
1984) factors” (Herring, 2004, p. 4), the interaction is analyzed using the framing of public values
identified by the semantic codebook. Content analysis of value expressions using a semantic content
coding approach (Herring, 2004) is based on the universal, public sector and library values as informed
by the literature on public value for the semantic domain; and, policy making processes that include
problem definition and agenda-setting based on policy analysis literature (Majchrzak, 2013); Mintrom,
2012; Weissert & Weissert, 2008).
Van Dijk conducts a detailed discussion of the nature of political discourse analysis, which could
also be used to examine this case study and identifies political discourse as “essentially defined
contextually, viz., in terms of special events or practices of which the aims, goals or functions are maybe
not exclusively but at least primarily political” (1998, p. 15). While the Miami-Dade advocacy campaign did
indeed target political decision makers, both officials and citizens as political actors, the position of this
research is not to examine the discourse for its political efficacy alone: the theory of CPV does provide a
mechanism with which to identify political aspects of policymaking. But the use of social network sites
provides a channel for information sharing that can be viewed for its public consensus building capacity
and for its use of digital technology to share, create, and collaborate on information that can be examined
for its power in citizen enablement but also for its influence on problem definition of public problems. This
latter activity has traditionally been the domain of the elected official but in the age of increasing use of

39

digital technologies to deliver government services, public officials have often struggled to effectively
manipulate online social network sites to arrive at a consensus and solution to which they can commit.

Summary
“Unless public sector leaders have powerful mandates that are backed by insistent and
enthusiastic support, they will be unable to mobilize the resources, the cooperative efforts they need from
others, or their own staffs, to accomplish their goals” (Moore, 2000, p. 199). Government policy actions
aimed at information diffusion and social marketing have traditionally addressed market failures related to
information asymmetries including consumer protection, improved citizen decision-making resources,
public safety advisories and advice on economic or health concerns. This use was previously just
another form of one-way communication that had the convenience of immediacy, remote access, broad
reach and currency. However, with the adoption of social media platforms that provide a more accessible
feedback mechanism for the citizen, the power of information diffusion and social marketing is that they
“reinforce the goals of other policy instruments” (Mintrom, 2012, p. 39) and become not just objects of
policy but instruments of policy as well.
Public policy has relied upon the information sharing process to disseminate details about policies
and to perfunctorily gather feedback from citizens that may or may not justify or influence the future
process of policy making or the public relations used to distribute information about the policy
implementation. But public policy also relies on the diffusion of information to express the values of policy
making. Social media’s role has offered the public sector, public officials and administrators, along with
the stakeholders in various publics, the opportunity to interact with the information, creating a spectrum of
involvement with “Both e-government and e-democracy [which] have become important instruments of
modern governance” (Lee, Chang & Berry, 2011, p.444). The result is an increase in citizen involvement
and participation (Backus, 2001). In this study I examined use of social media in moving citizens from
uninvolved reception of e-government services to a more active, participatory role in e-democracy by the
conversation afforded by online participatory networks.
This section briefly described the literature that supports increased research on the efforts of
library funding advocacy, its relationship to networked community governance through the framework of
the public management theory, CPV, and the potential for discourse analysis of social network sites to
discover what a community values about public libraries. The following chapter will describe the
discourse analysis of the Facebook page, Save the Miami Dade Public Libraries; the web-based survey
of library advocacy participants; and, interviews of key library advocates and public/political agents who
participated both in the discourse and policymaking process in Miami-Dade County, Florida.

CHAPTER THREE
METHODOLOGY AND RESEARCH DESIGN
This chapter presents the study design and rationale for a concurrent, exploratory examination of
the discourse surrounding the 2013 Miami-Dade County budget discussion that included proposed major
decreases in library funding, potentially closing up to 44% of the county system’s 49 libraries, the users
who were identified as participants in the discourse, and the messages they created. . Included in this
section are the research questions in detail, a brief discussion of mixed methods, a description of and
rationale for use of a discourse analysis approach, a summary of the study limitations and both practical
and ethical considerations.

using the SMDPL Facebook page?
RQ 1.2-Which participant roles are observed among those sharing information?
RQ 1.3 -What is the relationship between the values shared and the various participants?
RQ2: How do social network sites used for library funding advocacy contribute, if at all, to the
policymaking process?
RQ 2.1 -In what ways are agenda-setting and problem definition expressed?
RQ 2.2 -What solutions to the library-funding conflict, if any, were proposed?

Philosophical and Methodological Foundations
Design Rationale
This section presents the concurrent, exploratory, mixed methods study design in which data
were collected and analyzed to inform and guide the succeeding phases of the data collection. Initial
phase one data will be analyzed using a discourse analysis framework deployed by NVivo10 analysis
software. Units of analysis will include Facebook posting activity from the group page, Save the MiamiDade Public Libraries (SMDPL); and a web-based survey of participants of the discourse, whether as
active participants of the Facebook page or as mentioned in Facebook posts. Participants will include
librarians, library administrators, professional library advocates, citizen participants political/public agents
and broadcast journalists able to be contacted through the SMDPL Facebook page, the Florida librarian
list-servs, FLA-lib and FL-lib, and the public email contact lists of Miami-Dade County public officials. This
design complements the dual purpose of exploring the CPV (CPV) theory (Moore, 1995; Benington &

41

Moore, 2011) that guides this study, using an analysis of data that seeks to 1) describe and explain online
aspects related to the public policymaking phenomena introduced onto or created on the SMDPL
Facebook page; and 2) understand any correlation to real-world outcomes provided by various
stakeholders involved in public sector policymaking in general, and library funding advocacy in particular
(Zimmerman, 2014).
Theory is typically employed for its explanatory power with complex phenomena that merits rich
description and reliability of methods (Creswell & Plano-Clark, 2011). This study employs CPV (Moore,
1995; Benington & Moore, 2011) and an analytical framework based on Herring’s computer-mediated
discourse analysis (2004) to more adequately examine the phenomenon of social network sites used as
library funding advocacy platforms and explore the discourse constructed by the social network
interaction. The 2013 Miami-Dade library funding phenomenon established a discourse in which the
values of public libraries were publicly discussed, examined and used to define the issues surrounding a
proposed reduction of a long-term institution, the termination of many of its employees, and the virtual
elimination in many low-income communities, of their only access to social services via library facilitated
Internet service. Social network sites democratized a discourse that has previously been held within
more controlled confines of municipal meetings or within public official chambers. However, policymaking
is only effective if it is implemented, and implementation is a key phase of the creation of public value, as
applied with the “conception and use of political power” (King, et al., 2010, p. 957).

Creating Public Value
The theory of CPV (CPV) is based on the principles of networked community governance, in
which the policymaking process of deliberation, decision-making and implementation are “associated with
a shift in the centre of gravity of governance from state and market towards civil society” (Benington,
2011, p. 34). Networked community governance responds to public-value failure, using participative and
interactive information communication technologies to address when societal “values articulation and
aggregation have broken down” (Bozeman, 2002, p. 145) resulting in unsound monopolies, inequitably
distributed societal benefits, few providers of public goods and bringing to rise questions over which
sector is best suited to provide goods and services in the public interest. In networked community
governance, those who are governed are more actively involved in the problem definition, agenda-setting,
solution creation and evaluation, and in development of resources (through crowdsourcing online and
third-sector initiatives such as non-profit, voluntary, independent, charitable, community, philanthropic and
non-governmental organizations (Billis, 2010; Najam, 2000). This marks a departure from previous
hierarchical forms of governance such as traditional public management (TPM), which approached public
needs in a fairly straightforward manner with clearly drawn lines of responsibility; or new public
management (NPM), which relies on market forces to meet the needs and wants of the public (Benington
& Moore, 2011).

42

It could be argued that non-hierarchical, community governance structures that produce decisionmaking, problem definition, policy-making and implementation have not evolved either infrastructure or
policies that exploit and benefit from the widespread use of online information sharing and content
production. Public officials and administrators often perceive the rapid digital information network to be
disruptive for government authority and accountability (Benington, 2011; Mergel, 2013). Day also reports
that many local online/digital network initiatives that are headed by local public authorities or
public/private partnerships, often miss the potential of information and communication technologies to
support extensive outreach, thus compromising community development (2002). Often, local online/digital
network outreach projects are viewed as “social initiatives” (Day, 2002, p. 91), a nomenclature that can
make them politically divisive rather than socially inclusive.
Participatory community networks’ users share information in multiple formats and in both digital
and non-digital dimensions. For the purposes of this analysis, data will be drawn from online social
network sites that include social media, which is “new digital media phenomena such as blogs, social
network sites, location-based services, micro blogs, photo- and video – sharing sites, etc., in which
ordinary users (i.e. not only media professionals) can communicate with each other and create and share
content with others online through their personal networked computers and digital mobile devices”
(Bechmann & Lomborg, 2013, p. 767). Analyzing the social network site Facebook’s discourse
surrounding the 2013 Miami-Dade library funding conflict offers an opportunity to identify the universal,
public sector and library values shared through the Save the Miami Dade Public Libraries Facebook
network and then compare them to the perceptions of traditional forms of state policymaking, such as
public managers as stewards of the public good or legislative governance by democratic rule, which
continue to make up the approach of state and local governmental bodies (Yang, in press).
As articulated by Benington and Moore (2011), CPV describes the fundamental elements
underlying networked community governance as a strategic triangle that includes:
1. A set of public value outcomes or strategic goals which are targeted and are contextual;
2. An authorizing environment which relies on the cooperation of diverse stakeholders to achieve
the targeted public value outcomes; and
3. Operational capacity comprised of the public and private and third sector resources necessary to
achieve the public value outcomes.
Acknowledging that public values are a vague and mutable concept, contextually bound and
dynamic, Benington and Moore offer five categories for public sector values: economic, social, cultural,
political and ecological value. Yang extends the theory to identify the processes of governance
(deliberation, legitimation and implementation), and the CPV components of the strategic triangle
(renamed as Outcomes and Indicators, Authorization and Accountability, and Processes, Resources and
Performance Measures). Public value is achieved when individuals’ and institutions’ actions are directed
by a set of universal values such as ethical leadership or democratic/constitutional ideology (Yang, in
press).

43

As previously illustrated in figure 1-B illustrates Yang’s translation of CPV into a model that
articulates the processes (deliberation, legitimation and implementation) and Benington and Moore’s
strategic triangle fundamental elements, public value outcomes (Outcomes and Indicators), authorizing
environment (Authorization and Accountability), and operational capacity (Processes, Resources and
Performance Measures). Guiding all this community networked governance are universal values, which
can be defined deontologically as actions guided by a rule or set of rules (Alexander & Moore, 2012).

Multi-Method Rationale
Public sector advocacy, the process of educating and influencing decision makers and the public to
support causes of all types, is seen as public deliberation and information sharing in a public setting or
sphere, but is also a public sector institutional and accountability element used for public libraries, public
safety, health and wellness care and policies and education, among others. There is an interrelationship
between public and private spheres online and offline that influence information control, self-perceived
identities of participants and the messages created. “Networked publics are publics that are restructured
by networked technologies” (boyd, 2010, p. 39) that provides a new online space where “an imagined
collective” (p. 39) results from the convergence of people, technology and practice and offers innovative
capacities for participation. The examination of the discourse surrounding the Miami-Dade Public Library
funding conflict using discourse analysis seeks to explain the interrelationship of online and offline
occurrences in more detail.
This mixed methods approach implements the following elements: 1) use discourse analysis to
examine the process of information sharing across both the social and mainstream media, including the
implications that may be inherent in each; and 2) use an online survey, identify and examine roles and
perspectives of participants.
This study defines mixed methods research as “research in which the investigator collects and
analyzes data, integrates the findings, and draws inferences using both qualitative and quantitative
approaches or methods in a single study or a program of inquiry” (Tashakkori & Creswell, 2007, p. 4) with
the focus on the concept of ‘integration,’ or the point at which quantitative and qualitative data and
processes interface with each other (Guest, 2012). This use of ‘point of interface’ (Guest, 2012) supports
a study of social network sites, as the methods available can examine the roles assumed by participants
in both online and offline networks, and allow for description of one role with messages selected from two
different communication channels, one online and one offline. These data can be mixed to create a
composite profile of a participant, as individuals in this particular case participated in multiple forms of
advocacy and were observed approaching these forms with different expectations of power, influence and
ability to share information.
Guest’s granular approach to the process, proposes the concept of integration of data sets, not
just the methods, that focuses on the “’point of interface’ between two data sets” (2012, p. 146), moving
away from the linguistic emphasis on a mixed methods study to a more general mixed methods research.

44

This allows the mix to occur at the point of data collection, the analysis or the interpretation or any
combination thereof. Guest’s example cites a study with four uses of the same data: 1) “to corroborate
and expand on previously collected data; 2) to inform the content of the subsequent survey; 3) to help
explain the survey’s findings; and, 4) as stand-alone exploratory qualitative data” (2012, p. 143).
The question of methodological choice begins with the need to explain an observed or suspected
phenomenon (Newman, Ridenour, Newman, & De Marco, 2003; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010). With
further investigation and a consistent (but not necessarily linear) process, a researcher will choose one or
more ways to collect, examine and interpret data points that help to describe, explain or predict the
scrutinized phenomenon. Mixed methods research use of “epistemological and methodological pluralism”
(Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004 p. 15) promotes more effective research, required by a “research world
that is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, complex, and dynamic” (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004, p.
15). Mixed methods research acknowledges the paradigmatic distinctions without discarding the flexibility
required of utility. For a study of information sharing for library funding advocacy, this means that the
perspectives and values of library and information science and public administration can both bear equal
weight in a study, giving equal value to both the provocative information sharing process that can occur in
social network sites and to the potential public governance value of partnership-based and crowd-sourced
outcomes.
In a study of information sharing for library funding advocacy, the benefit of mixed methods is that
expressions can be analyzed quantitatively using co-word analysis to derive power and relationship
values by mapping the strength of associations between keywords (He, 1999; Krippendorf, 2012;
Neuendorf, 2002); and, messages can also be examined qualitatively using discourse analysis of the
information shared and its contribution to the advocacy, illustrating the sentiment of messages and
demonstrating a discourse’s potential in denigrating, creating or illustrating public value.

Discourse Analysis Approach
Discourse can be conceived “both as a specific form of language use, and as a specific form of
social interaction, interpreted as a complete communicative event in a social situation and discourse
analysis focuses on phenomena beyond the sentence” (Van Dijk, 1990, p. 164). The purpose of
discourse is to impart meaning using interactive processes (Fairclough, 2003); in so doing, discourse, or,
meaning making, includes the process of text creation, the text itself, and the succeeding interaction with
the text. This study purposefully includes not just utterances or text but also “observable verbal or nonverbal features, or social interaction and speech acts…the cognitive representations and strategies
involved during the production or comprehension of discourse” (Van Dijk, 1990, p. 164) as a means of
establishing context. Although initially only occupied with ‘written discourse’, later extension of the
discourse analysis concept to integrate context with discourse studies acknowledges the environment or
situation and embraces the diverse ways that discourses are “produced and understood as a function of
the properties of the communicative situation – as they are understood and represented by the

45

participants themselves” (Van Dijk, 2009, p. 248) Discourse analysis is thus considered a suitable and
effective approach in understanding the information sharing in the social network of the SMDPL
Facebook group.
At its most basic, discourse analysis provides descriptive views of ideology in the forms of
attitudes, beliefs and perspectives of stakeholder groups; this study purposely avoids the critical
discourse positioning of ideology that establishes a power aspect (Fairclough, 2003) in order to pursue a
more balanced, interdisciplinary understanding of public value discourse in which established institutions
face fundamental challenges of survival through funding reductions or elimination that are the result of
political or public agent responses to reduced public revenues. CPV acknowledges that what the public
values is often in conflict with what public agents manage to establish in the public sphere and often is
questioned by a public increasingly interested in transparency, participation and collaboration in
governance (Mergel, 2013). Further, the focus of discourse analysis on broader concepts is to be viewed
in the context of conversational structures within the Facebook page: emphasis or consensus may simply
be a by-product of the utterance structure of this particular social media platform (Wooffitt, 2005). By
using CPV to examine the values expressed and the process used, this study recognizes this tension but
seeks to understand the values and the process independent of the power relationships that can be
difficult to grasp. It is preferred to allow any power-related values that may emerge to be examined using
the values framework as an assumption that the policymaking process and outcomes are complicated by
more factors than simply a power differential.
This study employed discourse analysis to examine and develop the public values into a
meaningful and explicit coding scheme. The social media phenomenon of ‘threading’, (or those posts with
comments organized by reply patterns, time, theme and group) that connect the messages by topic,
which Herring describes as an “interactional phenomena” which can be identified on structural grounds
but in this study, provided a means to establish the sample using Facebook paradata (likes, comments) to
make the selection.
This study used a semantic content coding approach (Herring, 2004) based on the universal,
public sector and library values as informed by the literature on public value (Benington & Moore, 2011);
and the policy making processes of problem definition, agenda-setting and solution creation for the
semantic domain. This approach focused the research on the semantic aspect of information sharing
during a library funding advocacy campaign, thus providing a preliminary exploration of the relatively new
theory that is CPV (Herring, 2004).
From this public value perspective, it can be argued that discourse surrounding library funding is
naturally mutable, based upon changing communities, needs and missions, as understood by the public
agents charged with their implementation. Examining the values that were shared online during this
campaign, understanding the discourse expressions of policymaking and the relationship of the values
and policymaking concepts to the participants constitutes the full scope of this investigation. By employing
a “classical content analysis” (Herring, 2004, p. 25), this research focused on the patterns of language

46

used to present some of the often passionate rationale in the discourse, and distinguished the values that
most mattered to this particular community of users. The policymaking expressions represent elements
of public policymaking viewed from an information sharing perspective, thus providing this study with an
opportunity to contribute to the interdisciplinary literature on the nature of information used for diverse
purposes and on multiple platforms.

Research Design
Study Design and Procedures
This study looked at the creation of public value by operationalizing and examining the discourse
conducted for library funding advocacy for the universal values, public sector values and library-specific
values; and the expressions of policymaking that include problem definition, agenda-setting and solution
creation expressed by a diverse group of stakeholders including library staff, library advocates, library
users, Miami-Dade public officials and others. The empirical focus of this study was on the information
shared by a diverse group of stakeholders on the Facebook page, Save the Miami-Dade Public Libraries,
from July 17, 2013, through September 17, 2013, which represents the period of time that the discourse
surrounded the pending library budget shortfall and the Miami-Dade elected county officials’ public
deliberation of several proposed courses of action. Research questions will be addressed by execution of
the following methods and analyses as displayed in Table 2.
Data Selection
The selection of the threads of discourse phenomena studied within the SMDPL Facebook page
were based upon offline activities such as the schedule of public hearings and county commission votes
around which much of the discourse focused. Online data are also bounded by engagement of public
officials with Facebook participants such as the page administrators and several high frequency posters
and include those posts that are followed by replies that are directed to specific comments and grouped
together based on relevance to viewers (Lavrusik, 2013). External events tend to stimulate an increase in
online activities for SNS sites (Weickster, 2006) and studies suggest that metrics used to assess the
success of social media efforts are more effective if tied to external, mission critical events, activities and
goal achievement (Cahill, 2011; Marek, 2011;Paine, 2012;Weickster, 2006). This “offline to online trend”
(Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe, 2007, p. 1144), is considered a platform specific feature of Facebook.
Data collected for this study included posts (text, external web links or references to external
documents) on the Facebook group page Save the Miami Dade Public Libraries (SMDPL), and a webbased survey distributed to available outlets for public librarians and public officials in Florida that
included public library list-servs, the SMDPL page and the publicly available email addresses and phone
numbers of Miami Dade county public officials.

Two Phase Study Design
An analysis of the funding conflict deliberated in the context of the Facebook page intended to yield
the content of the postings; the critical incidents to which they were related; the policymaking process
elements including problem definition, agenda-setting, solution creation and consensus building; and the
influence of those values expressions on the actions of public officials. It is not clear that the latter
outcome was achieved. Using a concurrent, exploratory mixed methods approach in which findings were
integrated during the study analysis (Creswell & Plano-Clark, 2011), data collection included:
•

A discourse analysis of the Facebook page activity and related events promoted on it to
understand the content of the messages, specifically in terms of expressions of what people
value universally, in public sector contexts and about public libraries; how individuals perceived
the use of social network sites for policymaking especially the problem definition, agenda-setting
and solution creation; and how participants view any agreements in context of the information
shared during the library funding advocacy campaign;

•

A survey of participants of the library-funding advocacy, to understand their roles in the discourse
and their perspectives about the values shared and the process of library funding advocacy

48

conducted using social network sites; and to see who they are (demographically) and determine
their library advocacy and use habits. (e.g., age, income, education, library use habits, social
media use habits, voting habits). The FSU Human Subjects approved protocols including master
participant recruitment, participant consent form and the survey instrument can be viewed in
Appendix B (recruitment), Appendix C, (informed consent) and Appendix D (survey
questionnaire).
•

This phase in the study resulted in a description of Miami-Dade library funding advocacy
participants, a ranking of the participation roles; a list of the universal, public and library values
participants; a view of the interactive public policy making process based on the problem
definition, agenda-setting, and solutions policymaking attributes; and a perspective of influence of
the discourse from the view of a diverse group of stakeholders. Figure XX illustrates the two
phase study and the deliverables that resulted from the data analysis.

•

In this study, I used mixed methods to collect qualitative data from the Facebook entries
and quantitative data from the survey, to show similar findings from different viewpoints. At the
time of the survey, many of the participants, who were admittedly participants in the Facebook
discourse, shared views on the discourse with the benefit of reflection.

•

The intent of the study design was to validate the values as coded in the Facebook
discourse but because the coding process was extended, the survey was conducted
concurrently. However, the benefit was that the survey was then used to understand participants’
view on the roles of government agencies’ public officials and the libraries they also govern. This
approach supported the answer of Moore’s question about who the community’s arbiters of
values should be and resulted in a convergent, parallel design, conducting both the quantitative
and qualitative processes simultaneously and balances the data collection between the two
methods (Creswell & Plano-Clark, 2011).

Phase 1 data collection: Facebook data.
The selection of the threads of discourse phenomena studied within the SMDPL Facebook page
was contingent upon offline activities such as the schedule of public hearings and county commission
votes around which much of the discourse focused. Online data are also bounded by engagement of
public officials with higher profile Facebook participants such as the page administrators and several high
frequency posters and include those posts that are followed by replies that are directed to specific
comments and grouped together based on relevance to viewers (Lavrusik, 2013).

Figure 5. Exploratory concurrent research design
External events tend to stimulate an increase in online activities for SNS sites (Weickster, 2006)
and studies suggest that metrics used to assess the success of social media efforts are more effective if
tied to external, mission critical events, activities and goal achievement (Cahill, 2011; Marek, 2011;Paine,
2012;Weickster, 2006). This “offline to online trend” (Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe, 2007, p. 1144), is
considered a platform specific feature of Facebook. This feature guided the selection of the Facebook
data for this analysis that resulted in a combination of Facebook entries from the Save the Miami Dade
Public Libraries group page that was created on July 17, 2013.
The sampling frame of the Facebook discourse was identified as all discourse originating from
Facebook entries beginning July 17, 2013 with the creation of the group page through the Miami Dade
County Commission budget hearing and vote held September 10, 2013. This included posts, references
to external (to the Facebook phenomena) documents, external links, and any images that originated on
the page. This resulted in a population that includes a total of 3924 entries (posts, comments, replies) that
break down into 1236 posts, 2688 comments created by 723 unique users.
Schutt (2011) describes the use of systematic sampling, observation and measurement as the
means social science uses to compensate and overcome the errors of casual reasoning. To expediently
examine the phenomena and provide a representative sample, the data were first determined to require a
confidence interval of 95% with a standard error of .05. Based on the population of 3924 entries, this
required a sample size of 350 entries. To accommodate the study objective to explore the discourse of
the social media campaign, the unit of analysis is a discussion.

50

Based on the definition of discussion, which is a thread with a post and related replies, called
comments that correspond to the topic of the initial entry. The discussion is also formatted by the
Facebook platform in a style that identifies the thread cohesion with time stamps and indented formatting;
many comments also refer directly to the original post or post creator. The sampling frame of Facebook
entries comprised 605 discussions.
From the sampling frame, a sample was generated from the Facebook page, Save the Miami
Dade Public Libraries and any of the external documents or web links posted to the Facebook page. The
sample was designed to examine the discourse within the two-month period in which there was public
discussion and debate surrounding the proposed cuts to library operations and services that included
official government correspondence, informal public official comments, citizen participation, mainstream
and social network news coverage, among others. Selections were purposive in nature and based upon
the various paradata provided by the Facebook platform: 1) Number of comments; 2) Number of Likes;
and the 3) Number of discussions per day; 4) Days with any public official comments, latent or active; 5)
Discussions with official public documents; and, 6) Discussions with mainstream media coverage. These
criteria resulted in selections that exemplify the offline to online trend and quite possibly demonstrate the
creation of discourse that is unique and emerging in citizen participation using social network sites. Figure
XX illustrates the process used to select the discourse sample, which includes Facebook page entries,
external documents and other external web links.

The sample was based on the timeline of activities, events and discussions shown in Table 4.
This table demonstrates the key external events that comprise the topic of the posts in the sample and
they are important in establishing the interaction between policymaking actions of the public agents and
the legally mandated policymaking process with the responses of actors in the public sphere as described
in the Facebook posts. This timeline lists 44 unique events or actions that occurred over the two month
period, listing both the original media source and the type of artifact or activity it was. All of the items
eventually became Facebook posts on the group page as this was the minimal requirement for including
them in the study.

Phase 1 analysis.
Qualitative discourse analysis of Facebook activity using Nvivo10 qualitative research software
can support analysis of the 319 posts to the Facebook page during this two-month period. This analysis
also included the 16 external documents or external webpages that were posted or referred to during this
time and select incidents that are mentioned in Facebook posts. Facebook posts and Twitter messages
(tweets) were framed based upon the Semantic domain (Herring, 2004) of CPV values:
Universal values categories include ethical, democratic, professional and people (Kernaghan,
2003; Yang, in press). Universal values are defined as “enduring beliefs that influence the choices we
make among available means or ends” (Rokeach, 1973, p. 5). Kernaghan makes the distinction that
ethics and values are not synonymous; ethics are a subset of values and values can be ethical, unethical
or non-ethical (2003). Universal values include ethical (integrity, fairness); democratic (neutrality,
responsiveness, openness); professional (effectiveness, efficiency); and people (caring, tolerance,
humanity).
Public sector values categories include economic, social, cultural, political, environmental
(Benington, 2011). Public sector values add value to the public realm through the generation of economic,
social, cultural, political, and environmental activity that results in products and services tailor-made to
meet unmet human needs. (Benington, 2011) Public sector values include: economic (economic activity,
enterprise and employment); social (social capital, cohesion or relationships); cultural (cultural identity
and meaning); political (supporting democratic dialogue and active public participation); and
environmental, (promoting sustainable development, reducing public problems).
Library values categories add value to the public realm through the generation of economic,
social, cultural, political and environmental library-based activities that result in programs and services
designed to meet a particular community’s unmet needs (Adapted from Benington, 2011) Library values
include: access, confidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education/lifelong learning, intellectual,
freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility (Hernon & Altman,
2010).
Finally, the policymaking process values of problem definition, agenda-setting and solution
creation and consensus building (Weissert & Weissert, 2012) are examined within the messages. These
include:
Agenda-setting can be considered the “collection of issues which are given attention at any given
time” (McCarthy, Smith, & Zald, 1996, p. 293).
Problem Definition is the process of identifying a condition that defines “parameters for discussion
and lends legitimacy to an issue” (Weissert & Weissert, p. 296) that begs a solution. In the public sector,
this solution must be something that the government is capable of providing.
Solution Creation includes the ideas that possess technical feasibility and values acceptability
according to policymakers (Kingdon, as cited by Zahariadis, p. 76).

55

Consensus Building is a process defined as a “deeply embedded in the ongoing stream of
political and social action, collective learning, and change” (Innes & Booher, 1999, p. 416). Consensus
building represents the actions of the community as attempts are made to set mutually agreed-upon
objectives, coordinate activities, and make gains for all stakeholders. Explicit attributes for each of the
values and policymaking process are included in the codebook located in Appendix B.
The intangible and abstract nature of the values requires a simultaneous coding approach that allows
the application of two or more codes to describe qualitative data (Saldana, 2009); a value may have a
universal nature but distinctly different implementation when in context of the public library. Thus,
statements may be double-coded and the public library values will be categorized as dominant themes
emerge for each keyword. Emerging frames will also be drawn from multiple, open coding of the data.
Results in Phase One were intended to inform the web-based survey in Phase Two, as the study
intended to gather perceptions of the Facebook page’s and related activities’ relationship to the
subsequent results of the county budget hearings and vote. However, the survey was conducted
concurrently and the results are integrated into the findings at the appropriate topic and will be examined
more closely in the discussion chapter.

Phase 2 data collection: Quantitative survey of Facebook users of SMDPL.
The intent of using a survey with a purposive sample was to explore responses of participants in
the discourse to the values discovered as a result of the examination of the Facebook data using the
codebook developed from the theory, CPV. However, given the extensive data cleansing and coding time
required, the timeframe for collecting the survey was moved up to a more simultaneous activity alongside
the Facebook examination. Therefore, rather than validate the data about the values found in the
Facebook discourse, the survey was used to provide 1) perceptions of participants about the use of the
Facebook platform for library advocacy; and, 2) provides perceptions who participants thought
accountable for implementation of values and of the use of the policymaking process.
Therefore, the survey was distributed from May through July 2015 by email and Facebook. Based
upon the poor response rates from those identifying as public officials and mainstream media, multiple
attempts were made including personalized emails and phone calls. The latter proved helpful but the
response of public officials was less than hoped for.

Survey e-mail distribution.
Step 1: On May 7-8, emails of the approved survey solicitation and survey link to 18 key library
leaders including multi-type consortia leaders, library system director, librarian leaders, a local lobbyist
and national public library advocacy leader and a Florida Association of Counties official;

56

Emails to members of the Florida Division of Library and Information Services (DLIS) (email
distribution list called fl-lib, n=900+) and the professional state advocacy group, the Florida Library
Association (FLA) (email distribution list called Fla-lib, n=1500+); and
Emails (n= 80) and Twitter messages (n=14) to the Miami Dade County mayor, commissioners of
Miami Dade County, and all of the municipal mayors of Miami Dade County municipalities. Emails (n=2)
and Twitter messages (n=2) were sent to two mainstream media members who were known participants
on the Facebook page.
The emails were repeated three weeks later to the two librarian list-servs.
Step 2: The administrators of the SMDPL Facebook page posted the text of the survey solicitation
on the SMDPL group Facebook page. As of that date, there were 6442 fans (participants who had ‘liked’
the page). The link was also shared by five other library researchers and academics. This first attempt
resulted in 78 responses with only a 60% completion rate.
Step 3: A second email was sent on May 27 with a new survey link with a revised survey in which
the selections were broken up onto more pages to improve the speed with which a participant could
complete the survey. This second email was sent only to the fl-lib and FLA-lib distribution lists and to
Miami local lobbyist, who distributed the survey to the Miami Dade county and municipalities mayors and
the county commissioners.
The survey responses results include:
•

113 participants began the survey; 55 completed the survey with a drop rate of 52%;

•

90 participants began the re-formatted survey; 51 completed the survey with a drop rate of
44%;

The survey did not have any participants identifying as public officials or mainstream media so on the
advice of the dissertation committee and an FAC official, calls were placed to the county mayor’s office,
each of the county commissioners and all of the county’s municipal mayors resulting in contacts to 50
public offices. Only two of the public officials answered each survey question and the results were
recorded in the online survey; one municipal mayor spoke to me off the record. Other public officials
declined either citing a lack of time or in one case, perceived lack of relevance.

Phase 2 analysis.
The survey data were originally intended to be collected sequentially, with questions structured
on the results of the Facebook content analysis and resulting values. However, the data were collected
concurrently, was cleaned and descriptive statistics obtained that further describe the use of social media
for library advocacy and the policy making processes. Rather than have respondents rank values,
participants were asked to assign the accountability for public library, public sector and universal values
to either a government entity, a library organization, neither or unknown. Frequencies for all of the
categories were calculated with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and are reported, with
the various policymaking responses presented in chapter four in each of the sections of the Facebook

57

discourse analysis with which they correlate. The demographic description of the survey participants is
introduced at the beginning of the chapter four.

Reliability of the study.
The codebook was developed and reviewed with committee advisors and a post-doc researcher
with whom a consensus exercise was conducted (Saldana, 2009). Multiple coding sessions were held
with a colleague with library service background and knowledge of the public library values codified by the
American Library Association and used to create the public library values section of the codebook. A
dean in the FSU College of Public Administration and a dean in the FSU College of Communication and
Information with extensive background in policy research reviewed the policymaking process and survey
construction.
Descriptive values coding was employed in multiple sessions, with the first session designed to
examine and identify the attitudes, beliefs and conceptual values revealed in the Facebook messages
(Saldana, 2009). The CPV framework presents three tiers of a priori values that were modified during
intercoder reliability testing, resulting in the elimination of one process code – consensus building - as
consensus would require the coding to trace the interaction of a solution proposed in one remark, all the
way through a discussion. Proposed solutions are a subset of consensus and do not require the
acknowledgement and agreement of multiple participants and are a valuable aspect to the policymaking
process. It was determined in the coding discussions that tracing comments for consensus through the
discussions was not feasible and that the identification of proposed solutions in the social media forum
may be all that could be validated so the Solution Creation policymaking characteristic was adopted into
the codebook.
The second session coding added two types of coding methods indicated by the first cycle coding
results, magnitude coding and simultaneous coding. Magnitude codes indicated the sentiment of each
entry, assessed on the basis of four attributes – positive sentiment, negative sentiment, neutral sentiment
or mixed sentiment (Saldana, 2009) – as many comments were found to possess a sarcastic or ironic
tone, often using hyperbole to indicate meaning. Magnitude coding is a way to contribute texture and can
support quantification of discourse but was also helpful in dealing with comments that are ironic, tacitly
indicating one meaning but within context of the full discussion, implying an opposite (usually negative)
meaning. Magnitude coding guided the process and the codes were applied but are not analyzed in this
study.
The hierarchical context of the library/community landscape dictated the use of simultaneous
coding. Saldana (2009) indicates that qualitative datum have the power to illustrate multiple points and
therefore simultaneous coding is valid; further, the values based upon the CPV model are hierarchical in
nature and while not always invoked, codes were found within a particular context that were then used in
a broader or narrower subtext. The following example illustrates a case in which multiple codes were
applied in this portion of a discussion including agenda-setting (PM-AS), problem definition (PM-PD), and

58

economic (PS-E). Each of the roles here, a professional advocate (Facebook poster A) and a resident
citizen (Facebook poster B) are connected to these codes but the discussion as the unit of analysis only
counts each occurrence once.
Facebook poster A: “Facebook poster B, it was a pleasure meeting you on Saturday.
Thank you for everything. One thing to keep in mind is that we can make up portions of
the shortfall without touching the millage rate. One example is that the county charges
the library $5 million per year in "rent" for the main library. I am doing some research to
confirm, but my recollection is that the building was built to be a library through bond
money. There is no reason any rent should be charged, let alone $5 million. That amount
will only get us part of the way, but it is a start.
I didn't get your number on Saturday, but if you send it via PM, I can call you after my
follow up meeting with Mayor Gimenez on Friday to fill you in.
Facebook poster B: “Facebook poster A, I definitely mentioned that point today several
times. <smile emoticon>”
Simultaneous coding also offers the opportunity to examine the coupling of codes and reveal
patterns of pairing between different values codes or between the values codes and the policymaking
process codes.

Inter-coder sessions.
The purpose of the inter-coder sessions held with a colleague were to identify meaningful phrases in
each entry of a sample discussion (Discussion #2), and then to assign values and policymaking process
codes to those. The discussions also included agreement that codes should be assigned to an entry and
then aggregated to the discussion level. Even those external documents examined are assigned to a
discussion thread, as only documents introduced onto the Facebook page as a post or comment were
included in the study. However, using Nvivo 10 analysis software allows for more granular coding, and
thus codes were applied to phrases, not just to the entry, as this also provided a definite reference for
each code.
Two coding sessions occurred over a period of five days. The first resulted in a revision of the
codebook, streamlining the attributes and using consensus as an indicator of reliability, rather than interrater reliability or inter-rater agreement, neither of which are entirely suitable for nominal coding (Tinsley &
Weiss, 1975). Inter-rater agreement is a more amenable method of assessing ratings but results in the
establishment of absolute ratings that are not subject to measures for the occurrence of change

59

agreement/disagreement. Finally, the texts may not present any evidence of a value or policymaking
process and thus would not be coded at all. Therefore, the second session focused on the use of
consensus, discussing the implications of each entry and any variance proposed. While the codebook
was not originally set up to consist of mutually exclusive values, we concluded that the context of remarks
provided an indication of the parent category to use, e.g., the democratic value is identified in both the
universal values category and the public library values category; specific reference to a library context
description of a democratic value (libraries provide early voting) would be coded as a public library value.
A general reference to democratic values would be coded as a universal value.
“A construct and its measurement are validated when the discourse about their relationships is
persuasive to the community of researchers” (Kvale, p. 240) and therefore, agreement among competent
scholars is an acceptable reliability measure in qualitative studies (Creswell, 2013). As Kvale indicates,
the use of consensus as knowledge-building dialectic among scholars has a rich history and is often the
final threshold that is collectively crossed on the way toward truth.
The colleague selected as a partner in coding agreement is an individual with knowledge and
credentials in library literature and scholarship, with practical experience in library operations and in
research methods. The coders agreed that the value of the codebook descriptions in clearly delineating
meaning implied by everyday language stylized by social media was the strongest basis for validity and
the greatest potential source of bias – coherence of values in context were distilled until both coders
could agree on ratings.
For us, inter-coder agreement meant that we agreed that when we assigned a code to a passage, we
both used the same codes for the same passage. Further, rather than compute a reliability statistic, we
used consensual agreement as the codebook is intentionally not mutually exclusive except in context of
the entry within a full discussion. Therefore, we discussed at length the use of irony and whether to code
the implied meaning or the tacit meaning. We agreed that implied meaning was likely the accurate choice.
Specifically, the following four categories form the basis of the codebook and the decisions below guided
our decision-making in coding the sample:
1. Policymaking, a category that contains four parent nodes (Nvivo calls codes ‘nodes’)
a. Consensus Building
b. Proposed Solutions
c.

Problem Definition

d. Agenda-Setting
2. Universal Values that include four parent nodes:
a. Ethical
b. Democratic
c.

Professional

d. People
3. Public Sector Values, that include four parent nodes:

60

a. Economic
b. Social/Cultural
c.

Political

d. People
4. Public Library Values include ten parent nodes:
a. Access
b. Confidentiality/Privacy
c.

Democracy

d. Diversity
e. Education/Lifelong Learning
f.

Intellectual Freedom

g. Innovation
h. The Public Good/Social Responsibility

•

Each of the parent nodes contains anywhere from 2-6 child nodes.

•

For the Policymaking category, the unit of analysis is an entry and is coded using the child nodes,
as the literature establishes a strong tradition of policymaking steps that I am seeking to examine
for similarities in a social media format; the policymaking category will be analyzed for both parent
and child nodes.

•

For each of the values categories, universal, public sector and public library, the unit of analysis is
an entry and will be coded with the parent nodes for all values. Due to time constraints and the
scope of this study, values will not be coded at the child level but these distinctions will help guide
coding and provide greater reliability.
Reports generated out of Nvivo qualitative analysis software will then be able to reveal which

elements of each Policymaking variable are present in each discussion; this can reveal aspects of
Policymaking that differ from those identified in the literature as codified in the traditional public policy
practice.
Specific steps for coding included:
1. Review the document or entry being coded.
2. Identify the participants in each entry as often, multiple participants express statements in each
entry, (e.g., the mainstream news media quotes public officials and advocacy participants, so
these entries are coded by attribution. If no attribution, it was assumed that the entry be ascribed
to the main author.

61

3. Entries were then coded for values and policymaking codes; the policymaking parent and child
nodes were both coded while values were only coded at the parent level.
4. Entries were also coded for sentiment value, either positive, negative or neutral.
While the intercoder agreement process was largely collaborative, examining each measure in
context of the textual entries resulting in a “simple group consensus” (Saldana, 2009, p. 28), the
researcher and colleague did complete a review of a sample discussion that resulted in an intercoder
agreement score of 97.3%.
Bauer and Gaskell (2000) in response to van Dijk’s contention that there can be normative criteria
for qualitative analysis, suggest that the integrity of studies lie in the transparency of and extensive
methodological documentation that allows other researchers to reconstruct the analysis in other contexts.
The codebook created with the three categories of values and the policymaking process attributes
identified provide an instrument that can be applied in other contexts an is considered to demonstrate
criterion validity (Bauer & Gaskell, 2000). While this study does not claim to represent the community of
Miami-Dade County, the sample is representative of the discourse for the library funding advocacy for
which the Facebook page was the nexus.

Limitations and Assumptions
Critique of Mixed Methods Designs
One of the values of mixed methods research is the legitimation of findings established by the
use of multiple methods to assess the trustworthiness of the data collected and its interpretations
(Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004). Legitimation, the mixed methods term for validity, (Creswell & Plano
Clark, 2011, p. 277), is created by the use of steps like triangulation, instrument creation and fidelity,
multiple and diverse research questions, explanation, unexpected results, sampling credibility, context,
illustration, utility, confirmation of findings, diversity of views, expansion of knowledge, and theory
development (Bryman, 2006). With the transient nature of online communication via online social network
sites (Kazmer, 2002), identity is not generally a given and thus the use of an individual’s office or agency
is not available to determine the veracity or credibility of statements made online. With the quickness,
volume and intensity with which messages can be disseminated, misinformation is pervasive. Therefore,
the practical solution is to use other means to empirically ascertain the truth of a message resulting in
corroboration or convergence of results that may illuminate greater meaning than online short message
services (SMS) can provide (Greene, Caracelli & Graham, 1989).

General Research Limitations and Assumptions
The limitations in this study included:

62

•

The CPV codebook was created for this study and has not been applied to a study of library
funding advocacy; the protocol and instruments were pre-tested; consensus agreement and interrater reliability were conducted to provide internal validity;

•

CPV, as a theory, has not been operationalized and thus there is scant literature on its use for
explaining policymaking phenomena (Benington, 2011);

•

The researcher participated initially in the social media campaign and therefore the emic effect of
the researcher involved is to be considered both a limitation to objectivity but also a contribution
to understanding the Miami-Dade system in depth (Herring, 2007);

•

Use of data from online social network sites is not generalizable, as there is not enough research
that has examined its use in depth (Ruths & Pfeffer, 2014) and the data that is examined is done
so in a “node to node” fashion, rather than as field effects (Tufekci, 2014, p. 505);

•

The quickness, volume and intensity of messages disseminated can contribute to misinformation,
especially using digital communication technologies (Herring, 2013) therefore the time lapse
between this study and the actual event may cause a lapse in recall of authentic details;
participants may confuse events between the 2013 library funding process and the more recent
2014 budget discourse, which experienced a similar concern;

•

Potential hesitance of public officials to be candid or even to agree to participate in the survey.
Solutions to these challenges include the use of triangulation of results in which the data collected
from archival records of Facebook posts were used as prompts during phone surveys or as
validation tools to compare information sharing activity (Fraenkel, Wallen & Hyun, 1993);

•

This study will make no claims to external validity, as even with other methods such as a webbased survey being used to answer the overall question about how much this campaign may
have influenced policymakers is not enough to generalize even to other online social movements;
and

•

While the comments made by participants in this discourse may have encouraged and
strengthened the intensity of the community protest, too many factors exist as part of any
community’s policymaking milieu that are not transparent or remain beyond this researcher’s
access and prevent any findings presented herein from being considered causal or definitively
explanatory in nature.
Other limitations experienced during the study include the difficulty of cluster sampling all of the

roles compared to values and policymaking processes coded by the researcher, especially when
combining the coding of both the Facebook sample and the external documents retrieved. Also,
discussions often occurred between multiple participants with a variety of roles but the values were the
same, so the frequencies of values counted in each discussion does not match those of values
frequencies by roles, as the discussion frequency was counted once whereas each role contributing
would have its own count. Finally, sentiment analysis was not used in this examination and would

63

contribute explanation and illustration of the discrepancy between word use similarity and latent meaning
that became evident in the differences in correlation between coding and word similarity statistics.

Ethical Considerations
All data were anonymized and the confidentiality of the participants is ensured to the fullest extent
possible. The Facebook data is publicly available and all correspondence of public agents are subject to
the Sunshine Laws of the state of Florida and are thus beyond the control of the researcher. However, the
conclusions drawn using this data have been aggregated with personal identification removed; topics will
be discussed by referring to participant group identity or an assigned pseudonym rather than personal
identity. Further, the researcher’s work has been guided by the dissertation committee members and all
protocols submitted to and approved by the Florida State University Human Subjects Committee.

Summary and Study Timeframe
The nature of communication today is that it occurs amidst the real-time immediacy of social
media. There is little room for error. “Increasing the capacity of overseers to ensure that the information
being communicated is candid, accurate, and consistent with the overall mission of the organization”
(Moore, 1995, p. 189) may be a lesson for all public officials who are the spoke persons and the decision
makers. Understanding both the positioning features afforded by digital technologies and the influence of
social network sites that interact in both online and offline public spheres may offer a greater
understanding of the weight of public values shared in online advocacy campaigns and may also suggest
effective messaging for users to effectively construct and deliver advocacy concerns.
The anticipated timeframe for concurrent data collection and analysis was based on a completed

CHAPTER FOUR
RESEARCH FINDINGS
Description of the Data
The Facebook discourse that included the group page entries (posts and comments) and all
resulting referenced documents were coded using universal, public sector, public library and policymaking
process attributes. The analysis resulted in lists of values frequencies; cluster analyses of relationships
between participant roles, Facebook discussions and coded values; and, lists of keywords and keyword
frequencies that illustrate the words used within each of the policymaking attributes. Additionally,
participants in the discourse were surveyed about their perceptions of the effectiveness of the Facebook
group page for library funding advocacy. The survey data provides further context for the Facebook data.

Save the Miami Dade Public Libraries (SMDPL) Facebook Page
Data gathered from the Facebook page, Save the Miami Dade Public Libraries (SMDPL)
demonstrate many expressions of values (perceptions of beliefs, attitudes and behaviors) posted online
by a variety of participants beginning with the page origination date of July 17, 2013 through September
10, 2013. These data include posts and any references within the posts to external texts such as public
official documents, meeting minutes, mainstream media articles, and external web links. An analysis of
the funding conflict deliberated in the context of the Facebook page yielded the content of the postings;
the critical incidents to which they were related during the Miami Dade library funding advocacy
campaign; the policymaking process elements including problem definition, agenda-setting, solution
creation and consensus building; and the influence of the expressions of values on the actions of public
officials. Table 5 displays all discussions listed in order of initial post entry date, the count of ‘likes’ for the
discussion (initial post and related comments). Also provided are the number of comments associated
with each initial post and the number of discussions per day, both of which provided a criterion for
selection of the sample (based upon the number of discussions per day, number of comments per
discussion and the occurrence within the discussion of a public official reference).
The table provides a summary list of the resulting values in each of three categories, universal
values, public sector values and public library values, as well as the policymaking process attributes. The
total column is the sum of the values and the policymaking attributes and does not include the social
media paradata. Highlighted entries are posts that are not discussions (that is, there are not any
succeeding comments attached to the original entry) but are included as they provide important context to
the overall Facebook group page activity with relevant external documents referenced, or they occurred

66

on high discussion days.
Table 5 demonstrates a total of 833 values based on the proposed CPV model of public library,
public sector and universal values; and 1259 policymaking references are coded in the messages shared
on the Facebook group page, SMDPL, identified and classified using a discourse analysis approach. The
table also shows the social media paradata – the number of comments and discussion ‘likes’ – for each
discussion and post. The rows that are shaded indicate the posts which were Facebook entries without
comments that were included because they originated the page, (7/17, 7/17, 7/18) at its initial launch of
the social site, had a large number of discussions on that day (7/19, 7/20) or had a large number of likes
(7/22).

Survey of the relevant population
A survey was employed to provide original descriptive data about the participants involved in the
discourse surrounding the 2013-2014 proposed budget. The participants who could be identified included
those who posted on the SMDPL group Facebook page, Miami-Dade County public officials including the

67

county and municipal mayors; the Miami Dade County Commissioners; all types (public, academic, etc) of
librarians and library workers; Miami Dade County community organizations such as the Friends of the
Miami Dade Public Library System; and any resident of Miami Dade County who posted on the SMDPL
site. Therefore, the survey was emailed to the public email addresses of participants; posted multiple
times on the SMDPL Facebook page; sent via Twitter and offered via phone to those who elected to not
use the web-based survey. A total of 106 surveys generated the responses in the following tables which
describe the number of SMDPL visits made by each participant (Table 6) and how often the participant
responded to a post with a comment or a like (Table 7).

Table 6 indicates that 15.1% of respondents used the SMDPL Facebook page daily; more than
one-quarter of the respondents visited the page over three times over the eight-week period examined in
the study, while 25.5% of the respondents never used the Facebook page at all.

Table 7 indicates that almost 70% of the survey respondents participated on the SMDPL page by
creating or liking a post; 8.5% of participants either commented or liked a post daily; and a little over 30%
may have visited the page but did not participate by either ‘liking’ or creating a post or comment. The
survey indicates that 28.3% of the sample respondents participated three or more times while most
participants were infrequent visitors (34% visited three or fewer times ) in the eight weeks of the study
period.

Research Findings
The study asks two research questions that focus on the public library, public sector and
universal values; and, the policymaking process respectively. The following sections present the findings
by the topics addressed in the research questions.

Values in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
This section presents the values expressed by participants within the social network advocacy
discourse. The posts, comments and any document referred to on the SMDPL Facebook page were
coded using the codebook of Public Library, Public Sector and Universal Values and the Policymaking
attributes using the CPV framework (Benington & Moore, 2011; Yang, in press).

Table 8 displays all of the 833 values by ranking with the universal democratic value (n=150) and the
public sector political value (n=146) with the greatest number of referents from the sample, each
appearing twice as frequently as the next highest value, the public library value, access (n=73). The four
universal values proposed in the CPV model occupy spots in the top ten values, as professional is the 4th

69

more frequent value (n=68), ethical (n=54) and people (n=52) are tied for the number seven and number
eight spots.
The public library values of service (n=58) and the public good-social responsibility (n=48) occupy
top ten rankings (#5 and #9, respectively) and the public sector value of social-cultural value (n=56) is the
sixth most frequently occurring value of all. The public library values of democracy (n=7), diversity (n=3),
intellectual freedom (n=1), and preservation (n=1) only occurred with single digit values as did the public
sector environmental value. The public library value of confidentiality-privacy was not evidenced in any of
the discourse. These findings demonstrate that all of the universal, public sector values and most of the
public library values are expressed in the social network advocacy discourse
The ranking of the values findings in the SMDPL Facebook discourse shows that the discourse
focuses on the democratic universal value (n=150) – characterized by 1) responsive to the wishes and
needs of the governed; 2) empowerment to citizens (giving legal authority); 3) behavior governed by rule
of law; 4) refusal to take sides in dealing with citizens (neutrality); and, 5) transparency in actions.
The public sector political value was found to be the second most frequent value (n=146). This
value is characterized by 1) actions based on the authority of the government/mandate of constituents; 2)
demonstration of concern by public officials for future generations; 3) efforts to cultivate approval,
acknowledgment or conversation from a variety of stakeholders; and, 4) embodies responsibility to act on
behalf of the whole community.
The third most frequent occurring value coded is the public library access value (n=73). This
value is specifically defined in context of public library organizational purposes and refers to 1) equal
access to materials, services and to place for all citizens; and, 2) access of citizens to public safety,
security and community services provided by public libraries. Detailed code explanations for all values
and policymaking attributes can be found in Appendix B. The following sections present each of the
values sections separately, with examples from the actual discourse provided for illustration. The values
demonstrated by the posts and the discussions (discussions include both an entry, primarily by the group
page administrator, and responses to this specific entry, termed comments).

Values for the Public Library Category in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
The research found 262 instances in which participants expressed values about public libraries.
For example, a participant expressing the library value of access in the Facebook discourse stated:
I keep hearing about new technology, but who is going to be there to teach the patrons who do
not know how to use it? Many people don't have skills or access to classes. The library is their
only source of assistance to learning and using technology,” and, “Please send this to the herald.
you say it all. We have given so much to the county because we believe in our mission of
providing access to information to everyone.

Figure 7 demonstrates that for the public library category, access (n=73), Service (n=58) and
public good-social responsibility (n=48) account for over 68% of the values coded in the entire discourse.
Confidentiality-privacy is missing from the table as it is not ever indicated as a value expressed in this
discourse. However, access (n=73), service (n=58) and public good/social responsibility (n=48) are the
three most frequently expressed values and account for over 68% of the public library values expressed;
professionalism (n=30), education/lifelong learning (n=22) and innovation (n=19) are all shared with
similar frequency; Democracy, diversity, preservation and intellectual freedom all follow with single digit
frequency.

Values for the Public Sector Category in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
A total of 247 references to public sector values occurred in the discourse on the SMDPL
Facebook page. The public sector values shared occur with over 59% of the values focused on political
expressions (n=146); social-cultural values follow with 56 expressions (22.7%) and 42 total economic
values at 17.0%. Environmental values only occurred three times. A public official contributed an example
of the economic and political values in a memo from a Miami Dade County Board of County
Commissioner’s meeting that was linked to the SMPLD Facebook page:
At that same meeting, I reaffirmed my commitment to continually assess the way we carry out our
mission of public service in a manner that seeks efficiencies and maximizes our reach, but also
protects the quality of the services provided to our residents. I welcome recommendations and
feedback from each of you and from vested community stakeholders, but all scenarios must be
vetted against criteria that evaluate the fiscal and programmatic viability of a sustainable county
government. Our decisions must be strategic.

Figure 8. Public sector values.
Figure 8 demonstrates that the political value (n=146) in the discourse comprises 59.1% of the
values coded in the discourse; social-cultural values were expressed 56 times and accounted for 22.1%
while economic values (n=42) made up 17.0% of the public sector values coded. Environmental values
were expressed just three times in the discourse coded. An example of the political values expressed in
the discourse includes:
WOW! I am getting it now. This is about incorporating the entire county and making libraries the
responsibility of municipalities. Think of all those who voted against increase including mayor. All
were city mayors or state legislators. All of which dislike the county. They are dismantling
countywide services....phase one. (24 July 2013, 7:22 p.m. Facebook post).

Values for the Universal Category in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
Three hundred and twenty-four values were coded as universal in the Facebook discourse.
Universal values comprised 38.9% of the 833 total values expressed. The democratic value (n=150)
accounts for 46.3% of the universal codes while the remaining values are fairly evenly distributed
between the other three codes.
An example of the democratic value in the universal category from the Mainstream Media
participant, WLRN in Miami noted in a 7/17/2013 online article that “The budget cuts hitting libraries, fire
departments and animal shelters have one thing in common: They are an assault on the foundation of a
civilized society.” The article also cited a public official also stated, “Our planning efforts have centered on
common trends impacting most libraries. Although we have a complex road ahead of us, it is imperative
that our work for short-term solutions does not stray from the integrity of our long-term plans” as an
example of the ethical value in the universal category.

Figure 9. Universal values.
Figure 9 illustrates that the Universal values were primarily represented by the democratic value
(n=150), which was the overall top value for all three categories as well and accounted for 46.3% of all
Universal values. The professional value (n=68) accounted for 21.0%, the ethical value (n=54) 16.7% and
the people value (n=52) for 16.0%). The more even distribution of values in the universal category and its
larger quantity demonstrates that universal values were more prevalent in all of the discussions and
posts. While several discussions and posts revealed only one or no public library or public sector values,
universal values appeared in every single discussion and post.
Perception of Survey Participants about Social Network Advocacy Discourse
In this section I present survey data used to examine the perceptions of the ways participants
were able to use social network sites for library funding advocacy. Participants were asked to describe
concepts of discourse sharing effectiveness and Table 10 demonstrates that 78.3% of the survey
respondents agree or strongly agree that use of the Facebook group page was an effective way to share
information about the Miami Dade County library budget discussion.

Table 11 Demonstrates that 55.6% of the survey participants indicated that the Facebook group
page discussions represented the diverse interests of Miami-Dade County residents; however, more than
a quarter (25.5%) answered that they did not know, 11.3% did not agree or disagree, and 6.6% either
disagreed or strongly disagreed, suggesting that the survey participants were less conclusive about the
Facebook page’s representativeness of the entire county population.

The responses in Table 12 demonstrate an even higher percentage of responses in which
participants are either neutral (17.9%), disagree (4.7%) or don’t know (28.3%) if the Facebook page
sharing produced an agreement about Miami Dade County library funding. While almost half of the
respondents (48.1%) replied that the Facebook page produced agreement, there is a clear split in views
on this question.

Values Distributed by Facebook Discussion/Post in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
Tables 13-15 display the number of public library values, public sector values and universal
values coded by discussion and posts.

Public library values distributed by Facebook discussion/post in social network advocacy
discourse.
In Table 13 displaying public library values, codes are prominent in discussions #3 (n=46),
#6(n=41) and #11(n=47); access is the most consistently occurring value, included in every entry but one;
service appears in all but three discussions and public good/social responsibility appears in all but four
discussions. What is also notable is that one discussion accounts for 43.3% of the professionalism
values; the service value concentrates 41.3% of the values in just two discussions. Only four values,
access, service, professionalism and public good/social responsibility occur in the posts (it should be
remembered that the values of the posts that initiate discussions are accounted for in the discussion
values total).

Public sector values distributed by Facebook discussion/post in social network advocacy
discourse.
Table 14 displays the public sector values for discussions and posts. There are a total of 247
values coded but they are spread over only four categories, as opposed to the public library values that
are broken into nine categories. Political values occurred in all discussions except discussion #5 that
occurred on 7/25/2013. Political values were also the most frequent value that appeared in the posts

76

without discussions as well (n=14). Environmental values occur in only two discussions and don’t appear
in the posts without discussions. Discussions #9 (7/31/2013) and #11 (8/4/2013) are the only discussions
in which all four values appear.

Universal values distributed by Facebook discussion/post in social network advocacy
discourse.
Table 15 displays the universal values, which appear in at least one category in every discussion.
Democratic and professional values occur in all but one discussion (7/25/2013 and 9/8/2013,
respectively); all four categories of values appear in the posts without discussions. Universal values are
found in every discussion, whereas public sector values and public library values are missing in one
discussion (7/25 and 7/29 respectively). Thus, although the findings show almost all universal values in
every discussion, public library and public sector are often missing, suggesting that the discourse was
focused less on the specific subset of values and most consistently on the broad Universal value
category.

Participant Roles in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
Participant roles are assigned to the 254 unique participants determined by either the
participant’s self-description on their Facebook page as collected by the software program Nvivo when
the data were downloaded from the group Facebook page; or, the descriptions were applied by the
researcher who conducted Google and Facebook searches for reliable information about the participants.
Those who could not be conclusively assigned to a participant category were coded as ‘Unassigned’.

77

Resident Participants (n=113) make up 44.0% of the participants; Unassigned (n=70) accounted
for 27.2%; and Librarians (n=48) account for 18.7% of the total participants on the Facebook page. The
remaining participants are comprised of eight Professional Library Advocates, six Library workers, three
Mainstream Media journalists, one Blogger, and five public officials that include the County Mayor, three
Municipal Mayors and four County Commissioners (Table 16).

Table 17 illustrates the values segmented by participant role in both the Facebook discourse and
the participant survey. The total of SNS participant values is incongruent with the total values enumerated
by the Facebook discussion/post totals, as multiple participants may be counted in the expression of one
value. Values in the Facebook discussion/posts were counted by entry instance; Facebook discourse
participant roles were also counted by instance and multiple roles frequently occurred in discussions. For
the Facebook discourse, the Unassigned roles account for over one-third (33.8%) of the values
expressed by role; Librarians account for 19.8% (n=310) and Resident Participants account for 15.0% of
the values expressed by the different roles. The public official roles count for 25.4% of the participant
roles; the County Mayor alone represents 14.2% of values by roles, with 223 instances of participation
throughout the sample studied.
The survey participant roles exhibit a greater percentage of Librarians (42.3%), and Resident
Participants (26.0%); Unassigned participants are much lower at 15.4% (versus 27.2% Facebook
discourse Unassigned participants). The County Mayor declined to participate in the survey and only two
County Commissioners participated by phone. The two participating Municipal Mayors self-identified in
the online survey.

Participant Roles by Discussion in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
Table 19 shows the participation of each of the role types by discussion. The Unassigned roles
and the Librarian roles participate in every discussion; Resident participants appear in all but one
discussion; Professional Advocates participate in all but five discussions, Mainstream Media appear in
only six discussions; the Municipal Mayors participate four discussions; and the County Mayor’s and
County Commissioners’ roles only occur in three discussions each.
The timeframe of the discourse in the sample covers July 16, 2013 through September 10, 2013.
The discussion dates reflect the initial entry date of the post that originates the discussion; the timeframe
of the sample includes dates that were referred to in various entries, thus the sample timeframe includes
dates beyond July 18 and September 10. The table shows the participation of the various roles
throughout the sample timeline.

Relationship of Participant Roles to Values in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
The relationships between the values shared and the various participant roles were examined
both in total and by value type. For purposes of this particular analysis, Librarians, Library Workers,
Resident participants and Unassigned were combined in the following discussion to enable the use of the
Nvivo cluster analysis feature that offers the linear correlation similarity metric of the Pearson Product
Moment (PPM), (QSR International, 2016A), as an exploratory technique. PPM measures the degree and
direction of the relationship between two variables (Asthana & Bhushan, 2007). In Nvivo, the formula is
used to visualize data but can also output the statistics in tabular form and is used here to explore various
types of community participation and the roles of librarian, library workers, unassigned, resident
participants, public official, media, and professional advocates. Because of the multiple sources used in

79

coding, the Nvivo cluster analysis would only compute the categories with librarians, library workers,
unassigned and resident participants combined, which limit the degree of analysis possible.

Relationship of Participant Roles to Public Library Values in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
Table 18 demonstrates that for public library values, there is not a single strong relationship
between the role of the participant and the values expressed. The strongest coefficient emerges for the
Municipal Mayor category relationship to diversity (.55), which suggests that these mayors are more
strongly related to expressions of diversity in their postings.
The Librarian, Library Worker, Resident and Unassigned category have their strongest correlations to
intellectual freedom (.34), diversity (.24) and professionalism (.24); Mainstream Media have the most
positive correlations to public library values with intellectual freedom and preservation (both .43),
democracy (.42), and innovation-future (.38) all positively correlated; the County Mayor has the most
positive correlations in the public library category with diversity (.30), professionalism (.30) and education
(.035); Bloggers only had two positive correlations, service and public good-social responsibility (.24
each); and, Commissioners had only one positive correlation, innovation-future (.24). While Municipal
Mayors exhibited the strongest correlation, they also exhibited the greatest number of negative
correlations (n=6).

Relationship of Participant Roles to Public Sector Values in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
For public sector correlations (Table 20), the strongest positive relationship exists between the
combined Librarian, Library Worker, Resident and Unassigned category and environmental value (.51);
Professional Advocates’ strongest correlation is with economic value but is only .24; Mainstream Media’s
strongest public sector value is with social-cultural (.39); the County Mayor strongest relationship is with
economic value (.43); the County Commissioners’ strongest correlation is with political value (.30); and
Bloggers’ strongest relationship is with economic value at .26. The public officials – County Mayor,
Municipal Mayors and Commissioners – have weak negative or weak positive correlations to political
value; the strongest negative correlation is between the Librarian, Library Worker, Resident and
Unassigned category and political value (-0.24).

Relationship of Participant Roles to Universal Values in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
In the universal values category (Table 21), the Librarian, Library Worker, Resident and
Unassigned category exhibited the stronger relationship – negative – with the democratic value. This
indicates that the greater this category’s entries, the codes for democratic decreases. The Librarian,
Library Worker, Resident and Unassigned category has a stronger relationship to ethical value but this is
still not considered strong in terms of Pearson product-moment correlation standards. The strongest
relationship is the positive one between the County Commissioner posts and the value of professional
(0.68). The County Mayor also has a stronger relationship with professional (.53); the public official
categories and the Mainstream Media are the only categories with no negative correlations in the
universal category.

The Nvivo cluster analysis also offers the option to analyze the data by word similarity rather than
coding similarity. While many correlations were similar between the two techniques, the use of codes is
more appropriate to identify relationships by concept and not just by word linkages (QSR International,
2016). Cluster analysis using the word similarity feature can be viewed in Appendix XX).

Role of the Public Library and Public Sector Accountability to Value Attributes
The Values section of the web-based survey asked participants to assign the accountability for each
value attribute from the public library and public sector values to the entity to whom they would expect to
be accountable for that value attribute. Table 22 illustrates the ranked public sector and public library
value attributes, comparing government agencies rankings with those of public libraries.
As might be expected, government agencies were ranked as more accountable to many public sector
values, as public libraries ranked higher on most public library values. However, two public sector value
attributes - Demonstrates caring behavior toward community stakeholders; and, Supports and contributes
to innovations that better the community; ranked higher by respondents for public libraries. In addition, the
public library attribute of Stimulates and supports democratic dialogue, ranked higher for government
agencies than it did for public libraries.

The Policymaking Process in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
Survey data are presented to present the policymaking concepts from the survey participants’
point of view. The purpose of this data collection was to determine how participants perceived the use of
social media on the group Facebook page, SMDPL, functioned as a platform for library funding advocacy.
Questions addressed participants’ views of problem definition (responses 1-3), agenda-setting
(responses 4-5) and solution creation (responses 6-7) and all responses are listed in Table 23.

Survey Responses About the Policymaking Process in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
Question 1 shows that 76.4% either agree or strongly agree that the social media campaign
defined the problems in the discourse; 16.0% did not know if it has this impact and less than 2.0% of the
participants perceived strongly that the campaign did not defined the problem.
Responses to question #2 show that 82.1% of the participants perceived that the social media
campaign demonstrated that funding the Miami Dade Public Libraries as an urgent condition. Less than
1/5 disagreed and 14.2% did not know if it demonstrated urgency.
Responses to question #3 show that 75.5% of the participants perceive that funding for Miami
Dade public libraries is a problem that the Miami Dade County government can solve. Again, 14.2% of
the participants did not know if it is a problem solvable by the county government.
In question #4, participants were asked if the social media campaign conducted on the SMDPL
group Facebook page identified and prioritized the issues. Almost 68% of the participants agreed or
strongly agreed that the Facebook page identified and prioritized the issues; 12.3% of the participants
neither agreed nor disagreed; and, 17.9% did not know. Less than 2% disagreed.

85

Question #5 asked if the SMDPL Facebook group page focused attention on a condition that was
previously not receiving attention (question #5) and 73.5% of the respondents agreed. Less than 5%
neither disagreed nor agreed (4.7%); 4.7% also disagreed and 16.0% did not know. This response
suggests that most participants felt this was a way to identify a need and bring it to the attention of
policymakers.

In question #6, participants were less convinced that the Facebook campaign generated practical
solutions. Only 64.2% of participants agreed that practical solutions were generated; further, almost 21%
responded that they did not know if this was the case.
Question #7 was designed to interrupt acquiescence bias (Qualtrics, 2016), which is the tendency
to agree with statements in the survey. Because the survey framed almost all of the questions similarly,
validity is enhanced with questions that are phrased the same but the affirmation is opposite of the prior
questions. The result is that 60.4% of respondents did not agree that the SMDPL Facebook page did not
have an impact – or rather, that it did have an impact. However 22.6% of respondents replied to this
question that they ‘did not know’ if the SMDPL Facebook page had an impact, which is a higher percent
of than other questions in the survey. Over 6% of the respondents did not agree that it had an impact,
which again, is one of the higher negative response rates in the survey.

86

Summary of the Survey on the Policymaking Process in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
Questions that showed the strongest agreement with a positive view of the effectiveness of the
SMDPL Facebook page include #2 and #3 (problem definition) and #5, (agenda-setting). In fact, question
#2 about library funding urgency shows the greatest agreement (over 80%) and the least amount of
disagreement (less than 1%). Question #4, which focuses on how well the SMDPL Facebook page
identified and prioritized issues, and question #6, which asks for participants to assess the feasibility for
these solutions to be used by policymakers, reveal the greatest sense of uncertainty in both the “Neither
agree nor disagree” (12.3% and 13.2% respectively) and “I don’t know” (17.9% and 20.8% respectively)
categories. These two questions, along with question #7, ask respondents to estimate the policymaking
performance of the social media campaign in terms of agenda-setting and solution creation. Question #7,
however, does not demonstrate the same level of uncertainty and actually has the lowest response to the
“I don’t know” answer of all the questions.
The sample size of the survey is unknown. While the list-serv memberships are estimated to be
approximately 2400 members (Fla-lib n=900; Fl-lib n=1500), many of the emails are considered to be
duplicates. Further, the survey link was distributed via Twitter using the Florida Library Association 2015
conference hash tag with dispersion unknown; also, it was emailed to Miami-Dade County official
addresses and posted on both the researcher and SMDPL Facebook pages. This limited survey
response suggests that participants used the social media Facebook page to identify problems and define
their urgency and also partially shaped policy agendas by giving attention to otherwise concealed or
ignored conditions. However, many participants were unwilling to assert that the solutions offered were
practical or feasible.

SMDPL Facebook Page Participation Coded for the Policymaking Process in Social Network
Advocacy Discourse
Tables 24 and 25 illustrate the use of the SMDPL Facebook page for policymaking by participant
roles. Table 24 shows stakeholders who are directly impacted by the county budget proposal (i.e.,
Unassigned, Resident Participants, Librarians, Library Workers and Professional Library Advocates); and
table 25 shows those stakeholders whose interest is indirect (i.e., County Mayor, County Commissioners,
Municipal Mayors, Mainstream Media and Bloggers). To be clear, the Mayor and Commissioners did not
post directly to the page; however, their official correspondences and remarks articulated by Mainstream
Media or on the SMDPL Twitter feed did get mentioned on the SMDPL Facebook page and therefore
were included in the discourse analysis. What is clear from the policymaking codes of SMDPL
participants is that the highest frequencies on the Facebook page mirror the responses on the survey.

87

Problem definition a policymaking dimension that revealed high frequencies in the survey also
shows the greatest number of coded references in the Facebook page entries. Problem definition has the
two highest counts – Identifies the context of a problem (n=243), and names a problem or conflict
(n=222). Solution creation has a similar vague response as it did in the survey: participants respond that
the solutions alleviate a need of the stakeholders involved (n=147) but the occurrence of solutions that
will be feasible (n=45) and/or acceptable (n=15), are two of the lowest scoring policymaking attributes.

Other lower scores include those for consensus building, which is expected, as consensus
building is usually a function of a clearly cohesive and mutually tasked group. Those participating on a
Facebook page could not indicate this. The consensus building attributes of agreement imperative (n=23)

88

and consensus efforts (n=28) are two of the three lowest scores: in this case, the Facebook page was not
used for these ends.
The agenda-setting attribute of items that need attention was a high score for Unassigned (n=53)
participants and the County Mayor (n=25). Unassigned participants also responded with high frequencies
of problem definition (n=102 for problem naming and n=97 for context identification). The total references
for Unassigned participants were 655, or 9.6 references per participant; Librarians averaged 4.7
references each. This contrasts with the County Mayor, who contributed 292 policymaking coded
references to the discussion. While this is to be expected, as this position contributes the leadership voice
for County actions, what is clear is that the discourse exhibited by the County Mayor covers all of the
policymaking attributes with references in the double figures. The exception, and it seems notable, is that
the expressions of the County Mayor do not exhibit wide acceptable (n=3).

The Policymaking Process: SMDPL Facebook Page Participation Ranking
Table 26 illustrates the participant rank in terms of each role’s contribution to policymaking
references within the discourse. Obviously, with greater numbers of participants, the Unassigned role is
the highest ranked role. However, the County Mayor has the highest number for a single individual, and
the Librarians rank third, with an average of 4.7 references per participant.

Table 27 lists the total coded policymaking references by discussion and post. Problem definition
(identifying context, n=132; Names a problem, n=124) and solution creation (solution alleviates condition,
n=121) have the top three attributes and this validates the high frequency of these attributes in the survey
responses as well. Wide acceptance of solution creation was the overall least frequent policymaking
attribute, both in the County Mayor’s results but here in the discussions and posts as well (n=9).

The Policymaking Process Code Totals and Rank by Discussion
Finally, Table 28 demonstrates the policymaking totals and rank by discussion (in order of
discussion date). The top policymaking dimension is problem definition (n=292), followed by solution
creation (n=241), consensus building (n=131) and lastly agenda-setting (n=96). Discussion #5 from
7/25/2013 displays the highest number of policymaking references (n=121); this discussion included a
public official memo and Facebook responses to the Twitter conversation from the prior day. This
discussion has the high numbers for each policymaking category as well. The discussion from 9/8/2013
(n=117) was the second highest policymaking discussion with discussion #4 from 7/24 as the third most
prolific policymaking discussion (n=80).
The Policymaking Process by Category in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
The findings in answer to this question provide sample texts with drawn from the discourse that
includes the Facebook posts, comments and any external references such as public official memoranda
or meeting minutes, mainstream media articles or online blog postings.
Agenda-setting in social network advocacy discourse.
Agenda-setting is characterized by 1) issues that participants state should be addressed; and 2)
identification of an order or plan by which problems should be solved.

With the exception of Unassigned participants, public officials establish the policymaking
dimension of agenda-setting most frequently. The examples of agenda-setting are evident in almost every
text public officials present; below are examples from the County Mayor, County Commissioners,
Librarians, and Resident Participants. The text needs only exhibit one of the two attributes to be coded an
agenda-setting characteristic.
County Mayor: Gimenez sent commissioners a memo Tuesday saying he would not have any veto
items and the administration would not have any agenda items for July 30. "There is much work to be
done during the summer recess in regards to the Fire and Library budgets," Gimenez's memo said,
asking for the meeting to be canceled "so that staff can fully focus on the budget process (Gimenez
Memorandum, 23 July, 2013 quoted in 25 July 2013, 12:25 p.m. Facebook post).
The mayor identifies a plan (cancelling the July 30 meeting) with reasons (the budget process needs
focus). This statement identifies the order of actions (much work to be done during the summer recess)
and asserts that these actions fulfill a commitment to do what is important (working on the Fire and
Library budgets).
County Commissioner: “Personally, I (Commissioner) have always felt that libraries serve as the
backbone of our neighborhoods. My aim is to keep them open and serving our community” (22, July
2013, 12:51 p.m. Facebook post). This Commissioner statement identifies a plan (“keeping libraries open
and serving community”) and asserts that this is an important commitment (“I have always felt that
libraries serve as the backbone”).

92

Librarian: “Misinformation is our greatest enemy, and now that our Elected Officials seem to be
listening to us, we have to be ready to give coherent answers, support, and solutions to the crisis that lays
before us” (29 July, 2013, 7:48 p.m.). This statement contains the elements of agenda-setting: importance
of topic (“Misinformation is our greatest enemy”) and an order or plan of action (“be ready to give
coherent answers, support and solutions to the crisis”).
Resident Participant: “Share this page! Gain support! Let the public know what our commissioners
and mayor is doing and write them to RECALL THEIR VOTE in the September BCC meeting!” (17 July,
2013, 11:47 p.m.). This statement contains the elements of agenda-setting: importance of topic (“Gain
support! Let the public know…”) and an order or plan of action (Share this page!...write them to RECALL
THEIR VOTE…”).

Table 29 is presented to demonstrate the top 10 words occurring within the agenda-setting coded
references, returning similar words as well as the exact word (QSR International, 2016B). For agendasetting, library is the most frequent word; other public library related words include services, and closing
(which is related to the public library value, access).
The conversation about agenda-setting is heavily related to decision-making for the county public
officials at large, however, as ‘county’ is the number two word (weighted percentage). Other words that
populate the discourse such as ‘work’, ‘budget’ and ‘closing’ all relate to the libraries but are discussed for
the county at large.
Problem Definition in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
Problem definition can include four attributes but all four do not have to be present for a code to
be assigned. The attributes include: 1) concerns all citizens or the entire county; 2) condition that is
urgent and requires fast action; 3) identifies the context of a problem (facts relating to problem); and, 4)
names a problem or conflict ('the problem is...')
County Mayor:
One of the most challenging responsibilities that we have as elected officials is to balance
the desire of our residents to pay less in taxes with the desire to maintain or improve services.
We must also give due consideration to our hard-working employees in this decision-making
process. However, our local economy just hasn’t improved enough to make that possible at this
point (Gimenez, 16 July, 2013).
“Our residents” indicates all citizens in the county; the context of the problem is demonstrated by the
claim that the problem is the challenge to balance competing desires for decreased taxes with increased
amenities; the conflict cited is the stasis of the local economy. This example possesses three of the four
problem definition attributes.
Examples of problem definition most heavily articulated by the Unassigned, Librarian and Resident
participants include the following:
Librarian: “What we want users to do is to imagine their lives without libraries and realize how
important libraries are to the everyday lives of families, the community and the public at large (26 July
2013, 8:25 p.m., Facebook post). The librarian’s excerpt indicates the context of the problem (a future
without libraries) and indicates also that it is a community problem (the community and the public at
large).

94

Resident Participant: “They're closing bc (sic) it's either that or raise taxes on homeowners in Miami.
They're also closing 6 fire stations for this reason” (19 July 2013, 4:26 p.m., Facebook post). This citizen
participant indicates the problem or conflict (raise taxes on homeowners or close libraries).

Professional Advocate:
The changes made to the originally proposed 2013- 14 County Budget did not afford
Miami-Dade citizens an opportunity to be heard," the statement said. "The rushed decision was
made without notice, therefore leaving citizens out of a decision-making process that will close
libraries and fire stations in their communities (28 July 2013, 12:25 p.m., Facebook post).
The professional advocate indicates the context of the problem by providing facts relating to the problem
(changes made ….did not afford Miami-Dade citizens an opportunity to be heard), and also shows that
this problem affects citizens of the County.

Mainstream Media:
The decision yesterday was made to theoretically close 22 libraries (10 storefronts and
12 branches) as well as lay off 251 employees. This number is presented as the worst-case
scenario. While it could be less, the closings are nearly half of the libraries in Miami-Dade. Half of
the Miami-Dade County Commission is facing re-election next year and a vote to increase any
types of taxes could cost them their office (Sandler, 2013, para. 3).
The mainstream media example demonstrates that this problem is related to the urgency of the
voting timeframe, and suggests that the conflict is raising taxes within an election cycle and the urgency is
to NOT raise taxes. Also, this provides context with facts about the consequences (close 22 libraries,
layoff 251 employees, half of the Miami-Dade County Commission is facing re-election) that explains
more about the source of the conflict.
Problem definition ranges from the Librarian view, which here focuses on the Universal value of
libraries to their communities; the Resident participant acknowledges the practical, Public Sector
Economic value; the Professional Advocate and the Mainstream Media focused on the Public Sector
Political value of political maneuvering and public officials worrying about re-election.
The word frequency text query presented in Table 30 presents a similar list of words occurring in
the coding for problem definition. Four of the top five words are the same as those in agenda-setting,
which suggests that the agenda-setting and problem definition concepts are alike, with similar words
coded for both.

Solution Creation in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
Solution creation is a dimension that has five attributes in this study:
•

A condition that alleviates a problem;

•

Indication of agreement on strategy and feasibility;

•

Indication of wide acceptance;

•

Indication that solution alleviates stakeholder needs; and,

•

Users share information with facts-stats to alleviate condition.

In the discourse, I found the policy making characteristic Solution Creation exemplified in the
following participant roles:

96

County Mayor: “It is clear there is no public support for a tax rate increase right now,” Gimenez told
the commission before they approved it” (Gimenez, 16 July, 2013).
County Commissioners:
Among these are "store-front" libraries in commercial establishments which could be
adopted by major shopping centers, saving in rent and utilities. Then we would budget enough
so that all neighbors can have access to the Web - This is important in that approximately 25% of
County residents do not have Internet access, many residing in my District’ (Commissioner Sosa
memorandum posted 25 July 2013, 2:43 p.m., Facebook post).
“…perhaps now is the time to reinvent our libraries with new technology, hours of operation and
engage new municipalities” (Commissioner Bova quote from Twitter posted on 25 July 2013, 7:47 p.m.
Facebook post).
“I believe this proposal is fiscally responsible and respectful of the community’s desire to balance their
tax rates with levels of services, and the will of the voters to support animal services” (Gimenez, 16 July,
2013).
Librarians:
We made sure to post guidance to supporters so that they knew who and how to contact
their local commissioners,” wrote (name deleted). “Since then, all 11 of the Miami-Dade County
commissioners have been receiving non-stop letters, phone calls and emails demanding and
pleading to not close libraries because of how important they are (Librarian quoted in Castillo,
2013).
Mainstream Media:” It’s slow progress, but it’s progress. And library fans can thank a growing social
media http://wlrn.org/post/can-social-media-campaign-save-more-miami-dade-public-libraries Follow us
on Twitter” (Castillo, 2 August 2013)
Professional Advocate: “…labor union leader Fred Frost of the Miami Economic Sustainability
Alliance told commissioners at the July 16 meeting, according to the paper. “We need to have calm,
stable and effective leadership. We cannot be governed by a bumper sticker” (CBS Miami quoted in 29
July 2013, 5:32 p.m. Facebook post).
Solutions to end the library-funding conflict include resolutions that could still result in the closure
of the libraries ‘no public support for a tax rate increase’ (County Mayor), libraries being adopted by
shopping centers, adopting new technology, hours operation, engaging new municipalities and balancing

97

tax rates with services (County Commissioners); to simply ‘not close libraries’ (Librarians); or Professional
Advocates who suggest that leadership, a funding solution and understanding the community importance
of libraries are solutions to the conflict. Finally, the Mainstream Media suggested that any solutions were
due to the efforts of the “growing social media” efforts.
The text query for solution creation is much more focused on the responsibility of the public
officials to provide solutions; and, the concept of community, with its related infrastructure for
communication and network are proposed related themes. Also, the term ‘support’ and related terms are
frequent terms that are proposed as key elements critical for solution creation.

Summary of the Findings
The findings presented in this chapter answer the questions of how the public perceives values in
a library funding advocacy discourse examined on the social network site Facebook. Values were
discovered in all three categories that include universal, public sector and public library values. Only one
value dimension, the public library value of confidentiality/privacy, was not found in the sample examined.
Universal values (n=324) were the most frequently occurring values, with four concept dimensions that
include democratic (n=150), professional (n=68), ethical (n=54), and people (n=52).
The values were also present and examined by participant role and by occurrence in the
Facebook structure of a discussion, which is defined for this study as an originating entry with successive
replies directed toward that entry and organized by position (immediately following the entry and indented
on the page) and time on the Facebook page. Participant roles and values were also examined in the
survey results distributed to a wide range of participants via a diverse dissemination method that included

98

Twitter messages, Facebook posts and emails to librarian list-servs and public officials’ email addresses.
The high number of Unassigned roles in the discourse make unclear how the roles truly influence the
values expressed as these identities are unknown for a large group of participants (n=70) and they
account for over 33% of the values found in the research.
The policymaking process attributes were also examined in both the Facebook entries and the
survey. Policymaking attributes were found in all of the discussions and the survey results affirmed the
usefulness of policymaking processes within the advocacy discourse with the exception that there was
less support for the concept that the social network site SMDPL made an impact on the funding outcome.
Discussion of the values, participant roles and the policymaking process findings will be
presented in the next chapter, with added context provided from discussion with Florida library
stakeholders and others.

CHAPTER FIVE
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The final chapter of this dissertation presents a discussion of the findings from the examination of
the posts, comments and external reference documents from the Facebook page, Save the Miami Dade
Public Libraries (SMDPL) and the survey responses of participants about the use of social media for
library funding advocacy during the 2013 Miami Dade library budget discourse. This chapter begins with a
restatement of the problem addressed by the study, briefly overviews the findings and then moves on to a
discussion of the findings situated within the values’ literature and the policymaking literature with
conclusions of the research. The chapter concludes with implications of the research for practitioners and
scholars and provides recommendations for future research related to public library funding advocacy and
for public policymakers use of social media in creating public value.

Summary
This study examined values revealed in the discourse surrounding the proposed 2013 Miami
Dade County proposed library funding and County budget considerations. The source of the discourse
included six posts (entries without subsequent replies), and fifteen discussions (a total of 319 posts with
replies and also including 16 external documents) that originated on the Facebook group page, SMDPL in
July 2013 and extended through the first Miami Dade County Commission budget vote in September
2013; and the study also included survey responses of 106 discourse participants that examined
perceptions of the use of social network sites for library funding advocacy.
The research was framed using the public policymaking theory, CPV (Benington & Moore, 2011),
which was extended into a model that identifies each of the dimensions of Moore’s strategic triangle –
public value outcomes, authorizing environment, and operational capacity – by placing them into a public
policymaking category – Deliberation, Legitimation and Implementation – respectively. The complete logic
of this model underlies and contributes to the creation of public value, which in this respect, is the
collective noun that refers to the manifestation of the “desires and perceptions of individuals” (Moore,
1995, p. 52), those things that people desire and are considered within communities as activities and
resources provided to the public sector by government as authorized by citizens. This study has focused
on the public values outcomes that Yang represents in the deliberation category, with the addition of
public library values added to the public sector values and universal public values and used distinct
definitions as codes to identify the values in the discourse generated in Miami Dade County in summer,
2013.
Discourse analysis was employed as an examination method that seeks to identify concepts and
ideas within text, conversation and other forms of communication. This study focused on the text from
Facebook page entries that included posts, comments, and other external artifacts introduced within each

100

Facebook entry. External artifacts included official public memoranda, public meeting minutes, local and
national mainstream media online articles, among others. The Facebook page generated over 4000
entries within the two-month sample period that includes the origination date of the Facebook group page
to the first County Commission vote on the evolving budget. Because the study purpose included
understanding the use of the social network site for policymaking, a survey was implemented to obtain
the perceptions of respondents who may have participated in the library-funding advocacy and proposed
budget discourse in the summer of 2013 to determine their perceptions of its effective and efficient use as
communication tool in the policymaking process. The results of these two methods are discussed in the
next section.
Conclusion and Discussion
This section presents the research questions and the findings that answer each; discussion is
provided for each of the questions that address issues raised in the literature review, specifically related
to 1) public library, public sector, and universal values expressed in the findings and their expressions by
different participants; 2) policymaking attributes the emerged in the findings, their uses in the discourse by
different participants and the value of social network sites for the policymaking process; 3) the use of the
framework Creating Public Value (CPV) as presented by Yang and adapted for this library funding
discourse context; and, 4) the use of discourse analysis as a method with which to examine library
funding discourse using social network sites.

Social network sites in public library advocacy discourse and public sector discourse.
RQ1: In what ways, if at all, does the use of social network sites for library funding advocacy
demonstrate what the public values about libraries and public sector institutions?

Figure 10. Values and policymaking attributes by post and discussion.
Participants in the library funding advocacy discourse as framed by CPV expressed public library,
public sector, universal values and policymaking attributes in almost every discussion and post analyzed

101

in this study. As Figure 10 shows, with few exceptions, the weeks of 7/27 and 7/29, all three values
categories populated the discourse with a similar trend line to that of the policymaking attributes. While
values and policymaking attributes occurred with similar frequency to the Comments and Likes of the
Facebook paradata, this is not always the case. Specifically, the weeks of 7/19, 7/20a and 7/22b, all
reveal a growing number of Likes but no comments: the first two were ‘calls to action’ by the SMDPL
administrator, to sign a petition and attend a list of public meetings; the week of 7/22b is a post reprinting
a call to action by a municipal mayor. The weeks of 7/27, 8/3, and 8/4, all portrayed photos from library
rallies; the week of 9/8, with the highest number of Likes (675) and Comments (n=62), is the only
discussion in the sample in which the original post was supported and disseminated by a Facebook
‘Boost’ – a Facebook feature that increases the number of entries and positioning of SMDPL posts in
followers’ Facebook newsfeeds (Facebook, 2016).
These findings, except for the paid ‘Boost’, confirm the offline to online migration of relationships
resulting from “interweaving of actions in social encounters” (Carrington & Scott, 2011, p. 1) and reinforce
research that demonstrates that social network activity is strongly related to external events and
relationships (Carrington & Scott, 2011; Steinfield & Lampe, 2007). In this case, the Facebook group
page was used often to list County commissioner votes (7/18), public meetings (7/20a), library rallies
(7/27, 8/3, and 8/4) and calls to action, revealing that the page became a nexus for offline activities and
information sharing, using facts, photos and external stories to create an online resource for library
funding advocacy. It is clear that the SMDPL page created an interrelated online and offline network that
built on community relationships, the ability to share information to a wide audience and embed diverse
messages (boyd, 2010) that quickly disseminated information and fueled advocacy, expanding the
participatory network (Wellman, 2002).

Values in Social Network Advocacy Discourse
RQ1.1: What universal values, public sector values or public library values, if any, are shared
using the SMDPL Facebook page?

Examining universal value.
Using the CPV framework, the discourse findings indicate that all four of the universal values –
democratic (n=150), professional (n=68), ethical (n=54) and people (n=52) – were in the top ten most
frequently expressed values. The public sector value, political (n=146), ranked just behind the universal
value of democratic, and access (n=73) was the highest ranking public library value. This demonstrates
that what the public values in this library discourse relates to the “enduring beliefs” (Rokeach, 1973, p. 5)
or principles that influence the choices made among the available alternatives. The universal values
made up 38.9% of the values expressed in the sample. This suggests that the participants in the
discourse were most concerned with the elements of a democratic community that include transparency

102

and restraint of power, representation with integrity and equality of participants in governance of the
community. The most important value to the Miami Dade citizens using social network sites is
responsiveness to community needs, behavior that is governed by the rule of law and acknowledging
citizen empowerment. The frequency of the universal value of democratic in this discourse supports
Williams and Shearers’ (2011) findings that public value is only delivered with renewal of citizen consent
through democratic means and that participants in this discourse first addressed their rights to be
empowered and have a voice about the role and value of libraries.
This finding indicates that the deliberative process is an important element in the funding conflict.
But this finding also indicates that the participants in this discourse, many of whom are librarians or library
workers (n=56) did not demonstrate the neutrality that Alighieri (2006) claims has denied library
professionals the opportunity to advocate for their profession and for libraries. This finding supports that
discourse conducted using the SMDPL Facebook page privileged the democratic voice first of all the
values, as participants emphasized the need for the County government to engage with civil society in the
act of policymaking, a form of e-democracy in the participatory network of the social network site, seeking
to establish the “networked community governance” of CPV (Benington & Moore, 2011).

Examining public sector value.
The public sector value, political, was the second most frequent value expressed (n=146). This
value is characterized by public officials and/or active citizens, acting to represent the public will with the
authority of government based on a mandate of the citizens. Political value is demonstrated by
expressions of concern for future generations, efforts to cultivate approval, and conversation with a
variety of community stakeholders. In many cases, the political values expressions were not always
positive and often were questioning or defensive as in this example quote from the Miami Herald
(7/20/2013) about the County Mayor’s very first consideration to raise taxes and his resulting change of
mind:
But, the pushback from commissioners and some in the public was swift and Gimenez changed
his mind, according to CBS4 news partner The Miami Herald. “It is clear there is no public
support for a tax rate increase right now,” Gimenez told the commission before they approved it.
When asked if he was an ‘unapologetic flip flopper’ when it came to his stance, the mayor said
the people determined his stance. “I’m unapologetic for listening to the wishes of the people.”
(Miami Herald, 2013, para. 3).
This excerpt is just one example of the public sector political value and is clearly crafted by a
policymaker for whom the perception of changeable decision maker is a valuable role, demonstrating

103

adaptability, and engaging public dialogue, all of which creates public value through discourse,
demonstrating his continuing “renewal of consent” (Williams & Shearer, 2011, p. 6), by the public.
Other Facebook posts that demonstrate the political value ranged from balanced but opposing views
of public official actions to those are were just blatantly mean-spirited.
After reading [Facebook participant] comments I went back to the Miami Heralds editorial
on July 15th that seemed to encourage the Board of County Commissioner to vote against fully
funding the library. I commented on their editorial. "Nobody wants their (sic) taxes to go up" that's
how you began your editorial. Well that's a broad brushstroke over all county residents. I
disagree. Taxpayers despise waste and fraud and graft and being apologized to for loss of
millions. (Save the Miami Dade Public Libraries Facebook page, 2013).
Additionally, one participant provided this very simple denouncement: “Well no one said that he
was a genius. Just another stupid lying politician” (July 22, 2013, 2:14 p.m., Facebook). While the first
Facebook quote offers details that can be determined for their veracity and focus on actions, the second
quote is disparaging and arguably does not contribute to public value because it lacks purpose and is
dismissive, rather than seeking that ‘greater sense-making’ that results in economic or socio-political
public sector resources (Bechmann & Lomborg, 2013).
While Hale suggests that the process of increased citizen participation creates trust (2011), it is
hard to fully embrace the notion with insulting comments that are easily and anonymously posted to a
page that was being followed at the time by over 6000 followers. However, as Mergel and Mosteller both
confirmed, there is a lack of guidance for public officials in the use of online social networks that offer
such robust opportunities for network building that cuts across boundaries of agencies, disciplines,
expertise and stakeholders.

Examining library value.
The public library value of access (n=73) was the third most frequent of the values, and the first
public library value. Access was stated in multiple ways, as in access to libraries, access to materials and
services, and access to technology. Access occurs in every discussion but one, whereas the next two
most frequent library values, service (n=58) and public good/social responsibility (n=48) are missing in
three and four discussions, respectively. However, five of the public library values occurred in less than
half of the discussions, and three values, diversity, intellectual freedom and preservation, occur in three or
fewer discussions.
That access is the most prevalent value is not surprising and the literature is full of examples of
access and its important service to diverse communities as a core library mission (De Rosa & Johnson,
2009; Hoffman, Bertot & Davis, 2012; Knight Foundation, 2009; Shubik-Richards & Dowdall, 2012).

104

However, if advocacy is the process of educating and influencing decision makers to support libraries of
all types (Hoover, 2012), then there are many missed opportunities within this discourse to demonstrate
all of the values of public libraries. This along with the continuing need for library data that point to
community-specific needs within market-based conditions (Koontz, Jue, & Lance, 2005) suggest that the
ability of advocates to articulate library value is not optimized in this example of online advocacy.
The prevailing view on the part of the library advocates is that consistently decreasing public
funding to libraries expresses that decision-makers consider libraries to be operations that underperform
expectations (Prentice, 1996). This is echoed by the Mayor of Miami Dade County who was quoted early
in the advocacy discourse, saying, “The age of the library is probably ending” (McCorquodale, 2013).
Equally important in aligning library values with modern views of information provision and relevancy,
library measures that better tell the story of the purpose and daily activities of today’s public libraries. The
effective dissemination of the modern library community reach, outcomes and impact can be improved by
messages that are crafted with concrete images of library value creation.

Role Of Participants In Library Funding Advocacy Discourse
Two hundred and fifty-four participants contributed to the library funding discourse in the sample
selected from the Facebook group page SMDPL from July 17, 2013 through September 11. 2013.
Because the unit of analysis was the discussion, multiple participant roles could be coded and each
would account for the values and policymaking attributes coded in a discussion. Therefore, one value
may be coded but it would be counted twice into a discussion with two participants.
RQ1.2: Which participant roles are observed among those sharing information?
While Librarians accounted for almost 20% of the coded values, and the County Mayor
accounted for 14.2%, almost 34% of the values were accounted for by those participants who could not
be assigned to a category. Resident participants accounted for 15.0% of values. These four roles make
up the majority of the values coded and appear in most discussions (with the exception of the County
Mayor, who participated in only four of the discussions) but an admitted limitation of the study is that the
identity of participants on social network sites is not verifiable and may not indicate a participant’s
authentic role as a stakeholder in the discourse.
The large number of Unassigned participants does suggest that some participants may be willing
to comment but unwilling to identify themselves in fear of reprisal from library administrators (Comito,
Geraci & Zabriskie, 2012); also, non-identifying participants may be library workers who understand their
employment as a library work as an obligation to be neutral in all aspects of the profession (Jaeger, et al.,
2014). Both of these suggestions are speculations, but data from an anecdotal observation support these
propositions. When a national library publication sought out a local librarian to quote in a story the journal
was writing about the funding conflict and resulting social media activity surrounding it, the librarian

105

declined to be interviewed because the librarian perceived it to be prohibited by library administrative
policies (phone conversation, July, 2013). When I pointed out that she had been outspoken against the
public officials on the Facebook page, she indicated that there was not a policy against this and no one
really knew her exact profile. But even the Facebook discourse demonstrates what could be considered
the discouragement by administrators to librarians about their comments, “And after all this we were told
by [our supervisor] NOT to tell the public to call the commissioners to complain (19 July 2013, 7:35 a.m.
Facebook post).

Perceptions of Survey Participants
Another way to answer this question was to understand the perception of the web-based survey
participants who also participated in the Facebook discourse. The survey data in which 75% of the
respondents (n=79) visited the SMDPL Facebook page at least one time, found that over 55% of
respondents agreed that the Facebook page represented the diverse interests of Miami Dade County.
Almost 50% thought that the social media sharing on the site produced agreement and 78.3%
perceived the platform to produce effective sharing. But of the survey respondents, only three confirmed
public officials participated and the County Mayor declined to even answer the survey questions by
phone. Therefore, these influential stakeholders are not wholly represented in the survey responses.
While the use of the Facebook SMDPL group page may have increased transparency of
government expression by the intense amount of sharing of documents and public information that
occurred on the site; and, may have created a narrative about the budget discussions, proposed library
cuts and resulting alternative solutions, the public official confirmation of the influence of any one role is
not available.
RQ1.3: What is the relationship between the values shared and the various participants?
Public library values.
The missing frequencies of many public library values in the discussions as displayed in Table 13
are indicative of the lack of strong, positive correlations among any of the participant roles and the public
library values within this discourse. The literature indicates that social media has become an important
tool in e-governance (“(Bertot, Jaeger & Hansen, 2012) but in this study, other than the three values of
access, service and public good/social responsibility, it is not expressive of other professionally codified
library values.
While the Facebook data demonstrate that participants missed opportunities in many of the
discussions to share expressions of values relating to confidentiality-privacy, innovation and intellectual
freedom, it does not suggest why this may be. The survey results suggest that sharing was effective
(Table 10) but if measured by the number and diversity of library values occurring in the Facebook

106

discourse, the perception of survey participants is not supported. The survey participants were made up
of a greater percentage of librarians and library workers, many who identified as participants in the
Facebook discourse. Possibly for them, the use of the Facebook page made sharing information
effective.
However, the number of discussions without an expression of public library values mirrors the
findings in the literature that document the lack of effective library use measures and library value
calculators (Lyons, 2013). Further, the higher numbers of Unassigned and Resident Participants in the
Facebook discourse may indicate that uninformed participants who lack library use expertise resorted to
vague assertions of value rather than descriptive demonstrations of library use and public value. As
Hussey and Velasquez (2011) describe, even in library and information studies education programs,
advocacy is barely a topic.
Several examples from the Facebook discourse demonstrate the vague assertions of library
value and often, polemical rhetoric including “The message there is that voters, even in tough times, will
pay for something they deem to be a worthy investment. Animals' lives, as well as libraries and fire
departments are worthy investments“ (21 July 2013, 4:26 p.m.). This example conflates the problems of
each of the public services with threatened budgets – libraries, Miami-Dade County fire/rescue and the
public animal shelters – as the same type of community loss. Others cited the specific professions, as in
“As far as I see it the librarians and firefighters earn their keep by providing a service to either enrich or
save a life (22 July 2013, 3:47 p.m.).” And finally, this message, that begins with the promise of sharing
specific information about the role of libraries, but concludes with more vague assertions:
Unfortunately not everybody knows what is the role of the libraries in the community, they
think that a library is a place where they get free books and that's all. Let's get together all, let's
do what we need to do. Rising taxes for just a year or two does not hurt that much. Some people
think they will have to pay more monthly, please explain that just by rising the taxes a few dollars
we can save what it took so much effort to built, and besides, once libraries are closed down they
will remain closed forever, because next year it's going to be the same song. NO LAY OFF, NO
CLOSING OF LIBRARIES, spread the word (28 July 2013, 2:35 p.m.).
These expressions are examples of value by assertion rather than value by demonstration (Jaeger, et
al., 2014) . They are passionate and emphatic but lack substance as an appeal to policymakers who are
often simultaneously faced with multiple, competing and urgent priorities.

Public sector values.
Public sector values also do not exhibit any strong positive or negative correlations with any
particular role. While political value was the second most frequently occurring value, it was shared by all

107

participant roles. The environmental value exhibited the strongest, positive relationship (r=.51) but was
only expressed three times in the entire discourse. However, in analyzing the difference between
Facebook posts from Unassigneds’ or Resident Participants’ roles, the political values expressed are
quite different from those identified from public officials or mainstream media, in sentiment, as these two
examples indicate: “Well no one said that he was a genius. Just another stupid lying politician (22 July
2013, 2:14 p.m., Facebook post) and “Excuse US, Commissioner. We are TAXPAYERS and VOTERS
first -- and please remember that at the end of the day, you work for the people and it is your obligation to
listen to us!” (3 August 2013, 12:15 p.m., Facebook post). The public official comments are less
emphatic: “I believe this proposal is fiscally responsible and respectful of the community’s desire to
balance their tax rates with levels of services, and the will of the voters to support animal services
(Marquez, 2013); and the mainstream media example is from an online article by Miami station WLRN
posted to the Facebook page:
In fact, an exchange on Twitter between #savourlibrary activists and Commissioner
Esteban “Steve” Bovo proved fruitful. On July 24, after a flurry of tweets directed at him, Bovo
responded to the @MIALibraries account with, at first, a carefully worded brush-off (2013).
But some Facebook posts expressed balanced messages about public sector values, such as this
message focused on Economic value:
I went back to the Miami Heralds editorial on July 15th that seemed to encourage the
Board of County Commissioner to vote against fully funding the library. I commented on their
editorial. "Nobody wants their taxes to go up" that's how you began your editorial. Well that's a
broad brushstroke over all county residents. I disagree. Taxpayers despise waste and fraud and
graft and being apologized to for loss of millions. The most glaring example i recall was the
mismanagement of money that had been allocated to better transit that went missing. That’s why
the majority of us are tired and angry. The Pets Trust vote however, demonstrated that 500,000
voters are not following the cookie cutter belief that "Nobody wants their taxes to go up." For the
evident public good we are willing to pay. Libraries are for the evident public good (26 July 2013,
10:21 a.m., Facebook post)
The use of social network sites in sharing public sector values offers a strong, one-way broadcast
channel about public meetings, official comments and calls to action (Williams and Shearer, 2011) and
this is evidenced in the SMDPL Facebook discourse; however, the public sector values shared by
Facebook posts were often overwhelmingly negative and not substantive. This activity would undermine
efforts to engage citizenry and to increase transparency using social media in spite of the expectation that
governments could be expected to do so (Sadeghi, 2012). Thus the sharing of public sector values by

108

different participant roles can be seen as differing in tone and sentiment but a complete analysis of this
phenomenon goes beyond the scope of this study.

Universal values.
The strongest positive correlation for universal values was for the professional value with
Commissioners (r=.68) and the County Mayor (r=.53) which include expressions of expertise, efficiency,
quality of actions and integrity. Some examples include:
It is our responsibility to effectively hone our holistic approach to service delivery within a
sustainable fiscal framework. Our planning efforts have centered on common trends impacting
most libraries. Although we have a complex road ahead of us, it is imperative that our work for
short-term solutions does not stray from the integrity of our long-term plans (Gimenez, 2013b).
And from the Facebook postings:
Research this issue. It's a deeper story with twists and turns. The library actually was
the only fiscally healthy department out of 48 (turned into 25 by the mayor). Because it had a $75
million reserve that was to be used for renovations and construction, it was a target. The no tax
mayor directed the library to spend down the reserve and halved the tax millage. The library did
this over two years (10 September 2013, 12:21 a.m.)
Both expressions focus on the problem but the second expresses a negative view of the professional
value. However, it offers information that can be verified (the position of the mayor, the amount of library
reserves) and exemplifies how social media can be used for a the creation of ‘community networked
governance’ (Benington, 2011) as a way to articulate community-wide, proactive responses to the kind of
systemic change proposed by such a sweeping change to the public library system.
Baym describes the shared attributes of both network and community as “public group contexts
[in which] people participating in online groups collaboratively build a replenishing repository of public
goods that can be used by unknown recipients one might never encounter again and whom one can’t
expect to reciprocate immediately” (2010, p. 85). In the public sector, information generated by networks
manifests as policymaking capacity for public agencies, and delivering public service to address public
problems (Agranoff, 2007; Hale, 2011).

Information Sharing As Policymaking
In the public sector, “public opinion informs the government, and the government makes it
policies known to public opinion – public opinion reigns, but it does not govern” (Fraenkel as cited in
Habermas, 1989, p. 239). Thus, information sharing using social network sites can be important sources
of the wishes of a community even if they do not direct the actions of public sector officials. But this lack

109

of action on publicly communicated information can become a source of community conflict. The
interactions involved in information sharing in the public sector are now examined for their contribution to
policymaking process, which directly implicates the usefulness of the values method to understand the
deliberative process in the revised Yang model of Creating Public Value.

Processes of Policymaking
RQ2: How do social network sites used for library funding advocacy contribute, if at all, to the
policymaking process?
In both the survey findings and the Facebook discourse results, participants’ demonstrated use of
the policymaking processes of problem definition, agenda-setting and solution creation as identified by
Kingdon (1993) and Zahariadis (2003). Problem definition is the process of identifying a condition that
defines “parameters for discussion and lends legitimacy to an issue” (Weissert & Weissert, 2008, p. 296)
that begs a solution. In the public sector, this solution must be something that the government is capable
of providing; agenda-setting is “the process by which certain issues gain prominence” (Zahariadis, 2003,
p. 79); and solution creation are ideas that possess technical feasibility and values acceptability according
to policymakers (Kingdon, as cited by Zahariadis, 2003, p. 76) or more simply, a condition that alleviates
a problem.
As indicated by the survey findings, participants agreed that they were able to define the
problems facing the Miami Dade community; create a sense of urgency that indicated to policymakers
that they desired action; and, for the most part, agreed that feasible solutions were provided in response
to the issues. Solution creation was the response with the lowest frequency, however, as over 20% of
respondents indicated that they did not know if feasible solutions were created. This indicates that while
solutions may have been proposed, they may lack the knowledge to confirm if the solutions were any that
could be implemented.
The policymaking dimensions were coded at the attribute level and a Facebook entry only
needed one attribute to be considered indicative of the dimension. The Facebook discourse revealed the
Unassigned participants by sheer numbers ranked first in the policymaking rank of roles; The County
Mayor was the second most prolific policymaker and the Librarian role was third. The problem definition
dimension possesses four attributes and two of these occupied the number one and number two spots as
participants in the discourse described perceptions of both the context of the problem – overspent library
reserves, out of touch agenda, public official incompetence, among others – and demonstrated a
propensity to name the problem, e.g., policy makers out of touch, lying politicians, and undervalue
librarians, to name just a few.
Also frequently occurring was the solution creation attribute in which users share information with
evidence. This was fueled in part by the SMDPL administrators, professional advocates and several
frequently posting librarians. Additionally, the president of the MDPLS Friends of the Library, two
municipal Mayors and researchers from Florida State University, contributed evidence-based information

110

to the discourse, boosting the occurrence of the solution creation attributes. The first agenda-setting
attribute, was the fourth most frequent and concerned the attribute of participants identifying an important
item that they feel should be addressed. In this case, the item was library funding and it was placed on
both public officials’ agendas and on the agenda of the community in the form of attending rallies, public
hearings and communicating with officials.
Problem definition was abundant in the discourse and was provided by all roles. Using the social
network site, the participants defined the problem, promoted it to the agendas of all stakeholders and to a
lesser degree, offered solutions to solve the problem. However, solution creation and consensus building
were the two least frequently occurring attributes; these attributes address specifically that agreement on
strategy or satisfying all stakeholder needs could be achieved. This was supported by the results of the
participant survey as the respondents replied by over 20% that they did not know if the solutions
proposed were feasible to policymakers.
Agenda-setting was controlled primarily by the public officials, participants who are trained in
planning processes, and also by the administrators of the SMDPL group page who used the opportunity
to turn the Facebook page into an interactive broadcast channel, providing details on public meetings,
library rallies, public official voting records, media coverage and other social network coverage, enriching
the literature that indicates that in spite of the expectation of greater interaction via social media, much
communication remains one-way (Williams & Shearer, 2011). In this particular case, the SMDPL
administrators did use the page to disseminate information but the sheer number of followers in such a
short time period created a fan base that responded both online and offline, drawing crowds to rallies and
many citizens to public hearings, mirroring other online social movements described by Tufekci (2013),
Skinner, (2011), Gonzalez-Bailon, 2013), and Merchant, Elmer & Lurie (2011).

Information Sharing As Policymaking In The Networked Community
RQ2.1: In what ways are agenda-setting and problem definition expressed?
Agenda-setting attributes are those entries that include a sense of urgency for the item to gain
attention and create a strategy with either a future plan with timeline, methods for goal achievement or
directions for advocates to continue their efforts. Agenda-setting is primarily evidenced in the texts of the
public officials, who contributed public memoranda to the discourse (because participants linked to them
or posted them). As official documents contributed to the discourse, rather than impromptu remarks on
the Facebook page, they possess structure that is common to policy makers, and agenda-setting is a part
of this. In particular, the communications of County Mayor Gimenez contain all of the elements of
policymaking examined in this study.
The expressions of most Facebook participants are exclamatory as in “Share this page! Gain
support! Let the public know what our commissioners and mayor is doing and write them to RECALL
THEIR VOTE in the September BCC meeting!”, using capital letters and exclamation points. As

111

indicated, the SMDPL administrators crafted more complete messages with more policymaking elements
contained, as in this sample of problem definition:
A little too late Mrs. Sosa, the people heard you, and your vote was counted. Main library 3rd
floor and the basement will be closing hoping to lower the lease of 5.1 million, which the library
pays for the building now, everyone there will be relocated or laid off, a total of 90 employees,
also there will be 160 public servants that will be laid off and 22 libraries will be closed. The
administration is looking for any available space in the libraries that will stay open to store
equipment and books, but there is not enough room for everything and the amount of books that
will be destroyed could reach 1 million or more. In books alone the amount of money lost will be
over 40 million dollars, the value of PCs, laptops, shelves, furniture, equipment, newly refurbished
libraries and recently constructed buildings will add to millions of dollars wasted (7/25).
Agenda-setting messages included lists of prioritized items, explanations for the plan, specific future
actions and dates or timeframes.
Very closely allied to agenda-setting is the expression of problem definition, in which participants
related facts of the problem (decision made to close 22 libraries, lay off 251 employees with the reason
given that commissioners facing a vote to increase taxes would cost them their jobs). From the public
officials’ perspective, library closures and personnel layoffs reduce the problematic size of the
government. Other problems cited included the irrelevancy of libraries because of the Internet’s
insinuation into daily life; unstable leadership on the part of the County public officials; and, the budgetary
reality of balancing desired services with funding shortfalls due to a sluggish economy. While some of the
discourse focused on the economics of the library funding structure, many focused on the more vague
and less helpful issues of political maneuvering and cultural ignorance. And for some, the problem was
also the issue of a missing democratic process:
The changes made to the originally proposed 2013- 14 County Budget did not afford
Miami-Dade citizens an opportunity to be heard," the statement said. "The rushed decision was
made without notice, therefore leaving citizens out of a decision-making process that will close
libraries and fire stations in their communities (League of Women Voters as cited in Mazzei,
2013).
If a library is to be seen as more than just an expensive warehouse (Hernon & Altman, 2010), and
advocacy is required to identify the needs of communities and influence public opinion (Hoover, 2012),
then the messages defining the problem would benefit from the structure of formal agenda-setting and
problem definition that would identify and plan necessary action and fully describe the fiscal challenges of
libraries and the problems they solve for their communities in more discrete terms. And if the problems

112

are as complex as described by Jaeger, et al (2014), then messages must incorporate politics, policy,
advocacy, history and services but it is hard to imagine complex expressions as these successfully
conveyed using a social media platform. Finally, meaningful and captured data demonstrating the many
services provided by libraries both in the building and online are often not available at the individual
library level but are aggregated at the larger, system level, often masking conditions; and, traditional
library professional standards regarding the capture of these data pose obstacles to much change
(Koontz, & Jue, 2002; Koontz, Jue, & Lance, 2005).
RQ2.2: What solutions to the library funding conflict, if any, were proposed?
Solution creation, as Kingdon (2003) describes it, comprises a variety of proposed alternatives
that are then evaluated based on selected criteria and decisions made not in the public forum but by an
assemblage of experts. Further, the propositions seek to alleviate the problem, provide facts and suggest
that there is wide acceptance of the proposal. Proposed solutions attributed to public officials included
cutting back library facilities, library hours, staffing, and reduced services. More lofty solutions included a
consideration that “perhaps now is the time to reinvent our libraries with new technology, hours of
operation and engage new municipalities” (Commissioner Bova quote from Twitter posted on 25 July
2013, 7:47 p.m. Facebook post) and locating libraries in commercial establishments as store-fronts
adopted by major retailers. The County Mayor’s proposed solutions initially solved a different problem that of balancing services with the available funds resulting from flat budgeting. Later, he suggested that
parks could accommodate some heretofore library services like Internet access. Mainstream media
suggestions focused on the problem of citizen voices being heard and suggested that the growing social
media campaign on the SMDPL Facebook page was progress and continued to publicize advocacy
meetings. Professional advocates cited the need for effective leadership, acknowledging that libraries are
important parts of the community and putting the choice up to the people in a voter referendum. Librarian
and resident participants voiced solutions that were more vague, suggesting that the only solution was no
library closures and that participants simply need envision their lives without libraries.
As such, these entries were counted as solution creation, because that is how participants
phrased them. But in reality, they do not suggest a realistic, mutually acceptable solution and thus do not
mirror the online movement phenomenon of crowdsourcing or as boyd (2010) imagines, a collective that
offers innovative capacities for participation, forging new social, cultural and civic outcomes. As the
survey seems to indicate, the participants are less convinced that the solutions are feasible and therefore,
are not contributing to the creation of public value.
Consensus as a policymaking dimension, was removed as a research question but was still
coded as an outcome, an agreement. Consensus as a process was often attempted as indicated in the
values recorded. However, consensus is both a series of multiple steps, and is also more typically a

113

formal, structured process (Innes & Booher, 1999; Yang, in press) References for consensus were coded
for this value even if only one attribute of consensus was noted.
Creating Public Value
Using A Values Framework To Understand The Public Values Outcome Segment Of The CPV
Strategic Triangle
I chose to use the framework, Creating Public Value (CPV) (Benington & Moore, 2011; Moore
1995; Moore, 2013), because it posed the challenge to define a “clear, objective definition of what
constituted public value” (Moore, 2013, p.8). To simplistically state that public value is what the citizens
of a community are willing to pay for obscures the fact that the transaction (the actual exchange of capital
for goods and services) is not direct and that many citizens in a community never use the tangible
elements of that value. CPV seeks to identify the legitimate arbiters of public value in a community and
which particular values do these arbiters choose to direct government activities. By answering these two
questions, performance measures for government agencies can be defined, accountability obtained and a
clear, proactive approach for future initiatives developed, all parts of the Strategic Triangle (Benington &
Moore, 2011). This model comprises three spheres that include an Authorizing Environment, an
Operational Capacity and the Public Values Outcome. In the Yang (in press) extension, these spheres
are produced by the activities of Deliberation, Legitimation And Implementation, respectively.
This model was applied to a particular context, that of a public library funding deliberation that
focused on the proposed decrease in funding and consequent library closings and personnel layoffs in
the Miami-Dade County Public Library System beginning June 2013. In this study, the arbiters were
chosen from the participants of the discourse created by respondents of the Facebook page, Save the
Miami Dade Public Libraries. The values chosen are reflected in the findings for public library, public
sector and universal values described in the Chapter 4 Results. This is the step in the CPV framework
that Yang calls the ‘Deliberation’ process, responsible for identifying the public value outcomes and
measurable indicators of mission achievement. Culminating with this study, the deliberative process is
captured as discourse produced by the social network sites intersecting on the SMDPL Facebook page.
If looking only at the public library values found in this discourse as proposed by this study, the
participants valued access to public libraries, service provided by libraries, and activities that benefit the
public good or demonstrate social responsibility. Notably, however, many of the values typically expected
of public libraries as expressed by the American Library Association were not ever mentioned such as
confidentiality and privacy. However, the participants did express the full range of both the public sector
and the universal values. The deliberative process would have to be considered less than fruitful.
And yet the library advocacy can be attributed with not only creating the authorizing
environment’s established outcomes and measurable indicators but also contributing to later results from
this advocacy movement. These outcomes illustrate the other two spheres of the strategic triangle, both

114

reinforcing the value of using this framework to understand attempts at articulating what the public values
about libraries but also raise the question of causality.
The outcomes include the establishment of a Blue Ribbon Task Force in December 2013 created
to advise the Miami-Dade County Commission and develop a master plan for improved future library
funding (MiamiDade.gov, 2013); and subsequent annual increases in library funding that brought the
library system revenue to a total of 61 million dollars, from a 2013-2014 low of almost 49 million dollars
(MiamiDade.gov, 2015). The creation of a committee of community stakeholders that includes resident
participants, professional advocates and librarians demonstrates characteristics of both the Legitimation
sphere in which public outcomes are codified by public institutional action; and the Deliberation sphere,
that establishes the view of public value held by participants of the discourse. That this task force
continues its efforts two and a half years later also demonstrates the creation of Operational capacity, as
does the increase in public service positions of 32 full-time library positions in 2016. These outcomes
clearly align with the concepts identified in Moore’s strategic triangle.
The question of causality is difficult to answer, especially with the weak results of values in the
public library category, conflicting views of the municipal mayors and the lack of survey response by
public officials. However, the increased participation in the Authorizing Environment led to development of
desired public value outcomes and increased Operational Capacity, both for future deliberations (an
active Blue Ribbon Task Force) and library operations (increased public service library positions). The
CPV model demonstrates what public institutions often struggle to articulate, that despite the lack of “a
bottom line in the black…convincing evidence that an organization is creating value for society” (Moore,
2013, p. 39), that they are delivering the public value desired by their community.
However, in weighing the value of CPV as a way to examine library funding advocacy using
social network sites, it is important to heed Moore’s cautionary message that focusing on outcomes as
the sole metric obscures the need to remain aware of and be able to scrutinize the processes involved in
creating public value. It is in the analysis of the “value chain” (Moore, 2013, p.14) that Operational
Capacity is identified and potentially measured. Thus for this study, I incorporated the elements of
traditional policymaking processes - problem definition, agenda-setting, solution creation and consensus
building - to understand how using social network sites for advocacy function as a communication
platform, as the deliberative process itself is a public value (Yang, in press). This enabled me to look
closely at the messages created by the different participant roles and about the three different categories
of values. In building a case for public library capacity, the public library values were exposed as lacking
in detail or simply missing altogether.
Using the policymaking process attributes affords a closer view of the strategic triangle’s
Authorizing environment as it functions in the public sphere of the social network sites. One result that is
notable is the use of the agenda-setting attribute: public official use of this (and all of the attributes) is
consistent and dominant in terms of the roles exhibiting this attribute use. And in extending the known
relationship of online behavior to offline relationships, one could suspect this policymaking behavior to be

115

lacking in advocates’ offline activities. Thus, the model may offer some value in exposing successful
deliberative actions that may benefit the efforts of library funding advocates.
The other issue with focusing solely on outcomes as an equivalent measure of value creation is
that there is a cost to implementing values that is not transparent when discussing outcomes.
Operationalizing values with both outcomes and processes provides a view of the costs of producing a
value. For example, if the County Mayor asserts that he is upholding both the universal value of
democracy by delivering the public sector economic value with no increase in taxes, the cost incurred
may be that he is, as Kingdon (2003) suggests, spending the universal value of people. In other words,
there is a cost to the County Mayor’s actions but it may be in the form of an intangible value, and the
mayor is treating the cost as another form of money spent to cover the cost of no tax increase.
The result is diminished social capital as the public library value of education and lifelong learning
is denied to those in low-income areas where some of the library closures would have occurred. By
producing the public sector political value, public officials may be spending both public library and other
universal values. The framework provided by CPV, especially as modified with Yang’s model and the
addition of public library values creates a way to begin assessing the creation of public value using a tool
like Moore’s (20123) public value account in way that analyzes outcomes and processes as consistently
and wholly as possible. This extension of the model to indicate the iterative and reflexive action of the
deliberative, legitimation and implementation processes on the values at all levels, and vice versa,
support Moore’s original intent that the model illustrates the “core idea” that the a community holds public
officials accountable for results but are also likely to values’ priorities (Moore, 2013)

The Usefulness of the Revised Yang Model
The revised Yang model merges four approaches to public administration theory with
assumptions of public value creation including Universal Values theory, aggregation of interests, citizen
deliberation/participation and public managers as experts (Yang, in press). Yang’s integration resulted in
a model that features a collaboration of Deliberation, Legitimation and Implementation that align with
Moore’s original Strategic Triangle of Public Value Outcomes, Authorizing Environment and Operational
Capacity. Each of the four approaches respectively contribute 1) public value created when values direct
actions; 2) decision rules such as legislation or policy that support the general will; 3) individual
preferences transformed into common good through deliberation attempting consensus; and, 4) public
agents (public officials and public managers) as experts tasked with solving the public’s problems (Yang,
in press).
Each of these aspects presents a conflict however, as values must be negotiated and often do
not resolve; decisions are made to satisfy a majority and ignore the legitimate concerns of some citizens;
deliberation may not be authoritative, and thus often reflects only the most able voice; and, public agents
are often only political individuals who delegate to a non-elected manager to make decisions, presenting

116

a choice between a politically-motivated public official and the questionable legitimacy of an un-elected
delegatee. Yang’s (in press) model results in the three processes that define values within contexts,
establish legitimacy required to achieve goals, and develop and contribute to operational capacity through
a network of resources.
As Yang does within this revised model of public value, creating public value begins with a
values’ inventory; in this study of the SMDPL Facebook discourse, the values are established by coding
on three levels of values, universal, public sector and public library values. Then the values are
“translated into clearly-defined end outcomes with measurable indicators” (Yang, in press, p. 9) – in the
SMDPL discourse, the deliberation of the participants identify their indicators of public value as 100%
access to the current level of operations, including maintaining all locations and personnel.
Legitimacy is established in the creation of the Blue Ribbon Task Force, comprised of many of
the individuals responsible for organizing the constant Facebook posts, library rallies and public meeting
attendance. The findings illustrate Yang’s Legitimation sphere, what Moore terms the Authorizing
Environment, as the County Mayor and several of the county commissioners engaged either on the social
media platforms or because of information posted on them. Finally, Operational Capacity is created when
library funding is reinstated, the Blue Ribbon Task Force is created, and future initiatives can be
developed because there is both a formal, citizen feedback group and the experienced advocates who
participated and continue to monitor local funding.
The expressions of universal values illustrate activities that create public value as the actions as
they are guided by the universal values such as ethics, professionalism, public sector values with
economic and political characteristics and many references to the public library access value. Yet,
“Public value is created when these values direct individual actions and decisions” (Yang, in press, p. 4)
and the values exist within a context in which they must be operationalized and any conflicts addressed.
The discourse of the 2013 SMDPL library funding budget shortfalls suggests a conflict between the public
sector values of political, professional and economic values with public library values. The County Mayor
floats the notion that libraries may be an irrelevant institution for which he cannot justify a tax increase;
the library advocates point to the intangible and, in this discourse, unmeasured costs to a community
without libraries. Creating public value occurs when values’ conflicts such as these are addressed and
solutions are successfully implemented. .
In terms of the Miami-Dade County Public Library System (MDPLS), public value was created by:
1) the budgetary deliberative process that included discourse anchored by the SMDPL Facebook group
page; 2) funds that were made available to maintain all library facilities and librarian positions; 3) a Blue
Ribbon task force that was created “to assist the County Commission in creating a Master Plan for the

117

future of the Miami-Dade Public Library System (MiamiDade.gov, 2013). The press release announcing
this result asserted that “”During the County’s Fiscal Year 2013-14 budget process, the role of libraries
emerged as an important topic” (MiamiDade.gov, 2013, para. 3). With these actions, the conflict between
public sector values and public library values were addressed.
Assessing public value is made more complicated by the potentially unrealistic citizen perceptions
and the lack of objective evidence about public libraries’ outcomes produced to make the case for desired
public services. In the case of the MDPLS in particular, and libraries in general, the inclination, ability and
resources required to demonstrate library value in tangible and meaningful ways continues to challenge
even those most passionate about their love for libraries. Creating solutions to address library funding is
just one element of the many dimensions of policymaking that often require a broader view of alternatives
to providing the services that libraries deliver to communities. If viewed in this manner, it may be that
more efficient and effective alternatives exist and this begs the question of whether a community dare
replace its libraries if that is the desire of its citizens.
In analyzing the discourse presented by this situation, I draw the conclusion that while the overall
appeal to universal values that connect to libraries was convincingly drawn, the messages that articulate
and describe the public library values are missing for many values that libraries are expected to provide,
such as lifelong learning, service and strict adherence to confidentiality and privacy. Public libraries may
be conducting activities and delivering services that exhibit library values, but the messages in this
discourse do not convey this and therefore library funding advocacy is weakened.
Finally, I offer a revised model that illustrates the phenomenon of creating public value within the
context of public library funding advocacy. While Yang’s model inserts the processes (Deliberation,
Legitimation and Implementation) that afford the outcomes described by Moore in the Strategic Triangle,
the ecosystem of the values as revealed in this study suggests that Universal values are a backdrop for
both Public Sector and Public Library Values; the processes of Deliberation, Legitimation and
Implementation and the resulting affordances of Public Values Outcomes, Authorizing Environment and
Operational Capacity are situated in the Public Sector. Public library missions are directed by public
sector processes, policies and values from each of the public sector categories, but the values of public
libraries are often not completely integrated with the mission of the public sector. Public libraries exhibit
values that connect to universal values but are sometimes out of sync with public sector values.

Discourse Analysis Value In Analyzing Social Media
A discourse analysis approach to examining the data provided by the social media campaign
conducted on the Facebook group page, Save the Miami-Dade Public Libraries, provided an expansive
consideration of diverse contexts in which related information was shared and concepts, ideas and power
were articulated and characterized. Against the backdrop of Habermas’ public sphere, the “domain of our
social life in which such a thing as public opinion can be formed” (as quoted by Zimmerman, 2014, p.
132), discourse analysis describes and explains the dynamic interaction of information sharing using
social network sites in a process that may have resulted in forming a public opinion, which is a group of
people who share “a common understanding of the world, a shared identity, a claim to inclusiveness, a
consensus regarding the collective interest” (Livingstone, 2005, p. 9).
As an examination of what the public values about libraries and in the public sector, the discourse
analysis approach examined the ideas and concepts of the Facebook entries and all of the external
artifacts introduced to the page by either a mention in the post or comment or by insertion of a website
URL linking to another document or story. Discourse analysis was appropriate because the public sphere
is available to all who contributed to the public forum and the interaction of participant roles and
policymaking attributes all converged to identify a variety of values framed by Creating Public Value. In
categorizing the language used, I was able to identify the values, the enduring beliefs and principles that
guide actions and shared by all, represent the wishes of the participants.

119

Limitations
Creating Public Value
In using Creating Public Value as a basis for a values framework with which to identify and
examines values in the library funding discourse, two key limitations are evident: 1) the participants in the
discourse were an unrepresentative sample of primarily Miami-Dade residents, an admitted shortcoming
that limits understanding what the community as whole values; and, 2), values created by libraries as
public organizations are not only represented by use of these organizations. As Moore (2013) indicates in
his example of the New York City Police Department, people who call the police get much more value
than what their portion of taxes paid for. However, this equation assumes that there should be a direct
relationship between what one pays in taxes and the services one receives in return. This type of
calculation does not account for the latent outcomes of police presence in a community, such a crime
deterrence as a result of police presence, quiet neighborhoods or the feeling of safety and security.
Operationalizing values is a context dependent and time consuming exercise. However, this
process is transferrable as the public sector values were operationalized using the Miami-Dade strategic
plan, a tool in common use in most American public governance. Most libraries can be assigned to library
types and as such, have professional organizations with codified values or mission statements that could
serve as a basis for providing consistent metrics, like the American Library Association values used in this
study.

Quality of Data
In March 2015, Facebook changed its policy, removing a variety of inactive accounts on group
pages with the result that “like” counts would decrease (Facebook, 2015). For group pages that often
function as small business web presence, the decrease in “like” counts may reflect on the business’
marketing profile. This is just one example of the constraints of data integrity when using social media
sites for data collection. Some of the posts that were captured for this study in December 2014 when the
data were collected from the Facebook page using Nvivo have since disappeared and thus, are no longer
visible on the SMDPL Facebook page. For research purposes, this precludes the possibility that research
on the same dataset could be replicated.
Using a computer assisted qualitative data analysis (CAQDAS) like Nvivo10 provided a tool that
was able to easily capture the Facebook page before the removal of relevant inactive accounts but that
does not mean that individuals did not remove their own posts prior to this collection. Therefore, the
sample collected is not claimed to be the entirety of the discourse that occurred during this time period.
By using Nvivo10, I was able to easily download the data but because Facebook participants do
not always populate the personal profile fields that Nvivo10 collects from the site complicated the ability to
retrieve participant role information, limiting my ability to make conclusive findings about participant roles.

120

Reporting cluster analysis, used to report correlations in Nvivo10, is also limited as one cannot select
distinct roles that included both the manually assigned roles along with the Nvivo assignments.
Other limitations to this study included the difficulty in obtaining public official surveys. After the
first four weeks of survey distribution, I sought out help from the director of communication for the Florida
Association of Counties. She advised that I call the officials, speak to their aides, and be persistent. She
also said that the county officials whom she surveys only respond at a rate of about 20% (Mosteller
phone conversation, 2015). For this study, I was only able to obtain four public official surveys, based on
their online self-identification or their being willing to answer the survey questions by telephone.
Finally, I have not found any other instances of CPV used as a framework to understand and
examine what the public values about public libraries and therefore, this particular framework has no
comparison with which to examine its validity.

Recommendations for Future Research
The influence of social network discourse on policy maker decision making.
While interviewing one Miami municipal mayor, it was suggested that the campaign had no
impact on the ultimate decision to re-appropriate the necessary funds for maintaining the library system
and its employees at the status quo. This municipal mayor suggested that the intent of the county public
officials was to raise alarm about impending hardships because of a resistance to tax increases by
segments of the community and then to appear as if they were coming to the rescue in order to appear
concerned about citizen needs in an election year.
Anecdotes such as this are hard to verify. What is clear is that a range of politics and political
ideologies were exhibited in the discourse and inform the decisions made on behalf of the community by
public officials, librarians, professional advocates and mainstream media alike. Future research on
multiple social network campaigns for library funding advocacy using this same framework that include
greater online participation by more public officials and a fully identified group of participants would reveal
more important findings about the influence of library advocacy discourse on the policymaking of public
officials. This would help answer questions like 1) what advocacy messages influenced the outcome of
policymakers’ decision making? And, 2) how can advocacy be more consistent and effective within the
policymaking priorities?
It would also be instructive to see how other communities express what is valued in their public
libraries; Miami is a diverse community that experienced recent, severe economic hardship as a result of
the 2008 recession, a period that saw homes lose 48% of their value in one year (Florida TaxWatch,
2009) with 184,000 people unemployed in October, 2008 alone (Zumbrun, 2008). Many American
communities suffered varying degrees of hardship and the impact of reduced local funding of public
libraries could be compared using the same framework but also looking more closely at the context of
each community. As Moore (2013) indicates, social outcomes are the result of aggregate factors that go

121

beyond the social elements and include partisan politics and political ideologies, dimensions that
influence funding outcomes and contribute to funding advocacy discourse.
Further, research should focus on the expression of public library values in terms of the
understanding of the virtual services and resources afforded by public libraries. Based on physical visits
library use has increased 17.6% over the last ten years, but has not regained the peak experienced in
2009 (Institute of Museum & Library Services [IMLS], 2016). In large part, this is attributable to the
increasing use of library virtual resources and a transference of usage from book circulation to program
attendance. Programming is targeted at the growing United States population of children, increasing
28.6% since fiscal year 2006 (IMLS, 2016).

Library professionals’ advocacy anxiety.
Studies of information anxiety for librarians range from examinations of rapid technological
change that impacts both library organizational life and librarian technical expertise (Kupersmith, 1992);
research of the need for librarians to adapt reference services to accommodate the growing body of
information that contributes to the feeling of information overload (Hopkins, 1995); a large body of
literature on the demand for librarians to meet the information literacy needs of users (Butler & Veldof,
2002; Starkey, 2010); personality attributes and learning facilitators influence on technology adoption
(Aharoney, 2009) and, the librarian as information overload specialist, tasked with diagnosing, codifying
and relieving the symptoms of a modern disease as information anxiety (Eklof, 2013). Simply in providing
information seeking and literacy skills, librarians are challenged by a dynamic information ecosystem.
Further, current tasks demand that librarian fill the role of social equity facilitator and human rights
advocate, especially given the focus on access (Jaeger, Taylor & Gorham, 2015). And as public sector
agents themselves, librarians would are held to the standards imposed on public agencies that include
not just efficiency and effectiveness of operations but ensuring just and fair access (Moore, 2013).
Given the demands of a politically charged atmosphere that is shaped both by public officials,
their own workplace administrators and the larger social justice mandate, I would suggest that future
research on librarian advocacy anxiety is indicated as library advocates are faced with demonstrating
value, equity, inclusion, information competency as well as financial and value accountability. As the CPV
model has demonstrated, creating public value requires the Deliberation sphere to continually confirm
what a community values, and yet it is not always a clear and permissible process in which librarians are
able to participate. Research questions could include:
•

In what ways does the library professional experience advocacy anxiety?

•

How does the image of the library professional contribute to advocacy anxiety?

•

Does the library professional’s self-image contribute to the public library values held?

•

In what ways could LIS education better prepare librarians for this demand?

122

Library professionals expressed a concern about violating library policies that constrain public comment
on library operations but they also commented on the lack of respect and understanding of the range of
skills and tasks demanded of them (4 August 2013, Facebook post). This research would then contribute
to the needed library professional curricula so lacking in LIS education (Hussey & Velasquez, 2011).

Sentiment analysis of effective library advocacy messages.
When public officials finally engaged with participants of the Facebook page discourse, it was in
response to inflammatory rhetoric or inflammatory misinformation. Research on the engagement of public
officials and other stakeholders could examine the effect size of sentiment values discerned in social
media messages. This would contribute to the advocacy curriculum in LIS education as well as to the
professional association advocacy efforts in state library association lobbying efforts.
Situational factors in community advocacy efforts.
Transferring this study’s method and codebook to other contexts to examine other types of
advocacy efforts or other types of communities engaged in library funding advocacy requires an
assessment of the situational factors embedded in each. For instance, Miami-Dade County experienced
severe tax revenue and intergovernmental aid deterioration, reporting their lowest revenue totals of the
six-year period that ended in 2012 (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2014). Florida’s public libraries rely on the
local tax base for 96% of their funding (Florida Division of Library and Information Services, 2015).
Therefore, the county’s public officials were under extreme fiscal challenges and the county public
libraries suffered. Further, Miami-Dade County comprises an incorporated metropolitan area served by
both the county library systems and a variety of municipal library systems. Several of the municipal
mayors expressed frustration at the idea that their municipal libraries would have to serve a greater
service area without increased funding. Therefore, situational factors include economic factors that
impact the local funding base and the nature of the county’s library service area demarcation.
Examining situational factors is also inherent in the process of refining the values/policymaking
codebook, establishing it as a transferrable instrument for understanding how and what a community
values about its libraries. For instance, I used the the Miami-Dade County strategic plan to operationalize
the public sector values, thereby using the County’s own articulated values with which to assess the
values expressed by participants about the public sector. Values would also change based on the
professional organization informing the type of library or community institution in the study. As the
profession evolves, these criteria would evolve as well.
Future research should focus on the diverse digital platforms used in social network advocacy
and the development of networked publics. Govtech.com publishes weekly on the use of technology in
state and local government, with many recent articles on the use of social media by government agencies
(Dalton, 2015). Key areas that are identified for development include social media management best

123

practices, social media policies that include (and currently exclude) elected officials and constant
attention to new platforms, with a view toward broad concepts for practices and policies that are not made
obsolete by changing platforms.
Steps made to improve social network practices and broaden social media policies will need to
include strategies for all participants to navigate the ethical and professional responsibilities as they strive
to effectively advocate. Different governmental contexts, types of local library funding and labor
agreements are just some of the other situational factors that can be used to operationalize values in
using the Creating Public Value model to examine diverse communities.

Implications of the Study
Using Social Media As An Interactive Platform For Policymaking
Public officials’ use of social media.
The example set by the Save the Miami Dade Public Libraries Facebook group page supports
boyd’s (2010) notion that publics exist in both space and as collectives – meaning that the discourse
created as a result of the library funding advocacy spanned social network sites that included social
media, weblogs, Internet sites for organizations with physical entities (e.g., Friends of the Miami Dade
Public Library, the Miami Herald, Huffington Post) and sites that only occupied a virtual space like the
Facebook page and EveryLibrary.org. Participants from as far away as New York City, Chicago, Illinois
and Tallahassee, Florida posted comments or otherwise shared information on the Facebook site.
Further, a great deal of information was shared that was not original to the Facebook site but was born
externally, such as the public meeting minutes, policy memos, mainstream media stories and photos of
rallies held in various Miami Dade library buildings. Certainly, as a networked public, the engagement
grew as the information sharing platforms multiplied.
The implication of the discourse on the SMDPL Facebook page as a networked public for public
sector officials poses both challenges and opportunities: as Mosteller (email correspondence 2013)
indicated, while federal agencies’ use of social media and online communications has a comprehensive
portal for citizen participation and guidance for federal officials (Mergel, 2013), state agencies and local
governments including municipalities and counties, operate with their own administrative guides. This is
evidenced by the continuing lack of administrative policy concerning the use of social network sites by
Miami Dade public officials: in April 2012, a resolution was drafted and presented to the county
commissioners directing the mayor or his designee to draft a policy for the county. However, this
resolution was withdrawn one month later and has not been renewed. If local governance agencies are to
take advantage of an obviously willing public to deliberate in an online forum, then will need to understand
the potential disadvantages that include:
•

Immediate publication of unedited comments and photos that can lead to communication that
is not well crafted or is inflammatory (e.g., Commissioner Soto’s comment to a library rally

124

attendee suggesting that he was only concerned for his library job [3 August, 2013, 12:15
p.m., Facebook post]);
•

Posts shared out of contexts that can distort their original intent; and

•

Is time intensive and requires timely management that builds relationships and creates a
responsive reputation.

Advantages however, were evidenced in this study as Miami-Dade memoranda from the County
Mayor and Commissioners were cited, linked to and excerpted, giving broad coverage to texts that often
are not widely circulated among citizens in spite of their public availability. Further, as Mayor Gimenez
noted in a public memorandum from August 2013, concern for library closings emerged as an important
topic and eventually led to the creation of the Blue Ribbon Task Force for the Miami-Dade Public Library
System (Price, 2013). A comprehensive policy and best practices training coupled with communications
personnel who possess social media expertise and a mandate to manage the many platforms for local
agencies is indicated for a county the size and diversity of Miami-Dade County.

Library workers’ use of social media.
Participants included citizens employed as public librarians and library workers who felt
intimidated by administrative policies preventing them from speaking about the issues facing the libraries
that may be closing and the librarians who would be unemployed as a result. Social network sites like the
SMDPL Facebook page are a ‘location’ for kindred advocates to gather and share information and voice
their concerns. As indicated in an ad-hoc interview with one of the librarian participants in 2015, she
indicated that the library has a written social media use policy but an informal policy about librarians
speaking in public about library funding or criticizing county government (phone conversation with
Facebook participant and MDPLS librarian, November 2015). This is an example of what Mosteller
described as a unit of government (the library as a unit of county government) creating its own policies to
fill the void of a countywide policy.
The Miami Dade library funding advocacy possessed what boyd (2010) further described as the
nature of networked publics: possessing invisible audiences (over 6000 Facebook followers); collapsed
contexts that exist without physical boundaries (the online petition from Change.org); and, the blurred,
public and private boundaries (librarians who felt like that library policies prevented them from speaking
with mainstream media journalists but shared videos with those making their requests online). As social
media enables citizens of all types to share information and opinions about their community governance,
clear guidelines are needed that both guide acceptable use and yet protect the right of expression of
those working in the public sector.

125

Strategies for successful social media campaigns.
The experience of the SMDPL Facebook campaign is instructive for future campaigns conducted
by library advocates and experienced by public officials. This study supports the practical strategies
espoused by GovTech.com, especially for public officials who may resist engaging with those conducting
advocacy using social media (Dalton, 2015). Once the Miami-Dade County officials engaged with
SMDPL administrators and several of the more high profile advocates, the discourse became more
productive, resulting in the creation of the Blue Ribbon Task Force, the removal of inaccurate Facebook
posts and several in-person meetings. Established social media best practices include a consistent,
positive relationship; transparent social media policies; proactive approaches to engagement that include
expansive and responsive social media policies (Dalton, 2015).
Policymaking using social network sites.
It is clear that social network sites provided many and diverse platforms for individuals to come
together and share information. It is also shown that policymaking elements can be found in the
messages shared and that public officials demonstrated the use of agenda-setting in particular, much
more frequently. As Kingdon found, an idea is not important for where it came from but for what made it
take root and grow (2003). Further, Kingdon’s work suggested that increasingly, non-governmental
agencies and individuals seek ways to transfer a “systemic agenda to a governmental, ‘formal’ agenda
(2003, p. 16) either through a galvanized, relevant public or through the dissemination of ideas. In the
case of the Save the Miami Dade Public Libraries, both the way that the issue came to the forefront of the
public agenda and the way the Facebook page was able to define the problem (Kingdon, 2003), are
examples of how agenda-setting can be set for networked publics. However, the study shows that
consistent use of the policymaking element of agenda-setting is practiced by public officials and may be
an area of improvement for library advocates.
The use of the Facebook page as a platform upon which to build a social network, as Moore
phrases, a networked public, was in this case successful as a broadcast channel with very specific
information about public meetings, library rallies and portals for easy access to public official memoranda;
and as a forum for participants to share a range of sentiments about libraries, public official behavior and
community needs.
From the policymaking conceptualization, participants shared their view of the problems and
offered solutions, but with the exception of the Facebook page administrators, participants were not adept
at using the page neither for agenda-setting nor for building any kind of consensus. To do the latter would
mean that participants would have to acknowledge that public officials have a legitimate concern in
exercising budgetary constraints and that they have other constituent concerns to satisfy. In view of how
vitriolic some postings were, it is not surprising that public official participation was limited to postings of
secondary discourse.

126

However, it was clear that public officials took note of the social media site, as the Facebook
administrators were contacted by the County Mayor’s office when misinformation about the relocation of
valuable portions of the County Library collection was shared. This inaccurate information focused
criticism on public officials as the local mainstream media (Miami Herald) featured a story about it and
cited the social media page as a source for these allegations (Mazzei, 2013). Further, in spite of
encouragement by the state’s professional library organization to maintain a positive tone to messages
and be nice (Parker, 2015), public officials in this situation only responded to misinformation (as in the
Miami Herald report) or to hyperbolic messages, as in the July 25 Twitter conversation several
participants had with a County commissioner. In this case, participants compared the library closings to
librarians being burned and a commissioner responded that they were being “dramatic”. This exchange
was then posted to the SMDPL Facebook page for this online community to see.
The implications of using a dynamic media like Facebook, in which all types of communications
are shared and consumed, means that there are lessons for all stakeholders. The public officials were put
on the defense and every communication was broadcast to the large group of advocates following the
page; library administrators would be naïve to think that this is an isolated incident and could begin to
develop more realistic advocacy policies and training for library workers, who evidenced a great deal of
anxiety about what they could say and where they could say it; for library workers, the SMDPL Facebook
campaign is an example of the transference of offline social capital, their existing relationships, that
converged around a single mission and successfully reversed an unpopular policy. Future social media
campaign managers can learn from the need for vigilance against inaccurate or misleading posts, guide
the discourse with timely posts and messages structured with policymakers in mind. Building messages
with all of the policymaking elements may improve the message’s receipt by key stakeholders.

The Public Library Advocacy Message
If, as Prentice (1996) suggests, that policymakers are sending a message about the
underperformance of public libraries by defunding or decreasing funding, then library advocates need to
seek ways to both quantify and capture elements of library services and resources that resonate with
community leaders. By demonstrating the ability to disrupt and “alter the existing landscape” (Gleick,
2011, p. 411), library advocates position their messages to appeal to the concerns of community leaders
to maintain innovative advantages such as the high-speed Internet connections so often provided by
libraries in low income communities.
As John Chrastka from the online library advocacy organization, EveryLibrary.org implored at the
recent Florida Library Association Conference in a presentation entitled, The Librarian as Candidate,
librarians can behave as advocates for 364 days out of the year, but for that one day, when their public
officials are voting on library budgets, they must function as lobbyists (Daytona Beach, FL, 2016). This
echoes the refrain from Jaeger, et al., who describe a profession, confusing its role of neutrality in

127

information provision with its right and need to advocate, not just educate, for the libraries in which they
serve (2014).
Further, the polemical rhetoric that is exchanged between library professionals and their public
official funders obscures the fact that in most cases, they are all public servants with similar missions. As
this study has revealed, those missions conflict because they don’t always share the same values and
don’t always express them effectively. As social network sites are increasingly used to demonstrate what
the public wants in libraries, the values expressed in the messages needs to be convincing,
comprehensive and mindful of the diverse audience to whom it must appeal.
The Facebook page was phenomenal in its explosive growth; the variety of posts accompanied
by external links and offline discursive artifacts expanded the breadth of the perspectives that exceeded
the boundaries of the online public and reached into the community’s offline discourse. In lieu of direct
contact with public officials, librarians used the Facebook page to express frustration over perceived
budget mismanagement, disappointment at the perceived lack of respect for their profession and anger
over their lack of involvement and participation as members of the Miami-Dade community. This
exemplifies the ambivalence with which librarians perceive their abilities to be their own advocates.
As Jaeger, et al. (2014) suggest, this ambivalence often results in heartfelt sentiment about the
intrinsic value of libraries but with little real evidence that the library exacts real outcomes. Librarians
continue to advocate with few details, missing opportunities to demonstrate the impact of library
programs, continuing education, access to social services and a wide array of technology literacy training
found to be highly valued in national studies (Hoffman, Bertot, & Davis, 2012; Horrigan, 2015). As
evidenced in the abundance of universal values shared but comparatively few public library values
shared, libraries still require growth in values and impact assessment. This growth has its place not only
in the mission of the professional organizations like ALA and the state library organization, the Florida
Library Association, but advocacy training needs to occur in more than just a handful of American library
and information science curricula (Hussey & Velasquez, 2011). Library advocates need more than
admonitions to remain nice but also need to embrace the idea that measures of library values can inform
decision-making and help demonstrate impact to public officials whose stakeholders are broader than the
pool of library users.

Key social media strategies for library advocates.
This study has also resulted in several key strategies that appear to guide successful social
media campaigns for library funding advocacy:
1. Establish accountability to several individuals who will administrate and facilitate a prolific
discourse, supporting the diffusion of accurate information and structuring messages with
good policymaking fundamentals, using the agenda-setting, problem definition, solution
creation and consensus building attributes demonstrated by policymakers;

128

2. Maintain relationships for the long term that can become social capital that is drawn on when
a budget crisis occurs;
3. Establish social media goals that support the purpose articulated by library strategic plans or
mission statements;
4. Build in an assessment component to examine whether messages match the values inherent
in the desired goals;
5. Ensure mechanisms for vigilance are employed: use social media tools that allow scheduled
messages; use platform features that allow moderation functions; confront or disarm
erroneous messages;
6. Identify situational factors that can influence the discourse such as strong, local media or
governance issues like Miami-Dade County exhibited with the impact the outcomes of closing
county libraries could have on the local municipal libraries;
7. Fact-check information posted – defuse inflammatory situations by posting accurate
responses, by contacting the original participant and encouraging he/she to revise, or by
removing the post altogether.

Summary and Conclusion
In this study, I examined the Facebook page, Save the Miami-Dade Public Libraries, a social
media site that became a nexus for a diverse group of stakeholders, to explore what the discourse
revealed about how a particular community viewed its public libraries. The findings indicate that the
participants who expressed themselves in this forum, were actually less articulate about what the libraries
actually do and more specific about their role in the public sector, how the public officials should value
them, and how intrinsically tied to the universal values as defined in this study as enduring, guiding
principles. For communities to create public value, the need exists for a mechanism by which to articulate
the values that guide the actions of community governance officials and direct them to the actions desired
by the public. Creating Public Value offers a structure for public officials in government agencies that
initiate concepts, as often, there is not political accord, appropriate or clear metrics and no evident way to
use data for decision-making (Moore, 2013).
I began this study asking other librarians, information studies scholars and library advocates a
simple but inflammatory question: If a community decides it does not want to fund a library, then should it
not be able to dispense with the institution? If, as the County Mayor of Miami-Dade County suggested,
the era of libraries is ending and he was making the decisions he claimed were based on the wishes of
the Miami-Dade citizens, then in spite of the opposition raised to his retiring an incredibly revered
institution, he was fulfilling his agency’s mission to deliver effective and efficient government. However,
the outcome he promised came at the price of giving up a publicly valued institution that many in MiamiDade County were not willing to let go. In this instance, the price was either too high or was the wrong
expense and the community did not accept it. An implication of this study and of the Creating Public

129

Value model is that most public libraries exist in the larger public sector ecosystem – using an
operationalized value approach and examining what people say about their needs from and desires of
their public sector institutions helps bridge the gap that often emerges in a local funding dispute.
But the lesson for advocates is clear: public library values are disguised or obscured in the
discourse. One Miami-Dade County librarian I spoke to recently told me that she had not spent much time
paying attention to the social media page or to any kind of advocacy because the funding had increased
in Miami-Dade County. This is a dangerous position to take. The March 2016 IMLS report, Public
Libraries in the United States Survey, Fiscal Year 2013, demonstrates that funding still lags behind prerecession levels, circulation and visitations are down, but virtual visits/use and circulation are not largely
accounted for. Library advocates must find ways to demonstrate, not just that information can be found
on the Internet, but they have to show how it reliably gets there. This study only looked at the
Deliberation sphere of Moore’s Strategic Triangle but clearly, the findings from the discourse resulted in
both Operational Capacity (stable and increasing funding) and participation for library advocates in the
Legitimation sphere (Blue Ribbon Task Force). The networked public that evolved from the creation of
the Facebook page, Save the Miami-Dade Public Libraries, demonstrated “the vital substitute for
hierarchical authority in creating accountability and ensuring effective and efficient cooperation” (Moore,
2013, p. 17). But they have to maintain their social network presence and identify ways to improve their
public library value expressions.

APPENDIX A
DEFINITION OF TERMS
Advocacy as a form of information sharing is the process of educating and influencing decision
makers and the public to support causes of all types. Advocacy efforts may focus on influencing
public opinion, sparking legislative action and identifying the needs of communities; often these
targets are interrelated and interdependent (Hoover, 2012);
Agenda-setting can be considered the “collection of issues which are given attention at any given
time” (McCarthy, Smith, & Zald, 1996, p. 293) is the means by which specific issues gain prominence
(Zahariadis, 2003) and are considered those which hold the greatest promise for key stakeholders ”
(Bryson, 2001, p. 381);
Consensus defined as high quality agreements that produce “mutual-gain solutions” (Innes &
Booher, 1999 p. 11);
Consensus building is the process that includes a dynamic group discussion among a diverse
collection of stakeholders that produces innovative ideas and “feasible strategies to deal with
uncertain, complex, and
Information sharing via participatory networks, providing an opportunity to examine information
sharing and conversations in public spheres, with a focus on the creation of public value;
Interactive framing can be defined as “how people construct meaning from moment to moment”
(Ribeiro, 2006, p. 48) describing “the resource orientations of participants” (p. 50) as they attempt to
appropriate the meanings in the thread exchange to establish meaning that is in dispute as part of the
library-funding advocacy.
Networked publics function as a subset of the participatory collective networks, an online version
of other types of publics that offer individuals ways to gather, collaborate, and connect for various
purposes such as social, cultural, civic and advocacy (boyd, 2010);
Problem definition is the process of describing a condition that identifies “parameters for
discussion and lends legitimacy to an issue” (Weissert & Weissert, p. 296) that begs a solution. In the
public sector, this solution must be something that the government is capable of providing;
Public library values include library contributions to the public realm through the generation of
library-based activities based on the core values of librarianship of the American Library Association
that include: individual empowerment; literacy and lifelong literacy support; support that strengthens
families; the equalization of resources; community building; the protection of an individual’s right to
know; activities that strengthen the nation; advanced research; support for individuals to share and
understand diversity; and preservation of our cultural heritage (American Library Association, 2004;
Fleischman, 2014);

131

Public sector is a sphere of activities and resources that are available to all in a community of
interest, local or global, virtual or physical, and that serves as an authorizing environment for policy
making. “The public is made up of individuals – individual citizens, voters, and taxpayers – and of
collective bodies and institutions such as the voting constituencies of elected public executives, the
legislatures elected to guide and oversee the government’s executive branch, the courts responsible
for protecting the rights of individuals, and those who influence the actions and decisions of these
institutions (such as interest groups and the media)” Moore, p. 36, 2013);
Public sector communication, including policy-making and administration;
Public sector information sharing can be defined as the exchange of words, ideas, and concepts
that not only “convey meanings that can characterize and define the cultural life of a society”
(Williams, 1983, as cited in Raber, 2003, p. 7) but also create state authority to deliver public value;
Public sector values add value to the public realm through the generation of economic, social,
cultural, political, and environmental activity that results in products and services tailor-made to satisfy
unmet human needs. (Benington, 2011). These values are mission and agency specific, internal and
subjective;
Public value is the manifestation of the “desires and perceptions of individuals” (Moore, 1995, p.
52) as those things desired by individuals but unavailable due to market failure; and, belonging to the
realm of those activities conducted and resources provided for the whole of the public sector. Public
value contributes “to the public good” or uses public monies to “pursue a purpose that has been
authorized by the citizens and representative government” (Moore, 1995, p. 53). Examples of public
value include public sector education, public libraries, and municipal safety and services, all of which
are in part or in whole, created by and for with funding from public sources and governed in part by
public policy or management. Universal, public sector and public library values can be considered the
individual units in the collective of public value; other members of this collective include the products
of the legitimation and implementation processes in the Yang’s CPV model in Figure 1;
Semantic framing includes an analysis of language at the levels of meaning, which includes the
“meanings of words, utterances (e.g., speech acts) and larger functional units (Herring, 2004, p. 3) –
in terms of this study, the interaction is analyzed using the framing of public values identified by the
semantic codebook;
Solutions are the “ideas that possess technical feasibility and values acceptability according to
policymakers (Kingdon, as cited by Zahariadis, p. 76); controversial planning and policy tasks” (Innes
& Booher, 1999, CAS, p. 412);
Universal values can be considered “enduring beliefs that influence the choices we make among
available means or ends” (Rokeach, 1973, p. 5);

Using Social Networks For Library Funding Advocacy: A
Discourse Analysis of the Save the Miami-Dade Public Libraries
Facebook Campaign
On July 17, 2013, a budget was proposed that would close 22 libraries throughout Miami-Dade
County, with layoffs for over 400 county employees. In response, two Florida graduate students created
the Save the Miami-Dade Public Libraries (SMDPL) Facebook page The final vote in September 2013
resulted in the use of reserve county funds to maintain existing levels of service and staffing at all 49
locations in Miami-Dade County.
This study examines how social media was used in the Miami-Dade Public Library Service budget
process in a citizen effort to influence officials and public policy decisions.

Universal
Values

Problem Definition

PD

The process of identifying a condition in a
community or the environment that is wrong.
The process defines “parameters for
discussion"(Weissert & Weissert, p. 296),
asserts that the condition is a legitimate societal
concern and that it deserves a solution. This
solution must be something that the
government is capable of providing.

1-The condition is urgent and requires fast
action;(have to act now)
2-The condition is widespread;(concerns all
citizens or the entire county)
3-Identifying the context of a problem (facts
relating to a problem situation);
4-Naming a problem or conflict ('the problem
is...')

Agenda-setting

AS

Agenda-setting can be considered a listing of
issues, which are given attention at any given
time (McCarthy, Smith, & Zald, 1996, p. 293). In
this instance, agenda-setting is a list of issues
that participants list, in an order in which they
need to be addressed that is based on the
prominence of the condition.

1-Agenda items are those items that
participants state should be addressed;
2-Identifies an order in which problems should
be solved.

Characterized by any of the following
behaviors that are:
1-honesty vs. dishonesty
2-fair vs. unfair
3-transparent vs. deceptive
4-respect vs. disrespect
5-right vs. wrong
6-moral vs. immoral
7- legal vs. illegal
8- good vs. evil
