Dedications
To my father Anthony Nizich who created in me an unquenchable thirst for knowledge
and understanding of the world. Your constant teachings, life views, discipline, and respect for
education are what made this achievement possible. In an otherwise regretless life, I have but
only one; that you were not here to share in this moment with me….perhaps you were. I miss
you dearly Dad.
To my mother Anne Nizich who taught us through example that we were more than we
thought we were, that any adversity can be overcome, and that our only limitations were the ones
we placed on ourselves. In 1979 you lovingly taught me to walk with my head high and always
look straight ahead. I have never looked down since. Thank you for everything Mom.
To my wife and soul mate Cara, an achievement like this is neither accomplished nor
celebrated alone. Without your love, support, and motivation throughout the years, none of this
would have been possible. Your belief in me had many times surpassed my own and for that, and
all else, I am eternally grateful to you. Thank you for all that you are and all that you’ve done. I
love you.
To my children Thomas and Grace, of all the lessons I may teach you in life, most of
them can be learned from this dissertation. They include respect, passion, spirituality,
commitment, motivation, self confidence, and occasional humility. I pray that in life you each
acquire these attributes in your own way, and in your own time. I love you both.
To Rose and Tom Grace, of all the words contained in this document there is not one that
can adequately convey my gratitude and appreciation for the help and support you provided to us
during this journey. My appreciation for your love and presence in our family’s lives can neither
be adequately quantified nor expressed. I will simply say thank you to you both.
To my siblings Maryann, Greg, Gerard, Barbara, and Matthew. To be part of a family
means sharing in all facets of life whatever they may be. I am so very happy to be able to share
this achievement with all of you as you are all such a big part of who I am today. Thank you for
all of your love, help, guidance, and thoughtfulness throughout our lives together.

Abstract
This study explores the information validation process of police investigators. The
purpose of the research was to create a formal process model of the information validation
process of a group of professional investigators. In this study I argue that the existence of such a
model will help researchers in various disciplines by providing a baseline to which the validation
process of other groups of information seekers can be tested and compared.
The study subjects consisted of 45 police investigators and data was collected using 4 distinct
methods including semi-structured interviews, talk aloud sessions, a controlled experiment, and a
Joint Application Design (JAD) session. The research culminated in a new process model of the
information validation process of police investigators. The study also provides a new research
framework for the future study of information validation processes of various groups of
information seekers.
Several new discoveries emerging from the study include, but are not limited to, the
findings that when validating new information, police investigator’s consider disparities between
the behavioral, physical, visual, evidentiary, and potentially audible forms of information
surrounding the information source and the investigator’s own personal knowledge base and
experiential database. Other discoveries were that police investigators use their knowledge base
and experiential database to create a virtual descriptive scenario or pre-disposition of what they
expect to find before the validation process begins. They then use an abductive process through a
questioning and information exchange process to test the details of their own scenario moving
towards the best possible explanation of their observation.
In summary the study provides a new model of information validation illustrating the
entities, processes, and decisions that comprise the process as well as the relationships, interix

dependencies, and constraints that govern it. Using professional investigators as study subjects
provides merit to the model as a baseline or foundation to which we can now begin to study and
compare the information validation process of other information seekers to the new model.

CHAPTER 1. Overview
1.1 Introduction
This study explores the information validation process of police investigators. I propose
in the study that the validation process is governed by the investigator’s sense of disparity
between a subject’s verbal statement and other forms of information surrounding the subject
including behavioral, physical, visual, auditory, and evidentiary information. Understanding and
modeling this process should improve researchers understanding of the information validation
process of police investigators and information seekers in general.
The study consisted of a two phase research design including a data collection phase and
a model design phase. The purpose of the research was to create a baseline process model of the
information validation process of a group of professional investigators. Additionally, this study
and its findings provide an empirical framework for using the new model to test and evaluate the
information validation process of other groups of information seekers. The 45 subjects for this
study were police investigators as operationally defined and consisted of 15 interview subjects,
25 experiment subjects assessing the subject’s evaluation of disparity, and 4 Joint Application
Design participants whose focus was on designing a series of model prototypes. There was also a
single subject who participated in the pre-testing portion of the study.
The existence of such a model and empirical framework will help researchers in various
disciplines by providing a baseline to which the validation process of other groups of information
seekers can be tested and compared. Models are a tentative ideational structure that can be used
as a testing device (Fisher, Erdelez, and McKechnie 2005 p. 3). The model also provides an
empirical structure and method for testing and evaluating the information validation process of
various groups of information seekers. The empirical framework included in this dissertation that
1

evolved as a direct result of this study includes the specific combination of methods used in the
study, the survey instrument for the study, the coding instrument for the study, the scenario based
experiment design, and the use of JAD techniques to acquire expert knowledge from research
subjects.
The existence of this new tool will help researchers in various disciplines to understand if
one group of information seekers validates information in the same way as a group of
professional investigators. As an example, the new model and associated framework allows
researchers to compare the information validation process of health information seekers or civil
rights information seekers against the representative model. The results of the study and the
existence of such a model are significant because the ability to understand the similarities or
differences between various groups of information seekers important. Using the model for
comparison may help adjust and modify the delivery systems of important information to more
effectively deliver quality information to information seekers. The new model may also be used
to assist in the design of new training programs, procedures, and materials that will help teach
information seekers in various disciplines how to more efficiently and effectively validate
information as it is presented to them.
Obtaining an understanding of the information validation process of a group of
professional investigators and ultimately moving towards a general understanding and theory of
the information validation process, will help information providers more clearly understand the
reasoning why a user would trust their information or not. There are essentially three areas that
benefit from the findings of this study. The first benefit may be meaningful change in the way we
teach and train information seekers to validate information, the second may help in the design of
important information delivery systems, and third the findings of this study expand our current
2

knowledge and understanding of the validation process of information seekers.
Due to a steady increase in the abundance of information made available to us on a daily
basis from sources such as print, media, Internet and mobile devices, it is more important than
ever to validate information before using it in some fashion. It seems to be a fact that more and
more people are burdened by information overload, and it also seems to be a fact that there exists
more information than ever (Mai 2013, 675).
The necessity to validate new information that is presented to us from the outside world
is an inherent factor of our daily activities within society. Validating and weighing information
for accuracy and integrity as it is presented protects us from a variety of threats and
misrepresentations that can ultimately lead to mayhem and potentially dangerous and poorly
made decisions. For example, literature shows that if people are misled by inaccurate
information, it can cause serious harm to their finances (Fowler et al. 2001) and their health
(Kiley 2002).
Obtaining a better understanding of the information validation process is important for
us since more information is available to us, and in more forms, than ever before in human
history. Thus, people need to be able to distinguish the accurate information from the inaccurate
information and specifically Internet based information (Fallis 2004).
With a rapid increase in the abundance of information to which we are exposed through
print, television, radio, Internet, and mobile devices it becomes more important for us to validate
information as it comes to us rather than accept it at face value. The activities of information
validation become more difficult in the presence of information overload. Information overload
occurs when an individual has difficulty understanding an issue due to an overabundance of
information that prohibits effective decision making.
3

A number of contributing factors are related to information overload such as increased
communication, globalization, deregulation, downsizing, and technology (Waddington 1998;
Chan 2007).

The literature shows that there is an existing cache of knowledge in areas that

most likely play an integral role in the information validation process of police investigators
including information behavior (Belkin 1982; Dervin 1999; Kulthau 1991; Nahl 2007; Wilson
1981), general decision making (Simon 1963; Ranyard 1997), and police decision making
(Bennell 2005; Davis 2006; Mann and Vrij 2006; Dearstyne 2007; Bond 2013; Schafer 2006;
Worden 1990; Buerger 2010). This contributory knowledge however does not, either in part or as
aggregate, clearly or explicitly delineate the information validation process of police
investigators. Furthermore, there are various models and theories that help us understand the
needs and processes of information seekers in general (Wilson 1981; Kulthau 1991) but not
specifically the validation process of new information as it is received from various sources
during the seeking process.
Since there are myriad reasons, uses, functions, and utilizations for information,
validating information as we receive it has become a necessity in our information society
(Webster 2006). Understanding the various entities, processes, and decisions that comprise the
information validation process is of interest and importance to us as a discipline. One of the most
interesting ways to study this process is to study a group of professionals that validate
information as part of their job requirements and who may be more adept at the process than any
other single group. This study explores the information validation process of police investigators,
a group of professionals whose validation of new information plays a critical role in their work.
One profession that values the process of information validation at a very high
importance level is Public Safety. Four decades of social science research yield the conclusion
4

that human beings are unable to detect deception when it is present in communication at no
greater than chance success rates (Frank, Freeley, Paolantonio, Servoss 2004, 45). However,
professional police investigators regularly validate information as it becomes available to them
during their investigations ultimately leading to successful dispute resolution, case closures, and
solutions. This makes the understanding and modeling of their validation process of great interest
to the research community.
Police officers routinely make important decisions, many of which affect people’s lives.
On any given day, an officer might have to decide whether a suspect is being deceptive or not
(Taylor, Bennell, & Snook 2002). Police investigators receive large quantities of information in
varied forms and from varied sources during the process of an investigation. This information
can take the form of verbal statements from involved persons, physical appearance of
information sources, vocal intonations of sources, physical behaviors of sources, and evidentiary
or accreted information physically surrounding the information source (O’Hara 2003). This study
looks at the intricacies of the validation process of a police investigator and the relationships
between these forms of information and the roles they play.
The importance of understanding information validity and information quality evaluation
lies in the complete understanding of a person’s information seeking behaviors. These behaviors
govern and guide our current research path in the areas of information retrieval and information
access. The validation of information plays a role in a person’s information seeking behavior
(Wilson 1981; Chun 2010) and information seekers validate information as they encounter it
(Erdelez 1997). The literature demonstrates that there is a need to understand and measure this
process more effectively (Fallis 2004). It can also be derived from the literature that scientifically
comparing behavioral processes against known established models provides a useful tool for
5

identifying similarities and differences between various groups (Bergmann, Wilke, and
Shumacker 1997).
The literature shows that within the discipline of Information Science, models are a
successful way of understanding the complexities of information seeking behaviors and of
subcomponents of those behaviors (Wilson 1981; Wilson 1990; Kulthau 1991; Dervin 1999). It
shows us that a model can be viewed as a likeness of something and consists of symbols or
characteristics that represent some empirical phenomenon including the model’s components,
represented as logical arrangements of concepts. Additionally, a model helps us order and
simplify our view of reality by representing its essential characteristics in abstract form
(Franfort-Nachmius and Nachmius 2000). A model’s usefulness lies in its ability to accurately
predict the behavior of the executing process. Also, the usefulness of an executing process is
largely in its ability to fulfill the requirements embodied in a formal model of the process (Cooke
and Wolf 1999).
As this study called for the design of a new model representing the information validation
process of police investigators, a modeling language was needed that would be able to
adequately represent the complexities of such a process. Although there were several modeling
languages reviewed for this project including Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Business
Process Model and Notation (BPMN), the Integrated Definition for Process Description Capture
Method (IDEF3) language was ultimately selected for the model design. The basic reasoning for
this was because of the languages ability to capture the process descriptions of experts but a
more in depth explanation for the selection can be reviewed in the literature review section of
this study.
The IDEF series of languages originated as the Integrated Computer Aided
6

Manufacturing standards or ICAM created by the United States Air Force in the 1970’s. The
IDEF3 language was created specifically to capture detailed descriptions of sequences of
activities from process experts, a nuance either absent or generic from various other modeling
languages. The primary goal of IDEF3 is to provide a structured method by which a domain
expert can express knowledge about the operation of a particular system or organization. There
are several police investigator methods that play a part in this study. A method is an organized,
single-purpose discipline or practice (Coleman 1989) and is critical to this study due to the fact
that police investigators describe their specific processes and methods experienced during their
validation of new information.
An IDEF3 model enables a viewer to see the contributing factors and elements in a
process, the order in which they occur, and the relationships and interdependencies between
those elements in the context of the process being modeled. In general, the existence of the
IDEF3 model will allow future researchers to compare the information validation process of
health information seekers, as an example, to the specific elements of the new model for
comparison and evaluation purposes.
To demonstrate this principle, a sample of a general procedure or process has been
selected from the IDEF3 literature in order to show how the modeling of a complex process
creates an abstraction of that process. This abstraction can then be used in a number of ways
including training or instruction, system design, or simply to obtain a better understanding of the
process and its intricacies. In the IDEF3 model example in Figure 1 below the general process of
ordering materials is used to create a simple but detailed abstraction of the entities, processes,
sub processes, decisions, and interdependencies that comprise the specific process as a whole.

7

Figure 1: Example of a Process Schematic, Mayer et al. 1995, 14
To illustrate how a model abstraction can then be used to test, evaluate, and compare
similar processes from other groups, a similar sample based approach can be used to accomplish
this. For example in Figure 1 above, if a researcher wanted to better and more richly understand
how the ordering process of perishables compared to the existing documented process, the model
would provide a framework for the investigation to follow. This is because the contributing
factors and elements in the process, the order in which they occur if applicable, and the
relationships and interdependencies among them is clearly exhibited providing a conduit for
testing and comparison.
This is possible because IDEF3 captures the basic steps or processes including the
detailed descriptions of those processes. In this case a researcher could prepare a study using a
simple questionnaire designed around the sequential steps illustrated in the model and then very
accurately measure or compare the actions and activities of the information seeker being studied.
The implications of this are important to the discipline of Information Science because for this
study the existence of a model of information validation by a group of professional investigators
will allow future researchers to test, compare, and evaluate the validation process of other
8

information seekers leading us closer to a deeper understanding of the validation process of
information seekers in general. This study has three specific research goals including:


Identify the entities, processes, and decisions experienced by a police investigator during
the validation process and understand the relationships among them.



Document those entities, processes, and decisions in a structured and validated process
model using IDEF3 methodologies, language, and symbolism.



Establish a research framework and a set of methodologies for future researchers to
further understand the information validation process of various groups of information
seekers.
At the conclusion of this study all 3 specific goals were met in that the various entities,

processes, and decisions comprising the validation process of police investigators were
identified. Those components were documented in an IDEF3 process model design, and a set of
empirical guidelines and procedures were established for future researchers to use to further
enhance our understanding of the information validation process.
In summary, understanding the information validation process is important to the
discipline of Information Science as abundant information is available and presented to us from
multiple sources on a regular basis. Having a deeper understanding and model of the information
validation process of a group of investigative professionals provides the discipline with a
baseline from which to compare the validation process of other groups of information seekers.
Finally, the existence of the new process model which uses standard IDEF3 communications
language coupled with a set of established research methods provides researchers with a way to
use and apply the new model towards the understanding of the information validation process in
general.

1.2 Research problem
The absence of a structured process model detailing the validation process of new
information by a group of investigative professionals contributes to an incomplete understanding
of the validation process of information seekers in general and ultimately, a research void within
the discipline of Information Science. This study addresses the problem by answering the
following research questions.

1.3 Research questions
To adequately provide valuable research that contributes to a solution to the specific
research problem above, three essential research questions needed to be answered from this
research. The answers to these questions provided me with the specific information required to
construct the new model of information validation by police investigators. The three questions
that I sought to answer in this study were:
Q1:

What are the various entities, processes and decisions experienced by a police
investigator during the validation of new information received during an investigation?

Q2:

What are the relationships and interdependencies between these experienced entities,
decisions, and processes?

Q3:

Does a disparity between information contained in a person’s verbal statement and
the information originating from sources surrounding the person, lead a police
investigator to require additional information before considering a piece of
information valid?

10

1.3 Propositions
The results for this study with regard to the associated multiple propositions were that the
determination of validity for a single piece of new information by a police investigator does not
rely on, nor is solely determined by, the characteristics of that single piece of information but
relies on the absence of any disparities between that piece of information relative to the other
sources of information surrounding it. These propositions were formally and scientifically tested
in the disparity controlled experiment detailed in the methodology section of this study.
For example the verbal transmittal of the term “I am waiting to pick up my wife from
work” is only likely to be considered valid by a police investigator after the information was
evaluated in relation to the visual, auditory, physical, behavioral, and evidentiary information
surrounding the source of the initial statement. The methodology of this study was designed to
answer the three specific research questions of this study as well as to support or reject the
following multiple propositions which played an important role in the final design of the process
model:
P1:

A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement and a
person’s physical appearance will lead a police investigator to require additional
information in order to consider a piece of information valid.

P2:

A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement and a
person’s behavior will lead a police investigator to require additional information in
order to consider a piece of information valid.

P3:

A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement and the
physical evidence surrounding that person will lead a police investigator to require
additional information in order to consider a piece of information valid.
11

P4:

A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement and
auditory emanations surrounding that person will lead a police investigator to require
additional information in order to consider a piece of information valid.

P5:

A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement and the
visual emanations surrounding that person will lead a police investigator to require
additional information in order to consider a piece of information valid.

P6:

A lack of any disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement
and the visual, behavioral, audible, evidentiary or physical sources of information
surrounding that person will lead a police investigator to consider a piece of
information valid.

12

1.4 Operational definitions
For the purpose of this study the following operational definitions will apply to the
methods used towards the goal of adequately answering the associated research questions of the
study.
1.4.1 Audible information
Audible information is information communicated to the police investigator through
noise and audible vibrations. Examples of this information might be a cell phone ringing during
an initial investigation or a vehicle making a suspicious rattling noise. These are referred to in
the study as audible emanations.

1.4.2 Behavioral information
Behavioral information is information communicated in the form of physical actions and
reactions of a person while communicating data to the police investigator. Examples of this type
of information would be nervousness, sweating, stammering, or subtle paranoia.

1.4.3 Decision
A decision is any conclusion or resolution reached after consideration of alternative
possibilities.

1.4.4 Dependent
Dependent is anything that is decided or controlled by something else.

13

1.4.5 Disparity
A disparity is defined in this study by adapting Case’s definition (Case, 2007) of
Information. A disparity is any difference perceived in your environment or within yourself that
you notice in the pattern of reality. As an example if a school bus parked in front of a school is
plausible, then a school bus parked in front of tobacco shop is a disparity.

1.4.6 Entity
An entity is any person, place, event or object that may be included in the process.

1.4.7 Evidentiary information
Evidentiary information is information that is communicated to the police investigator
from the physical accretion or evidence surrounding the originator of the information. Examples
of this may be a security badge hanging in the front window of a car or tools in the back seat of a
car.

1.4.8 Form of information
A form of information, for the purpose of this study, is any information received by a
police investigator during the investigation from any of the declared study sources.

1.4.9 Information corroboration
Information corroboration is the receipt of the same information from other sources
either at the same time or at different times.

14

1.4.10 Information plausibility

Information plausibility is the likelihood of the information to be true based on various
situational attributes or characteristics. As an example a man stating that he is on his way to the
circus, when there is no circus in the area, would not be considered plausible for the purposes of
this study.

1.4.11 Information presentation
Information presentation is the manner or format in which information is presented
including yelling or whispering as examples.

1.4.12 Information source

An information source is any originating entity that projects information in the forms of
visual, audible, verbal, behavioral, evidentiary, or physical forms.

1.4.13 Information source authority
Information source authority is the appropriateness of the information source providing
the information. As an example a car mechanic speaking of engine trouble has the authority to do
so.

1.4.14 Information
Information is any difference you perceive in your environment or within yourself and is
any aspect that you notice in the pattern of reality.
15

1.4.15 Interdependence
Mutually dependent; depending on each other

1.4.16 Physical information
Physical information is information that is communicated to a police investigator from
the physical condition of a person, place, or thing. Examples of this might be a person wearing a
torn jump suit or a new vehicle with a dent in the front left fender.

1.4.17 Police investigation
A police investigation is any series of police activities that occur in sequence during any
period or length of time that pertain to a specific person or event of interest. In general these
activities are referred to as cases, events, or incidents and are recorded this way by the police
agency.

1.4.18 Police investigator
A police investigator is any current or former member of a law enforcement agency
located in the United States who has, during their tenure as law enforcement professional,
performed at least one hundred (100) police investigations.

1.4.19 Process
A process is any cognitive or physical set of activities performed by a police investigator
while attempting to validate information received from a source.

16

1.4.20 Relationship
A connection, association, or involvement

1.4.21 Validation
Validation is the process by which an individual determines that a single piece of
information provided to them from a particular source is either valid or invalid.

1.4.22 Verbal information
Verbal information is information that originates from a human source communicating
data to the police investigator. The catalyst for this information transfer can be from the person
but also from the person in response to a question or comment from the investigator.

1.4.23 Visual information
Visual information is information that is communicated to the investigator through any
visual means. This type of information can be a person walking past the investigator during the
information exchange or a sign on a building that can be seen by the investigator during the
information exchange. These are referred to in the study as visual emanations.

17

1.5 Limitations
This study was designed to identify the entities, processes, and decisions experienced by
a police investigator during their validation process of new information received during an
investigation and to establish a new process model using the IDEF3 modeling language. There
are several limitations to this study primarily that I was not specifically focused on the reasoning
or motivations from an emotional or psychological approach of why police investigators process
information in certain ways. These factors may be an interesting area of future research in the
cognitive science or related disciplines but is, at best, briefly discussed here from a purely
speculative and theoretical standpoint.
Other limitations to this study are the minimal number of subjects used in various
methodology components. The investigators used as subjects for the study can be considered a
small sample of the entire population of police investigators but cannot truly represent the
population in its entirety and would require future research to collect data from a much larger
portion of the population.

CHAPTER 2. Literature Review
2.1 Introduction
Conducting a literature review is a means of demonstrating an author’s knowledge about
a particular field of study, including vocabulary, theories, key variables, phenomenon and its
methods and history (Randolph 2009). This review and its design has been established by the
author to identify and convey to the reader the above parameters and components in an effort to
support and reinforce the research framework for this particular study.
During this review it was found, in general, that there is a limited body of empirical
literature available on the process of information validation and there was literally no literature
found with specific regards to modeling of the validation process of new information by a group
of professional police investigators. The existing knowledge identified through the literature
review provides supporting background for this study in areas like information quality,
information accuracy, general police processes, information seeking behavior, decision making,
and veracity judgment. The review includes separate distinct sections for philosophical and
historical backgrounds, closely related research, police process, information seeking behavior,
decision making, and process modeling.
This literature review shows that there is a healthy understanding and documentation of
the evaluation of information, the police investigative process, judgment of deceit and veracity,
the needs and drives of information seekers, and the processes governing general and police
decision making. There is however a large gap in the literature pertaining to the process of
information validation of information received from a particular source during an investigative or
information seeking activity within any domain. This gap creates a challenge for investigators
19

who want to better understand the factors that drive an information seeker to consider a piece of
information valid when it is presented to them.
This study will contribute to the existing literature by providing a detailed process model
of the validation process of new information by a group of professional investigators.
Additionally, the results of this study will provide an empirical framework for researchers to
measure, test, and compare the validation process of other groups of information seekers
ultimately providing a better overall understanding of the information validation process in
general.

2.3 Frameworks and foundations
This study explores the information validation process of professional police
investigators where the validation of new information plays a critical role in their work. The
study proposes that the validation process is governed by the investigator’s sense of disparity
between a subject’s verbal statement and other forms of information surrounding the subject
including behavioral, physical, visual, auditory, and evidentiary information.
To adequately build an empirical framework for such a study, there are several major
factors or frameworks that must be established as generic scaffolding from which the results of
this study can stand upon. The first of these frameworks is the existence of philosophical and
historical underpinnings that create and establish a foundation for the open discussion of
information validation as a general topic of interest and importance. Establishing this concretion
creates our boundaries and borders in which we can then more freely discuss the details and the
intricacies of the topic.
The second of these frameworks is the existence of current closely related works in the
areas of information validation, and the information behaviors of police and the judgment of
validity and veracity of information during the investigative process. Understanding the current
existing knowledge within the narrow confines of this study will help to better place the study in
the literature.
The third of these frameworks is the identification and establishment of an existing and
successful police investigative process that includes areas of interest like the crime scene and
setting analysis, the interview process, and the judgment of statement veracity. The existence of
a robust policing process and of information processing procedures needs to be identified and
acknowledged in order to place the specific area of interest, information validation, in its proper
22

location within the larger system.
The fourth of these frameworks is the identification and establishment of a body of work
regarding the information seeking process and information seekers in general. This study seeks
to establish and provide a baseline model of the information validation process of investigative
professionals in which to better understand the validation process of the specific group and
possibly other groups of information seekers. For this reason, the understanding of the current
knowledge about the related areas of information seeking behavior is an important component of
the study.
The fifth of these frameworks is the identification and establishment of a body of work
regarding the cognitive decision making process that may affect or drive the decision making
process of the police investigator during their validation process of new information. The
detailed process of the validation of new information by police investigators is a complex
combination of entities, processes, and decisions and is not simply be a single decision.
However, the assumption and expectation that there will be multiple decisions made for a variety
of reasons throughout the process requires an establishment of theory and existing knowledge on
the cognitive decision process.
The sixth and final of these frameworks is the identification and establishment of a
technical framework regarding process modeling including background, structure, and
usefulness. The establishment of the modeling concept, practical applications, and design process
will be discussed to place the usefulness of such a systems based model in perspective to its
usefulness as a research tool.
As this study focuses on the topic of information validation and concerns itself with the
identification of disparities between various forms of information, it is important to establish a
23

few foundations with regard to the sometimes illusive concept of information. In a very practical
sense we are addressing the concept that information, in multiple and various forms, is being
received by an information seeker (police investigator) and then considered and used in some
way during their validation process. For this reason it is required that these terms and concepts
be solidified at this stage.
When the concept of information validation is discussed there are a few basic foundations
that first need to be set and those are of information quality and of the definition of information
in general. To place information in some sort of general context for the purposes of this study we
need to define information as to its specific meaning within the study.
The term information has often been a very difficult and elusive term to define with any
great specificity within the Information Science discipline as can be seen by many of its
foundational authors. One author writes that the abundance and definitions of information
bewilder (Braman 1989). Another research team reviews 40 different academic disciplines that
use information and express frustration that all the things that are called information should have
something in common but do not (Machlup 1983).
One study found that there are over 100 different definitions for the term
“communications” used for regulatory purposes alone (Ploman 1982). Cornering and definitively
locking down Information as a term with a set meaning to all entities is clearly a moving target
that will most likely not be immediately achievable. One definition pertaining and relating to this
study defines information as the pattern of organization of the matter of rocks, of the earth, of
plants, of animal bodies, or of brain matter. In fact, Bates states that almost anything existing in
the universe that can come into human and other animals’ purview can be experienced as
information (Bates 2006). Another definition of information that pertains to this study is the
24

concept of the “conduit metaphor” in which information is the flow and exchange of a message,
originating from one speaker, mind, or source and received by another (Day 2001, 38).
The discussion of information definition is of great importance to this study because the
study is considering several forms of information as contributory factors to the validation of
information by a group of professional investigators. As this study considers behavioral,
physical, visual, audible, and evidentiary forms of information as contributing factors to the
information validation process, the definitions of information are critical to the in depth
understanding of the process.
For the purposes of this study the definition of information and other related terms that fit
most applicably to the subject and topic at hand has been adopted from Case (2007). Case posits
that Information is any difference you perceive in your environment or within yourself and is any
aspect that you notice in the pattern of reality. An information need is a recognition that your
knowledge is inadequate to satisfy a goal that you have. Information seeking is a conscious effort
to acquire information in response to a need or gap in your knowledge. Information behavior
encompasses information seeking as well as the totality of other unintentional or passive
behaviors as well as purposive behaviors that do not involve seeking such as actively avoiding
information (Case 2007).

25

2.4 History and philosophy
This literary framework establishes the existence of philosophical and historical
underpinnings that create and establish a foundation for the open discussion of information
validation as a general topic of interest and importance. To place this particular study within
some sort of philosophical and historical context we need to understand that the need for
information validity and quality has been discussed and theorized for a long time. The general
concerns of information validity, veracity, and quality can be observed in some of the
foundational work of modern Information Studies.
One effort made during this section of the literature review is to establish the existence of
information validation as a topic of study within the discipline but also to demonstrate a valid
interest and concern within the discipline by researchers. To this point information quality is a
foundational notion within information studies. Information studies are fundamentally concerned
with providing a user with “what we can call the best textual means to his end” (Wilson 1968,
21).
That best textual means is often one that is correct, true, authentic, and of high quality. When
information is used to communicate and exchange ideas, it is important that the information can
be trusted, meaning typically that it is of good quality (Mai 2013). To defend the existence of a
study like this one, there must be some general benefit or addressing of an evident societal
concern that clearly exists. In this particular case we are looking at the overwhelming presence of
information presented to us in today’s society that can be devastating to information seekers if
not properly validated before use or application of the information.
With so much information being presented to us there is a risk that information overload
may affect our ability to adequately validate the information we are about to use. It seems to be a
26

fact that more and more people are burdened by information overload, and it also seems to be a
fact that there exists more information than ever before (Mai 2013, 675). A number of
contributing factors are related to information overload such as increased communication,
globalization, deregulation, downsizing, and technology (Waddington 1998).
Establishing that there is an apparent concern within the discipline regarding information
validation there is one area of study, among others, that can be considered important which is PI
or Philosophy of Information. PI is “the philosophical field concerned with the critical
investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of information, including its
dynamics, utilization, and sciences” (Floridi 2002). There is also a practical concern within the
discipline of how an information seeker can verify the validity of information before they use it.
One researcher focuses on how PI can help one verify the accuracy of recorded information. In
other words, how one can determine if the information found in a book, in a newspaper, on a
Web site, etc. is accurate (Fallis 2004).
One additional focus of this section is to establish the realities and the risks of an absence
of a validation process or even the difficulty of validating information based on its appearance.
The literature shows that if people are misled by inaccurate information, it can cause serious
harm to their finances (Fowler et al. 2001) and their health (Kiley 2002) and thus, people need to
be able to distinguish the accurate information from the inaccurate information and specifically
Internet based information (Fallis 2004). The need to understand the information validation
process, at its greatest importance level, of information seekers stems from the need to minimize
the negative effects of inaccurate information that may cause personal harm.
Kiley (2002) describes the case of a patient who died of kidney and liver failure after
using hydrazine sulfate recommended as an alternative treatment for cancer and a nurse who was
27

charged with manslaughter after administering MICON therapy to a patient with cancer after
reading about it on the Internet. She references people that find a "cure" on the Web and adopt
this possibly at the expense of conventional therapy. Kiley summarizes that medical
misinformation is a problem on the Internet and that the danger is that vulnerable people will
adopt these unproven therapies at the expense of proven conventional medicine.
Fowler (2001) discusses the topic of Internet fraud involving stock information and
identifies it as the second most common form of investment fraud, amounting to losses of over
$10 billion a year. Fowler cites phony press releases or websites with inaccurate stock
information designed to boost the price of a stock. Fowler references a hoax perpetrated against
PairGain Technologies where a former employee posted a fraudulent message on an Internet
website designed to look like a legitimate Bloomberg news service page. The message falsely
stated that a competitor was acquiring PairGain and the false site convinced even money
managers at the Wall Street news and thestreet.com amounting to losses of millions of dollars by
investors.
When selecting information, people must concern themselves with the quality of the
information available. People are not interested in just any information; they request the best
information available for their purpose (Mai 2013, 1). For the quality of information to be
assessed, it must mean something to somebody in some context. Only information that means
something to somebody can have a certain quality. Therefore, the conception of information
quality must build on a philosophy of information, which in turn should be grounded in a
philosophy of language that accounts for the concept of meaning (Mai 2013, 675). With regards
to this study we are attempting to understand and document the information validation process of
a professional investigator. It can be assumed to some degree that the investigator will be
28

searching for the best information available during their general investigation process and when
each piece of new information is received they will be evaluating that piece of information for its
quality. It is this process that is of the most interest and is most pertinent to this study.
The existence of a large amount of damaging inaccurate information can be assumed
based solely on the sheer amount of available data in existence today. From a simple
probabilistic approach we can assume that there is a large amount of inaccurate information
living on the Internet and within the world’s databases. Even fairly reliable information sources
contain some amount of inaccurate information. Famously, the Chicago Tribune mistakenly
reported that on verifying the accuracy of information Dewey had defeated Truman in the 1948
presidential campaign (Fallis 2004). More recently, Dan Rather mistakenly reported that James
Brady had died after being shot by John Hinkley (Fricke 1997, 887).
However, since almost anyone can post almost anything on the Internet with no editorial
control, we might expect much more inaccurate information on the Internet. In fact, empirical
studies have found a considerable amount of inaccurate information on the Internet (Impicciatore
et al. 1997; Connell & Tipple 1999; Berland et al. 2001). This being the case we can predict to
some degree that a police investigator will be presented and will experience the same level of
inaccuracies we see in other various distributions of information. It can be derived then that the
police investigator will need to activate and initiate a process to filter and evaluate each piece of
new information they receive during the investigation.
The documented concept, importance, and philosophical underpinnings of information
validation can be traced back as far as the 1600’s in the writing of two respected philosophers of
their time. Both Rene Descartes and Baruch Spinoza (Bennet 1984, Gilbert et al. 1990) exhibit
and document a unique yet disparate view on the process of information validation. Where
29

Descartes argues that we receive information initially and instantly determine the information as
valid or invalid, Spinoza theorizes that all information is initially received as valid and then, only
after a period of time and some sort of applied cognitive rationalization process, does the
information become invalid. There are several empirical studies with results supporting Spinozan
theory that can be seen in several scientific works (Gilbert et al. 1990) and (Ratcliff and Mckoon
1982).
In fact, work in this area goes back to the ancient Greeks. Plato (380 BC/2002, 170), for
example, asked whether one can “examine another man’s claim to some knowledge, and make
out whether he knows or does not know what he says he knows”. Based on these notions and
observations it can be established that a professional investigator will be examining information
as it is encountered to evaluate validity and that information will be received initially and then be
subjected to a process to verify validity.
This study focuses on creating a new model of information validation to act as an
evaluation tool for the comparison and evaluation of the information validation processes of
various information seekers. One goal of having such a model would be to move closer towards
the general understanding of information validation of information seekers in general as opposed
to a single group as in this study. One potential benefit of having such a model and an
understanding of the information validation process of police investigators is that we may be able
to use this new knowledge to teach information seekers how to better and more efficiently
validate information.
One researcher states that information professionals go about teaching people how to
evaluate information. He argues that information professionals can and should use some further
important techniques to make it easier for people to verify the accuracy of information (Fallis
30

2004). The need and importance of this study can be supported in one respect based on the need
for information professionals to use a new tool and technique, as proposed in this study, to assist
people in verifying the accuracy of information.
One structural necessity for this study to be valid and generally useful is to understand
the existing knowledge of how people currently verify the accuracy of information when they
receive it. This knowledge can then be applied theoretically to the information validation process
of professional police investigators as a potential basis for a complete theoretical understanding
of their specific process.
One of the foundations of this specific work references the works of Don Fallis (2004)
and also David Hume (1748/1977) and Alvin Goldman (1999 and 2001) who suggest four
important areas to consider when verifying the accuracy of information including authority,
independent corroboration, plausibility, and presentation. These attributes and characteristics of
testimony, statements from individuals, essentially equate to the following generalizations
regarding the validation of new information by police investigators:
Authority:

Who is providing the information and what are their qualifications?

Corroboration: Who else is saying the same thing?
Plausibility:

Is the claim remotely plausible? What is the likelihood of such a claim?

Presentation: How is the claim being presented by the source?
One thing we can derive from the associated literature is that a police investigator, while
validating new information being presented to them, will be considering the authority and
integrity of the information source, other sources relaying the same information, the likelihood of
the information being true, and the way in which the information source relays the information to
the investigator.
31

One general focus or concern of figures such as David Hume is the concept of testimony
and the importance of evaluating the testimony that has been given by a person. His concepts of
evaluating testimony given by a person can just as easily be used to evaluate, for example, the
claim on a Web site that a particular treatment for a child with a fever is safe and effective. We
should consider all of the available evidence (including the fact of the testimony itself) and
determine what the best explanation of this evidence is (Fallis 2004). Since we are looking at the
information validation process of police investigators we can apply Hume’s concept of testimony
evaluation to the police investigator’s evaluation of the person’s testimony or verbal statement.
From this we can infer from the literature that the police investigator will be considering all the
available information from the various forms of information being received during the validation
process. These forms of information include physical, behavioral, visual, audible, and
evidentiary sources or information.
Fallis theorizes on Hume’s concept of the importance of testimony and that the
epistemology of testimony is important because a large amount of the information that we have
about the world comes from others rather than from direct observation (Lipton 1998, 2). As
Hume (1748/1977, 74) puts it, “there is no species of reasoning more common, more useful, and
even necessary to human life, than that which is derived from the testimony of men, and the
reports of eye-witnesses and spectators.” This echoes the viewpoints to some degree of Patrick
Wilson who argues that all that people know of the world beyond the narrow range of their own
lives is what others have told them (Wilson 1983). Fallis states that in particular, a large amount
of the information that we get from others comes to us as recorded information (e.g., in books, in
newspapers, and on Web sites). These foundations further strengthen the need for such empirical
work as this study in order to further explore the information validation process of information
32

seekers.
In efforts to address the information validation challenges experienced by information
seekers, a set of guidelines has been established by researchers within the discipline to try and
guide information seekers towards success in evaluating information. Library and information
scientists have responded to the problem of inaccurate information on the Internet primarily by
publishing guidelines for evaluating information (Ambre et al. 1997; Silberg et al. 1997;
Wilkinson et al. 1997; Alexander & Tate 1999; Cooke 1999; Smith, A. 2002).
These guidelines provide people with a list of features of Web sites that are supposed to
be indicators of accuracy (e.g., the author is identified, the author is an authority on the topic, no
advertising appears, no spelling or grammatical errors are present, the Web site is up-to-date, and
authoritative). These guidelines can be traced back, to some degree, to the core values of Hume
regarding testimony but they do not provide us with an understanding of what the information
seeker is actually experiencing during the validation process. These guidelines can provide
recommendations to information seekers as to what to look for but they do not tell us if the
seeker is already experiencing these items as a sensing and identification of disparities during
their own validation process.
For this study we can infer from the literature with regards to these guidelines that a
police investigator may be judging the subject’s statement in reference to the presentation of the
statement such as grammar, vocal intonations, and sarcasm and possibly as to the subject’s
inclusion of some sort of advertisement like component meant to mislead the investigator.
This study proposes in general that the information validation process of a police
investigator is governed by the sensing and identification of disparities between the verbal
information provided by a person and the information emanating from the various forms of
33

information surrounding the person. The discoveries made through this study will establish to
what degree these propositions are supported. The combination of the above characteristics of
information validation, the newly discovered knowledge of disparity sensing, and the discovery
of the entities, processes, and decisions experienced by a police investigator may provide enough
research data to create a new, unique view and deep understanding of the validation process of
new information by a group of professional investigative information seekers. It is these data that
will enable a new process model to materialize as a primary result of this study.

2.5 Related works
This framework establishes the existence of current closely related works in the area of
information validation and those within the police domain investigating the information
behaviors of police and the judgment of validity and veracity of information during investigation.
This section focuses on two specific research areas that pertain to this study which are first, the
evaluation of information quality and second the police evaluation of information for deceit,
veracity, and quality.
There is a body of work dedicated to the way people make judgments about the quality of
information. A number of articles (Fogg et al. 2001; Eysenbach & Kohler 2002; Rieh 2002;
Wathen & Burkell 2002) look at how people actually do make judgments about information
quality. Fogg (2001) conducts an online study that investigated how different elements of Web
sites affect people's perception of credibility. Over 1400 people participated in this study, both
from the U.S. and Europe, evaluating 51 different Web site elements. The data showed which
elements boost and which elements hurt perceptions of Web credibility. Through analysis they
found that elements fell into one of seven factors. The five types of elements that increased
34

credibility perceptions were “real-world feel”, “ease of use”, “expertise”, “trustworthiness”, and
“tailoring”. The two types of elements that hurt credibility were “commercial implications” and
“amateurism”.
In relation to this study these elements identified in the 2001 study may play some role in
the validation of new information by police investigators. Since we are already looking at the
four specific components of authority, corroboration, plausibility, and presentation in this study
perhaps the concepts of trustworthiness and expertise relate to authority while commercial
implications relate to the presentation of the information or statement. With regards to police
investigators we can consider that the investigator will be looking at and considering the
authority of the person making the statement as well as the way the statement is being presented
to the investigator.
Similarly, Eysenbach & Kohler (2002) look at what characteristics of information on the
Internet users find credible. Participants in focus groups said that when assessing the credibility
of a website they primarily looked for the source, a professional design, a scientific or official
touch, language, and ease of use. However, in the observational study, no participants checked
any “about us” sections of websites, disclaimers, or disclosure statements. In the post-search
interviews, it emerged that very few participants had noticed and remembered which websites
they had retrieved information from. Eysenbach & Kohler state that further observational studies
are needed to design and evaluate educational and technological innovations for guiding
consumers to high quality health information on the web.
Relative to this particular study we again see the concept of presentation and authority
with respect to the professional design and scientific touch discussed in the work. The
researchers establish the need for further research and innovations in this area further supporting
35

the present study’s need and importance. One question not answered in either of the preceding
works is the judging of credibility based on the sensing of disparities for example between the
website content and the website design. For example would a medical research site without a
caduceus logo be trusted less than a Web site with one present on the front page?
In a 2002 study, Soo Young Rieh examines the problem of the judgment of information
quality and cognitive authority by observing people’s searching behavior in the Web. The
purpose of the study was to understand the various factors that influence people’s judgment of
quality and authority in the Web, and the effects of those judgments on selection behaviors. It
was found that the subjects made two distinct kinds of judgment which were predictive
judgment, and evaluative judgment. The factors influencing each judgment of quality and
authority were identified in terms of characteristics of information objects, characteristics of
sources, knowledge, situation, ranking in search output, and general assumption. According to
Rieh (2002, 153), cognitive authority can be characterized as having six characteristics including
trustworthiness, reliability, scholarliness, credibility, officialness, and authoritativeness. Of these
characteristics, trustworthiness may be perceived as the most important.
Rieh introduces an influential model explicating the factors by which people judge
information quality and cognitive authority on the Internet. She showed that during the search
process, users make two distinct kinds of judgment with regard to information quality and
cognitive authority which are predictive judgment and evaluative judgment. The former refers to
what the searchers expect to happen when they move on the Web by making decisions
concerning the activation of alternative hyperlinks. Evaluative judgment denotes the values by
which they express preferences, for example, when assessing the degree to which an activated
web page is useful (Savolainen 2011). The study demonstrated that in the case of predictive
36

judgment, the criteria of topical interest (43% of mentions), information quality (33%), and
cognitive authority (18%) were employed most frequently (Rieh 2002, 151). When making
evaluative judgments, the most frequently mentioned criterion was information quality (46%),
followed by cognitive authority (20%) and topical interest (13%).
For this study we can derive from Rieh’s work that the characteristics of information like
trustworthiness, reliability, scholarliness, credibility, officialness, and authoritativeness may play
a role in the validation process of a police investigator. Similar to the others studies mentioned in
this review the specific details and findings of this particular study can be, to some degree,
categorized into the various foundational categories of authority, corroboration, plausibility, and
presentation that can be used for the evaluation of information.
Wathen & Burkell (2002) perform a literature review of the area of human interaction
with information on the web. The objective of the literature review was to synthesize the current
state of knowledge in this area, develop new ways to think about how people interact with
information presented via the Internet, and suggest next steps for research and practical
applications. The review examined empirical evidence, key reviews, and descriptive material
related to credibility in general, and in terms of on-line media. The article synthesized what we
have learned from various fields, and proposed a model as a framework for much-needed future
research in this area.
There are also several works that look specifically at the accuracy of information even
though accuracy is usually just one contributing factor to the overall quality of information
(Alexander & Tate 1999; Cooke 1999). In Alexander and Tate’s book they stipulate that there
are five components that need to be considered when evaluating information. Those are
accuracy, authority, objectivity, currency, coverage. They also posit that there are several other
37

factors that govern the evaluation process and these are standards and guidelines, regulations,
and sensory perception.
The researchers discuss the concept that there are certain regulations in place for the
publication of materials from legitimate sources that make it distinguishable from low quality
materials and that the identification or perception of these characteristics may assist in the
evaluation of that information. Most interestingly Alexander and Tate state that there are some
helpful ways to assist users in the evaluation of information including quality reviews of
resources from other users, lists of shared resources from known field experts, lists of resources
from known academic institutions, and news and health organizations that provide links to
quality resources.
For this study it is most important to denote the relationships between Alexander and
Tate’s recommendations and our base characteristics of the evaluative process including
authority, plausibility, corroboration, and presentation. We can easily relate the resource reviews
of other users to corroboration and we can also relate the resource links from known experts and
institutions back to the need for authority. Of the most interest to this study is that Alexander and
Tate refer to sensory perception when discussing the evaluation of different Web pages as to the
identification of differences between things like navigation aids, image locations and so forth. In
this study we look at the sensing and identification of disparities between different forms of
information and their effect on the evaluative process. Alexander and Tate provide supporting
data that this sensory perception has a role in the evaluative process.
In Cooke’s 1999 book she looks at how to identify the purpose of a source, assess its
coverage, authority, reputation, accuracy, currency, and accessibility. In addition she looks at the
presentation and arrangement of information as well as ease of use and how to compare a site
38

with other similar sources. Many of Cooke’s recommendations again stem from the core
variables for information validation being considered for this study including authority,
plausibility, corroboration, and presentation. By using an information source’s authority and
reputation as indicators of quality and by comparing information with other sources in a
corroborative way we can derive that police investigators will be, to some degree, activating
these same processes during their validation of new information.
When discussing information validation in any manner the assumption is that the
information has originated from a particular source and that source has a certain level of
authority that needs to be evaluated before we trust and use the information. It is critical that we
discuss the work of Patrick Wilson and the tenet of Cognitive Authority when looking carefully
at the way professional investigators validate information from a particular source.
Patrick Wilson developed the cognitive authority theory in 1983. The fundamental
concept of Wilson’s cognitive authority is that people construct knowledge in two different
ways. The first way is based on their first-hand experience and the second way is by what they
have learned second-hand from other people (Wilson 1983). The first hand experiences of people
and their interpretation and understanding of their encounters with the world comprise a portion
of their entire universe of knowledge that they obtain.
Many times people depend on other people for ideas as well as for information outside of
their first-hand experience. Much of what they think of the world is what they have gained
second-hand. Reijo Savolainen references Patrick Wilson stating those who are deemed to be
individuals who “know something we do not know” and who “know what they are talking
about” are recognized as cognitive authorities, at least to some degree (Wilson 1983, 10–14).
This is because they are thought to be intrinsically plausible, convincing, and thus credible and
39

worthy of belief. They also are perceived to be potentially able to influence one’s thinking in a
specific sphere of interest (Savolainen 2011).
Wilson argues that all that people know of the world beyond the narrow range of their
own lives is what others have told them. Only those who are deemed to “know what they are
talking about” within that pool of people become cognitive authorities (Wilson 1983). Wilson
coined the term cognitive authority to explain the kind of authority that influences thoughts that
people would consciously recognize being proper. Cognitive authority differs from
administrative authority or the authority vented in a hierarchical position (Rieh 2002).
For this study we look to cognitive authority theory for a possible theoretical foundation,
grounding framework and possibly an explanation of several derivations discovered through the
police literature. The police literature shows that during the investigative process there is
mention and experience of terms like gut, feeling, and instinct while performing police
investigations (Bozza 1978; Fuentes 2006; Galliher 1971; Gilbert 1986; Greenwood 1975; Inbau
1961; O’Hara 1988; Giacalone 2010). In an attempt to demystify and materialize these concepts
for this study, we look to cognitive authority theory to provide a general experiential database
from which the police investigator will be measuring and comparing new information as it is
presented to them. In this manner the police investigator’s feelings, instinct, and gut about the
validity of a piece of information can be theorized to very basically be a comparison to all of the
knowledge they have acquired by first hand experiences and all of the knowledge they have
learned from others.
There is a body of work that exists regarding the police evaluation of information for
deceit, veracity, and quality and strongly relates to the current study at hand on the information
validation process of police investigators. It is important to note that the primary focus of police
40

investigation with regards to information accuracy and evaluation is to obtain information in
context, and regarding, a specific incident to which they are attempting to logically explain
through empirical and evidentiary methods. In this case the interest in information validation
digresses from the academic interests to a degree because the primary interest of the investigative
professional is to actively seek and elicit valid information rather than evaluate what is presented
to them through an information delivery system. This digression is one of the primary interests of
this study as we are interested in what that validation process is and what are the entities,
processes, and decisions that make up that process.
One specific area of theoretical interest to this study is the existing pool of research in
veracity judgment based on observation alone. The concept of telling if a person is lying or
telling the truth has been a topic of interest for many years and ironically the results of many
studies show that police investigators have no better odds at judging veracity based on
observation alone than chance or fifty-fifty odds. The research shows that the success rate
increases dramatically though when the police investigator is allowed to interact with the subject.
We can derive from the literature that police investigators successfully validate information on a
regular basis as part of their profession and so we are very interested in understanding their
validation process.
Information validation within the police domain is a regular activity performed by police
investigators and on any given day, an officer might have to decide whether a suspect is being
deceptive or not (Taylor, Bennell, & Snook 2002). This makes understanding their validation
process of importance to our discipline because it may identify important key components and
characteristics of the group that can then be applied. For example training methods that can help
information seekers to better evaluate information or design features that can help designers to
41

build more effective information delivery systems and Web sites.
Four decades of social science research yield the conclusion that human beings are
unable to detect deception when it is present in communication at no greater than chance success
rates (Frank, Freeley, Paolantonio, and Servoss 2004, 45). However, professional police
investigators regularly validate information as it becomes available to them during their
investigations ultimately leading to case closures and solutions. This makes the understanding
and modeling of their validation process of great interest to the research community. Of specific
interest and relation to this study is the question of why police investigators are able to validate
information or even to make probability judgments on information validation based on their
professional activities. Although there are obvious similarities to information seekers as both
entities are looking for the best information for their needs, we are interested in understanding
how the professional investigator’s actions are unique to that of the general information seeker.
There are several areas of existing work that comprise the information validation process
of police investigators and those include the judgment of accuracy and veracity and police
information behaviors. This section attempts to outline some attempts at understanding the police
process of veracity judgment and also of how the police use information for various activities by
understanding their information behaviors. In one experiment the investigator attempts to test the
accuracy of deception detection by police investigators based on the introduction of information.
Previous research shows that observers are hardly able to detect deception above the level of
chance (Vrij 1994). Results revealed that information improved detection of deception, but only
in the planned interview condition and the two interviews hands only condition. In this example
we can see that providing the investigator with information regarding the process improves the
detection rate. Interestingly the planned interview condition in this study refers to the ability of
42

the investigator to prepare for the interview. This is of interest to the study because the
preparation process may play a role in the validation process of new information by police
investigators.
In a mathematical or statistical approach, one work uses Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) analysis to demonstrate how the analysis can be used to improve the
quality of decisions made routinely in a policing context. In signal detection theory, a receiver
operating characteristic (ROC), or simply ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the
performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The results of
the study were that the procedure can be used to improve police decision making by allowing the
police decision maker to set more appropriate decision thresholds and to estimate the accuracy of
their decisions in a more valid manner (Bennel 2005).
In one study two researchers investigate the efficacy of a novel information gathering
technique for detecting truthful and deceptive verbal accounts in interview settings (Dando and
Bull 2011). Five police officers were trained to use each of three separate interview techniques.
Results revealed a significant advantage for detecting both deceivers and truth tellers using the
tactical procedure. In the tactical procedure information from the investigator that was previously
known was revealed throughout the interview rather than withheld or even presented before the
interview. Additionally, when interviewing tactically, not only were interviewers more confident
in their judgments but they also reported using verbal behavior more to inform their judgments.
For this study these results show us that police investigators invoke various methods as part of
their process for validating information. It is these techniques that we are seeking to collect and
document for this study.
There exists a significant body of empirical research suggesting how cognitive effort and
43

working memory can influence verbal indicators of deception in interview situations. In brief,
deceivers often provide less detailed accounts and shorter answers than truth tellers (Dando and
Bull 2001; Sporer & Schwandt 2006). For this study we can derive from this that police
investigators may have obtained knowledge either through formal training or their field
experience that has exposed them to this understanding. The possession of this knowledge may
potentially govern a portion of their validation process.
As discussed above the detection accuracy of about 55%, or little better than chance, is
commonly found in deception research (Vrij, Edward, Roberts, & Bull 2000; Zuckerman,
DePaulo, & Rosenthal 1981). In one study, groups of graduate students judged segments selected
from videotapes of criminal confessions (Davis, Markus, and Walters 2006). The mode of
delivery changed with each group including video, audio, and transcript formats. The results
remain consistent with the presence of valid visual cues but suggest that at least in some
situations focus on valid vocal cues may offer more accuracy. As we are looking at the effect of
disparity between various forms of information as part of an investigators validation process, the
mention of vocal cues affecting accuracy judgment is a very interesting result in reference to the
present study. This study shows us that information from various different forms changes the
validation process of a police investigator as well as the outcome accuracy of the validation.
What is not understood or available currently is a detailed process description and model of the
information validation process of police investigators.
One study focuses on determining the information-seeking behaviors of police officers
who work in police stations in the Turkish National Police (TNP). The purpose of the study was
to motivate scholars to move forward regarding the understanding of information-seeking
behavior of other police units (Guclu 2011). In this study the researcher utilized an existing
44

model of information behavior, the information-seeking behavior of professionals (Leckie 1996)
to better understand police information seeking behaviors. One of the main purposes of the study
was to test the model of information-seeking behavior which was a general model including
general components of information flow and information need of working professionals. This
study created new knowledge on the sources of information used during a police officer’s search
for information but did not provide any insight into the validation process of new information by
police investigators and does not provide a detailed process model of the process.
In another study the authors look at the actual processes now being used to elicit and
validate information from suspects and find that coercive tactics were used very infrequently but
that tactics concerned with the seeking of information were common (Soukara et al. 2009).
While one of the main aims of the study was to identify the actual tactics most commonly used
during modern interviews with police suspects in England and Wales, the work does not look
specifically at any one process such as the validation of new information or where that process
lies in the bounds of the interview process.
One study states that many individuals do not routinely evaluate new information for
consistency with respect to what they already know and one factor that may affect the likelihood
of critical evaluation is whether or not the information is the central focus of the message (Baker
and Wagner 1987). The authors find through a series of experiments that the subjects identified
false information in a primary message but not in a subordinate one. This work contributed
greatly to this study in that it established that people have a validation process that they invoke
upon receiving new information and that subordinate information has a low validation success
rate. For this study understanding that people do not routinely evaluate information with what
they already know in comparison with a police investigators process of accessing an experiential
45

database as cognitive authority will be a very important differentiation if discovered and
supported.
Two researchers perform and analyze the results of 8 separate experiments finding that
subjects that answered yes early to false statements such as “all birds are robins” then later
answering no after a period of time (Ratcliff and McKoon 1982). In one work the authors present
data supporting Spinozan theory from a series of experiments and show that subjects declared
information true, no matter how absurd, until they had an opportunity to rationally determine the
information as false (Gilbert et al. 1990). Similar results were shown by other researchers where
respondents answer yes to clearly false or absurd statements when given a limited amount of
time to answer and then answer differently once given an adequate amount of time for
rationalization (Knowles and Condon 1999).
If Spinozan concepts are to be considered through empirical work like this 1982 study,
the implications are important because it means that as police investigators receive information
they are automatically determining it as true until they invoke a validation process to invalidate
it. As we are building a model to represent a complex process of information validation, this
theory will need to be considered to some degree in the model design.
One study focuses on the concept that information is presumed to be true at encoding but
later on turns out to be false (i.e., misinformation) often continues to influence memory and
reasoning (Ecker, Lewandowsky, Briony, and Chang 2011). The researchers investigate how the
strength of encoding and the strength of a later retraction of the misinformation affect this
continued influence effect. Results suggested that stronger retractions are effective in reducing
the continued influence effects associated with strong misinformation encoding, but that even
strong retractions fail to eliminate continued influence effects associated with relatively weak
46

encoding. The interest in this work for this study is how the police investigator may handle or
reference incidents where information turns out to be false. In other words, what changes in the
validation process based on experiencing this misinformation?

2.6 Police process
This framework establishes the existence of a successful police investigative process that
includes areas of interest like crime scene and setting analysis, the interview process, and the
judgment of veracity. The existence of a robust policing process and of information processing
procedures needs to be identified and acknowledged in order to place the specific area of interest,
information validation, in its proper location within the larger system.
In this study we are attempting to understand and document a complex process performed
by a professional investigator. Because of this it is necessary to try and understand the
characteristics of the criminal investigation process as well as the investigator as a person and a
professional. This section of the literature review uses established police training materials, text
books, and professional training materials to construct a view of the professional investigator and
the domain in which they function.
The police literature available for general research includes professional journals and
training materials for the most part. The challenge is that there is no standardized, mandatory, or
required process for investigation that can be referenced. The concepts are mostly best practices
within the police domain so for this section a series of criminal investigation textbooks were
used in order to create a basis for the criminal investigation process. It should be noted that this
section is designed to create a very high level framework for the investigative process in order to
demonstrate where the information validation process lies in relation to the larger process.
47

Within the domain of this study there is a need to clearly define and identify what the
currently known activities, processes, and general procedures are with regards to the police
investigative process. The primary reasoning for this is to appropriately place the validation of
new information by police investigators within the larger framework of the entire investigative
process. Additionally, understanding how and where the police profession places the validation
of new information within its own definitive framework will help us to understand more clearly
the current processes and procedures for validation that are currently in place.
To begin this process there must first be an understanding of the general concepts and
constructs of the investigative process. There are three particular viewpoints from which the
investigative process can be approached or viewed. The first viewpoint is of the process itself,
the second of the investigator performing the investigation as an individual, and the third is from
the viewpoint of the actual investigation or series of events that have triggered the need for the
investigation. Taking these individual viewpoints as a whole we need to understand the
intricacies of the individual performing the investigation, the structure of the investigative
process, and the attributes of a criminal investigation with regards to the information that
characterizes the incident requiring investigation.
The first viewpoint of the police investigative process is that of the process itself. From
the literature we know that the police investigator looks at investigation as an art and not a
science; hence it must be discussed in terms of precepts and advice rather than laws and rigid
theories. (O’Hara 2003, 5). The literature shows us that the initial crime scene investigation
process involves a seven step process maintained by the main case investigator (Giacalone 2013,
41). This process involves a sequential series of events and activities by the main investigator
and includes the following steps:
48



Collect all information you can before leaving the station



Reassess the crime scene boundaries setup by patrol officers



Initiate crime scene walk through with first officer on scene as guide



Make extensive notes at scene



Take photos of everything possible



Sketch and search crime scene



Collect and record physical evidence discovered at crime scene

A more detailed process is provided below (O’Hara 2003) which demonstrates more
clearly the areas that will involve information validation by the police investigator.
Identify and, if possible, retain for questioning the person who first notified the police.


Determine the perpetrator by direct inquiry or observation if his identity is
immediately apparent.



Detain all persons present at the scene.



Summon assistance if necessary.



Safeguard the area by issuing appropriate orders and by physically isolating it. All
unauthorized persons must be excluded from the crime scene. Spectators, newspaper
photographers, reporters, and others who are not officially connected with the
investigation should be kept at a distance. Uniformed police stationed at appropriate
distances will serve to perform this function. The police should be requested to refer
potential witnesses to one of the investigators.



Subsequently permit only authorized persons to enter the area.



Separate the witnesses so as to obtain independent statements.
49



Do not touch or move any object.



Assign definite duties of the search if assistants are present.

We can derive from this detail and make several assumptions that included within these
basic investigative steps that the police investigator is encountering new information from
various sources throughout the process. The investigator will be validating that information as he
or she encounters it and it is that process that is of primary interest to this study.
From the literature we know that the investigator finds himself in a position of working a
mathematical problem backwards with the known solution always before him (O’Hara 2003, 3).
The investigator gathers knowledge from other persons and there are basically two kinds of
information collected. The first type of information is acquired from regular sources such as
conscientious and public-spirited citizens, company records, and the files of other agencies. The
second is the knowledge gathered by the experienced investigator from cultivated sources such
as paid informants, bartenders, cab drivers, licensed owners and employees in general, former
criminals, or acquaintances (O’Hara 2003, 5). From this we can infer that the police investigator
maintains some sort of a sequential cognitive process during investigation and that they
categorize information into different types but also place different values on them.
The success of “information” depends on the intelligent selection of informative sources;
the effectiveness of interrogation varies with the craft, logic, and psychological insight with
which the investigator questions a person who is in possession of information relevant to the case
(O’Hara 2003, 5). We can derive from this that successfully validating information involves a
combination of components that play various roles in a process enacted by the investigator.
One investigative activity considered imperative by the profession is the act of note
taking. Experienced investigators employ a notebook to record the relevant details of a case.
50

Adequate notes are considered a prerequisite to the future recording, evaluation, and presentation
of the information developed in the course of an investigation. The age-old questions of when,
who, what, why, and how should be answered. When taking notes the report should develop
logically. The order of presentation is not fixed but is dictated by the nature of the case. It will be
found that the chronological order is best suited to certain parts of the investigation, while others
should be associated with the place where the facts were developed (O’Hara 2003, 5). For this
study we can establish that physical note taking may play a significant role in the validation of
information by a police investigator. The act of writing down a specific detail may actually have
a specific role or part in the investigator’s validation process.
A statement of a subject should be set forth verbatim, if practicable. Data should be given
concerning the place where the statement was taken and the location of the original statement.
Statements of witnesses can be given in substance and a remark made, where applicable, that a
written statement was taken. Here we can see that the various forms and sources of information
are being recorded as they place the information being validated in some sort of context. Even in
the review process disparities may be sensed by the investigator within the written details of the
statement.
Police investigators like qualitative researchers look for accretion to explain what might
be happening in certain situations. In a crime scene traces or accretion may be left in the form of
clothing, shoe impressions, fingerprints, bloodstains, overthrown furniture, disturbed articles in
general, and jimmy marks. The scene of the crime must, moreover, be viewed in an active as
well as a passive sense. The investigator must be able to visualize the way in which the
perpetrator may have carried with him the available evidentiary material that may link him to the
scene (O’Hara 2003, 47). It is possible that when investigators are validating new information
51

provided to them that the visualization process used to reenact the crime in their own minds is
similarly used to place all of the various forms of information together to identify any disparities
between them.
The second viewpoint of the investigative process is of the police investigator. The police
investigator in the context of this study can have several different titles such as investigating
officer, detective, or even lieutenant or chief as long as they meet the criteria as defined in this
study. The literature shows that the police investigator as an individual maintains a series of
qualities and skills that contribute to success in various capacities of a criminal investigation. It is
important to consider these qualities and skills in the process of validation of new information
(Gilbert 1986; Greenwood 1975; Inbau 1961; O’Hara 1988; Giacalone 2010).
A criminal investigator is a person who collects facts to accomplish a threefold aim: to
identify and locate the guilty party and to provide evidence of his guilt (O’hara 2003, 5). The
effectiveness of an investigator is largely dependent upon his ability to obtain information from
complainants, witnesses, informants, and suspects. Included in these sources of information are
those persons who may not be called as witnesses but who can provide useful data such as
official company records or non-official information that is a matter of observation.
One of the ways in which a police investigator validates information is with an interview.
An interview is the questioning of a person who is believed to possess knowledge that is of
official interest to the investigator. In an interview the person questioned usually gives his
account of an incident under investigation or offers information concerning a person being
investigated in his own manner and words. The investigator as an interviewer should have the
qualities of a salesman, an actor, and a psychologist. He is called upon to subject strangers to
extensive questioning on topics of varying sensitivity. He must be measured by the discretion
52

which he employs, and at the same time he may be criticized for a want of perseverance. He
must possess insight, intelligence, and persuasiveness. His speech should be suited to the
situation, compelling for the educated subject and calculated to strike a responsive note in the
subject (O’Hara 2003, 6).
It is possible that part of a police investigators validation process may be driven by the
professional setting and structure which place him in the investigative role originally. For this
reason we need to look at the contributory factors that placed them in the investigative role. In
general, the literature shows that police investigators originate their career by taking a civil
service test and becoming a uniformed patrol office in a similar fashion to all police officers
nationwide. This can lead to a very formal training process through a regional police academy
but not always, especially in smaller towns and villages. During an officer’s years of patrol
service, some officers develop the potential for becoming a good investigator by their quality of
work, street smarts, experiences, and apprehension record (Giaccialone 2013, 1).
The literature also shows that the selection process by administration for the advancement
of patrol officers into the investigative role is done very carefully. Giaccialone (2013) states that
the selection process is not only based on merit but that an officer’s behavior is also considered
since an investigator position has a certain level of autonomy. From a very general perspective
and in an effort to understand a very specific process it is important for this study that we note
that police investigators receive special structured training as uniformed police officers, have an
exceptional work ethic and work record, have some sort of a measurable quality of work
experiences, and maintain a distinctive cognitive skill or capacity referred to as street smarts
seemingly referring to an instinctual situational awareness.
In addition to the above generalities there are some behavioral characteristics that are
53

important to understand why we are studying the validation process of new information by police
investigators. The qualities of an effective investigator are persistence, determination,
communication, detail oriented, and overall have a talent for organization and preparedness
while investigating a case (Giaccialone, 2013, 2-3). These behavioral characteristics and qualities
need to be considered when studying their validation process as they may more clearly define or
support the activities or actions taken during the validation process.
There are several models of the police investigative process that have been established
through the evolution of Intelligence Led Policing and include Ratcliff’s Intelligence Cycle,
Gill’s Cybernetic Model, the NIM Business Model, and Ratcliff’s 3-I model. Each of these
models provide a general flow of intelligence and information from the environment and within
various entities of the investigative process but do not provide a structured process model of an
individual investigator’s validation of new information as this study proposes. These models
provide a larger view of the investigative process of which information validation is a part of but
not a detailed view of the validation process itself. The general policing models are a good high
level view of the policing process but for this study act only as a reference for where the more
specific process of information validation resides within the larger process.
In one work the researchers discuss scientific crime scene investigation as a process (Lee
et al. 2001). This model identifies four steps within the investigative process but deals only with
crime scene investigation and does not specifically focus on the validation process of new
information by police investigators. There are additional models of police investigation and
process that focus on particular investigative procedures but not specifically information
validation. One author presents a model for processing and examining digital evidence (Casey
2000) while another produced a model which sets out the steps for digital forensic analysis in a
54

linear process (Palmer 2001).

2.7 Information seeking behavior
This framework establishes the existence of a body of work regarding the information
seeking process and information seekers in general. This study focuses on building a model of
the information validation process of police investigators in hopes of better understanding the
information validation process of information seekers. For this reason there must be a discussion
on the existing key theories of information-seeking behavior that may provide supporting
grounding theory as to why police investigators may maintain the process and behaviors that
they exhibit.
In this study I propose a new model of information validation using a group of police
investigators as subjects. In many respects the validation of information as it is received plays a
crucial role in the behaviors of all information seekers yet we do not know much detail about this
specific area or the phenomena that surround it.
Obtaining an in depth understanding of the information validation process of a group of
professional investigators will provide us with a baseline upon which to measure the validation
process of other groups of information seekers in general. In order to establish a background for
this study’s purpose, the current understanding of information seeking behaviors in general must
be investigated to better understand what knowledge exists regarding the human information
seeking process.
Models are a great value in the development of theory and are most useful at the
description and prediction stages of understanding a phenomenon. Models are also a tentative
ideational structure used as a testing device (Fisher, Erdelez, McKechnie 2005, 3). Within the
55

field of information science there are several process based models of information behavior that
were reviewed for this study including both Wilson’s 1981 model of information seeking
behavior and his revised general model of information seeking behavior (Wilson 1999).
These models and associated papers have become some of the most cited articles in the
field (Fisher, Erdelez, McKechnie 2005, 35) and provide a concise general model of the entities
involved in the seeking of information by an individual. Wilson’s work is the first work to look
at information seekers’ needs as behaviors since behaviors could be observed. He was also the
first to separate the seekers needs into physiological, affective, and cognitive needs.
Wilson’s original 1981 model is important for a number of reasons but primarily that it
set out the fundamental categories of causal factors that produce a need for information as well
as the barriers that may prevent a person from taking action to seek information. The model
establishes a Universe of Knowledge that the information seeker experiences including the
seeker’s context, the systems used for seeking, and the information resources that are drawn
upon during seeking.
The importance of Wilson’s model to this study is first that Wilson derived his model not
from previous literature but from an analysis of human information behavior of a structured
group of social workers as part of a project called INISS. In this study we plan to derive a new
model of information validation from the analysis of human information behavior of a structured
group of police investigators in the same general fashion. Second, Wilson’s model and revised
models are general enough to help explain some of the observations that will be made during the
study of the information validation process of police investigators helping to place this work into
a specific area of the literature.
As a supporting foundational structure and based on the police literature we may be able
56

to apply some of Wilson’s concepts to the information validation process of police investigators.
We can observe relations between what we know about police investigators, their process, and
their profession and make several assumptions that they will be looking at information in the
context of the investigation and drawing upon information resources during seeking.
Although both of Wilson’s models include entities and process flows indicating items
like “information processing and use” and “context of information need” they do not, however,
include any validation component for the incoming information to the seeker leaving the detailed
process of information validation unknown.
Another key work in information behavior that plays a role in this study is Brenda
Dervin’s Sense-Making theory. Sense-Making is a conceptual tool of broad applicability for use
in understanding the relationship of communication, information, and meaning and is essential to
understanding how human beings derive meaning from information. Sense-Making has a great
utility for shifting researcher’s focus from categorization to process, a focus that might better
reflect the intricacies of information behavior. For this study we are looking at a very specific
process involving police investigators and some of the general theoretical principles of SenseMaking may help to explain some of the phenomena that might be witnessed during the research
portion of the study.
In Nicholas Belkin’s ASK (Anomalous States of Knowledge) model (Belkin), he includes
a model component he titles “Belief, intent, knowledge of intended recipient” that acts as a sort
of check on validity and the user’s perception of validity but as in Wilson’s model there seems to
be a lack of a detailed validation component for the new information being received by the user.
Carol Kuhlthau’s 2004 model of the information search process identifies dual actions of
seeking relevant information and seeking pertinent information. Kuhlthau identifies that through
57

their actions, people seek information relevant to the general topic in the beginning stages of the
search process and pertinent to the focused topic toward closure. Similar to both Wilson’s and
Belkin’s models there is no clear definition or process identified or illustrated for the validation
of new incoming information to the seeker.
I propose in this study that the validation process of new information by a police
investigator is governed by the sensing and identification of disparities between the verbal
statement of a subject and the various forms of information surrounding that statement including
physical, behavioral, visual, audible, and evidentiary sources of information. In order to solidify
and demystify the concept that information is eminent and evident in multiple forms we need to
look at the various forms already established within the discipline.
Bates (2006, 1033) states that we are continually subjected to a huge range of sensory
inputs and internal experiences of sensations and thoughts. In fact, almost anything existing in
the universe that can come into human and other animal’s purview can be experienced as
information. The definition of information used here, therefore, goes to the very basis of any
living being’s awareness: “Information is the pattern of organization of matter and energy.”
Bates (2006, 1036) also details and defines multiple sources of information available to us in the
universe that pertain to each of the forms of physical, behavioral, visual, audible, and evidentiary
sources of information.
For this study, the forms of information that are considered as contributors to the
validation process of information by police investigators are verbal information, behavioral
information, evidentiary information, visual information, auditory information, physical
information, and evidentiary information. These can be translated respectively into the categories
of Enacted and Expressed Information (behavioral and verbal), Trace and Exosomatic
58

Information (evidentiary), Embodied Information (visual,audio, and physical) and ultimately
Natural Information which can be treated as an umbrella of all of the forms of information being
considered.
Bates (2006, 1044) ultimately summarizes her 2006 work with the concept that
Information is the pattern of organization of matter and energy. All information is natural
information, in that it exists in the material world of matter and energy. Represented information
is natural information that is encoded or embodied. Encoded information is information that has
symbolic, linguistic, or signal-based patterns of organization. Embodied information is the
corporeal expression or manifestation of information previously in encoded form. For this study
we are investigating if a disparity between two forms of information originating from the various
sources above plays a role in the validation process of information by a group of professional
investigators. Bates’ work will most likely play a theoretical role in identifying how information
seekers receive and process these forms of information.

2.8 Decision making
This framework establishes the existence of a body of work regarding the cognitive
decision making process that may affect or drive the decision making process of police
investigator’s during their validation process of new information. This section is not a
comprehensive analysis of decision theory or background but focuses on general theory that may
affect or contribute to the validation process of police investigators.
Herbert Simon can arguably be considered the father of modern decision making theory
and the information processing approach to Psychology. Katsikopoulos and Cherng-Horng
(2011, 722) state that Simon was so prolific that many disciplines, from political science and
59

psychology to operations research and computer science, claimed him as their own. He,
however, saw himself as an interdisciplinary researcher, focused on understanding human
behavior and in particular decision making, who “rapidly became, and remained, obsessed with
human decision making” (Simon 2001, 501).
Simon and Kotovsky’s (1963) original work represents a significant departure from other
psychological paradigms in at least two important ways. First, information processing is
deliberately and necessarily quantitative. That is, it asserts that a theory of a given psychological
process must be reasonable and explicit about the amount of information that is being stored and
manipulated. Second, information processing took psychological theory well beyond the narrow
stimulus-response boundaries of the dominant behaviorist paradigm (Simon and Kotovsky 1963,
244).
In Simon’s 1945 work Administrative Behavior he describes that in actual organizational
practice, no one attempts to find an optimal solution for the whole problem and instead various
particular decisions or groups of decisions within the whole complex are made by specialized
members or units of the organization. He states that these specialized members or groups attempt
to make decisions that are simply satisfactory or good enough for any number of the subproblems that comprise the larger problem (Simon, 1945,1976 p. 272).
Simon also references a 1953 work from Milton Friedman stating that the complete
“realism” is clearly unattainable, and the question whether a theory is realistic “enough” can be
settled only be seeing whether it yields predictions that are good enough for the purpose in hand
or that are better than predictions from alternative theories.
For this study, I have identified from the literature that we may experience two types of
decision makers with regards to the information validation process of police investigators. One
60

type representing Simon’s good enough or satisfactory decision maker and one type representing
various police investigator personality attributes identified in the police literature. This type of
decision maker may always need absolute proof of information validity before validity is
declared for that piece of information. For this study I will refer to these decision maker types as
either good enough decision makers or absolute decision makers.
Within the police arena there are several models of decision making and intelligence that
provide supporting theory, structure, and background for this study. The Felony Investigation
Model of 1977 is one of these models. The primary goal of the research performed in Oakland
was to create decision models for four felony classes including robbery, assault with a deadly
weapon, car theft, and rape to determine if cases have sufficient probability of clearance to
warrant intensive investigation.
Only for robbery was it found feasible to construct a decision model. Primary casesolution factors, e.g., victim knowledge of offender, statistically dominated other, random
factors. The findings showed that, unless offender ID was made by responding officers, case
solution at the detective level was minimal. Therefore, it was concluded that patrol and
investigative functions cannot be viewed as completely separate.
The Felony Investigation Model of 1977 is important to note for this study because as a
statistical model it identifies and itemizes various information elements for measurement that
contribute to the concept of information being communicated to the police investigator in various
forms. Being a statistical model, this does not provide us with a rich understanding of the police
investigator’s experience during the validation process.
Bennel (2005) discusses the requirements for improved police decision making and states
that to accomplish this, the decision maker must base their decisions on evidence that reliably
61

distinguishes between the events of interest. In the ideal situation, this evidence will always be
present when the event occurs but never present when it does not. When this happens, there is
the potential for decision making accuracy to be extremely high. In the majority of cases,
however, this will be rare, especially when behavioral evidence is relied upon (as will often be
the case in the policing context). This is because behavioral evidence is often ambiguous in
nature, in the sense that it can occur to a degree when an event is present and absent (Swets
et al. 2000; Bennel 2005).
Police officers and investigators are forced to make all sorts of decisions. Bennel states
that all of these sorts of decisions are referred to as diagnostic tasks in other settings (Swets
1996). They each require a police officer (or some other decision maker) to use the available
evidence to decide between one of two alternatives and they are rarely, if ever, easy decisions to
make (Ekman & O’Sullivan 1991; Taylor 2002; Whittaker, Brickley, & Evans 1998).
Additionally, Bennel states that according to a number of leading diagnosticians, there
are two primary reasons why these tasks are difficult (Swets, Dawes, & Monahan 2000). The
first reason is that, in the majority of cases, many different sources of evidence can be drawn on
to make the decision, but only some of that evidence may actually be useful. For example, the
degree to which a suspect fidgets during an interrogation might not indicate whether that suspect
is being deceptive, however, the pitch of their voice might be a useful predictor.

2.9 Process modeling
This framework establishes a technical framework regarding process modeling including
background, structure, and usefulness. The establishment of the modeling concept, practical
applications, and design process will be discussed to place the usefulness of such a systems
62

based model in perspective to its usefulness as a research tool. A system is a way of looking at
the world (Weinberg 1975, 52) and a model helps to order and simplify our view of reality by
representing its essential characteristics in abstract form (Frankfort-Nachmius and Nachmius
2000). To a great extent, the usefulness of a formal model of a software process lies in its ability
to accurately predict the behavior of the executing process. Similarly, the usefulness of an
executing process lies largely in its ability to fulfill the requirements embodied in a formal model
of the process (Cook and Wolf 1999).
One perspective of this study is from a system or process based approach which looks at
the unique entities, processes, and decisions experienced by a police investigator during the
process of validating new information. Influences, both internal and external to a person, can
affect situation assessment and decision making in operational situations (White and Owens
2011). This study focuses on the verbal information being transmitted from a person, or
testimony as discussed earlier, and the various forms of information being transmitted from
fundamental sources surrounding the person including behavioral, physical, visual, audible, and
evidentiary information.
These various forms of information are received by the investigator and then processed in
a certain way to determine the validity of the message. Because of this structure we can make
comparisons to some degree using existing communications models like the Shannon-Weaver
model of communication. This model includes components such as message, sender, receiver,
channel, feedback, and noise and thus some general assumptions can be made regarding the
model design component of this study that these components will play a contributing role
somewhere in the final model design. Once we begin to think in this manner then the concept of
process modeling begins to emerge as the best possible way to capture and represent this
63

complex process.
In this study we can consider human beings as human information processors that, in a
classic computer modeling fashion, receive information in the form of Input, cognitively analyze
that information in the form of a Process, and then use that information in some way in the form
of an Output (Simon 1963). In this case the activity of information validation can be considered a
sub process or sub system of a larger system. A system is a set of individual components
combined on purpose to achieve a specific goal and each system may contain any number of
subsystems within its design (Dennis, Wixom, Roth 2012).
In this study I posit that the existence of a structured and detailed process model of the
information validation process of police investigators would act as a baseline for future
researchers to measure the validation process of other groups of information seekers. Models are
often used under this context as the following works demonstrate. A process model describes
business, organizational, and cognitive processes and has been a part of structured systems
analysis and design techniques for many years (Dennis, Wixom, Roth 2012).
Process models can be used to measure and evaluate a multitude of research questions
and observations. In one case researchers utilize the EPPM (Extended Parallel Process Model) to
measure the effectiveness of workplace safety messages on the employees of an organization.
Basil, Basil, Deshpande, and Lavack (2013, 29) discover that there is frequent use of EPPM
variables in real-world communications pieces for workplace safety through model application to
a specific problem. They state that of the four PPM variables, self-efficacy is used most
frequently, followed by severity, while susceptibility is used least frequently. The content
analysis demonstrates that although real-world organizations are using EPPM factors, rarely do
these communication pieces use all four components of the EPPM.
64

One of the challenges with any project that involves model design is the validation of the
model. The lack of verified data has made validating human behavior models difficult. Although
validation of physics-based models is well-defined using long-established standards, the
practices are not well suited for validating behavioral models. This is due to several factors
including one, the nonlinear nature of human cognitive processes, two the large set of
interdependent variables making it impossible to account for all possible interactions, three the
inadequate metrics for validating HBR models, four the lack of a robust set of environmental
data to run behavioral models for model validation; and finally that there is no uniform, standard
method of validating cognitive models (Goerger, McGinnis, and Darken, 2005). For this study
the validation method proposed utilizes the users of the model as an integral part of the
validation process as recommended by Robert G. Sargent (2004). In this approach the focus of
who determines the validity of the process model moves from the model developers to the model
users and ultimately aids in model credibility (Sargent 2004).
For this study I focused on a very specific and integral component or sub-system of the
larger umbrella system of criminal investigation. The process of information validation plays a
unique and vital role within almost every part of the larger umbrella of criminal investigation.
Because of the uniqueness and importance of the specific sub-system of information validation
this research focuses primarily on creating a richer and more robust understanding of the process
or sub-system and of the accurate modeling of the entities, processes, and decisions that
comprise the system’s architecture.
One of the best and most efficient ways of communicating the existence, combination,
and interactions of various entities, processes, and decisions of a process or sub-system such as
information validation is to utilize a standardized communications language to create a process
65

model that can be understood and adapted by others. A process model describes business,
organizational, and cognitive processes and has been a part of structured systems analysis and
design techniques for many years (Dennis, Wixom, Roth 2012). There are several standardized
languages and symbolisms in use today that allow individuals and groups to model processes and
activities that need to be visually represented for any reason.
There were several system modeling languages and methodology options available while
deciding on a modeling language for the design of the validation model. The languages and
methodologies reviewed for this study included the IDEF (Integrated Definition) family of
languages, the UML (Unified Modeling Language) family of languages, and the BPMN
(Business Process Model and Notation) modeling language. Although BPMN is a powerful and
robust language designed to capture business processes and notations (Zur Muehlen and Recker
2008) and was closely considered for this study, the IDEF3 language was more applicable to this
project. These methods were all reviewed for this study and ultimately IDEF3 Description
Capture Method was selected based on its specific applicability and purpose in relation to the
goals of this study.
The IDEF3 Process Description Capture Method was created specifically to capture
descriptions of sequences of activities. The primary goal of IDEF3 is to provide a structured
method by which a domain expert can express knowledge about the operation of a particular
system or organization. A method is an organized, single-purpose discipline or practice
(Coleman 1989).
This includes the capture of assertions about the objects that participate in the process,
assertions about supporting objects, and the precedence and causality relations between
processes and events in the environment. IDEF3 supports this kind of knowledge acquisition by
66

providing a reliable and well-structured approach for process knowledge acquisition, and an
expressively powerful, yet easy-to-use, language for information capture and expression (Mayer
et al. 1990). IDEF3 will allow a designer to construct a behavioral model of a business process
(Noran 2000, 41)
For this study I have selected the IDEF3 description capture method to represent the
information validation process of police investigators after a careful and empirical analysis. In
contrast to the IDEF series of modeling languages, specifically the IDEF3 description capture
method, the Unified Modeling Language (UML1&2) and the Business Process Modeling
Notation (BPMN) did not adequately provide notations and methodology to capture the domain
knowledge of an expert that was expected to evolve during the methodology phase of this study
with regards to the validation process (Giaglis 2001).
To completely capture and accurately represent the elements that comprise the
information validation process of police investigators it was a requirement that the modeling
language used have the ability to:


Construct a behavioral model of a business process



Capture a sequence of activities and descriptions of those activities



Capture knowledge of a process by domain expert



Capture assertions made about the objects included in a process



Capture assertions made about supporting objects



Capture the precedence and causality relations between events



Capture the precedence and causality relations between processes

To better demonstrate the comparative nature of the various languages reviewed and
67

considered for this study the matrix in Table 3 below was created to demonstrate the capabilities
of the various languages.

The IDEF3 or integrated definition for process description capture method is designed to
help document and analyze the processes of an existing or proposed system and allows us to
capture and document descriptions of sequences of activity (Mayer et al. 1995).
One particular process that is not currently modeled using these techniques is the
validation of new information by police investigators. Validating new information as it becomes
available is a critical part of the police investigative process and because of the weight and
importance placed on accurate information by the profession to assure officer and victim safety,
understanding and documenting the group’s validation process would be helpful to any
profession or discipline that includes an investigative component to their professional activities.
Using a language like IDEF3 to create and represent a complex behavioral process like
the information validation process of a police investigator will provide future researchers with an
68

abstract yet descriptive view of the validation process that can be used to test and compare the
validation process of other groups of information seekers. This will be possible because of the
specific constructs of the modeling language and because of the descriptive and ordinate nature
of the language itself.
An IDEF3 model enables a viewer to see the contributing factors and elements in a
process, the order in which they occur, and the relationships and interdependencies between
those elements in the context of the process being modeled. In general, the IDEF3 model will
allow a researcher to compare the information validation process of health information seekers,
as an example, to the model by performing experiments with representative subjects of the group
using the model specifics as a guide.
The results of testing and comparing other groups of professionals in a situation like this
would provide a series of benefits to the research community first being the identification of
similarities and parallels within then processes leading towards a general multi-disciplinary
theory of investigation and secondly the knowledge of design implications with regards to
information delivery systems. A similar process between groups leads to an increase in
knowledge with regards to enhanced systems design to deliver quality information to the
information seekers in an interface that incorporates the new knowledge.

2.10 Literature review summary
This literature review provides me with a supporting framework on which to base this
study, its purpose, and its need within the discipline. First and foremost this review shows that
there is no current or existing work that details and models the information validation process of
professional police investigators. This establishes the lack of scientific knowledge in this specific
69

area of research and ultimately identifies a research gap in the complete understanding of the
information validation process of information seekers.
The review shows that the importance of understanding information validity and
information quality evaluation lies in the complete understanding of a person’s information
seeking behaviors. These behaviors govern and guide our current research path in the areas of
information retrieval, information access, and information storage. Additionally, this review
shows that the validation of information plays a role in a person’s information seeking behavior.
It shows that information seekers validate information as they encounter it and that there is a
need to understand and measure this process more effectively. The review shows that
scientifically comparing behavioral processes against known established models provides a
useful tool for identifying similarities and differences between various groups.
The review shows that there is an existing cache of knowledge in areas that most likely
play an integral role in the information validation process of police investigators including
information behavior, general decision making, and police decision making. This contributory
knowledge however does not, either in part or as aggregate, clearly or explicitly delineate the
information validation process of police investigators. Furthermore, there are various models and
theories that help us to understand the needs and processes of information seekers in general but
not specifically the validation process of new information as it is received from various sources
during the seeking process.
The review shows that within the discipline, models are a successful way of
understanding the complexities of information seeking behaviors and of subcomponents of those
behaviors. It shows us that a model can be viewed as a likeness of something and consists of
symbols or characteristics of some empirical phenomenon including its components, represented
70

as logical arrangements of concepts. Additionally, a model helps us to order and simplify our
view of reality by representing its essential characteristics in abstract form. Finally, the literature
shows that a model’s usefulness lies in its ability to accurately predict the behavior of the
executing process and that the usefulness of an executing process is largely in its ability to fulfill
the requirements embodied in a formal model of the process.
Ultimately, the review supports the concept and notion that creating a baseline model of
information validation using a group of professional investigators will provide a scientific tool to
better understand, measure, and compare the information validation of information seekers.

CHAPTER 3. Methodology
3.1 Introduction
This study consisted of a two phase research design including a data collection phase and
a model design phase. The purpose of the research was to create a baseline process model of the
information validation process of a group of professional investigators. Additionally, this study
and its findings provide an empirical framework for using the new model to test and evaluate the
information validation process of other groups of information seekers. To meet the goals of this
study a variety of research methods and research tools were used. These included semi-structured
interviews, content analysis of recorded talk aloud sessions, a controlled experiment, and a Joint
Application Development session.
The 45 subjects for this study were police investigators as operationally defined and
consisted of a single subject for instrument pre-testing, 15 interview subjects to collect
information on various entities, processes, and decisions, 25 experiment subjects assessing the
subject’s evaluation of disparity, and 4 Joint Application Design participants whose focus was to
design a series of model prototypes. Additionally the 15 interview subjects also participated in
recorded talk aloud sessions detailing their own personal validation methods. The general
timeline for this study ranged from May, 2014 through June, 2015 and included various
components such as the initial proposal defense, approval by the Institutional Review Board of
Long Island University, data collection methods, data aggregation and analysis, model design,
dissertation preparation, and dissertation defense.
The methodology for this study consists of several components designed to:


Identify the various processes, decisions, and entities involved in the validation of new
72

information by police investigators so they can be represented in the new process model.


Test each of the multiple propositions so that they can be represented in the new process
model properly.



Create the model using standard IDEF3 language and methodology.

For this reason the following methodology section of the study is structured in two general
but separate sub-sections including Data Collection and Model Design. The research roadmap in
Figure 3 below illustrates this layout visually for easier comprehension.

3. 2 Police agency and subject selection
The original research settings for the study were 3 individual police agencies fitting the
descriptions of small, medium, and large as identified by this study. As the data collection
process progressed it became evident that the availability of participants in each agency and the
73

available time by the subjects for research at the sites was limited. For this reason 3 additional
research sites were added creating a total of 6 research sites including 1 small, 3 medium, and 2
large agencies. All 45 subjects participating in this study were law enforcement professionals
employed and actively serving at those associated agencies.
For the purposes of this study and of the related research questions, we are interested in
discovering if the introduction of a disparity (independent variable) between various forms of
information during the validation process will affect or alter the validation process (dependent
variable) of the police investigator. For this study there will be a number of different research
settings and subjects used to satisfy various method requirements during the data collection
portion of the study. This section describes the selection process for each of these settings and
subjects.

3.3 Use of human subjects and IRB approval
During the course of this study the use of human subjects was a necessity for the
collection of data needed to complete the proposed goals of the study. A total of 45 human
subjects filled the roles of interviewees, experiment subjects, and narrators within the various
methodologies used in the study.
Because of this I made all efforts to protect the human research participants for this study
as recommended by both the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Institutional Review
Board (IRB) of Long Island University at CW Post. Any and all use of human subjects as well as
the documentation supplied to them during the research was approved by the IRB of Long Island
University before any formal research began using these subjects.

74

3.4 Dependent and independent variables
To adequately satisfy and answer the research questions that act as the framework of this
study, I have included both qualitative and quantitative approaches to the collection and analysis
of the data required to answer these questions.
One research question that can only be answered specifically through a combination of
both methodological approaches is “Does a disparity between the information contained in a
person’s verbal statement and the associated information originating from surrounding
fundamental sources lead a police investigator to require additional information in order to
consider a piece of information valid?” I have established six individual and testable propositions
which were included in the new model based on their validity established from the results of the
experiment. To support or reject these propositions an experiment was conducted as detailed in
the methodology section of this study and used 25 police investigators as the experiment
subjects.
The goal for testing the propositions was to collect data through a controlled
experimental process that demonstrated if a police investigator’s validation process, the
dependent variable, is altered in some way when exposed to a disparity, the independent
variable, in the fundamental forms of information surrounding the information being validated.

3.5 Semi-structured interviews
For the semi-structured interview portion of the study, 15 police investigators as defined
in this study participated in the interviews. Each subject represented one of three agency profiles
including small, medium, and large agencies also defined by this study. The investigators were
selected based not only on their agency size but also on their willingness and agreement to act as
75

subjects of this study. The research setting for these interviews was a one on one (researcher and
subject) setting in a separate or closed room in each agency to avoid any outside distractions.
This setting also fostered better and more natural conversations between the interviewer and
interviewee. This setting also provided a better environment for audio recording and note taking
as well.
Due to the complex nature of the research topic it was decided to use semi-structured
interviews as one of the data collection methods for this study. This type of interview involves
the implementation of a number of pre-determined questions and special topics. These interview
questions are asked of each interviewee in order but the interviewees are allowed freedom to
digress. This allows the interviewer to probe far beyond the answers to their prepared questions
(Berg 2006).
It has been decided for this study that a combination of closed ended, open ended, and
scenario based questions for the interview content would be most productive. Interview
questions that adopt a business use case approach hold more meaning to the interviewee during
the process (Robertson and Robertson 2006). The investigative scenarios used for the interviews
will be adapted to the study from existing police training materials published for police
investigative training (McAuliffe 2012).
Each agency was contacted initially to secure their cooperation by explaining the purpose
of the study and by explaining the participation requirements to the police administration of the
agency. Upon agreement a signed and dated research permission form was attained from each
site. Once the research sites were acquired, dates were set up to work on site with each agency’s
participants.
Once on site for the day the subjects were asked to volunteer for the interview at their
76

convenience by police administration after regular duties were completed or in between calls as
appropriate. Each participant interview was conducted in a one on one (researcher and subject)
setting and occurred usually in an available police interview room or office. The subjects were
asked a series of 38 questions designed to attain information on their qualifications for the study,
their validation process, and their agreement levels of various propositions and assumptions
associated with this study.
After the answer to each question was given by the subject, the subject was provided an
opportunity to explain or expound on their answer. Any further explanation or expansion on the
subject’s initial answer was written down by me on the subject’s interview document. The
aggregated notes from all interview subjects were later compiled into a single representative
document of unique themes generated by the group of interview subjects.
At the completion of each session with each subject the subject was asked if they would
willingly participate in a recorded talk aloud session to document their information validation
process. It was explained verbally that they would be read an investigative scenario and then be
asked to narrate their own process aloud so they could be recorded for later transcription and
coding.
After agreeing to participate the subject would be shown the recorder and that it was
currently turned off. It was then explained that I was going to read them the scenario and turn on
the recorder. When I told them to begin they would then start there narration. During each
narration many subjects needed to be reminded to be as verbal as possible even if they thought
something was not important. If a subject was absolutely finished with their narration the
recorder was turned off and the number of the recording on the digital recorder was matched to
the subject number so that all the data was aligned properly. This narrative was then transcribed
77

into separate documents for each subject’s narration and then coded using content analysis with
30 specific and exhaustive codes that apply to this study.
After each interview session was completed the subject was provided with a $5 Starbucks
or Dunkin Donuts gift card for their participation. This identical process was performed with 15
subjects at 6 different research sites during the course of the study. The compiled interview data,
data analysis, coding summary, and findings may be found in the data analysis section of this
dissertation.
The primary goal of the interview process in this study is to elicit, acquire, and record as
much information as possible, both inductively and deductively. Subsequently, the goals of this
study are to collect from the police investigator subjects the entities, processes, and decisions
they experience during the validation of new information received during the investigation
process. Additionally, establishing the relationships and information flows between these
entities, processes, and decisions was critical for producing an effective model of the information
validation process of police investigators.
Primarily the relationships between the entities, decisions, and processes that make up the
validation process were provided by the subject’s detailed verbal descriptions of their process.
Additional supporting data identifying the relationships and information flows were acquired
deductively from the associated coding instrument for the study whose codes have been derived
from the police literature.
During this portion of the study I was looking for and recording information such as
subject recollections or personal experiences they call on that may provide a deeper
understanding of the process components and how they relate to one another. In this approach
the general relationships and information flows between the various entities, processes, and
78

decisions identified from the interviews started to emerge and then I was able to properly
represent them in the IDEF3 model. This type of activity represents the subject’s universe of
knowledge (T.D. Wilson 1981) and also their personal experiential database where all they know
about the world from their own experiences as well as from what others have told them resides
(P. Wilson 1983).
The interview instrument and its associated questions for this study are accessible in
appendix C of this study. The questions for the study were designed to capture the entities,
processes, and decisions experienced by police investigators during their validation process but
also to identify the relationships between those entities. In addition, the questions and structure
of the interviews are designed to allow for inductive methodologies to record and identify any
emerging behavioral themes which may evolve during the research. These themes emerged when
the investigators were relating their experiences to me and helped me to better understand the
validation process and the factors and elements that comprise it. This information was then
applied to the IDEF3 model during the model design phase of the study.
The interview instrument contains several categories of questions to improve the
reliability of the interview data (Berg 2006). These categories include essential questions to
capture the core study data, extra questions that capture the same core data but are worded
differently, throw away questions to develop rapport with the interview subject, and probing
questions to bring out richer explanations of their validation process. The specific interview
instrument that was used for this study contains a series of open ended questions, closed ended
questions, and scenario based questions that were used in concert with each other to achieve the
above requirements.
The questions were worded carefully to assure that the appropriate study information can
79

be acquired from their answers. They were also designed to avoid certain pitfalls such as doublebarreled questions and overly complex questions (Berg 2006). By avoiding these pitfalls,
subjects were able to clearly understand the questions and what is being asked of them and could
more easily provide appropriate information as pertains to the interview questions.
To improve the reliability of the interview instrument and schedule, a pretest procedure
was conducted on the instrument with a single volunteer police investigator. This process helped
to assure that the interview instrument included questions to capture necessary information, elicit
the types of responses anticipated from the subjects, used language that is meaningful to the
respondents, and that it motivated respondents to participate.
During the pre-test process I met in person with an experienced police investigator as
defined in this study and reviewed the individual interview questions with the investigator to
identify any issues or challenges with each question such as wording and clarity.
The remainder of the questions were asked using a scenario based format where the subjects
were read a certain investigative scenario by me and then were asked to talk aloud through their
validation process as they determine if the information that has just been presented to them can
be considered valid or invalid.
A adapted version of a police training scenario from a police training manual (McAuliffe
2012) was read to the subject and the subject was asked a series of questions to elicit the various
processes, entities, and decisions the investigator encounters and experiences while validating
the piece of information that was just provided. The subject was asked to “talk through” all of his
thoughts while he attempted to validate the specific piece of information in the scenario.
All subject talk aloud sessions were digitally recorded for content analysis in the next step of the
methodology. Content analysis is a careful, detailed, systematic examination and interpretation
80

of a particular body of material in an effort to identify patterns, themes, biases, and meanings
(Berg and Latin 2008). The general process for content analysis is that:


The data is collected and made into text, codes are analytically developed or inductively
identified in the data and affixed to a set of notes or transcript pages, materials are sorted
by these categories.



Sorted materials are examined to isolate meaningful patterns and processes.



Identified patterns are then considered in light of previous research and theories and a
small set of generalizations is established.
Content analysis for the interview portion of this study was accomplished by using a

deductive coding approach. Upon data analysis of the interview questions and upon completion
of the transcripts of all 15 talk aloud interview scenario recordings, the transcript documents
were coded using a basic deductive coding method using analytical codes derived from the
literature review including entities, processes, and decisions. The specific codes that were
selected for this coding process emerged from generalities that have been exhibited by the police
investigative process as well as the various literatures reviewed for this study. All associated
codes, coding documents, and coding frames can be found in appendix D of this document.
Once the 15 transcribed interview documents had been initially coded and the data
analysis completed, a set of generalized themes or patterns of activity were created and detailed
from the data that established the required model components of entities, processes, and
decisions needed for the study. The process also identified and established general behavioral
patterns and phenomenon that had emerged from the data as well. These entities, processes, and
decisions were a compilation of those derived from literature as well as those that emerged from
the research.
81

3.6 Experiment design
The following experiment was performed on 25 subjects representing 3 individual police
agencies or research sites representing each of the 3 categories of agency established for this
study. This experiment was designed to collect data with specific relevance to research question
3 that is does a disparity between information contained in a person’s verbal statement and the
information originating from sources surrounding the person, lead a police investigator to require
additional information before considering a piece of information valid? It also provides useful
supporting data that was helpful in identifying the model entities with regards to research
question 1. The experiment was performed in both a one on one format as well as a group format
based on subject and setting availability. During the experiment, when conducted in group
format, instructions were given to the group, however each subject performed their own
selections on each scenario individually.
For this portion of the study I elected to use a basic controlled experiment design in order
to evaluate and test the 6 individual propositions for this study so that the results of the
experiment could be integrated into the final IDEF3 process model created as part of this study.
The goal for testing the propositions was to collect data through a controlled experimental
process that will demonstrate if a police investigator’s validation process, the dependent variable,
is altered in some way when exposed to a disparity, the independent variable, in the fundamental
forms of information surrounding the information being validated.
To adequately test these propositions, the experiment was organized into a single group
of 25 subjects. The subjects for this study were all police investigators as defined by this study.
The general procedure for this study has been loosely adapted from a 1990 study on judging
information veracity. In the 1990 study the subjects were presented with individual statements on
82

a computer screen and asked to quickly judge whether the statements were true or false. The
subjects were asked to read the statements and then provided a very small amount of time to
answer true or false (Gilbert, Krull, Malone 1990).
In this study I adapted the general process of providing the subjects with propositions by
providing them with a series of brief investigative scenarios and asking them to determine the
validity of specific information within the scenario within a set amount of time (1 minute each).
The scenarios were issued on 8 ½ X 11 sheets of paper one at a time and the subject was given
60 seconds from the time of issuance to determine the validity of the specified information.
The group of 25 police investigators was provided with 8 total scenarios in which they were
required to determine the validity of the information. Of these 8 scenarios, 3 scenarios contained
no disparity between the various forms of information surrounding the information in question
and five scenarios that contained disparities representing the behavioral, visual, audible,
evidentiary, and physical forms of information proposed in this study.
It should be noted that 2 of the 3 non-disparity scenarios were identified by the subject during the
pre-testing portion of the study as having potential reliability issues primarily due to contextual
clarity in the wording of the scenarios. The third non-disparity scenario pre-tested with no issues
or challenges. Only this scenario was included in the study results.
The subjects were then asked to simply read each scenario and select one of the answers
provided including both VALID or NEED MORE INFORMATION TO DETERMINE
VALIDITY. The subjects were provided a notes area from which to explain their answer if they
feel they want to add more detail to explain their answer. These notes were valuable during the
data analysis phase when encountering various data anomalies that required a certain amount of
deeper explanation. These notes from the individual experiment responses were compiled into a
83

single research document representing a single list of unique notations form the subjects
regarding the experiment scenarios.
The 25 subjects were issued their 8 scenarios in random order and no two subjects
received the same order of scenarios. Randomization was achieved by using Research
Randomizer at www.randomizer.org to generate 25 sets of numbers, 1 through 8, which then
were applied to the physical order of the 8 paper based scenarios. The numbers 1 through 8
represent each of the experiment scenarios including both non disparity and disparity scenarios.
The following numbers (1-8) have been given to each experiment scenario and the
numbers were printed in small, faint, light grey fonts at the bottom right hand corner of each
scenario so as not to distract the subject while participating in the study.
1. Non Disparity
2. Non Disparity
3. Non Disparity
4. Behavioral Disparity
5. Visual Disparity
6. Physical Disparity
7. Audible Disparity
8. Evidentiary Disparity
There were 25 copies made of each of the 8 scenarios and each of 25 sets of scenarios was
placed in the appropriate order to one of the random sets below. As each subject participated
they were given one of the randomized sets of scenarios for their participation in the study.

Upon completion of the task each participant was thanked, issued their $5 Starbucks gift
card, and their scenario packets were collected along with their signed informed consent forms.
The 8 various scenarios for the experiment were pre-tested with a single police
investigator for quality and reliability before any subjects were tested. The pre-testing consisted
of an open discussion interview between a volunteer police investigator and myself to gauge the
investigator’s individual perception of the validity of each scenario based on the disparity or nondisparity scenarios.
The series of investigative scenarios for this experiment were adapted from a predefined
and valid source of police investigative training literature. The scenarios were specifically
adapted for use in this study while maintaining all of their core details. Due to the extent and
length of some of the training scenarios selected from training texts, the scenario details were
limited, adjusted, and adapted by me to fit the purposes of this study.

3.7 Joint application development (JAD) session
In order to achieve adequate triangulation the collection methods used in this study
incorporates a second level of data collection in the form of a Joint Application Development or
JAD session. During the requirements gathering phase of the systems analysis process there are
several collection methods used similar to those used during the structured academic research
process including interviews, questionnaires, and focus groups.
One very useful technique used during the systems analysis process that has been
selected for this study is the Joint Application Development or JAD session. The primary reason
for selecting a JAD session instead of a traditional focus group for this study is because we are
collecting actual process details and descriptions in order to build a process model that
adequately represents the validation process of police investigators. The JAD process has been
successfully used over the years for requirements gathering as well as system and process design
and provides a vehicle to efficiently elicit knowledge from domain experts as required for this
study (Wood and Silver 1995).
The primary goal of the JAD session with regards to this study was to gather information
from a group of police investigators with varied career experiences, in a group environment, on
the various entities, processes, and decisions experienced while validating new information
received during an investigation. The results of the JAD session were compared and used in
parallel to the interview data already collected in order to create a more complete and richer
picture of the validation process.
Joint Application Development (JAD) is a structured group process focused on
determining requirements and involves a project team, users, and management working together
and is a very useful technique (Dennis, Wixom, Roth 2012). JAD participants include a
87

facilitator who is trained in JAD techniques that creates an agenda that guides the group through
the process and users and managers from other business areas with broad and detailed
knowledge. For this study I played the role of the session facilitator and the user and manager
roles were filled by police investigators as defined in this study.
Joint Application Development originates as a process developed by Chuck Morris and
Tony Crawford of IBM in 1977 as a way to get users and programmers to agree on requirements
for systems based projects (Wood and Silver 1995). Formal JAD sessions consist of five phases
including JAD project definition, research, preparation, the session itself, and the final document.
This study incorporates all five phases of the methodology as part of this specific research step.
There are specific members of a JAD team that play unique roles of which I played multiple
roles during this session.
The formal roles and titles for the members of a JAD team are the executive sponsor, the
facilitator, the scribe, the full time participants, on call participants, and observers. Various
adaptations have been made to these roles based on the limited size and scope of the session and
ultimately incorporate the chief of police as the executive sponsor, myself as the facilitator and
the scribe, and the police investigators as the full time participants. There were no part time
participants or observers included in this process due to the highly focused nature and purpose of
the project.
The JAD session worked very similar to a focus group except that there was a very rigid
agenda and the goal of the JAD session was to act as a parallel data collection process to both the
interviews and the disparity experiment. The structure and schedule of the JAD provided me the
ability to present arguments for discussion and detailing but also provided a working document
and diagram of a preliminary model of the validation process. This preliminary model used
88

standard PFD (Process Flow Diagramming) techniques and emerged from the JAD session
efforts as a final document between the facilitator and the team members.
During the JAD project definition phase, session output requirements are established, a
management definition guide is created, and the session is scheduled with the appropriate
participants. Session outputs for this study have been established as:
The identification and transmittal by the group participants of all entities, decisions, and
processes they experience during the validation of new information by police investigators.
An in depth verbal description of the relationships between the entities, decisions, and processes
experienced during the validation of new information by police investigators.
In order to incorporate the findings and discoveries acquired from the JAD session into
the IDEF3 model design, a conclusive and final document needed to be created with the
outcomes of the JAD session. Ultimately one of the most important deliverables from the JAD
session was a series of hand drawn conceptual models using standard flow diagramming
techniques that represent the discussion and findings of the JAD team. These series of diagrams
are graphical representations of what the JAD team considers their information validation
process and consist of the entities, processes, decisions, and relationships that characterize the
attributes of their expert, professional validation process.
Essentially, the final JAD document is a more elaborate and detailed version of the
working document used in the JAD session itself. The working document was populated with all
of the additions and enhancements collected through the JAD session and its participants and
incorporate an inclusive summary which details the ultimate findings of the group and any and
all agreements or disagreements with the data collected from the interview sessions.
This final document was used in conjunction with the final interview statistics, coding
89

documents, and the results of the controlled experiment to create the new model using the IDEF3
modeling language.
For the Joint Application Development (JAD) session portion of the study, the four JAD
team participants met the qualifications of police investigators as defined by this study and were
selected solely from a single large police agency. There were several agencies selected as
prospects for this portion of the study but ultimately the agency was selected based on the
availability and cooperation of the administration of that agency.
The reasoning behind this selection process is due to the general correlation between the
size of agency with regards to the number of sworn officers in relation to the actual quantity or
amount of police events which the agency responds to. By selecting an agency that responds to
more events, the assumption is that there is more investigative activity within the agency. This
most likely means that more validation of information is occurring by the police investigators as
well. This makes the described and selected research environment more productive and
opportunity rich than other small or medium size agencies. Upon completion of this portion of
the research these assumptions were realized and a successful JAD session was achieved.
The JAD session was held at a single large agency as defined in this study with four
police investigators from that agency in a board or meeting room style configuration. In this
room there was a PowerPoint presentation running on a laptop and projector that guided the JAD
session specifics and schedule. There was also a large paper pad (27” X 34”) available for
detailing the findings and discussions of the JAD team. This pad was used to visually diagram
some of the team’s discussions on the validation process.
The four JAD participants were selected from the agency first based on their
qualifications as a police investigator as defined in this study. Additionally the subjects were
90

selected based on their willingness and cooperation to participate in the JAD session and to be
part of the JAD team. I coordinated directly with the police administration to arrange and select
these participants.
The Joint Application Development session was selected for this study as a method for
data collection because while the interviews allow us to capture the various details of
information validation from single users, it does not allow us to capture the same details from a
group of investigators at one time and in a workgroup format. Additionally, the JAD session
provided a conduit for the creation of an initial prototype model design using PFD (Process Flow
Diagramming) techniques that can be used as a base design for the final IDEF3 process model.
The JAD session began by setting up the assigned meeting room in an appropriate
fashion so that the participants could sit close to one another while I, as moderator, could be at
the front of the room while accessing the laptop and paper pad simultaneously. I began by using
a prepared PowerPoint presentation that explained the purpose of the session, the goals of the
session, and the procedures and guidelines of the session. Once I received a verbal agreement
from all participants that they understood all of the topics mentioned then, I continued.
The PowerPoint presentation transitioned into a series of questions derived from the
interview instrument designed to establish the group’s agreement levels of contributing factors to
the validation process of police investigators. A list of these questions can be found in Appendix
X of this document. With each question introduced to the group through the PowerPoint a group
discussion emerged and an ultimate group agreement or disagreement was established with each
proposal.
Upon completion of the initial project introduction portion of the JAD session the first
page of the paper pad was marked with a simple legend representing each of the model
91

components in different colors using colored Sharpie pens. The components included entities,
processes, and decisions that would be represented in the model. The group was explained
further that they were required as a group to document the specifics of the validation process that
they were experiencing upon being asked to validate the information provided to them by me in
the form of an investigative scenario.
The group was then read an investigative scenario which contained a piece of information
that needed to be validated in relation to the scenario. The group was then reminded that the goal
was to document these data using simple process flow description (PFD) techniques to diagram
the model on paper. The process ensued with me as the moderator and model designer being
directed by the group as they explored their own validation process with each other in a group
format. This process became an iterative process as they worked through the complete validation
process including all of their actions, processes, decisions and activities used during their
process.
Upon completion of the JAD session there emerged on 3 pages of the pad 3 unique yet
evolving diagrams that ultimately drove, in coordination with the other data collection methods,
the creation of the final IDEF3 model documented in this study. These model prototypes can be
found in both the model design section of this document as well as the figures appendix at the
end of the document.

92

3.8 IDEF 3 model design
The model design phase of the research roadmap consisted of the creation of the IDEF3
process model using the data collected from the data collection segment of the study. The model
shows, with regards to the information validation process of new information, the following
attributes of the process including:


Entities that are included or incorporated in any fashion during the validation process.



Physical or cognitive processes that are activated or performed during the validation
process.



Description and direction of information flows between the entities during the validation
process.



Any decisions made by the investigator with regards to the initiation of any physical or
cognitive processes.



Relationships between the various entities in coordination with the identified processes,
decisions, and information flows.
The general method of creating the process model for this study used the standard IDEF3

methodology included as part of the languages core definition. This general step by step process
guided my model development work so as to maintain a strict adherence to the IDEF3 design
principles. In this process the various entities, processes, decisions, information flows, and
relationships collected and identified during the data collection phase were transformed into the
various graphical elements that comprise the process schematics in IDEF3 modeling. These
elements included the IDEF3 Unit of Behavior (UOB) box, object symbol, individual symbol,
precedence link, junction, referent, and note.
93

As examples of how these elements were applied, the bulleted list below provides a
practical schedule as to the usage and application of the elements:


An object or individual symbol was used to identify entities like person, vehicle, and
location and so forth as they became evident as playing a role in the validation process.



Sub-processes such as asking a question or activities like visual scanning were considered
a common or repetitive activity that will use referents and notes to identify the activity as
a core component of the validation process.



Links were used to connect the various entities with each other as well as to connect and
direct the flow of any decisions or processes that may occur as part of the validation
process.



Activation plots were used to identify any entities or activities that seem to have a time
component or constraint to them so as to more accurately create a model that represents
the validation process.
In such a complex model as the validation of new information by police investigators,

there were portions of the model where a single process will branch into multiple unique
processes. When this phenomenon occurred the IDEF3 junction mechanism was used to clearly
and accurately represent this transition within the model.
Referents were used whenever additional clarity or description needed to be given to a
specific UOB or Object such as those objects that may use police language or terminology that
may not be clearly understood someone outside law enforcement.
Theorists often attempt to provide conceptual organization by using models. A model can
be viewed as a likeness of something and consists of symbols or characteristics of some
94

empirical phenomenon including its components, represented as logical arrangements of
concepts. A model helps to order and simplify our view of reality by representing its essential
characteristics in abstract form (Frankfort-Nachmius and Nachmius 2000). To a great extent, the
usefulness of a formal model of a process lies in its ability to accurately predict the behavior of
the executing process. Similarly, the usefulness of an executing process lies largely in its ability
to fulfill the requirements embodied in a formal model of the process (Cook and Wolf 1999)
I opted to design a model to adequately document and communicate the information
collected during the research portion of this study so as to most efficiently detail the process of
validating new information by police investigators. A model provides the discipline with a
practical tool that may be used by researchers in a multi-disciplinary context to apply the new
knowledge and science in a streamlined and efficient manner. In this case a model is now
available that represents an abstraction of the information validation process of a group of
professional investigators.
This knowledge can be used to test and compare the validation process of other
information seekers in an effort to better understand the information validation process of
information seekers in general. This knowledge can also be used in a more practical and
applicable fashion. For example, a curriculum developer either for law enforcement or civilian
investigative training programs may use the knowledge to develop more robust validation
procedures and techniques or a systems developer may use the knowledge whenever they are
required to integrate some sort of validation methodology into their system design.
In other words, understanding how information seekers validate information that is
presented to them greatly affects the way we think about our presentation modes and designs.
This knowledge may also help to design more applicable and effective training programs and
95

instructional materials. These materials and programs could be used by information professionals
to enhance the education of information seekers on the validation of new information as it is
encountered.
In order to best capture and represent the process descriptions emerging from the data
collection portion of this study, they must be documented and symbolized with a language that
has been developed and designed for the capturing of process descriptions. For this reason the
IDEF3 Process Description Capture Method was selected for the model design.
One of the most common communication mechanisms to describe a situation or process
is a story told as an ordered or partially ordered sequence of events or activities. For example, an
engineer often describes the design process of his company by telling a story about a product that
was recently developed. Likewise, a shop floor supervisor may describe the operation of his
manufacturing system by describing the process of building a product in his shop (Mayer et al.
1995).
The IDEF3 Process Description Capture Method was created specifically to capture
descriptions of sequences of activities. The primary goal of IDEF3 is to provide a structured
method by which a domain expert can express knowledge about the operation of a particular
system or organization. Knowledge acquisition is enabled by direct capture of assertions about
real-world processes and events in a form that is most natural for capture. This includes the
capture of assertions about the objects that participate in the process, assertions about supporting
objects, and the precedence and causality relations between processes and events in the
environment (Mayer et al. 1995).
IDEF3 was chosen for this study to represent the validation process of new information
by police investigators because of the need to capture descriptions of sequences of various
96

investigative activities. In addition to these activities, the representation of the various related
activities and the dependencies of the various elements within the process was also able to be
accurately represented. An IDEF3 process description organizes the network of relations
between situations in a specified scenario. IDEF3 descriptions are developed from two different
perspectives: process-centered and object-centered. Because these approaches are not mutually
exclusive, IDEF3 allows cross-referencing between them to represent complex process
descriptions (Mayer et al. 1995). This was important for this study since the validation process of
the police investigator will a complex sequence of interrelated elements need to be efficiently
abstracted and visually represented in a way that can be understood by future researchers.

97

CHAPTER 4. Analysis and Findings
4.1 Introduction
One of the primary goals of this study was to collect data regarding the information
validation process of police investigators in order to create new knowledge so we can better
understand the validation process in general. This new knowledge will ultimately help us move
towards a solution to the established research problem for this study. The specific problem for
this study is that the absence of a structured systems process model detailing the validation
process of new information by a group of investigative professionals contributes to an
incomplete understanding of the validation process of information seekers in general and
ultimately, a research void within the discipline of Information Science.
There were 3 specific goals to this research that I set out to achieve. The first was to
identify the entities, processes, and decisions experienced by a police investigator during the
validation process and understand the relationships between them. The second goal was to
document those entities, processes, and decisions in a structured process model using IDEF3
methodologies, language, and symbolism. The third was to establish a set of empirical guidelines
and procedures on the practical and applicable usage of the new model by future researchers to
better understand the information validation process of information seekers. At the completion of
this study, using the described methodologies, I have successfully identified the entities,
processes, and decisions experienced by police investigators during their validation process and
the relationships between them. Additionally, I have successfully created an IDEF3 process
model of the validation process of police investigators, and finally I have successfully created a
new research framework that can be used by future researchers to test the validation process of
other groups of information seekers.
98

This section of the study presents, reviews, and discusses the procedures and methods
used during the data collection process of the study and provides data in both aggregate and
detail forms that adequately support the claims made by me through the findings that have
emerged from the research. In this section I discuss in detail the various activities and
experiences of 3 specific data collection methods used for this study including Semi-Structured
Interviews, a controlled experiment, and a Joint Application Session.
Each of these methods incorporated qualified voluntary subjects and included a single
subject for instrument pre-testing, 15 interviewees, 25 experiment subjects, and 4 JAD team
members. Both the interview questions and disparity experiment scenarios were pre-tested in an
open interview style with a single qualified police investigator to establish question quality. In
total, data was collected from 45 individual police investigators representing 7 different law
enforcement agencies and also representing 3 different agency sizes as defined in this study.
In order to more efficiently report the findings of this study the results have been
summarized categorically within this introduction and then detailed more specifically within
their own appropriate areas of this findings section. There were essentially 6 different categories
or groups of findings that emerged from this study and its methodologies that are reported here.
These categories include the general findings of this study, the answers to the specific research
questions posed in this study, the acceptance or rejection of the various propositions established
for this study, the unforeseen emerging data and discoveries that were made during this research,
the newly created IDEF3 model of the information validation process of police investigators, and
finally the newly created empirical research framework for the future analysis and measurement
of the information validation processes of various groups of information seekers .
Combined, these various findings create a domain of new knowledge in the area of
99

information validation that allowed me to understand more clearly the information validation
process of professional investigators. I have chosen to discuss these findings and relay them to
the reader in their associated categories for readability purposes.

4.2 General research findings
Based on the data collected, compiled, and analyzed throughout this study employing the
various research methods associated with this study I found that:


When required to validate new information content being presented to them from an
information source, police investigators consider disparities between the behavioral,
physical, visual, and evidentiary forms of information surrounding the information source
and the investigators own personal knowledge base and experiential database.



In general the validation process of police investigators was initiated by a need for
information generated by either a directive from police dispatch personnel or supervisors
or by the police investigator’s requirement to resolve a recognized disparity between
current existing conditions and the investigators subjective view of what would be
considered normal for the existing set of circumstances.



Police investigators use their knowledge base and experiential database to create a virtual
descriptive scenario or predisposition of what they expect to find before the validation
process begins.



Police investigators use an abductive process through a questioning and information
exchange process to test the details of their own scenario moving towards the best
possible explanation of their observations.
100



There are 2 specific constraints within which the information validation process of police
investigators lies and those are one, the legal limits of their validation processes and two,
satisfaction of the need for validation accordance with the job and not from a personal or
subjective point of view.



It is uncertain, based on the findings of this study, if the audible form of information
surrounding or emanating from an information source plays a role in the information
validation process of a police investigator.



As the information validation process begins, a police investigator accepts that there is a
possibility that their original predisposition will be incorrect and inaccurate but that an
abductive approach is both safer and more efficient than an inductive approach.



Police investigators employ a limited series of practices that aid them in validating new
information as it is presented to them from the information source. These include the
asking of questions with unknown answers, the asking of questions with known answers,
and the presentation of false information intentionally for the purpose of eliciting
previously unknown information required for complete validation.



Police investigators view each validation opportunity through a subjective context lens
comprised of several factors. These factors include the plausibility of the information
being received, the corroboration of the information by other means, the authority or
character of the information source (does this person have the background to state the
information), how the information is being presented, the time of day the information is
being received, where the information is being received, and the prior history of both the
information source and the geographical location. It is through this lens which the
101

ultimate acceptance of the validity of information is reached and also from which the
information validation process is controlled. Any incongruence between the variables of
the subjective context lens forces the police investigator’s validation process into an
iterative state using the previously mentioned practices in the move towards validation.


Police investigators create an Information Bridge from an information source that has
exhausted its knowledge or usefulness. At this point the information source becomes a
potential bridge to another information source that may provide the required validation of
information that the investigator is attempting to achieve.



Police investigators appear to try and attain some level of integrity quickly from an
information source from which they base their initial trust level during the rest of the
validation process.

4.3 Research question answers
This study focused on identifying and modeling the information validation process of
police investigators and maintained 3 specific research questions that I needed to answer in order
to collect the data necessary to build the new model of information validation. Using the various
data collection and analysis methods established for this study I have successfully attained
answers to each of the 3 designated research questions established for this study. For readability
purposes I have structured the answers to these questions in Table 1 below.
The answers to the following research questions were attained using the summary data
compiled from the various research methods utilized in this study. With regard to the semistructured interview results, these data include the interview question statistics, the comments
made by each subject in addition to their question answers, and the recorded and transcribed
narratives performed by the subjects. With regard to the experiment results, the data includes the
specific proposition statistical results from the 25 subjects, and with regards to the Joint
Application Design (JAD) session the data includes both the model prototype designs and the
various pertinent comments made by the participants during the session. The methods used to
transform the data into the research question answers including entities, processes, decisions,
relationships and inter-dependencies are detailed in the Table 1 below.
The process used for transforming the data into the specific entities, processes, decisions,
relationships, and inter-dependencies required to provide answers to the research questions was a
basic form of content analysis. Content analysis is a careful, detailed, systematic examination
and interpretation of a particular body of material in an effort to identify patterns, themes, biases,
and meanings (Berg and Latin 2008).
For this study a basic, yet systematic, review of the various data was performed to
103

identify the unique entities, processes, decisions, relationships and inter-dependencies that exist
and comprise the information validation process of police investigators. In general the various
data were reviewed identifying the various components based on their operational definitions for
this study. The following section summarizes for each research question the data used for each
answer, the method used to answer the research question using the summarized data, and the
contents of each answer for all 3 research questions.

Behavioral, physical, visual, possibly audible, and evidentiary forms of information
are delivered from information source in parallel with each other.
Forms of information above are received in parallel with the information content
needing validation
Both legal limitation of potential actions and job requirements act as dual
constraints on the process
The police investigator evaluates contextual variables during their validation

RQ3:

Data Used:

Method:

Does a disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement and the
information originating from its surrounding fundamental sources, lead a police investigator
to require additional information before considering a piece of information valid?

 Interview questions and statistics
 Results and findings from coded data of talk aloud sessions

Answer:

process. These variables include time of day, geographic location, past history of
both information source and geographic location, character of source, authority of
source, presentation of source, and corroboration of information with other sources.
As these variables change the investigator may require more information before
validation in declared.
The iterative and repetitive state of the validation process is triggered and
controlled by the context variables identified in this study
Comparison of information to personal knowledge base governs disparity sensing
Evaluation of a disparity is dependent on the investigators personal knowledge base
and may vary
Investigators actions including asking a question with an unknown answer, asking a
question with a known answer, and introducing false information are dependent on
the individual investigators knowledge base and sense of disparity between the
information content and the surrounding forms of information

Statistical results from the disparity experiment were considered to support that each
of the behavioral, physical, visual, audible, and evidentiary forms of information
were evaluated for disparity by the police investigator
Statistical results from related interview questions were considered regarding the
behavioral, physical, visual, audible, and evidentiary forms of information to support
that each were evaluated for disparity by the police investigator
Results from the coded talk aloud sessions were considered support that each of the
behavioral, physical, visual, audible, and evidentiary forms of information were
evaluated for disparity by the police investigator

It has been discovered through this study that a disparity that has been experienced by a
police investigator between the information being presented to them and any of the various
forms of information surrounding the information source including behavioral, physical,
visual, potentially audible, and evidentiary information lead a police investigator to require
additional information before considering a piece of information valid. Additionally it has
been discovered through this study that the absence of such disparities leads a police
investigator to consider a piece of information valid.
Note: Although results show that audible information is sometimes considered during the
validation process by some investigators, the study does not produce conclusive results in
this area and requires further study.
110

4.4 Proposition evaluation results
This study included 6 specific propositions associated with the sensing of disparity by
police investigators between the five fundamental forms of information identified in this study
and the information content itself. These information forms included behavioral information,
visual information, physical information, evidentiary information, and auditory information.
Additionally this study proposes that the lack of any disparities between the 5 information forms
and the information content would more likely lead a police investigator to consider a piece of
information valid.
The information in the following table is representative of the data collected through the
disparity controlled experiment performed on 25 subjects during this study. Detailed statistics of
the study can be found in the experiment section of this document.

Supported
(Y/N)

A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement
and a person’s physical appearance will lead a police investigator to require
additional information in order to consider a piece of information valid.
A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement
and a person’s behavior will lead a police investigator to require additional
information in order to consider a piece of information valid.
A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement
and the physical evidence surrounding that person will lead a police
investigator to require additional information in order to consider a piece of
information valid.
A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement
and auditory emanations surrounding that person will lead a police
investigator to require additional information in order to consider a piece of
information valid.
A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement
and the visual emanations surrounding that person will lead a police
investigator to require additional information in order to consider a piece of
information valid.
A lack of any disparity between the information contained in a person’s
verbal statement and the visual, behavioral, audible, evidentiary or physical
sources of information surrounding that person will lead a police
investigator to consider a piece of information valid.

In summary, the results of the disparity controlled experiment strongly support that police
investigators consider an information sources behavior during information delivery, the physical
attributes of the source, the evidentiary accretions surrounding the information sources physical
environment, and any visual emanations that may be emitted from the information source or
surrounding the information source. The results of the experiment also show that audible
emanations emitting from the information source are considered during the information
validation process in a no more than chance probability at best and do not strongly suggest that
this is considered regularly during the process.
112

These experiment results stemming from the formal testing of the established
propositions for this study are also supported by the other data collection methods used for this
study including results from both the semi-structured interviews and the JAD session.

4.5 Emerging data discoveries
During the data collection portion of this study including semi-structured interviews, JAD
session, disparity experiment, and the talk aloud session there were various emerging themes and
new findings that presented themselves as my research progressed. These findings were possible
primarily due to the ability of the subjects to express themselves to some degree in the various
methods.
To a greater and more detailed extent the various comments made by the subjects during
their explanation or detailing of an answer to me provided a richer pool of data that could be
used to explain certain phenomena as they arose. The semi-structured interviews provided
freedom to the subject to expound on their answers verbally, the experiment subjects had the
ability to detail or explain their answers in writing, and the JAD session allowed a group of 4
subjects to speak in one voice during a very interactive and collaborative event. Combined, this
additional data provided me with the ability to draw certain conclusions in addition to the various
data already collected.
Individual notes, comments, or soliloquies made by the subjects during their interaction
with me during the various data collection methods of this study were addressed in essentially
the same manner. The notes were made on the individual research documents being used for that
subject’s session and then later compiled into a single document showing all notes for that
specific method or procedure from all subjects. From this notes document a very basic content
113

analysis was performed where I read through each of the notes made by the subjects and
organized them into various emerging themes as they made themselves evident. These themes
were then converted, in coordination with the standardized data collected, into the various
requirements for the new model design including entities, decisions, processes, relationships, and
interdependencies.
The various emerging discoveries made during this study include the following:
There is a contextual lens that a PI validates information through that may change based on
variables including time of day, geographic location, past history of both information source and
geographic location, character of source, authority of source, presentation of source, and
corroboration of information with other sources.
There are 2 specific constraints within which the information validation process of police
investigators lies and those are one, the legal limits of their validation processes and two, the
satisfaction of the need for validation accordance with the job and not from a personal or
subjective point of view.
Police investigators view each validation opportunity through a subjective context lens
comprised of several factors. These factors include the plausibility of the information being
received, the corroboration of the information by other means, the authority or character of the
information source, how the information is being presented, the time of day the information is
being received, where the information is being received, and the prior history of both the
information source and the geographical location.
It is through the context lens above that the ultimate acceptance of the validity of
information is reached and also from which the information validation process is controlled. Any
incongruence between the variables of the subjective context lens forces the police investigator’s
114

validation process into an iterative state using the previously mentioned practices in the move
towards validation.
Police investigators use their knowledge base and experiential database to create a virtual
descriptive scenario or predisposition of what they expect to find before the validation process
begins. They then use a deductive process through a questioning and information exchange
process to test the details of their own scenario moving towards the best possible information for
their purpose.
As the information validation process begins, a police investigator is expecting and
accepting that their original predisposition will be incorrect and inaccurate but that a deductive
approach is more efficient than an inductive approach. This is primarily due to a probability of
accuracy due to various factors such as location, time of day, and past history of both the
location and the individuals involved and also more effective from an officer safety perspective.

4.6 Instrument pre-testing
For both the survey instrument and the disparity experiment testing scenarios a pre-test
was performed with a single police investigator during an informal open discussion regarding
each of the interview questions and scenarios. The topics covered for each question and scenario
included the clarity of question wording, topical nature of the question, appropriateness of
professional terminology, and the ability to provide an applicable answer to the question. The
following were the issues identified by the subject as possible issues and challenges with each of
the instrument components.
While testing the experimental scenarios with the subject the following comments and
challenges were made with respect to the scenarios.
115



Scenario 1
o Due to the scenario beginning with the officer being dispatched to an event, you
may find that this places them into a mode of distrust since they have already
been told that there is something wrong.



Scenario 2
o You may see “need more information” responses because the officer in the
scenario is looking for the owner of the store and if this is not what the particular
officer/subject would do first then it may automatically place them in a need
mode.



Scenario 3
o This scenario adequately represents a lack of disparity between factors that would
cause an investigator to question the validity of the information provided.



Scenario 4
o This scenario adequately represents a disparity in expected behaviors of the
information provider



Scenario 5
o This scenario adequately represents the introduction of a visual indicator from the
information provider



Scenario 6
o This scenario adequately represents the introduction of physical details emanating
from the information provider



Scenario 7
116

o This scenario adequately represents the introduction of noise or sounds from the
information provider


Scenario 8
o This scenario adequately represents physical evidence surrounding the
information provider
During pre-testing both non-disparity scenarios 1 and 2 had potential validity issues

according to the single subject evaluation because of contextual challenges that may lead some
of the subjects to adhere strictly to police process requiring more information regardless of the
subject’s individual decisions. These two scenarios were not included in the final data analysis
used for the model creation.
While testing the interview questions and investigative scenario for the talk aloud session
performed by the subjects the following comments and challenges were made with respect to the
questions and the scenario. Essentially all of the question formats were easily understandable and
the questions were clear and answerable by the subjects. There was an overall warning that
because the subjects were trained law enforcement officers that I may experience the subject’s
need for officer safety and general personal security that may need to be considered when
reviewing the results of the subject sessions.

4.7 Semi-structured interview results
The data from the semi-structured interviews performed for this study is comprised of 3
individual pieces including the subject’s answers to closed ended questions, the subject’s
answers to open ended questions, and the subject’s recitation response during the talk aloud
session of the subject’s own validation process. Additionally the data includes various
117

explanations of certain answers given during the interview where the subject experienced the
need to expound on their answer. Because of this structure the data were compiled and analyzed
in both a quantitative and qualitative manner to extract the most meaning out of the data.
This section is separated into 3 categories of data analysis including statistical analysis,
notes and explanations, and the talk aloud sessions performed by the subjects. The various
sections use descriptive statistics, basic content analysis, and multi-coder content analysis with
basic observed reliability testing respectively to analyze the data.
The interview portion of this study provides data from several different but unique
components involved in the interview process. These components need to be analyzed and
summarized so they may be included into the new model. The first component is the responses to
the 5 point scale questions to measure agreement levels with the specific question topic. The
second component is the responses to the general questions of always, sometimes, never
responses to measure agreement levels with the specific question topic. The third component is
the responses to the open ended questions which were designed to capture the subject’s opinions
on certain topics. The fourth component is the individual subject comments and remarks in
addition to their answer to the question. Finally the fifth component is the subject’s talk aloud
recitation regarding their own personal validation process in response to the scenario.

4.9 Talk aloud session content analysis and coding results
During the process of each interview and upon completion of the closed and open ended
questions each subject was asked to recite out loud their validation process once they were read a
basic investigative scenario by me. This recital was digitally recorded and was then transcribed
by me for all 15 subjects. An exhaustive coding frame and recording document was created so
that a coder could read each transcription and then assign the associated codes to that document
for which they thought applied to the subject’s recital. If a coder ran across something that they
felt was not in the coding document then they would place notes in the other section of the
document. An example of this process would be if the transcription read “well, first I would
judge his body language” the coder would place a check in the YES box in the PI considers
behavior during their validation process option.
This process was performed by 2 individual coders for all 15 subject’s transcriptions and
the results were tabulated in a single document using 1’s and 0’s or Yes and No answers they
provided. To estimate inter-coder reliability I simply used the calculated observed agreement
percentage for the both sessions. Although I considered using either Cohen’s Kappa or
Krippendorf’s Alpha for a more robust coefficient of agreement, I ultimately decided against it.
The primary reasoning for this was the limited number of subjects, codes, and coders for the
session did not support the use of such formulations and additionally, the specific coding method
I used may have also skewed such results from either method. All observed agreements were
over 60% and most were over 80% between both coders providing an effective level of intercoder agreement for the study component.
The results of the coding session were determined by using a basic percentage calculation
of Yes agreements to No agreements for each code considered during the process. If the
125

calculation was 70% or greater meaning there were 70% or more Yes’s over No’s, then the code
value was considered supported while if the difference was 30% or less the code value was
considered unsupported. Any calculations between 30% and 70% was considered undetermined
by the study method. The limitations of this method were evident as the subjects were only asked
to evaluate a single investigative scenario that could not include the multitude of parameters
looked at for this study. For this reason there were outcomes of this portion of the study that do
not directly correlate with result data collected from other methods of the study.
An example of this was that the code value need for information was officer initiated was
unsupported because the scenario presented to them was clearly and evidently a directed dispatch
from headquarters. This is not in line with the interview data which clearly shows that the need
for information stems from both an administrative directive and an officer initiated observation.
Regardless of the limitations, the value of the data is established with a triangulated data
collection process providing supporting data for all supported code values. This provides
empirical data to be incorporated into the new model design. Table 8 and Table 9 on the
following pages include the inter-coder reliability figures, and the actual summarized results and
findings from the coding process. The coding instrument can be found in Appendix B of this
document.

4.10 JAD (Joint Application Development) session results
The purpose of the Joint Application Design session that was performed for this study
was to collect data from police investigators working in a group to gauge agreement levels on the
various components and processes of the information validation process. Additionally the JAD
session was designed to ultimately create early prototypes of an information validation model
using simple process flow diagramming (PFD) symbolism to illustrate those components and
processes.
The JAD session took place at a large police agency as defined in this study and was
comprised of 4 team members all meeting the qualifications of police investigator as defined by
this study. The session took place in a private meeting room located on the police agency
premises and was moderated by me. The following steps then took place with the assembled
JAD team consisting of the 4 police investigators.


The team was presented with the topic of the study and with some general
background of its need and importance. The team was explained the details of the
session and how it will be run.



The team was made aware of session expectations as to what information and
documentation we wanted to come out with in the end.



The group was shown a PowerPoint session with some general study topics based
on the interview questions and asked to agree or disagree as a group on each one.



The PowerPoint culminated with the last slide that showed a text based police
investigative scenario also taken from the interview instrument.



The text based scenario was read aloud by me to the group and then the group was
asked to collaborate on diagramming their validation process while it was
129

occurring.


The group diagramming process began and progressed in a series of 3 diagrams of
escalating complexity as the process moved forward.



Each diagram was created using Sharpie markers of varying colors and was
created on a large paper pad that contained each diagram on separate pages.

4.11 JAD session and model design results
The JAD session resulted in 3 individual and unique diagrams using process flow
diagramming techniques representative of the group’s collaboration on the identification of the
validation process of new information by police investigators. The knowledge that emerged from
the session and that was acquired from the diagrams contributed greatly to the final model
design. The following diagrams represent the digital replication of the three model designs that
emerged as a result of the JAD session.
Each of these model prototypes can be viewed on the subsequent pages of this document
in the order of their emergence within the JAD session. These model prototypes have been
identified as JAD PFD Prototype 1, JAD PFD Prototype 2, and JAD PFD Prototype 3. In
addition to these products of the JAD session there also is my own prototype model using
process flow diagramming techniques that emerged from the combination of JAD prototypes and
the other data collected in this study. This prototype is identified as Nizich PFD Prototype 1 and
can also be found in this section.
It is important to note that this section of the document is meant to be read as an
incremental and sequential series of events and activities leading to the ultimate creation of the
IDEF3 model of the information validation process of police investigators. For this reason the
130

final IDEF3 model was placed at the end of the sequence and at the end of this section of the
document.
The series of activities leading up to the IDEF3 model design included 15 semi-structured
interviews, 15 talk aloud sessions, 25 disparity experiment subjects, a 4 member JAD team
design session, and the prototype model design I created from a combination of data collected in
this study. The final IDEF3 model results took into consideration all of the results from the
above methods used in this study.
There were 3 separate and unique model designs that emerged from the JAD session
based on a few contributing factors. Primarily, as the group began to work together out loud and
in a collaborative environment they come to some sort of a conclusion about the validation
process and then one of the members would introduce a second set of variables or scenarios that
placed the current model in question. By the end of the third model prototype design all members
of the team felt that the third model captured what they had agreed on as a team.

131

Figure 7: JAD PFD Model Prototype 1

This first prototype created by the JAD team was the product of an initial discussion
session between the investigators of what they agreed on was an accurate representation of the
information validation process of police investigators. The prototype lost merit once several
members of the team introduced the concept that all of the components correctness rely on what
context the information is provided in which this model did not include.

132

Figure 8: JAD PFD Model Prototype 2

This second prototype created by the JAD team was the product of continued discussions
between the investigators on how context plays a role in the validation process. Their
discussions focused on the concept that overall everything could either be considered valid or
invalid based on the context in which the information is provided to you. This prototype lost
merit once several members of the team introduced the challenge that it really did not represent
the step by step process they go through from start to finish during validation.
133

Figure 9: JAD PFD Model Prototype 3

This third prototype created by the JAD team was the final product of the JAD session
and represents the entire discussion of the JAD team during their collaboration and prototype
designs. This prototype took into consideration that there is a step by step process that
investigators follow, that disparity evaluation plays a role in their validation process, and that the
context in which information is received is greatly considered during their validation process.
134

Figure 10: Model Prototype Design Using Process Flow Diagramming (PFD)

The process model prototype in figure 11 was created as part of this study in preparation
for the creation of the final IDEF3 model of information validation of police investigators. This
prototype emerged from the preceding 3 prototypes models created by the JAD team in addition
to the data collected from the interview, talk aloud, and experiment portions of this study. These
results combined with the existing knowledge acquired from the identified literature for this
study enabled me to create the prototype as a final version before the completion of the IDEF3
model.

4.12 The validation process of new Information by police investigators in IDEF3 format
One of the primary purposes of this study was to create a process model of the validation
process of police investigators using a standardized modeling language. To accomplish this there
were several techniques used to convert the data into the process model and were adopted from
the IDEF3 recommended procedures for model design. IDEF3 was designed to work
independently or in concert with other IDEF methods.
IDEF3 recommends the use of an iterative and repetitive process for converting data into
models and this process was utilized during this research to create the model. The general
recommended methods are to collect the data, classify the data, validate the data, and then refine
the data. A more detailed explanation of each of these recommended steps can be seen below.
Collect: Acquire observations and written descriptions of both process instantiations and
generalizations across process instantiations.


Classify: Individuate situation types, objects, object types, object states, and relations.



Organize: Assemble the data that has been collected and classified using IDEF3
structures.



Validate: Ensure that the statements made in IDEF3 are grammatically correct and that
they corroborate with the collected descriptions of the actual or idealized situation.



Refine: Make adjustments to the existing structures to incorporate newly discovered
information, to simplify the presentation, or to highlight important elements of interest.

IDEF3 states that the recursive application implies that the same development process
continues until the information and knowledge available in the domain has been collected and
organized into a structure that satisfies the termination conditions of description development.
136

The following graphical representation of the validation of new information by police
investigators is what emerged from implementing the above process using aggregated data
results from the various data collection methods associated with this study.
The answers to the study research questions emerged from the data collected and
analyzed. I transformed the entities, processes, decisions, relationships and interdependencies
into the IDEF3 model. Using answers to the research questions, the model prototypes that
emerged from the JAD session, and the process information collected from the study subjects,
the following list was compiled. The IDEF model was created to represent the items in this list.
1. The information validation process begins when a police investigator either makes a
personal observation that needs validating or is directed by their administration to
validate information.
2. A police investigator establishes the known details of the situation requiring validation
including the physical location, location history, subject history, and time of day.
3. A police investigator compares the known details of the situation to their own personal
knowledge and experiential database.
4. The police investigator establishes a pre-disposition as to what they think is happening
based on the results of step 3.
5. The police investigator establishes contact with the information source in one of three
ways. They ask a question with a known answer, they ask a question with an unknown
answer, or they introduce false information to the information source.
6. During initial contact with the information source the police investigator is receiving
information simultaneously from the behavioral, physical, audible, visual, and
evidentiary sources surrounding the information source.
137

7. The police investigator evaluates both their legal and occupational constraints asking
both “Am I legally allowed to perform this validation” and “Am I supposed to perform
this validation”.
8. If operating within both constraints the officer evaluates the context variables for the
information including the plausibility of the information, the presentation of the
information, the authority of the information source to make the statements, and the
corroboration of the information from other information sources. The time of day,
location, location history, and information source’s known character and history are also
evaluated.
9. The police investigator either recognizes or does not recognize a disparity between the
information provided and the behavioral, physical, audible, visual, and evidentiary forms
of information surrounding the information source.
10. If a disparity exists then the police investigator is forced into an iterative process with the
information source requiring more information to declare validity. This information is
acquired in one of three ways including asking a question with a known answer, asking a
question with an unknown answer, and introducing false information to the information
source.
11. If a disparity does not exist then the police investigator will make a decision as to
whether the information is valid or not.
12. Based on the type of decision maker the investigator is they will either declare the
information valid without any personal doubt or they will declare the information valid
but with remaining personal doubt.
13. If the police investigator declares the information invalid they will then repeat the process
138

requiring more information before they declare the information valid.
The IDEF3 model contained in the following pages graphically represents the information
validation process of police investigators and was created from a combination of the answers to
the research questions posed in this study, the model prototypes created during this study, and
the descriptive narratives of the information validation process provided by the research subjects
during this study.

4.13 Experiment results
The disparity experiment was designed to test the validity of the 6 individual propositions
associated with this study. The propositions below were tested using the experiment procedures
documented in the methodology section of this study.
P1:

A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement and a
person’s physical appearance will lead a police investigator to require additional
information in order to consider a piece of information valid.

P2:

A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement and a
person’s behavior will lead a police investigator to require additional information in
order to consider a piece of information valid.

P3:

A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement and the
physical evidence surrounding that person will lead a police investigator to require
additional information in order to consider a piece of information valid.

P4:

A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement and
auditory emanations surrounding that person will lead a police investigator to require
additional information in order to consider a piece of information valid.

P5:

A disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement and the
visual emanations surrounding that person will lead a police investigator to require
additional information in order to consider a piece of information valid.

P6:

A lack of any disparity between the information contained in a person’s verbal statement
and the visual, behavioral, audible, evidentiary or physical sources of information
surrounding that person will lead a police investigator to consider a piece of
information valid.

CHAPTER 5. Discussion
5.1 Introduction
In this study I explore the information validation process of a group of professional
investigators for the purpose of recording and modeling their information validation process. The
study focuses on the identification and documentation of the entities, processes, and decisions
experienced by a police investigator when validating new information provided to them by an
information source. The study broaches but intentionally does not cross the academic boundaries
between information science and various other disciplines such as psychology, cognitive
psychology, and behavioral psychology.
For this reason there are many findings and behavioral phenomena in this study that we
can theorize have explanations within these various other disciplines and their associated
foundational works. However, there would need to be a focus on these specific areas during
future research efforts within this domain to truly identify why some of these behaviors are
occurring from a psychological and behavioral point of view. The primary focus of this
discussion segment is to discuss what this study contributes to the discipline of Information
Science.

5.2 Contributions
This study provides the discipline of Information Science with several contributions that I
will discuss in detail during the rest of this section. The first contribution that this study makes is
an empirically supported introduction through its literature review to the idea that there exists a
need for further research on the topic of information validation. The expansion of research and
inquiry in this specific area could provide very valuable content to researchers who seek to
148

understand the information validation process of information seekers.
The second contribution that this study makes is an understanding of the validation
process of a group of professional investigators. By having an understanding of the validation
process of a group of professional investigators we have new knowledge that we can use as a
baseline to compare against other groups of information seekers. This means that we have a
foundational plateau that we can now launch a series of new research projects from in order to
attain a deeper and richer understanding of the validation process of information seekers. This
creates a series of research goals within the discipline of Information Science including the
possible future discovery of a general model of the information validation process of information
seekers or possibly a series of ethnographic models of the information validation process of
information seekers. I believe that the emergence of either direction of new research would be
both interesting and useful to the discipline of Information Science.
The third disciplinary contribution that this study makes is the introduction of a process
model of the validation process of professional investigators. This model may be used by
researchers within the discipline of Information Science as well as by researchers from other
disciplines. Industry experts may also use the model in a variety of ways to potentially enhance
our understanding of the validation process. By deciding to use an existing structured modeling
language like IDEF3, the model is more easily and readily adaptable to a variety of uses in a
variety of disciplines.
The fourth contribution that this study makes is the introduction of an empirical research
framework for the study of the information validation process. The specific combination of
research methods used for this study including semi-structured interviews, talk aloud sessions,
disparity experiments, and a joint application design session has provided data that has shown to
149

be useful in identifying and modeling the specific attributes of the validation process. This may
be valuable for future researchers in this area because the design and framework of the multifaceted methodology may be adapted and used by other researchers for their own studies.
The above contributions made by this work also create a new research void generated by
some of the limitations of this work. Many new questions arise from the discoveries made by this
research that now need further and deeper investigation to obtain a complete understanding of
the contributing factors of the information validation process. One question that arises from the
research is whether all information seekers use a similar validation process. Conversely, another
question that arises from the research is whether different groups of information seekers maintain
their own unique validation process.
These questions, once answered, will move the discipline of Information Science in one
of two directions. The research direction will move either towards a standard model of
information validation or towards a series of unique models based on the attributes of the
specific ethnographic group of information seekers.

5.3 Theoretical and disciplinary contributions
I discuss in this section the theoretical and disciplinary implications of this work and how
the existence of the new model of information validation may affect future research in the field
of Information Science with regards to information validation. When a new model emerges
within a discipline there is traditionally a number of additional works that evaluate and validate
that model. Proposals for this future research can be found in the future research section of this
work.
In this study I create a new model of information validation within the discipline of
150

Information Science. The theoretical and disciplinary implications of such a model may be
important because there is now the ability to compare, very specifically, the information
validation process of various groups of information seekers to the new model. Additionally in
this study I use a combination of research methods and techniques that have shown to be
successful and from a disciplinary point of view may affect research methods in certain areas.
The individual methods used in this study, as well as the specific combination of the methods
used, provide a unique research framework in which to study topic experts and collect their
unique and descriptive processes.
One of the primary theoretical and disciplinary implications that come out of this work is
the ability of future researchers to be able to evaluate the information validation process of
various groups of information seekers in comparison to the new model. One of the potential
disciplinary implications that may emerge from this study is the use of a combination of research
methods to collect a very unique and individual process such as information validation and
ultimately be able to generalize it in some way, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This
combination of methods including interviews, talk aloud sessions, disparity experiments, and a
Joint Application Design (JAD) session was able to identify the details and components of a
complex process from a series of topic experts to a granular level so that a process model was
able to be created in order to relate that process to other researchers.
Because of this success there may be disciplinary value in such a combination of research
methods to collect data from topic experts and diagram them in a way that’s communicative to
readers. Two of the methods used in this study including Joint Application Design (JAD) and
IDEF3 process modeling provide a business process modeling approach to collecting and
illustrating the scientific data collected from the subject experts. In this way we can use existing
151

knowledge in these areas to better and more effectively communicate processes attained from
subject experts in various areas of research within the discipline.
One possible area of theoretical and disciplinary implication that arises from this study is
the concept of the evaluation of intangible attributes. This is the notion that when evaluating a
complex process that involves a series of definitive actions, the process may also involve a series
of intangible components as well such as the sensing of disparity. The methodology used in this
study provided one approach to investigating these intangible components that may help future
researchers to analyze similar activities of other groups of information seekers during their
validation process.
For this study it was imperative to establish a method to evaluate the sensing of disparity
between information content and the various forms of information from and surrounding the
information source. Accomplishing this through the methods used for this study establishes the
potential to study anomalies or abstract concepts like these in a scientific manner.

5.4 Future research
With the introduction of a new empirical model of a complex process such as information
validation there are essentially three specific areas of emerging research that I think will need to
evolve to increase the usefulness of this work.
The first areas of research are the continuing works in the area to further support and
validate the existing model. These future works may continue to add merit to the model while
most likely also providing a series of modifications and enhancements to the model as we have
seen in other various disciplinary models. I think that the most important part of this process will
be the expansion of the population sample beyond the 45 subjects used for this study since the
152

small sample size for this study was a noted limitation.
Additionally I feel that the model validation process needs to expand the sample to
include investigators of different gender, age, and ethnicity to attain a deeper understanding if the
various validating methods and abilities are constrained by any of these variables. An example of
such a study would be on a group of 45 female officers between the ages of 30 and 45 as an
example of a more focused study to find various anomalies in the model and its embedded
processes.
The second area of research that I see evolving is the application of the new model
towards the understanding and exploration of other groups of information seekers. One of the
interesting things that I look forward to possibly understanding one day is if other groups of
information seekers (e.g. medical information seekers) validate information in a similar fashion
to police investigators or will it be a drastically different process. I believe that as a discipline the
potential of establishing a standard model of information validation one day would be very
useful, however discovering that each and every group of information seekers maintained a
unique validation process would be just as interesting. This new model provides us with the
toolset to now investigate and explore these areas in a scientific manner.
The third area of research that I see emerging form this study is the application of the
model to various exiting models and frameworks. One of the observations I have made in this
study was the absence of detailed validation methodology and process in some of our
foundational models. I envision the exploration of a series of models currently existing that now
may include an information validation component to them using this new model and research
framework.
In summary, as a discipline we now have a new model of information validation that
153

provides us with a baseline process that we can compare, through scientific method, the
information validation process of various groups of information seekers to a group of
professional investigators.
From a future research perspective one of the primary goals I believe is to continually vet this
new model and to move towards the understanding of its place within the discipline either as a
standard model or as a unique model of a specific group of information seekers.

154

CHAPTER 6. Conclusion
6.1 Summary and conclusion
This study explores the information validation process of police investigators. The
purpose of the research was to create a formal process model of the information validation
process of a group of professional investigators. In this study I argue that the existence of such a
model will help researchers in various disciplines by providing a baseline to which the validation
process of other groups of information seekers can be tested and compared.
The study subjects consisted of 45 police investigators and data was collected using 4
distinct methods including semi-structured interviews, talk aloud sessions, a controlled
experiment, and a Joint Application Design (JAD) session. The research culminated in a new
process model of the information validation process of police investigators. The study also
provides a new research framework for the future exploration of the information validation
process of various groups of information seekers.
Several new discoveries emerging from the study include, but are not limited to, the
findings that when validating new information, police investigator’s consider disparities between
the behavioral, physical, visual, potentially audible, and evidentiary forms of information
surrounding the information source and the investigators own personal knowledge base and
experiential database.
Other discoveries made were that police investigators use their knowledge base and
experiential database to create a virtual descriptive scenario or pre-disposition of what they
expect to find before the validation process begins. They then use an abductive process through a
questioning and information exchange process to test the details of their own scenario moving
towards the best possible explanation of their observation.
155

In conclusion the study provides a new model of information validation illustrating the entities,
processes, and decisions that comprise the process as well as the relationships, interdependencies, and constraints that govern it. Using professional investigators as study subjects
provides merit to the model as a baseline or foundation to which we can now begin to study and
compare the information validation process of other information seekers to the new model.

SCENARIOS
For the next portion of the study I will read you a series of short investigative scenarios. After I
have finished reading each scenario, please talk through your professional process and
experience of validating the information in question. Please be as detailed and as specific as
possible during your answer.

You are working on patrol. On Saturday morning you are dispatched to a
disturbance call on the corner of seventh and elm. This area is best known for
its upper class residents, good school districts, and a very low crime rate. Upon
your arrival you notice a man sitting in his running Dodge Caravan on the
corner reading the newspaper. You approach the vehicle and ask the man what
he is doing there and he states “I am waiting for my wife to come out so we can
go shopping”

Please talk aloud through your professional validation process and experience
that you would go through to determine that the specific information “I am
waiting for my wife to come out so we can go shopping” is either valid or
invalid.

APPENDIX E: IDEF 3 MODELING SPECIFICATIONS
In general, when using IDEF3 to collect and organize these descriptions, the following
five steps are applied recursively. These steps are defined in the IDEF3 definition as collect,
classify, organize, validate, and refine and are detailed below as far as their applicability to this
project.
Collect: Acquire observations and written descriptions of both process instantiations and
generalizations across process instantiations. This will be achieved by means of the semi
structured interviews and the joint application development (JAD) session as described in the
methodology of this study.
Classify: Individuate situation types, objects, object types, object states, and relations. This
process will be accomplished through both the content analysis and coding of the interview
transcripts as well as the completion of the final JAD Session document.
Organize: Assemble the data that has been collected and classified using IDEF3 structures.
During this process the discovered and identified entities, processes, and decisions experienced
by police investigators during the process of validation of new information will be materialized
into a process model using IDEF3 UOB’s, objects, junctions, referents, and links.
Validate: Ensure that the statements made in IDEF3 are grammatically correct and that they
corroborate with the collected descriptions of the actual or idealized situation. This portion of the
process will be achieved by systematically comparing the data from the coding documents and
JAD session document to make sure that all of the discovered entities, processes, and decisions
have been included in the process model.
Refine: Make adjustments to the existing structures to incorporate newly discovered information,
to simplify the presentation, or to highlight important elements of interest. This part of the
191

process will consist of a complete and general evaluation of the model with respect to the
information collected through the research process in collaboration with existing information
discovered through the literature review process.
Language and symbolism:
The following diagram represents the IDEF3 language and symbolism that will be used to
identify the various entities, decisions, and processes and the relationships between them as the
validation process starts to emerge.
