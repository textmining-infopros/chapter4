Abstract
Studies on the topic of library use by millennial students have called for more
qualitative studies to support the quantitative data. This study used a survey and face-toface interviews to collect qualitative data from freshmen students at the University of
Baltimore, in order to better understand the mental model that students have of the
library’s information organization system as well as the basis of students’ perceptions of
the library and its services. The responses to the survey provided insight into students’
basic understanding of the library online catalog’s information organization system.
Other findings from the survey and interviews generally support those in other similar
studies and several new themes were identified in the students’ perception of the library
in relation to their academic work. Together, these insights offer suggestions into ways
that librarians can better support students in terms of reference services and library
information.

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the
library in order to improve library help services

Introduction
	  
Reference transactions have been in decline in academic libraries nationwide over
the past decade. Librarians and information science researchers have examined possible
causes of this decline from various perspectives, in particular that of the academic
library’s main user group: students. The Online Computer Library Center (OCLC), a
global co-operative that provides technology and research services to its members,
published a user perception and library usage report in 2011 (Gauder, 2011) as a followup to a similar 2005 report (De Rosa, 2005). The report summarized the research findings
on the effects of economic and technological changes in library usage and user behavior.
The economic recession of the previous five years have led to increased library usage by
the American public as they turned to the library for free resources. The report described
an increase in the usage of both lending material and computer terminals with Internet
access. In this way, the library provided support to job seekers and others who needed
access to information and technology. Advances in technology enabled more people to
own smartphones and other mobile devices that changed their information seeking
behavior as they started to use more digital resources. Libraries began to offer more
mobile services to enable patrons to connect to their catalogs and other web services
through their mobile devices.

The research also showed an overall decline in the use of academic library
electronic services from library websites to electronic journals and online databases by
college students since 2005. This decline began around the same time the Internet started
becoming an integral part of the information environment and a new generation of
students known as “millennials” started entering colleges. This group differed from
previous generations of college because millennials had grown up in an environment
where information is mostly digitalized and connectivity to Internet is considered an
essential part of school. These students would have been accustomed to using the Internet
for schoolwork and using online search engines to find resources.

The hypothesis for this study is that most students enter university with a basic
idea of the academic library collected from prior experiences with school and public
libraries. However, this idea or schema does not seem to undergo further development
during subsequent interactions with the library, leaving students still unsure on how to
search for resources at the academic library. The study will also attempt to uncover in
greater detail the initial ideas that students have about the academic library and how they
perceive the way in which information is organized in the library. This knowledge can
then be used to improve the design of existing library enquiry and research services so
that it can support users’ in developing a better understanding of how the library works as
they make use of library services.

Literature Review
The existing literature on student information seeking behavior at the academic
library show that students find difficulty in using the library’s online catalog even though
they use Internet search engines extensively (Griffiths & Brophy, 2005; Catalano, 2013).
They have trouble finding resources in the catalog and often turn to Google instead. The
numerous descriptions of the students’ frustrations and lack of success in using the
library could be attributed to their understanding or mental models of how information is
organized in the library. Students seem to expect the library’s online catalog to function
the same as an Internet search engine and this is apparent in their search strategies
(Augustine & Greene, 2002; Griffiths & Brophy, 2005). It is not clear when and how
these mental models and perceptions were formed. By gaining a better understanding of
the perceptions that students have about the library and its online catalog, librarians can
develop more effective ways of correcting misconceptions during library instruction
sessions or reference information. These findings can then be included in library
information sessions and applied in the design and delivery of the different library
services.
A mental model, as defined in the field of interaction design, is the understanding
a user carries in his or her mind of how a system works. This understanding, or mental
model, is “often partial and even incomplete” (Johnson & Henderson, 2011, p. 9).
Norman (1988) describes the user’s mental model as a construct that is created from the
user’s interaction with the system. Thus, mental models are personal and vary between
individuals. Johnson and Henderson (2011) list the characteristics of mental models as

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

being “personal, partial and dynamic” (p.10), meaning that mental models are open to
change and evolution. Conceptual models, on the other hand, are the “ideal mental
model” (Norman, 1982) or “idealized view” (Johnson & Henderson, 2011). A conceptual
model is the view adopted by the designers or architects of a system, which in this study
also includes the librarians. Designers use this view to envision how users will navigate
the system. However, users may not interact with the system in the way the designer
intended. Although a user need not be aware of how a system is designed in order to use
it (Crilly, 2011; Morville & Callender, 2010), a clearer understanding or richer mental
model makes for more effective users. Norman (1988) points out that one indicator of a
good mental model “lies in its ability to provide meaning to things” (p. 69). A mental
model should help the user make sense of the logic behind the design, and a welldesigned system responds in the way in which the user expects it to. Such a system
should also support its users in learning how to use it from their interactions, without
making the users go through a tutorial or help manual. Designers should also have an
understanding of users’ mental models when designing a system, and Norman (1988)
goes as far as to warn that if the designers’ conceptual model is not clear and consistent,
the user may end up with the wrong mental model or wrong assumptions about how the
system works. This could result in an experience that leaves the user feeling frustrated
and confused.
The challenge in seeking a better understanding of the user’s mental model lies
with gaining access to the mental model that a user has in his or her mind. Norman
(19832) observes it is difficult for users to articulate their mental models of how

something works. Johnson and Henderson (2011) also note that “mental models cannot
be observed directly and users can rarely describe them accurately” (p. 21). The fact that
mental models are difficult for people to articulate makes the study of mental models a
challenge. In order for researchers to attempt to create a description of users’ mental
models, they must do so by observing people’s behavior and asking detailed questions
about their actions and expectations. Holman (2009) attempted to get students to explain
their mental model of how a search engine worked as part of a study on understanding the
students’ search strategies. In addition to verbal descriptions, the researcher asked
participants to draw their mental models of the relationship between their search terms
and results. Most drew flow diagrams but nothing that indicated the relative strength of
relationships between search terms. The task of visualizing the relationship between
search terms and results was too complicated for novice users. Another construct similar
to the mental model is the schema or one’s expectation of how something should work,
based on information collected from prior experiences. This expectation of how a system
works plays a large part in guiding user’s behavior. According to Minsky (1988), we use
“frames” to help us understand and navigate a new scenario. A frame is a data structure
that contains information about the scenario. This information helps us expect what will
happen next and know what to do if these expectations are not confirmed. In other words,
this information is a type of script for user behavior. Today, this data structure is known
as a “schema”. When a suitable frame cannot be found, we use the closest approximation
available to us. In the context of the library, how does one find a frame for a novel
situation for example, in the case of students who have never been to an academic library

before? In his paper, Minsky (1988) describes the cognitive process that occurs if a
suitable frame cannot be found as “alteration and modification” (i.e. learning takes
place). “View-changing”, as Minsky (1988) calls this process, is a form of problemsolving and learning. This process occurs when one enters a place with certain
expectations of what to find in the place and what to do in that place. These expectations
may have come from previous experiences or exposure. For instance, one might expect
an academic library to use a layout that is similar to that in a public or school library
where books on related subject matters are located close to each other.
The library usage studies reviewed here were conducted on populations in a
variety of academic institutions within the United States and in the United Kingdom, but
the themes and the participant responses are similar enough to form patterns about
students’ information-seeking behavior and how they impact library reference and
research services. The findings from Catalano’s (2013) meta-synthesis of studies on
graduate students’ information-seeking behavior showed that while the Internet was often
the first destination for student research, students acknowledged that sources from the
Internet were often unreliable and that they “contributed to information overload”
(Catalano, 2013, p. 259). Another finding was that low usage of more authoritative
library resources was often due to lack of knowledge and awareness about library
services and research databases. A study by Washington-Hoagland and Cloughery (as
cited in Catalano, 2013) reported that 70% of students surveyed rarely made use of
interlibrary loan service or the library’s webpage.

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

Studies on library usage in undergraduates have shown that students often have
the perception that the academic library is complex and difficult to navigate. In Mellon’s
(2015) qualitative study on students’ feelings about using the library for research, the
terms “scary, overpowering, lost, helpless, confused, and fear of the unknown” (Mellon,
2015, p.278) appeared frequently in the participants’ self-reports. One participant
summed up the general feeling: “The library can be an overwhelming place to someone
who doesn’t understand how to use it.” (p.279). This feeling of being overwhelmed stems
from the students’ unfamiliarity with the library and a lack of library research skills,
which in turn affects the way students approach research work at the academic library.
Students also perceive that conducting research in the academic library is timeconsuming and requires more effort compared to doing a search online. A participant in a
Web generation study by Holliday & Li (2004) had this to say about the information
search preference of her peers:
As I said [the] Internet is, like, the main source for students … I guess I thought
that it was like the best place to find information, because it's so easy and you can
just type it in, because we are from the microwave generation or whatever they
call us. (p. 356).
In a study of 38 college students in the United Kingdom, Griffiths and Brophy
(2005) investigated the ways in which students search for research-related information.
They found that 45% of students used Google as a starting point for locating information
whereas only 20% turned to the university library catalog (Griffiths & Brophy, 2005).
According to the study, students preferred online search engines as sources of

information because they are familiar with them, and these search engines previously
provided successful result, or “tried and tested” as described by a participant. Internet
search engines were also described as being “simple but complete” and “very straightforward” to use (p. 545).
The choice of the Internet as the starting point for student research has been
correlated with other studies since the mid-2000s (Fister, 2002; Sobel, 2009; Ismail,
2010) when Internet searching became another option to finding information at the
library. Searching on the Internet through Google appeals to students because they can
receive instant results with relatively low effort, and studies on the attitudes of the
students have shown that students do value time savings above reliability of sources. In
the study by Valentine (2001) compared undergraduate students’ perceptions of academic
effort with that of their professors, and found that both parties differed on what is
considered “a legitimate effort”. The professors’ expectation of a reasonable effort is
closer to that which is described in Kuhlthau’s (1993) framework of information search
where the learner has to go through the various stages and experiences including
uncertainty and frustration, in the quest for information. Investigations into students’
information-seeking behavior frequently make reference to this model of information
search process proposed by Kuhlthau (1993) in which the early stage of the information
search process is described as an experience “fraught with uncertainty and confusion”
(Kuhlthau, 1993, p. 344). The Kuhlthau model takes a constructivist approach to
information-seeking and describes the information search process as one in which users
progress through a series of six phases or stages beginning with the initiation stage,

8

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

followed by “selection, exploration, formulation, collection and presentation” (Kuhlthau,
1993, p. 342). These stages represent specific tasks and actions related to the process and
are accompanied by related feelings and thoughts. For example, the feelings experienced
in the first three stages include that of uncertainty, frustration and even doubt as the
searcher or learner begins the information search before passing into the later stages as
the search task becomes more focused, providing clarity, a sense of direction and
confidence. This unavoidable “principle of uncertainty” in the search process seems to be
the aspect with which students are most uncomfortable. Perhaps this is what contributes
to the anxieties associated with research: the uncertainty and confusion during the
exploratory stage that Kuhlthau describes as the being the “most difficult stage for users”
(p. 343). As novice researchers, undergraduate students might not know that these
feelings of uncertainty and frustration are unavoidable in the research process and must
be experienced before one can arrive at the turning point of “formulation” when the
information finally starts to make sense.
While the faculty may want students to experience all stages of the informationseeking process as part of the learning process, students preferred direct answers
presumably to avoid the frustration of “uncertainty” and to save time. In the interviews
with undergraduates, Valentine (2001) discovered that students were “pragmatic” in their
approach to schoolwork, weighing the academic and personal value of each assignment,
and allotting the corresponding effort spent. This finding is key because it reveals the
decision-making process behind how much time and effort students are willing to invest
in research for an assignment. A portion of this calculation includes the willingness to

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

seek reference help or be satisfied with the professor’s expectation, otherwise as known
as “WPW” – “What The Professor Wants” (Valentine, 2001, p. 109). This practical
approach towards academic work has also been noted in more recent studies on students’
attitudes towards research. Mizrachi and Bates (2013) observed that the primary
motivating factor in undergraduates’ academic goals were grades rather than studying for
the “altruistic pursuit of knowledge for its own pleasure” (Mizrachi & Bates, 2013, p.
1954). Undergraduates were also primarily concerned with saving time and they expected
“instant gratification” (Mizrachi & Bates, 2013, p. 1954) when conducting research work.
These attitudes explain the rationale behind students’ preference of Internet search versus
using the academic library for research.
George, Bright, Hurlbert, Linke, St Clair and Stein (2006) conducted a study on
the ways graduate students searched for information in which student search methods
were described as “lacking in sophistication”. The researchers observed that
“convenience” in obtaining the information was a deciding factor on the selection of
information resources. This behavior is not much different from that of undergraduate
students in similar studies. The findings from this study showed that graduate students
rely on librarians in locating and using resources and recommended that library
information sessions cater different levels of research experience, even though they were
all graduate students. In a comparative study between the research behavior of graduates
and undergraduates, Georgas (2014) found that undergraduates believed that they were
skilled at research when they were in fact being undiscerning with the credibility of their
results and employing unsophisticated search methods. Catalano (2013) made a

comparison of both graduate and undergraduate information-seeking behavior and
described the following as shared characteristics:
•

Both groups used the Internet as starting point for research

•

Both groups felt there was an “information overload”

•

Both groups accepted materials of lower quality or reliability in relation to
time-saving

The differences were that graduate students were able to employ coping
mechanisms and strategies such as:
•

Use of “chaining” or “chasing” (following of reference lists)

•

Use of Google Scholar for quick reference retrieval (as compared to simply
using the sources from Google Scholar)

The final point on the use of Google Scholar as a supplementary interface
suggests that the process of retrieving sources through Google Scholar takes less time
compared to using library’s online search, even for non-novices. From these studies it
appears that while students have no trouble in finding information online, they still need
help in locating credible, relevant resources and evaluating the information that they have
found. Young (2013) observes that as Google becomes the preferred starting point for
students and libraries cannot match Google in terms of convenience and online
accessibility, librarians should use the opportunity it presents as “teaching moments”
instead of disapproving the use of online search engines for student research.

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

In an attempt to understand what motivates students to ask for help at the library,
Sobel (2009) asked freshmen students what were the factors that led them to seek help
from library services. Students cited explicit instructions to use the library from the
professor as the most compelling reason to ask for reference help. Other factors such as
library information sessions and library outreach were ranked much lower. The study’s
sample population had only been on campus for a few weeks when they were surveyed,
and this condition meant that their responses are representative of incoming students who
had not yet really experienced academic life and were in fact, relying on prior experience
or possibly a library instruction session received as part of their freshmen orientation.
Ren (2000) conducted a study to evaluate the extent of library instruction on student selfefficacy in the areas of performance and behavior when conducting electronic
information searches at the library. The study involved 85 undergraduates enrolled in an
introductory English composition class at Rutgers University. One of the conclusions
from that study was that negative emotions such as confusion, irritation and frustration
did have an adverse impact on students’ self-efficacy (Ren, 2000). In other words, those
who had a poor search experience due to lack of library instruction would be less likely to
engage in future information searches at the library.
The issues of changing information-seeking behavior and needs have become
more critical with each incoming student cohort that has grown up using the Internet
extensively. A decade ago, Oblinger and Oblinger (2005) depicted the profile and
information-gathering preferences of “Net Gen college students” as an implication for
university libraries. They described a possible dichotomy between faculty, library

administrators and these “Net Gen” students in terms of attitudes towards scholarly
research. This divergence in mindset has been reduced in recent years as other aspects of
students’ online information-seeking behavior began to emerge. Researchers in the topic
of library use discovered behavior that was contrary to assumptions about the ability and
preferences of net generation or millennial patrons. Holman (2009) found that despite
their reliance on Internet search for school-related work, millennial students were not
savvy with library e-resources such as databases. They had difficulty finding relevant
databases and cross-searching between databases. Ismail (2010) also discovered trends in
library help preferences that go against the net generation profile. The undergraduates
who responded to the 2010 survey showed a preference for face-to-face or in-person
research assistance, rather than through online channels such as chat or social networks.
Mizrachi and Bates (2013) in their ethnographic study on undergraduates’ academic
information management habits also refer to first-year undergraduates as “digital
natives”, who are thought to prefer their academic information world to be a completely
digital one. However as the findings indicate, this is not always the case. The information
world of a student can be described as an “ecology” of both physical and digital
interfaces, with students employing a mix of both in their study worlds instead of a solely
digital one. This conclusion has direct implications on library and research services in
terms of the format and media in which they are best delivered to students. Insights like
these highlight the need for observing, documenting and understanding patron behavior
before designing services that cater to certain user profiles or certain trends.

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

Much research has been dedicated comparing the usability of the Internet search
interface and that of the library online catalog and other online library systems. In one
usability study on library websites, it was observed that the student participants’ lack of
understanding and awareness of library resources that affected their ability to complete
the information-seeking tasks more than the layout of the website (Augustine & Greene,
2002). Studies on student search behavior in the library often make the comparison
between Internet search and the electronic library catalog search system. Likewise, there
have been attempts to make the library search experience seem more like an Internet
search although this does not appear to be the solution if users do not understand what is
going on behind the apparently simple interface (Lown, Sierra & Boyer, 2013).
Concealing the complexity of the library online catalog behind a single search box might
increase library search utilization but does not improve the user’s understanding of the
library search process. The library’s federated search and discovery layer collate results
from the different sources such as external databases as well as the library’s own
collection. Users can make use of a controlled vocabulary (Holman, 2009), wildcard and
Boolean searches for retrieving more relevant results. The journals contained within these
databases do not always have titles that reflect their content, so the searcher needs to
know which terms to use. New terms take time to be entered into the scholarly lexicon so
certain search terms may not yield results in academic databases. The query systems
used in the library search interfaces were originally designed for highly skilled searchers
such as librarians and not for novices (Borgman, 1996), and so they remain difficult to
use because they are not intended to mimic the information-seeking behavior of an

ordinary user. The user should have an idea of how the information is organized and an
understanding of how the system works. This is a completely different approach from the
design of a typical online search engine, where the intention is to simplify the interface
and provide a low entry barrier for all users. For instance, Google employs a natural
language search mechanism that provides results regardless of how the query is phrased.
Beyond the design of the library online services, libraries have over the past
decade taken a more personal and pro-active approach to meet changing user demands.
The literature on reference services includes investigations on taking a more pro-active
and user-centered approach to reference services. These reference services include
embedding librarians into courses and employing roving librarians, both of which involve
an active engagement with the users, compared to the traditional reference help desk
model. Another approach is the “personal librarian” where library services are
customized to meet the user’s specific needs and requirements. Priestner and Tilley
(2010) describe this “personalized boutique” approach modeled after customer service in
the retail and hospitality industry, with a focus on specialized knowledge. This involves
investing time in learning about user needs, cultivating user relationships and
customizing services to meet individual needs. Such highly personalized and customized
services and programs are costly to maintain in terms of staff commitment and economics
therefore it is important to establish what type of reference help service best meets
students’ needs and preferences although the return on investment can also be high. The
success factors in the boutique library model, as described by Tilley (2013) depend on
knowledge of users’ specific needs, their preferences and methods of working (p. 83)

with the objective of providing service driven by user needs, not procedures. The guiding
principles behind boutique library models often challenges assumptions the librarians
might have about their users. Tilley (2013) describes how two libraries in Cambridge
successfully adopted the boutique library model to better serve patrons. One library was
situated in the English faculty and the other was located in the Judge Business School.
Both libraries conducted user research and collected user feedback on a regular basis to
keep up with user needs.
It is clear that libraries play an active role in helping students achieve academic
success, which is a key institutional goal, thus student engagement in the library is an
important issue for institutions for higher learning. Pellegrino (2012) reiterates the need
to halt this decline of library use amongst students because the academic library is in real
danger of becoming irrelevant to students in this age of instant information. Most of the
research done on the topic of students and library has been conducted by librarians
(Catalano, 2013), which could signify that more diverse views are needed in terms of the
way the topic is approached, for instance from the perspective of user researchers and
interaction designers. Many of the studies on library usage also recommend that more
qualitative studies be conducted to better understand students’ perceptions regarding the
different aspects of the library services (Robinson & Reid, 2007). A comprehensive and
regular study of user behavior and feedback such as the ones employed by the boutique
libraries would be a key feature at every academic library. By gaining insight to the
mental model that users have of the library, designers of the library experience will have
a better understanding of what goes on in users’ mind when they interact with the library

system. An in-depth knowledge of library users’ pre-existing assumptions and
perceptions can also help librarians improve the effectiveness of library instruction
programs by focusing on specific library features in the order of users’ priority and
interest.

Methodology	  
This study takes a mixed -methods approach and employs both quantitative and
qualitative methods in answering the research questions. Secondary data from two
student surveys administered by Langsdale Library were used in the initial inquiry into
students’ perceptions of the library. The surveys were part of the University of
Baltimore’s project for the Association of College & Research Library’s (ACRL)
Assessment in Action grant aimed at developing assessment of the University’s
information literacy program. The primary data for this study was collected through a
survey of freshmen students and face-o-face interviews with a smaller group of
participants.
The Langsdale Library is part of the University of Baltimore (UB) and houses the
physical collections and resources for all the academic programs except for the UB
School of Law. Langsdale Library currently occupies two floors of the Learning
Commons building. The library’s physical collection is located on the first floor while the
second floor contains computer workstations, group meeting rooms and individual study
rooms. The research librarians at the Langsdale also teach INFO 110, a 3-credit
information literacy class for freshmen as well as portions of WRIT 300, a writing and
research class that is required for all students.

Demographics of the Assessment in Action Fall 2014 survey respondents
These information literacy surveys were conducted in two parts: as a pre-test the
beginning of the semester and as a post-test at the end of the semester to collect baseline

improvement but did not provide an explanation for this improvement. This finding
provided the basis for some of the questions in the survey and interviews for this current
study, in terms of uncovering the role of the library in the self-rated improvement of
student information literacy.

Library perception and usage survey
The primary data for this study was collected from the Spring 2016 cohorts of the
INFO 110 and WRIT 300 classes. The goal of the survey was to learn about the mental
model that students have of the library’s online catalog. The survey also sought to verify
existing knowledge and perceptions about library resources and services as well as to
discover how students use the library. One of the considerations in the research design
was that the data would be conducted by a single researcher, and due to limitations in
time and resources, a survey was used as the first data collection method because it could
reach a relatively large number of respondents. The survey consisted of demographic
questions on the major, year of study, gender and age range of the respondent.
Information on race and ethnicity was not collected as they were not treated as variables
in this study. It was not within the scope of this study to consider the effect of these
variables. The other demographics were collected to ensure that was representation from
the different majors in UB and from both sexes. The full survey can be found in
Appendix B. The responses were collected from the questions listed below.

Questions 1 to 5 focus on gathering data about students’ expectations of what to
find in the university libraries, the role of the librarians, in order to build an inventory of
what is contained in the student’s existing schema of the library. The responses to
Question 6b and Question 8 form a rough idea of students’ mental models of both
Internet search engines and the library online catalog.
The second data collection method was a series of semi-structured, face-to-face
interviews with a smaller number of participants recruited from the survey respondents.
An incentive in the form of a $10 gift card was advertised at the end of the survey and
interested parties could leave their contact information along with their survey responses.
The researcher then contacted these students and arranged for interview sessions on
campus in late March and early April 2016. The students were interviewed individually,
and the researcher took notes and made audio recordings for transcription. Each session
lasted between 30 to 40 minutes with a total of seven interviews being conducted. The
interviews were conducted in a semi-structured format and this gave the researcher
flexibility to explore any interesting points that emerge. In this aspect, having a single
researcher conduct and record all the interviews proved advantageous as the order of the
questions had to be re-arranged, depending on the participant’s response. The sole

interviewer was also able to keep track of the main goals in the interviews and to probe
deeper if needed. The data was then transcribed and coded by the same researcher using
the interview guide in Appendix D.

Demographics of the library perception and usage survey respondents
With the permission of the class instructors, the survey was publicized in the
INFO 110 and WRIT 300 classes, to a group of approximately 552 students. Participation
was voluntary; some instructors used the paper version, and there was also an online
version for the eight WRIT 300 classes that were conducted online. In the survey for this
study, a total of 106 responses were collected, out of which 57 were from first year
students. Seventeen came from the online survey and the rest came from paper surveys
administered by the instructor during class. The study is interested in the data from the
group of students who at the time of the study had only been in UB for less than three
semesters and were mostly fresh from high school. They would have some experience of
the UB library and could still recall their first impressions of the university library. As
this survey was introduced to the class by the instructors, the introduction states clearly
that all information would be kept anonymous and participation had no effect on their
grade. It is worth noting that several of the class instructors were also reference librarians
and this could have had an effect on the participation rate and type of answers. The
demographic breakdown of the first year survey participants appears in Table 5.

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

Most of the respondents were between 18 -23 years of age (89.5%) with a
majority of females (61.4%). The majority of responses came from students in the Yale
Gordon College of Arts and Sciences (42.1%), and the rest were almost equally divided
between the Merrick School of Business (28.1%) and the College of Public Affairs
(29.8%). The distribution of respondents differs from the population in the Assessment in
Action Fall 2014 survey where the largest number of participants was from the Merrick
School of Business and the fewest came from the Yale Gordon College of Arts and
Sciences (Table 2). The second part of the study consisted of face-to-face interviews
with seven participants recruited from the library usage survey and conducted on-campus
over the period of a week. The participants came from all three colleges at UB. All seven
participants were between the ages of 18 and 21. They had all started at UB the previous
semester, straight from high school so they all had been at UB for the same length of
time. Four of the participants were male and three were female. For the purpose of this
study, each participant has been given a pseudonym. The participants’ demographics are
summarized in Table 8.

The follow-up interviews were arranged with participants of the survey as a
means of gaining further insight into the responses from the survey questions. The
interview questions were divided into three sections or topic areas:
1. Prior experience with libraries
2. Research habits and preferences
3. Experience with Langsdale Library
With the semi-structured format, the interviewer did not have to strictly adhere to
the question sequence in the interview guide, but followed the flow of the conversation
depending on the topics that emerged. The questions were also designed to encourage
participants to share stories starting with their earliest experience with the library. All the
participants had a prior experience with a library with the earliest experiences taking
place in elementary school library. The other libraries that were mentioned were located
in the participants’ middle school and high school as well as public libraries.

Assessment in Action 2014 survey results
The results of the Assessment in Action Fall 2014 post-test conducted by
Langsdale Library are presented in the tables below. Almost 70% of the 394 respondents
reported an increase of at least one level with 50.5% rating themselves one level higher at
the end of the semester. About 30% of the respondents reported no change and one
student rated their literacy skill as decreasing by one level. These self-ratings are
summarized in Table 9 and Table 10.

The data of interest in this study are the responses to the self-evaluation section of
the post-test attached in Appendix A and the responses to the optional open-ended
question: “What do you think contributed most to this change (if any) ”. The “change”
refers to the student’s rating of their research and literacy skill at the start of the semester
as compared to the end of the semester. Forty-four students provided a response to this
question. Most of responses listed the class instruction, coursework and instructors as
contributing factors to the positive change. The response below stands out not only
because the participant put in the extra time to answer this question and was clearly
interested in providing feedback, but also because it reflects the uncertainty that students
feel in the early stages of information search process:
I rated myself as fair in both cases. I have less confidence in myself than I did at
the beginning of the semester. Paradoxically, this is a good thing because my confidence
was buoyed by ignorance. I still suffer from having to write and cite at the same time. At
least I have a chance to improve in this area if I can keep passing classes and write more
using the appropriate citation style (Survey respondent).The respondent was one of the
only two students who rated themselves as “Fair” at the end of the semester. Coming
from a third year student, the response also reflects the “false” sense of confidence that
freshmen have about research because they are able to find information on the Internet. It
is in college that students are challenged in their search methods.

Results from the library perception and usage survey
The aim of survey was to collect information on students’ perceptions and usage
of the university library. In the first half of the survey, students were asked about their
perceptions and expectations of the library. The responses will help to establish what
students know about the university library and librarians, in terms of resources and
services. The questions in the second half were about students’ actual use of the library
including two questions on metaphors for the library online catalog and Internet search
engines.
In Question 1, students were asked to list the first three items that they would
expect to find in the library. The students’ basic schema of the library would consist of
these items. It was not surprising that almost half of the respondents (45.6%) listed
“Books” as the first item they would expect to find in the library. The same number of
respondents (45.6%) listed “Computers” as the second item, followed by “Librarians” as
the third item. Other terms that frequently appeared in all three items were “Printers” and
“Study spaces”.

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

Question 1 was an open-ended question and respondents were able to write
anything that comes to mind. Although this would make coding more difficult, the
rationale behind having an open-ended question was to allow participants to write
anything that came to mind. Most participants entered physical items but a few used
descriptive terms such as “great assistance” and “helpful resources”. The purpose of
Questions 2 to 4 was to determine the type of services students expect from the library
and librarians. The majority of responses indicated academic-related resources and help.
Amongst the six open-ended responses were “quiet study space” and “wifi”. The
responses shown in Table 12 reveal that the students mostly used the university library
and its website for starting their information search (84.2%), locating a resource for class
as instructed (82.4%) and for finding a specific resource (78.9%). The library as a
resource for verifying information was also one of the top selection with 68.4% of the
respondents indicating that they used the library and its website for that purpose.

Questions 7a, 7b and 7c were also about library help services. Thirty out of fiftythree participants said that they had asked a librarian for help before. In the responses to
“Question 7b: Where and how did you ask for help?” (Table 19), the majority of
respondents indicated they asked for help in-person at the library, a trend that is also
reflected in the follow-up interviews. Only two students (6.7%) asked for help through
email. None of the students had asked for help through the telephone or the online
LiveChat feature.

From the responses to Question 7c, the majority of students found the reference
help to be useful (78.3%) but 21.7% of the respondents felt that they had to figure out the
rest of the answer by themselves. Of the five students who felt that they still had to figure
out the rest of the answer to the question themselves, it is not known what was lacking in
the help they received. It could be that because librarians do not simply provide the
answer but give guidance and advice on how to find the information, the students might
have felt that they had to do some additional searching on their own in order to answer
the question.

Results of the follow-up interviews
All of the seven participants in the interviews had prior experience with school or
public libraries, with a few recalling their earliest experience with the library in
elementary school. It was observed that during their first few weeks on campus, students
tended not to explore library services but instead relied on information from class
instructors and friends. When recounting their first experience of Langsdale Library,
none of the participants mentioned exploring the library premises but went directly to the

computer workstations or help desk. Most of the participants had sought help at the
university library and this usually took place in their first few weeks on campus. The
students stated they want to do well in their first few assignments and were therefore
willing to approach the library for help. One participant said she approached the librarian
at the reference help desk for assistance in creating a reference list because “it was the
first assignment and I wanted to do well.” Other participants recalled asking the
librarians for help in locating books and in using the library online catalog. On the other
hand, the participants who have never sought reference help tended to perceive their own
research skills as being adequate.
Each participant was asked to compare their first experience with the university
library to their prior experiences with libraries in general. The size of the library was
mentioned as “surprisingly big for being on the third floor and just expanding out.”
Another aspect of the physical library frequently mentioned by the students was the study
spaces for individual use as well as group study areas. The majority of participants
reported feelings of being lost during the first weeks of class. Their first assignments
required them to use both the library online catalog and books as resources and one
participant admitted that he did not know how to look for books at the university library
during his first week on campus and had to ask for help at the front desk. Another
participant said she asked for help in locating the resources that were listed in the library
catalog search results, only to be told by the librarian that they were links to PDFs. Both
appeared to have been somewhat embarrassed by the incidents and were quick to point
out that they had since learned how to use the library’s resources. Other comments about

first encounters with the library involved the association of the library with computers.
This correlates with the responses in the survey where computers were listed the second
item, after books, as things students expected to see in the library. Interviewees also
mentioned that they made use of the library’s printers and scanners. Two participants
mentioned using other nearby university libraries, namely the Maryland Institute College
of Art (MICA) and Towson University library for scholarly research. They made use of
the physical resources located in those libraries. This shows that these students are
willing to spend the time to travel to another location to access a special collection. The
student who also uses the Towson University library does so because it is near his home.
He makes use of the Langsdale Library website and catalog even when he is at the
Towson library.
You	  can	  do	  that	  at	  home	  too,	  which	  kind	  of	  expands	  the	  length	  of	  the	  library’s	  
influence	  [...]	  if	  I	  could	  look	  up	  something	  here	  and	  continue	  at	  home,	  and	  still	  get	  
access	  because	  I’m	  a	  UB	  student.	  	  (Noel,	  Government	  &	  Public	  Policy	  major)	  
Even though students were resourceful in using the different libraries in the
university system, they did not make full use of the library services. The student who
went to the MICA library had not made use of the interlibrary loan services. He had
thought this service was only for physical books. He also assumed the loan request would
take too long to arrive even though he typically starts his research a full week before the
paper is due. He had not heard of interlibrary requests for digital resources. In another
instance a student was unaware of the reference help offered by the librarians: “I wish I
had known. If I had known I can get help from the librarians, I would go. There were
many times when I needed help” (Alice, Business major).

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

The participant above uses Google as her primary source of information, and
there were many occasions when she needed research help in assignments because she
could not find resources on the topic. She did not think that the librarians were able to
offer research help with class assignments. This is a case of missed opportunity where a
student who would have gladly sought help from the librarians but did not do so because
she was unaware that such help existed. However, not all participants were as uninformed
about the library’s research help services. Farah, a Finance major, had her first experience
with the library when she approached the reference help desk for assistance in creating a
reference list. She would not, however, ask the librarians for research help with an
assignment because she felt that the librarians would not be as familiar with the
assignment criteria compared to the tutors at the Achievement and Learning Center
(ALC) whose role is to help students with schoolwork. Another issue related to student
awareness of library services is the perception that librarians only assisted with physical
resources such as books. Shaun, an Applied Information Technology major said, “They
helped me find a book, but I never thought of them as helping me in research”. He added
that he did not think it was part of the librarian’s job to provide research help. Three of
the participants said they would ask for help with a book but not with digital resources.
Four of the participants had never approached a librarian for help. When asked why, they
said that they had not yet encountered any problems they could not solve by themselves.
Rae, a Psychology major, offered the following explanation, “Pride, I want to do this by
myself ... Feel like I kind of gave up.” Rae’s explanation reflects the attitudes of the
students described in the study by Clegg, Bradley and Smith (2006) on help-seeking and

self-esteem among students. The students did not seek reference help because they
wanted to complete the assignment by themselves and felt that asking for help would be
an admission of defeat. The participants were also asked if they would consider asking
for help through the other channels such online chat, email or phone. Rae said that
although she would not have a problem with using these channels, she would prefer to
ask for help in-person and “person-to-person interaction”. She explains why by adding,
“… it’s easier to understand you than a computer can, you don’t just use keywords, you
can describe what you are looking for and ask if they’ve helped anyone else with this
assignment or subject.” Another participant, Lauren, had more to say about using the
online help forum in Sakai, the learning management system used by all students at UB.
I hate doing that with them, like formal papers and whatnot. Just mainly I
find myself asking technical questions and I’ll ask a billion questions
which can be asked a lot faster in person (Lauren, Jurisprudence major).
All the participants preferred to seek help in-person, just like the students who
were surveyed in the study on net-generation help seeking preferences (Ismail, 2010).
Lauren offered this insight: “I’ve never asked a librarian [for help] online, I always feel
that when I talk to them, I feel it’s easier to get my point across and understand what I’m
trying to say.” Her explanation summarizes the main reasons why students prefer to ask
for help in person. They find it easier to describe their question or problem when talking
directly to the other party as compared to putting it into writing. In response to the
question on how much time they would allocate to research work on an assignment,
several participants said that they would first find out the professor’s grading criteria and

44

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

use that as a guide on how much research to do. The students were also pragmatic in their
approach to assignments and this meant giving themselves ample time for research and
stopping when they were tired, although one admitted to often “cramming the night
before”. The preoccupation with the grading criteria matches Valentine’s (2001) account
of how students were using “what the professor wants” as their main guide for research
work. In fact, one of the participants said that she did not approach the librarians for
research help because she thinks that although they can help in looking for information,
but not to “satisfy the professor’s criteria”. She would rather approach the tutors at the
Achievement and Learning Center “because they know the criteria and what the professor
is looking for.” Thus, the students in the interview group are very mindful of meeting
criteria and “fulfilling the teacher’s’ grading criteria.” However, students were not solely
motivated by grades and meeting the professor’s criteria. When asked if they found any
aspect of the research process rewarding, they provided a range of responses. One student
liked how she develops the research question through the process of research and starts
gaining a “vested interest” in the results. One student even compared the process of
evaluating the credibility of resources to “investigative work.” Another felt triumphant
when she found “the source or article in a journal that ties everything together.” The start
of the information search process was frequently described as being confusing,
overwhelming and frustrating. She described the difficulty of the process as, “having to
sift through one by one, wade through piles of other people’s research trying to find
something that you can use.”

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

Five of the participants reported that most time-consuming and tedious part of the
research process was the actual reading of the resources and evaluating their credibility.
In the response to the question on problems encountered during the research process, the
participants often shared what they learned in the information literacy classes, and it was
interesting to hear the ways in which they applied this knowledge. The students liked
learning how to use advanced search methods, in particular, Boolean operators. In the
response below, the student wishes they had been taught this search method earlier:
	  
The Boolean operators are very interesting, I didn’t know you could do
that. I learned about them this semester, but it probably would’ve been
helpful to learn that last semester just because they help broaden the way
you research a lot, because you can say multiple things and expand and
you can search multiple things at one time (Shaun, Applied Information
Technology major).
Another student found that Boolean searches provided results that were “very
quick and specific” when used in the library catalog. The topic of the library catalog
came up in the responses to the questions on the research process. The participants
described the problems they faced when using the online databases:
	  
A lot of topics I tend to want to do are newer, environmental policies and
topics that deal with the city of Baltimore specifically... very current or
there isn’t much of it at all or there hasn’t been much research done on

it… hard to have new research put on the library database because it has to
be peer-reviewed (Noel, Government & Public Policy major)
This student felt that there was more results in Google and fewer in the library
catalog because they have to be peer-reviewed before being included in academic
databases. He also said that it was hard to have “new research” put in the library catalog
because it would have to be peer-reviewed and that takes time. Students were concerned
with “peer-reviewed” articles and “scholarly journals”, two terms they seem to have
acquired from the information literacy class. They also have the perception that only
peer-reviewed articles are credible enough to use as sources. Lauren described the
problem of finding credible sources online:
False information. There’s a lot of websites where they don’t say its .gov,
.edu and .com, that’s what really gets you. But they are the majority of
websites that you’ll find information [...] I have to compare their
information with another website to make sure both add up. So sometimes
I’ve had to go across three websites to make sure the information adds up,
because they include advertisements on the side, and I’m not sure if they
are credible or not.
It appears from her response that resources from websites which end in .com are
automatically viewed as not credible as were web articles that had advertisements
embedded in them. It also seems that students took a literal approach in evaluating online
resources. The participants felt that information found in the library database was

© 2016 Veronica Ling Ling Ng

47

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

credible and trusted the information they retrieved from the library search. When asked
how he decided whether a particular journal was a credible source, the student replied:
I kind of trust the library on this one and say that maybe the ones that are
brought up in the first page of the search would hopefully be most relevant
- and if I go on and I read it and if it’s not I’ll go back and search. Usually
the library is very trustworthy with its top sources (Shaun, Applied
Information Technology major).
From his reply, it seems that this student trusts the library’s search system to
provide the most relevant and credible resources and the trust appears to have come from
experience with using the results from the library catalog search.
	  

Discussion
From their selection of metaphors, respondents to this survey revealed that they
mostly had inaccurate mental models of the library’s online information organization
system. In response to Question 6c of the survey where participants were asked to select
the metaphor that best described the library online catalog, the majority of the
respondents chose Option 1 – Filing Cabinet (Table 22). This suggests that they think of
the information organization system library online catalog as one where all the
information comes from a single source or location. The selection also indicates that the
respondents were unaware of the federated search system used in the library online
catalog and their understanding or mental model of the catalog was incorrect. Other

results from the survey confirmed some of the existing knowledge about students’
perceptions and usage of the library:
•

Preferred to seek library help in person

•

Felt that their search skills were adequate and had a sense of ownership in
their work

•

Used the library’s technological support such as computer terminals, scanners
and printers

During the course of the face-o-face interviews, some additional and interesting issues
emerged:
•

Students associated the librarians and library services with physical resources
such as books

•

Students tended not to explore the library by themselves

•

Students appreciated learning advanced search methods from the library
instruction

Mental model of the library’s online search
In the survey, students were asked to select the metaphor that they thought best
describes the way in which information is organized in the library online catalog. The top
choice of metaphor for the library online catalog was the filing cabinet, which is mapped
to the perception that the information is organized as a single source or database. The fact
that this metaphor was the top choice amongst survey respondents indicated that most of
them thought of the information in the library online catalog as coming from a single

49

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

source, rather than being collated from different databases. This choice of metaphor
suggests that students have an incorrect mental model of how the library’s online catalog
works. They are unaware of the multiple sources indexed and this could have affected the
way they searched the catalog. If students were aware that the results of their search
query originated from different databases, they could improve their search results by
selecting the most relevant databases to search. The filing cabinet was also the top choice
for describing Internet search engines, although not many students chose the same
metaphor for both search systems. This shows that they are aware that both systems are
different even if the metaphors selected are incorrect. Library instruction could have an
explanation on how a federated search works and how students could improve their
results by specifying which databases to search when providing reference help. A
comparison between the way information is collated in the library online catalog search
and Internet search engines could be provided in a visual form to help students
understand the differences. Having a more accurate representation of how their search
query is interpreted by the library catalog search system could help students navigate the
catalog and better understand how to retrieve relevant results.

Help seeking preferences
Most of those who sought help from the library had done so in person, and none
of the survey participants used the telephone or via the LiveChat function. A few had
used email for seeking library help. These findings match those of other studies on library
help-seeking preferences of millenials (Ismail, 2010) in that they prefer to seek library

50

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

help in person despite attempts by the library to provide online channels. The main
reason for this, as described by the interview participants was that they found it easier to
communicate and describe their help request face-to-face. They felt they could better
explain the problem in person. Although the participants in this study did not express any
fear or anxiety about asking for reference help as described in some of the studies on help
seeking at the library (Fister, 2002), a few did mention feeling self-conscious about
walking up to the help desk and asking for help. If students do not like to use existing
online channels and are also reluctant to approach the physical help desk, a third way of
delivering reference help needs to be found. Perhaps the problem lies with the students’
inability to describe a reference query in writing. This could be due to their inexperience
as researchers and limited vocabulary in the area of reference search. One way to
overcome this problem could be to provide users with an online template for creating a
reference query. Students can select from the options in the template to construct their
query instead of creating one from scratch. The use of auto-complete or suggested queries
similar to those used in online forms would also help students in forming help queries.
Another finding related to help seeking was that few of the students felt that the
librarian could provide a better answer than they did. The reason for this could be that
they perceive librarians as mostly assisting with locating resources within the library such
as books and not with reference search in general. Library instruction was not cited as a
reason for seeking help. These findings have implications on the design of library
instruction and outreach materials in terms of explaining the role of the librarian as well
as the digital resources and services offered by the library. The information from the
© 2016 Veronica Ling Ling Ng

51

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

interviews indicate that students’ perceptions of the library are influenced by their prior
experience with school and public libraries where books are the predominant and most
visible resources. The expertise and role of the school or public librarian are also
different from that of the reference librarian in a university library and students need to
know that they can approach the librarians in the university library for research help.
The participants in the interviews tend to seek help from the librarian as a last resort,
choosing to go to other student support centers for help with academic work. The
message on the types of help that students can get from the librarian should be made
more explicit in library instruction sessions.

Schema of the library
Based on the responses to the survey, students expect to find the following items
at the library: books, computers, librarians. The first and third items are not surprising,
but it appears that students viewed the library as a place where they could get hardware
support such as computers and printers. Almost all participants in the follow-up
interviews mentioned using the computers and printers in library and it was often cited as
the primary reason for going to the library. This perception of the library as a place for
studying and technology support correlates with the finding from the OCLC 2011 report
(Gauder, 2011) that showed more Americans were using the library to access technology
such as computers and the Internet. The interview participants had all used the library as
a study space even if they had not used the other library services and resources. They all
knew that they would find computers and printers in the library and found it preferable

compared to using the computer labs and study lounges. One reason for this was the
proximity of resources such as books, but even those who did not utilize the books found
it conducive to study in the library. The library as a place for studying seems to be a
natural extension of the library’s function. Having students coming to the library
voluntarily is a positive development as this means library outreach efforts can focus on
publicizing other library services beyond access to technology. The concept of the library
as a physical space for study could be a new way in which students perceive the reference
library.

Students’ perception of the librarians’ role
The majority of survey respondents saw the librarian as both a custodian and
manager of resources. In Question 4, students were asked to select what they think the
librarian could help them with. The findings from the responses to this question (Table
14) showed that while the majority of respondents were aware of the help services
provided by the librarian, only slightly more than half of the respondents would ask a
librarian for help in finding an online resource. This lower percentage corresponds with
the point that emerged from the interviews where the participants said they were more
inclined to ask librarians for help with physical resources as compared to online
resources. This could be due to the fact that the respondents felt that they did not need
help with finding resources online. During the interview, most participants said they had
not encountered a situation where they felt they needed help in finding information
online. According to the participants, this was because they thought of librarians as

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

custodians of physical materials such as books and did not associate librarians with
digital and online resources. This finding correlates to the observation in the OCLC user
perception and library usage report that Americans “overwhelmingly” equate libraries
with books (Gauder, 2011). According to the report, Americans mostly use community
and public libraries for print books, CDs and DVDs. Teenagers were identified as the
user group that most strongly associated the library with books (p. 38). Since the
participants’ only prior experience with libraries have been with school and public
libraries, it is not surprising that they would have this perception.
From the responses to the Question 5 - “When given a class assignment, what is
the first place you would look for research information?” it appears that the participants
in the survey were generally aware of the research help available at the library even
though not all of them made use of it. It could be that they only thought of the help
rendered by librarians in terms of locating physical resources such books and not the
other aspects of research. This is a point that librarians need to address in library
outreach. It might seem obvious to those who are familiar with the academic library, but
to a freshman student whose prior experience with library services is limited to high
school and public libraries, it may not be apparent that librarians can help with more than
locating books One participant assumed that interlibrary loans were only available for
physical resources and never thought to try requesting for digital interlibrary loans.
Another participant thought that the resources listed in the library catalog search results
were all physical items. She was surprised when the librarian told her that all she had to
do was click on the link and open the PDF. This association could have been formed

during their experiences in public and school libraries where library transactions involved
primarily around books and physical resources. The implication for librarians on this
issue would be to make the library’s digital resources more apparent to students. This
could be in form of posters and signs advertising these other resources as well as
messages in library instruction and outreach materials. Prominent displays and signage
promoting library services are necessary because students tended not to explore the
library. None of the interviewees mentioned exploring the library but went straight to the
help desk or computers.

Students’ sense of self-efficacy and impact of library instruction
The second part of the interview questions was focused on understanding
students’ research process and their methods for coping with the requirements of class
assignments. In response to the question on how they determined the amount of research
for an assignment, students tended to use the professor’s grading criteria as a guide and
this was also observed in earlier studies on undergraduate information-seeking behavior
(Valentine, 2001; Mizrachi & Bates, 2013) where grades were the key motivators for
academic work. However, the participants also expressed a sense of ownership and pride
in completing the work on their own. This was one reason for not seeking reference help
– they preferred to solve research problems by themselves. One of the participants even
felt that asking for help in research was a sign of defeat. The satisfaction of finding the
right source was one of the things that they liked about research. From the interview
questions on research attitudes, the participants mentioned that the thing they disliked

55

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

most about research was the feeling of being overwhelmed and “not knowing where to
start” during the initial process of research. This aligns with the thoughts and feelings that
accompany the first stages of the information search process (Kuhlthau, 1993). None of
the participants reported having reached a stage in their academic work where they felt
they needed to seek reference help although a few did mention learning useful search
methods such as Boolean operators, in their information literacy class. Studies have
shown that library instruction and guidance offered by librarians do have an effect on
students’ information seeking behavior (Ren, 2000). This could be the reason why more
than one-third of the survey respondents said that the library website would be their first
stop for research information. This relatively high number could be a result of having
reference librarians as class instructors who would have a direct influence on students’
information search behavior.

Recommendations
To address the issue of students’ self-efficacy as barrier to help seeking, librarians
could be more specific in describing the kind of help they provide, just as the other
student support centers explain clearly that they will only give critique but not do the
assignment. Librarians can reassure students by stating they will give advice on
improving search strategies but not answer the research question for them. The data from
the interviews suggest that more can be done to help students differentiate between the
types of academic help offered by the different centers. Students need to know what is
entailed in research help: it does not mean that the reference librarian will answer the

research question for them. As for the finding on students’ information seeking and
research preferences, library instruction programs could be delivered throughout the
academic year instead of during the first semester and the content could be mapped to the
stages of the information search process. In this way, students can apply the library skills
in their school work as research requirements get progressively more rigorous. Just as
the Writing Center and learning support services specify how they will be offering
guidance and feedback in specific areas and not doing their assignment, the library
reference help services can be more descriptive about the type of help services offered or
offer examples of the types of assistance available. This could help students make
decisions on whether to seek reference help and at the same time provide students with
guidance on how to frame their queries.

Conclusion
The results of the study suggests that students have an incomplete mental model
or understanding of how the library online catalog works. They think of the information
in the catalog as originating from a single source and are unaware of the federated search
process. This has implications on the way they use the catalog because if students knew
that their search results came from different databases, they could be more discerning in
selecting which databases to search. The study also provided interesting findings on
students’ current perception of the library. These include the perception that the library
and librarians deal exclusively with physical resources such as books. This perception
extends to the online catalog as one interview participant even thought the library online
catalog only contains books. The implication here is that students do not think of
librarians as being able to help them with online resources.
On the topic of students’ mental model of the library’s information organization
system, the metaphor that most of the survey respondents selected to represent the library
online catalog was that of the filing cabinet where all the information comes from a
single source. Although students think that the information comes from a single database,
they recognize that the library’s search system is different from online search engines.
This misconception should be addressed in both information literacy and library
instruction classes because knowing that the library’s online catalog is a more robust
discovery service indexing other sources could have an effect on their search strategies.
By knowing that their search query is accessing multiple databases, students can improve
their search results by opting to search within specific databases.

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

The library plays an important role in supporting student achievement, and the
assistance it provides needs to be distinguished from the help that is offered by the other
student support centers. One reason for students’ reluctance to seek reference help is the
perception that by doing so, they are “giving up” on the problem. The library could make
it easier for students to understand what reference help entails, in library instruction and
outreach materials. This will help assure students that seeking help from the librarian
does not mean that they are compromising on the ownership of the work.

Further research
This study was conducted on a relatively small number of participants from the
University of Baltimore, and the findings from this study are thus limited to users of
Langsdale Library. The number of students who responded to the survey was a limitation
factor in this study because a larger number of respondents would provide more
conclusive data; for instance, in the question on whether students have the same mental
model for both the library catalog and Internet search engines. Another limitation of this
study was that the primary source of data came from participant self-reports. These selfreports need to be supported by data from other sources such as observational data or
actual search logs. Future studies could make use of more quantitative data such as
library database queries, reference help desk transactions and chat logs. The participants’
self-reports on research habits could be corroborated with observations of their research
and information search processes.

The issue of help seeking was also a topic in the survey and interviews. The
results show that students prefer to seek reference help in person because they find it
easier to describe their query in-person. Further investigation is also needed to find out
which part of forming a reference query it is that students struggle with. A more
comprehensive study into the issues of library perception and usage should take into
consideration variables from the participants’ demographics such as gender, race and
ethnicity, family background, financial circumstances and prior education. As the
population for this study was limited to the students at the University of Baltimore,
subsequent studies should involve students in other colleges as well as students in
different stages of college. The fact that some of the students had class instructors who
were also librarians could have introduced some bias to their responses to survey
questions, for instance, in the higher than expected number of students who said they
used the library website not Google, as their first stop when seeking information (Table
15). The participants in the face-to-face interviews were also students who volunteered to
take part in the study and they could have been a group who were especially motivated
and engaged with schoolwork. This group of students also demonstrated the ability and
willingness to reflect on their own research processes, which may or may not be
representative of the larger student population. The participants were all fairly new to
college life, having only been on campus for two full semesters at the time of the
interview. Their short time in college could be part of the reason why they have not fully
utilized the library’s services. This lack of experience could be the reason behind some

Understanding the basis behind undergraduates’ pre-existing perceptions of the library in order to improve library services

of their current perceptions of the library. The responses from Langsdale Library’s posttest survey also suggests that students enter college feeling fairly confident about their
information search skills and subsequently discover that these self-perceived skills are
not sufficient for college-level work. A longitudinal study that follows the students
through their entire career in college and records their attitudes towards research would
be needed to collect the information to form a more complete picture. Studies on the topic
of student information search behavior and the library have mostly been conducted by
librarians or library staff and this could be a source of researcher bias. More studies in the
topic could be conducted or initiated by researchers from other fields for more diverse
perspectives and different insights.
The existing literature highlights the need to conduct regular studies to “update
our understanding of millennials” (Holliday & Lee, 2004) and to stay informed of each
cohort’s needs and expectations in order for library services to remain relevant to its
users. The assumption that millennials prefer to go digital in all aspects of their
information seeking habits is still untrue even as the internet has become even more
ubiquitous in recent years, students still face the same hesitancy in using online channels
to request for help and face the same problems in articulating their queries. The changing
perception of the library as a service to the library as a physical space and place for
technology access is another new theme which librarians need to keep track of as it has
direct impact on library utilization and allocation of resources. More resources could be
allocated to support this change in user needs and expectations of the library. For
example, more space could be set aside for studying and more technology and hardware

support such as scanners, workstations, printers and projectors. Other resources that
facilitate students studying in the library could be in the form of non-lending materials
such as reference texts and guides.
It would be worthwhile to find out why students seem to associate librarians
mainly with physical resources in this age of digital information. If these associations
were created from their experience with school libraries, more research can be done in
the area of middle- and high school libraries and the information seeking behavior of
secondary school students. The results can then be used for comparison with these
students’ behavior when they enter college. The findings on students’ perception of the
library that have emerged from this study have direct implications for library outreach
and instruction particularly in the areas of informing students about the library’s digital
resources and services. In terms of improving library help services, the findings from the
study can be used to inform improvements to existing help interfaces, as mentioned in the
discussion. More emphasis on the digital and online resources can be included into the
library’s outreach message and materials. This will ensure that students who are willing
to seek help will have the right information and the guidance that these students receive
could mean the critical difference in their performance in college. Stories such as that of
the participant who had no idea that the librarians could have helped her with her
research problems are a reminder that one cannot assume every student knows about
library services despite the library instruction and outreach efforts of the librarians.
