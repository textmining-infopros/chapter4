Information literacy—the ability to recognize when information is needed and then to locate,
evaluate, and effectively use that information—is an essential skill set for 21st century students.
In order for students to be prepared for college and career readiness, the component skills of
information literacy should be explicit in educational policy documents that establish standards
for student learning (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2009). Standard statements are guides
for developing curriculum and instructional programs for students, and therefore should reflect
what is known of cognitive development and must be clearly written so that all stakeholders—
including policy makers, teachers, parents, and students—understand what students are being
asked to do (Kendall, 2001). This research project sought to establish to what extent
information–literacy-related standard statements represent developmentally appropriate gradelevel designations. I did this by determining how well the Common Core State Standards (CCSS)
and the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) standard statements reflect the
information problem-solving process as represented by the Big6 model, and to what extent
expert, experienced teachers (as represented by National Board Certificated Teachers [NBCTs]

	  

	  
in the state of Washington) agree with both the grade-level, developmental appropriateness and
the importance of teaching from these standard statements.
The research process utilized a mixed-method design, consisting of a content analysis of the
standard statements, a quantitative survey of NBCTs, and a series of four focus groups for
explanatory feedback on the results of the survey.
Standard statements from CCSS and AASL were first sorted into Big6 stages (Task Definition,
Information Seeking Strategies, Location and Access, Use of Information, Synthesis, Evaluation)
and analyzed for the clarity of writing and the number of tasks involved. The content analysis of
the standard statements found that the CCSS emphasized Big6 stage five (synthesis), while
lacking three of the Big6 stages of the information problem solving process (task definition,
information seeking strategies, and evaluation). The AASL standard statements included all six
of the information problem solving stages, but both task definition and evaluation were
underrepresented.
A survey then was created using the standard statements that represented three Big6 stages. This
survey was sent electronically to NBCTs in the state of Washington. Ninety-six NBCTs
completed the survey. Volunteers were recruited from the survey respondents to form four focus
groups to provide explanations of the survey results from the participants’ views.
Findings indicate that there is disagreement between NBCTs on the grade level designations
assigned in the standard statements. Subjects were able to match 67% of second-grade standard
statements as belonging to second grade, but only 49% of fifth-grade standard statements as
belonging to fifth grade, and only 29% at eighth grade. However, in the section of the survey
where respondents examined the standard statements closest to their own grade level, the NBCTs
	  

	  
did tend to agree with both the developmental appropriateness and the importance of teaching
from the standard statements. This finding differs with the results of the first half of the survey
and points to potential issues with the clarity of the standards and perhaps with teacher
professional development. Without having the grade-level context, teachers had difficulty
placing standard statements at the grade level intended by the authors of the standard statements.
Whether this discrepancy is due to the lack of clarity of the standard statements, the lack of
knowledge of the teachers, or perhaps the fact that teachers being given the grade level before
the survey predisposes them to think this was an appropriate placement, is unclear and is
therefore an area for further research.
The major contributions of this work point to the need 1) for the entire information problemsolving process to be explicitly included in national policy documents such as the CCSS and the
AASL standards, so that the component skills of information literacy can be consistently
reflected in and taught from standards statements for each grade level in increasing complexity;
and 2) for greater collaboration between the writers of standards statements and classroom
teachers with the aim of creating standard statements that are comprehensible to all stakeholders,
including parents and students.

1. Overview	  
This is a study of how expert, experienced educators view educational standards that address
students’ abilites to solve information problems as students develop from kindergarten to grade
eight. The study sought to determine the current view of these abilities as : (1) operationalized by
educational standards that deal with information problem solving, and (2) assessed by expert and
experienced educators including classroom teachers, special education teachers and
teacher/librarians. The study examined the results in order to identify areas of alignment and
areas where gaps exist between educational standards and the views of expert, experienced
educators. The resulting analysis provides a justification and insights for a developmental theory
of information problem solving and inform instructional techniques for teaching information
problem solving.
Chapter One of this dissertation first discusses the importance of information literacy and the

1.1 Introduction	  
This section will discuss the importance of information literacy, give an overview from the
literature of current views of information problem solving and development, discuss different
models of information problem solving, and identify the central concern of this research project.

1.1.1 Why	  information	  literacy	  and	  developmental	  theories?	  
The importance of information literacy is well agreed upon in library science, education, and
among policy makers (American Association of School Librarians, 2009; American Association
of School Librarians & Association for Educational Communications, 1998; Bruce, 2002;
Considine, Horton, & Moorman, 2009; Eisenberg, 2008; Geyer, 2008; Heider, 2009; Johnston &
Webber, 2005; Julien & Barker, 2009; Kong, 2009; Kovalik, Yutzey, & Piazza, 2012).
Information literacy has become such an important concept that President Barack Obama
declared October 2009 National Information Literacy Awareness Month (Obama, 2009). It has
become a cliché to announce that the amount of information available to individuals has
exploded. Nonetheless, it is true. However, as the Presidential Proclamation points out, this
explosion has not necessarily made the ability to find any particular piece of information easier
and much of the freely obtained information on the World Wide Web is of limited value,
especially to school-aged students engaged in research. Much information on the Web is
repetitive, is biased because it is actually advertising, and in some cases it is deliberately meant
to deceive. Information literacy is seen as one answer for dealing with both the explosion of
information and the quality of that information.
One key issue of information literacy is: what are the capabilities of children of different ages to
solve information problems?1 This issue derives from a basic question of human developmental
research which is, “How do individuals develop over time?” (Bjorklund, 2005; Miller, 2002).
Considering this question from the perspective of Information Science and information literacy,

This dissertation uses the phrase information problem solving as the application of information
literacy skills to solve information problems. Information literacy skills and information problem
solving will be discussed in greater detail below.
	  
2	  

	  
a narrower question emerges, “How does the ability to solve information problems change as
individuals develop over time?”
An important early step in problem solving is to define the task (J. D. Bransford, Brown, &
Cocking, 2000). Part of defining the task is to identify what is already known. In this case,
identifying how information problem solving changes as individuals develop over time, the first
and seemingly easiest would be to examine what work has already been done in the field of
information science. However, it appears that little research in information science or education
has been directed at answering this question. Eastin, in describing the need for research in the
area of cognitive development and the ability to make credibility judgments regarding digital
media goes so far as to call the opportunities “wide open” (2008, p. 42).
In particular, little empirical work in the field of information science exists on children’s
developmental changes in relation to information literacy skills (Kovalik et al., 2012; Latham &
Gross, 2008) making it necessary to look to other fields, particularly psychology. Educational
standards are the method that the education establishment determines what is to be taught at what
grade level. Curriculum development theory advocates for a spiraling curriculum, one that
revisits topics in more depth as children progress through the grade levels of school (Marzano,
2001). Thus information literacy standards should deal with concepts in an increasingly more
complex manner as grade levels increase. This research project examines educational standards
that apply to information problem solving through the use of the judgments of expert,
experienced practitioners as a lens to examine current knowledge of the changing abilities of
students to solve information problems at different grade levels.

1.1.2 Theoretical	  approach	  
This research takes a constructivist approach to knowledge. In a traditional educational system
instruction comes from the authority of the teacher and the students are seen as vessels to be
filled with knowledge. In constructivism, students create their own new knowledge based on
their past experiences and their interaction with new experiences (DeLay, 1996; Savery & Duffy,
2001). The teacher goes from being the “sage on the stage to the guide by the side.” This same
constructivist rationale may be applied to the learning standards. Standards should not just be
handed down from committees of experts. Teachers must have some say in the creation and
implementation of these standards. Before being able to guide students to new learning, the
teachers must construct their own knowledge base around the standards and the content and
processes covered by the standards.
1.1.3 Central	  concern	  of	  this	  research	  
This dissertation sought to explore issues related to how the abilities involved in solving
information problems change over time in school-aged children. In other words, what are the
capabilities of children of different ages to solve information problems? Is there an identifiable
developmental sequence that individuals proceed through as they develop information processing
skills? And, if so, what is it? More narrowly, this dissertation sought to explore to what extent
are developmental differences exhibited in educational standards that are concerned with
information literacy and to what extent to the developmental levels found in those statements are
aligned with the views of expert, experienced teachers.
Conceptually this research project proceeds from two ideas:

	  

4	  

	  
First, as noted above, individuals undergo developmental changes during the time they are in
school. As a result, one common method of curriculum planning is the spiral curriculum. In a
spiral curriculum topics and or concepts are introduced at a basic level and as the school years
pass, the topics/concepts are revisited at a more complex level. In essence, the spiral curriculum
accounts for increased capability with increasing complexity of the material to be taught
(Marzano, 2001). Scope and sequence is the phrase used in education referring to the material
that will be taught (scope) and the order in which this material is to be taught (sequence). In
library and information science, as noted above, there are existing documents that deal with
scope and sequence; however, none of these documents are research-based (Zenger & Zenger,
2002, 2003). Thus there is a need in information science for research to understand how
developmental changes impact information problem solving.
Second, existing information literacy standards (which are also scope and sequence documents)
are one way current knowledge of developmental differences in information problem solving
abilities of school-aged children is defined. Educational standards have a variety of shortcomings
that will be discussed below. There appears to be no existing analysis of information literacy
documents that is similar to the work done critiquing other sets of standards. Information literacy
standards may not have the shortcomings identified in other sets of standards, but this is
currently unknown due to the lack of research. This indicates the need for research concerning
information literacy standards and will be expanded on below.

1.2 The	  need	  for	  research	  in	  information	  problem	  solving	  and	  development	  
Kuhlthau (1981, 1987; 1988) is one of the few library and information science authors who deal
with scope and sequence of library or research skills to describe developmentally appropriate
lessons for elementary school children. Callison’s (2002) work on scope and sequence refers to
	  
5	  

	  
developmentally appropriate instruction, though he relies on Kuhlthau’s work as the basis for
what consists of developmentally appropriate practice. However, neither Kuhlthau or any of the
more recent works examined (see below) that provide scope and sequence for information
literacy education relied on cognitive development theory or validated research in cognitive or
developmental psychology to justify the placement of learning activities at a particular grade
level. Rather, these works are based on the authors’ practice and do not draw on research in
either library and information science or cognitive psychology.
For example, Harker & Putonti (2008) assigned lessons to grade levels but bypassed the
challenge of determining appropriate content by advising the Library Media Specialists (LMS) to
leave content decisions to the classroom teacher. This is understandable: the classroom teacher is
the expert for his or her classroom. But, as a result, Harker and Putonti avoid discussing how
they decided what level of cognitive load is assigned to each grade-level lesson. Messner &
Copeland (2007) simply provide a compendium of teacher created lessons linked loosely to
information literacy standards with no reference to developmentally appropriate practice. Jansen
(2009) does provide a chapter on developmentally appropriate practice for early learners. The
core of this chapter is a series of lists of what accomplishments can be expected by the end of the
year for kindergarteners through third graders. Riedling (2007) in a book subtitled “What Every
High School Senior Needs to Know” draws on both the AASL and ACRL standards, but fails to
mention developmental differences. The closest she comes to acknowledging children’s different
levels of capabilities are two charts in the final chapter. These charts list all twelve grades – but
there is no differentiation based on grade level or age level for any of the 15 skills listed. There is
simply a list of skills listed in grade one and a corresponding essential question listed in grade
two. The remaining columns for grades 3 – 12 are blank. One assumes these skills continue
	  

6	  

	  
through grade 12, but there is no indication of increasing complexity. Stripling & Pitts (1988)
describe a taxonomy of skills for the library research process starting at grade one and
proceeding with increasing complexity to grade 12. However, they also fail to mention any basis
in developmental research for assigning skills to certain grade levels.
Authors dealing with scope and sequence in information literacy, with a few exceptions, appear
to be addressing developmental levels based on their own ideas of the capabilities of students
gained from personal practice and anecdotal evidence. Little effort to apply theories of child
development is evident and there appears to be little, if any, research into a theory of
development for information literacy skills. In general these authors, if they refer to theories of
development, refer to and apply the principles of cognitive development of Piaget (1969) and/or
Vygotsky (1978) for application to information literacy at the K-12 level or they refer to the
ideas of William Perry (1968) in higher education.
Piaget’s, work though ground breaking in its time, is no longer considered to be a completely
accurate view of child development (Berk, 2009; Bjorklund, 2005; Kuhn, 2006, 2008; Moshman,
2005). Competing theories have arisen and provide a more effective description of development,
especially in adolescents and in the transition from childhood to adolescence. According to
Moshman (1998) the description of formal operations put forth by Piaget and Inhelder is no
longer given much weight in the literature. “Adolescent thinking develops, but not through a
fixed sequence leading to a universal state of maturity” (Moshman, 2005, p. 24). Kuhn (2008)
identifies two particular areas of difficulty with Piaget’s formal operations. Formal operational
thought does not appear “predictably and universally at a specific point during adolescence” (p.
51). Piaget’s assertion that the formal operations stage appears in the individual as a single entity
is also not supported by current research. What Piaget does appear to have correctly identified is
	  
7	  

	  
the shift in thinking that occurs at about age eleven; adolescents become able to “think about
thinking” (Kuhn, 2008; Moshman, 1998).
Authors who mentioned Vygotsky (Vygotsky & Cole, 1978) focus on his Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD) and fail to examine with any depth his theories of socio-cultural
development. This dissertation is focused on the development of information problem solving
skills in grades K-8 and thus will not address William Perry’s theory of post-secondary
development (W. G. Perry, 1968).
Few authors have applied cognitive development principles to information literacy skills in the
grades prior to college—even Kuhlthau, who consistently calls for consideration of cognitive
development in teaching library or research skills starting with her early works on
developmentally appropriate library skills by grade level (1981, 1987) as well as her later work
with coauthors describing inquiry learning (Kuhlthau, Caspari, & Maniotes, 2007; Kuhlthau &
Maniotes, 2010). While her early 1980’s work did refer the developmental theories of Piaget, as
noted above, Piaget’s work concerning formal operations is now considered incomplete.
Adolescents do not move neatly all at once into formal operations and several different types of
thinking emerge at this time. Change in adolescent thinking also becomes driven by individual
interest and choices (Kuhn, 2006; Moshman, 1998, 2005). We must conclude that although
Kuhlthau’s writings often mentioned the need to consider developmental changes in information
literacy instruction, her Information Problem Solving model does not incorporate developmental
differences (Kuhlthau, 2004).
McGuire’s (1998) work describes an elementary school’s effort to create a developmentally
appropriate library skills program designed with input from the teachers and instructional
	  

8	  

	  
assistants at each grade level in the school. Eastin (2008) describes the need for the application
of cognitive development stages to analyze children’s ability to make credibility judgments.
Eastin’s work also relies on Piaget for theories of adolescent cognitive development without
taking into account the more current work in this field described by Kuhn (2006, 2008) and
Moshman (2005). Kuhn (2006) points out that most adolescent development texts are not
current in this area, which may explain why Kuhlthau and Eastin are still heavily dependent on
Piaget.
There is no specific theory that describes the changes in information problem solving abilities
that children progress through as they mature and little empirical research on the topic (Kovalik
et al., 2012). Many authors have recognized the importance of cognitive development to
information literacy instruction (Eastin, 2008; Jackson, 2007, 2008b; Kuhlthau, 1981, 1987;
Kuhlthau et al., 2007; McGuire, 1998; Orme, 2008). Kuhlthau’s (1981) book is a guide enabling
teacher librarians to implement developmentally appropriate library skills lessons, a pre-cursor to
both the current standards movement and the concept of information literacy skills. Eisenberg
has modified the Big6 Information Problem Solving approach to the Super3 for younger children
(2001).
Intuitively, fifth graders should be more capable of any particular task (defining problems for
example) than first graders. Age and education should make a difference. Developmental
psychology tells us that there is a shift in children’s thinking between the ages of five and seven
and again around the ages of 11 to 13 (Bjorklund, 2005; Daniels & Clarkson, 2010; Kuhn, 2006,
2008; Moshman, 2005; Sameroff & Haith, 1996). In addition, older children have more years of
education, giving them more experience. Are information literacy standards aligned with these
shifts? Differences should exist between, for example, the task definition skills of a fifth grader
	  
9	  

	  
and those of a first grader. A developmental theory focusing on information problem solving
should be able to explain these differences. Thus this research has importance in identifying
areas of agreement and disagreement between educational standards documents and
practitioners. These areas of agreement potentially lay the groundwork for a developmental
theory of information problem solving.

1.3 The	  need	  for	  research	  to	  inform	  information	  literacy	  standards	  
This section provides an overview of educational standards and their limitations, including the
Common Core standards and standards that apply to information literacy.
1.3.1 Standards	  
The question of how the ability to solve information problems changes as individuals mature is
particularly relevant in the educational system. Students enter the K-12 system as five- or sixyear-old children and exit at age 18, the age of legal adulthood. Children generally undergo two
shifts in the ability to think during this time period. First there is a shift that occurs during the
range of five- to seven-years-old. There is also a second shift when children enter adolescence
(Bjorklund, 2005; Daniels & Clarkson, 2010; Kuhn, 2006, 2008; Moshman, 2005; Sameroff &
Haith, 1996). These shifts in thinking suggest that during the span of time children spend in the
K-12 education system there are also changes in their abilities to solve information problems.
In order to teach a skill, it is necessary to know what the abilities of the student are prior to
instruction (Goertz, 2010; Marzano, 2004). This information gives the teacher a baseline to work
from, making it possible to assess progress and to make a judgment of the effectiveness of
instruction. Educating children differs from educating adults, in that children not only have a
level of ability based on prior experience, they also a level of ability based on their
	  

10	  

	  
developmental level. Physically, one would not expect a first grade student to be able to run a
50-yard dash faster than a fifth grade student. Similarly, one would not expect a first grader to
have the same cognitive skills as a fifth grader, due to both the lack of experience and due to the
lack of cognitive development. There may be individual exceptions to these patterns, both in the
physical act of a 50-yard dash and in applying cognitive skills, but for the most part we would
expect these generalizations to hold true.
One way educational systems at different levels (e.g., local school districts, state, national)
operationalize developmental changes is through standards. Standards are the defined goals and
objectives for instruction and learning. McClure states, “Standards as an organizing principle
make the enterprise of education transparent. From the classroom to the statehouse, all
participants know what is to be accomplished. Standards are also useful in educating parents and
students about what is expected” (2005, p. 10). Standards are important in education because
they are a guide for increasing achievement in all students, but they do so only if they are clear,
rigorous and understood by students, teachers, administrators, and parents (Bartow, 2009;
Goertz, 2010).
1.3.2 General	  issues	  with	  standards	  
“No solid basis exists in the research literature for the ways we currently develop, place and
align educational standards in school curricula. If this sounds shocking, it should not. The same
holds true for placing subject-matter content at specific grade levels (scope and sequence)”
(Zenger & Zenger, 2002, p. 212). Content has been placed in scope and sequence documents
based on tradition, individual teachers’ expertise, because it is the textbook, professional
judgment, or current practice and standards documents appear to be no different (Zenger &
Zenger, 2002, 2003).
	  

11	  

	  
Others besides the Zengers have found problems with educational standards. Marzano and his
colleagues at the Mid-continent Regional Educational Laboratory (McREL) have researched and
written extensively on standards and the national movement for standards, identifying several
problems with standards as currently written while maintaining that creating a standards-based
curriculum is essential to educational reform. Issues identified by Marzano and Kendall (1996a,
1996b, 1996c, 1997) include: multiple documents, varying definitions, and varying levels of
generality. Brief examples of these issues follow.
School districts, individual schools, or teachers trying to identify which information is of most
importance to teach according to the various standards would have to consult 116 documents
(Marzano & Kendall, 1998). In a study on relevance clues for possible use in information
retrieval, Reitsma, Marshall, and Zarske (2010) report finding over 60,000 math and science
standards in state standards on the Achievement Standards Network.
The word standard is itself ambiguous (Placier, Walker, & Foster, 2002). Kendall defines a
content standard as “summary description regarding what it is that students should know and/or
be able to do within a particular discipline” (2001, p. 2). Other terms that are used as equivalents
to content standards include “goals,” “expectations,” and “learning results” (Kendall, 2001).
There are also different types of standards – curriculum standards, content standards, and
performance standards. Each has its own varying definition. Another term used in the discussion
of standards is “benchmark.” Bodrova, Leong, Paynter, & Semenov (who define standard in a
way similar to Kendall) define a benchmark as “a subcomponent of a standard. Specifically, it is
a statement that reflects expected understanding or skill at a specific developmental level” (2000,
p. 4). Yet, as Kendall (2001), Bodrova et al. (2000), and Hebbeler & Taylor (2012) point out, the
use of these terms varies from one issuing organization to another.
	  
12	  

	  
In discussing varying levels of generality, Marzano and Kendall (1997, p. 32) compare a national
art standard, “Understanding the arts in relation to history and cultures” to a national history
standard “Students should understand the causes of the Civil War.” The art standard is clearly
aiming at a very high level of generality while the history standard is aiming at the causes of a
specific incident in United States history.
Standard statements often cover a band of grade levels (e.g. Grades 1-3) defining an expected
outcome only at the end of third grade. As Marzano (2001) points out, this method leaves
teachers in first and second grades without clear guidance as to what to expect of their students.
Thus a developmental theory of information problem solving that could be used to establish
standard statements at a level so that standard statements could be clearly differentiated for each
year in school would (continuing with Marzano’s example of a first, second, and third grade
band) be useful for teachers in first and second grade. This may not be possible. Marzano (2001)
describes this as a problem with standard statements in general. The shifts in thinking may cover
too broad an age range to be able to generate such fine-grained differentiation. However refining
standard statements to be as finely grained as possible is still an important goal.
More currently, criticism of standards comes from Phillips (2009, p. 28) who states that
standards derive from a “political sausage factory, in which the most important goal is to respect
each individual committee member’s personal, cherished opinions.” Goertz (2010) writes that
standards are driving educational change, but, “Policy makers must reach consensus on the type,
content, and specificity of the standards; determine who will develop the standards; and facilitate
the implementation of the standards”(p. 52).

	  

13	  

	  
Many authors have identified problems with existing educational standards (Berger, 2000;
Bodrova et al., 2000; Florian, 1999; Goertz, 2010; Kendall & Marzano, 1994; Marzano &
Kendall, 1996b, 1996c, 1997, 1998; Peterson & Hess, 2008; G. W. Phillips, 2014; V. Phillips,
2009; Placier et al., 2002; Zenger & Zenger, 2002, 2003). The issues identified will be discussed
more thoroughly below, but one important note is that a similar analysis of standards dealing
with information literacy has not apparently been done.
1.3.3 Common	  Core	  standards	  
The most recent work related to standards is the work of creating the Common Core standards in
Mathematics and English/Language Arts (National Governors Association & Council of Chief
State School Officers, 2014). The Common Core standards are educational standards in
English/Language Arts (E/LARs) and Mathematics that will be used in common by all states
choosing to adopt these standards. The idea behind the Common Core standards is that reading is
reading and mathematics is mathematics whether the subject is being taught in Kentucky,
California, Maine, Georgia, or Hawaii. The United States Constitution leaves education to the
states and as a result, prior to the Common Core movement, all 50 states set their own
educational standards. These standards varied a great deal in quality (Carmichael, Martino,
Porter-Magee, & Wilson, 2010; G. W. Phillips, 2014). The Common Core standards were
created under the auspices of the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of
Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) to replace the differing state standards with one set of
uniform standards. As of November 2014, forty-three states have adopted the Common Core
standards (National Governors Association & Council of Chief State School Officers, 2014).

	  

14	  

	  
1.3.3.1 Issues	  with	  the	  Common	  Core	  
The Common Core standards are not without issues. Tienken (2010) questions the basic
assumptions for the need for the Common Core. He argues that the United States’ educational
system neither lags behind the rest of the world nor that the scores of United States’ students on
international tests are an indicator of a coming economic disaster. Thus Tienken does not think
the effort and change needed to have new common standards are required or worthwhile. Porter,
McMaken, Hwang, & Yang (2010) using the Survey of Enacted Curriculum (SEC), found low to
moderate alignment between both state standards and assessments and the Common Core. The
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards did not exhibit a higher degree
of alignment with the Common Core standards than the state standards on average. Porter et al.
also compared the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) to the Common Core
standards and found only slightly higher alignment than with the state assessments.
1.3.4 Standards	  and	  information	  literacy	  
Standards may be viewed as experts’ opinions on what students are capable of and should be
doing at a particular grade level. The national standards movement emerged out of the
educational reform movement of the 1980s and 1990s that was sparked by the report A Nation at
Risk (National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983). As a result, standards have been
created at national, state, and local levels. Standards are generally established for each subject
and grade level by states and subject area associations. In many cases, these subject area
standards include items that clearly deal with information literacy (Murray, 2008a; Smith,
Churchill, & Mason, 2005), although information literacy is not necessarily the primary focus.
A comprehensive framework of developmentally appropriate information literacy standard
statements is important for a variety of reasons. Understanding the differing capabilities of
	  

15	  

	  
children of varying ages allows for the creation of standard statements that are appropriate for
different developmental ages. Appropriate in this case refers to concepts or instructional matter
that it is reasonable to expect children of a given age to master. Standard statements allow
curriculum planners and teachers to plan and implement lessons that are appropriate to the
children in a particular grade level or classroom (Dickinson, 2009; Stoll & Giddings, 2012).
Developmentally appropriate lessons and standard statements allow for the proper assessment of
children’s learning and for assessment of instruction (Bodrova et al., 2000; Ehri, 1999; Zenger &
Zenger, 2003).
Information literacy standards have been written as both a separate set of library media skills and
as a set of technology skills (American Association of School Librarians, 2009; International
Society for Technology in Education, 2007) and they have been incorporated into content areas
such as History (National Center for History in the Schools, Crabtree, & Nash, 1994), Social
Studies (National Council for the Social Studies, 2010), National Council of Teachers of English
and International Reading Association (1996), and Math (National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics, 2000). An important point is that information literacy standards are created by two
different components of the K-12 educational system in the United States. According to Smith et
al. (2005, p. 7) “Information literacy can now be found in every national curriculum document,
establishing a connection between information literacy and the content standards2.” The second
area is what this dissertation will refer to as the technical area, which is comprised of technology
specialists and library media specialists. Content areas all include standards that address
information literacy skills but from the view of that particular content area. These standards
address research, or information problem solving skills from the perspective of the individual
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
2	  The content standards Smith et al. are referring to are Social Studies/History, Science,
Mathematics, and English/Language Arts.	  
	  
16	  

	  
discipline. These standards are created by national level content organizations such as those
noted above. At the same time the technical areas has standards for information literacy that are
designed to address the needs for students to develop a competency in information problem
solving without regard to a particular content area. These standards are generated by
organizations such as the AASL and ISTE. This bifurcation in the creation of the standards is
one of the issues with information literacy standards that will be addressed in greater detail
below.
Marzano and Kendall (1996a, 1996b, 1996c, 1997), Porter and colleagues (A. Porter et al., 2010;
A. C. Porter, Polikoff, & Smithson, 2009), the Fordham Institute (Carmichael et al., 2010) and
the Common Core (National Governors Association & Council of Chief State School Officers,
2014) have analyzed standards, but an analysis of any type has not been done on standards
focusing on information literacy. The issues noted by Marzano and Kendall of multiple
documents is also an issue with information literacy standards. There are multiple organizations
and agencies (as noted above) that have issued standards in this area. There is little reason to
think that information literacy standards differ from other curriculum matters. Thus it seems
likely that varying definitions, levels of generality, and levels of subordination are also concerns
in information literacy and indicates a need for research in this area.
1.3.5 Operationalizing	  the	  term	  “standard”	  	  
For the purpose of this dissertation the term “standard statement” is defined and will be used to
mean a specific task that a student is to perform at a specific grade level. For example a third
grade standard statement would be: the student will be able to locate a book given a call number.

1.4 Models	  of	  information	  problem	  solving	  
Existing research generally deals with only fragments of the information problem solving
process. When analyzing the research, it is useful to have some model of the information
problem solving process to use in categorizing the different research projects. A wide variety of
information problem solving models exist. Callison and Lamb (2011) list 13 Information Search
Models, four Information Inquiry Models and two Discipline Specific models. Eisenberg and
Brown (1992) used four different models in their comparison on information problem solving
models. Wolf, Bush, and Saye (2003) identified three information problem solving models
(Kuhlthau’s information problem solving, Eisenberg & Berkowitz’s Big6, and Stripling and
Pitts’ research process model) as possible candidates for use in metacognitive scaffolding and
chose to use the Eisenberg Berkowitz Big6 model as it was not tied to any particular subject area.
Brand-Gruwel, Wopereis, and Walraven (2009) reviewed information problem solving models
identifying the same three models Wolf et al. used as “prominent” models. However, this group
of researchers rejected these models as all being over ten years old and created before the World
Wide Web. Brand-Gruwel et al. did use these older models as the basis for the creation of their
own Information Problems Solving – Internet model.
This dissertation chose to use the Eisenberg-Berkowitz model of information problem solving,
the Big63, as a model to serve as a framework for discussing information problem solving. There
are four reasons for this decision. First, as noted above, both Wolf et al. and Brand-Gruwel et al.
found the Big6 to be one of three prominent information problem solving models. Second, the
Big6 is widely used in the K-12 educational system in the United States, and educational
standards are a major focus of this dissertation. Eisenberg claims that the Big6 is “the most

widely-known and widely-used approach to teaching information and technology skills in the
world” and is used in thousands of schools (Eisenberg, 2007), though there is only anecdotal
evidence and no formal research to support this claim. However, a Google search on “Big6
research skills” returns over 6.6 million hits including schools from such diverse places as
Longmont, Colorado, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, and Goldsboro, North Carolina and
organizations at the state level such as the Washington Library Media Association and Utah
Education Network. Third, while none of the three main information problem solving models,
(Kuhlthau, Eisenberg Berkowitz, or Stripling Pitts) has a research based adaptation to differing
developmental stages, Eisenberg and Berkowitz’s Big6 has a simplified model called the Super 3
aimed at primary level students. Fourth, and finally, Murray (2008a, 2008b, 2010, 2011) has
done extensive work aligning various standards to the Big6 model. This work is particularly
useful to this dissertation as it examines existing information literacy standards and neither
Kuhlthau nor Stripling Pitts models have been aligned to the standards.
Analyzing examples of research in information problem solving and seeing where they fit into a
model of the information problem solving process reveals most work is in the areas of search
strategies, locating information and selecting information for use. A few examples of research in
these areas include Moore and St. George (1991) who studied the cognitive difficulties of New
Zealand sixth graders engaged in a information retrieval task. Schacter, Chung, & Dorr (1998)
examined fifth and sixth graders’ abilities to find information in either a well-structured or illstructured task. Fidel et al. (1999) studied the information seeking behavior of high school
students. Bilal (2000, 2001, 2002) studied the cognitive and physical behaviors of seventh
graders while they used a web search engine, Yahooligans, specifically designed for children.
Bilal and Kirby (2002) compared the information seeking abilities of seventh graders to graduate
	  

19	  

	  
students while using Yahooligans. Cooper’s (2002) studied second graders engaged in an
information seeking task in their school library. Rouet & Coutelet (2008) looked at 9 – 13 yearolds’ ability to find information within sources. Spink, Danby, Mallan & Butler (2010) studied
the web searching capabilities of kindergarteners.
The strengths of these studies are identifying and describing information problem solving
behaviors of children and adolescents and providing a basis for further research. Additionally
these studies are research-based rather than based on anecdotal evidence or opinions of the
author. Thus they provide some research basis for connecting information problem solving skills
with various age groups and grade levels. Weaknesses tend to be the small numbers of subjects
studied and the resulting lack of generalizability. Due to rapid changes in the world of
Information Communication Technology, (for example – Yahooligans no longer exists in the
same form as Bilal investigated and Google did not exist prior to 1998) focusing on a general
information problem solving model such as the Big6 makes more sense than studying a
particular search engine (Yahooligans) or even “web searching” since these items can be subject
to rapid change. Apple Computer’s release of the iPhone4 introducing voice activated search
(“Siri”), has already been upgraded, and is surely not the last change in technology or search.

1.5 Research	  questions	  
The purpose of this dissertation is to contribute towards a better understanding of the differing
capabilities of children of different ages to solve information problems. Findings will help to
identify standard statements and curriculum that are both developmentally appropriate and
viewed by practitioners as important. The end goal is to make a contribution toward a coherent,
comprehensive framework describing developmentally appropriate information literacy
standards for youth of different ages. Three main questions are explored:
	  
20	  

	  
1. What developmental differences in information problem solving abilities are reflected in
educational standard statements as they relate to youth at different ages?
a. To what extent are the developmental differences in information problem solving
abilities reflected in educational standard statements as they relate to youth at
different ages consistent with the judgments of expert, experienced teachers?
b. To what degree do standard statements deal with a single concept?
c. To what extent does clarity of writing impact interpretation of standard
statements?
2. What developmental differences in information problem solving abilities do expert
practitioners identify as they relate to youth at different ages?
a. To what extent do expert practitioners agree with the grade level appropriateness
of individual education standards concerning information literacy?
b. To what extent do expert practitioners view the importance of individual
education standards concerning information literacy?
3. How do information problem solving abilities, at different developmental levels, as
reflected in educational standards (both subject area and information literacy), match
those identified by expert practitioners? What areas are aligned and where are the gaps?

	  

21	  

	  
1.5.1 Research	  question	  1	  
The first question asks: do standard statements expect older students to do more difficult tasks
than younger students? Do they do this in a consistent manner? Are standards more rigorous as
they increase in grade level? Are these changes discernible by classroom teachers?
This question is based on the assumption that there are changes in information literacy skills that
are developmental--i.e., abilities change as students mature. This assumption is the foundation of
the organization and practices of educational systems. Students from kindergarten to graduate
school are expected to master material that progresses in difficulty as they advance through the
various levels of their schools. Educational systems assume and operate on the idea that students
do exhibit changes over time and this has led to the creation of standards that expect
progressively higher levels of achievement by students. The assumption is clearly present, but do
the standards for information problem solving consistently and appropriately increase in level,
both in terms of level of difficulty and in quantity? Do they accurately reflect the developmental
levels that would be derived from an analysis of current theories of cognitive development in
psychology?
1.5.2 Research	  question	  2	  
Question two asks what do expert practitioners expect of students at different grade levels in
terms of information problem solving abilities? The sub questions address to what extent expert
practitioners view any individual standards statement as grade level appropriate and as an
important standard for their students to learn. Teachers must implement a given curriculum and,
as described above, there are more standards to implement than time to implement them
(Marzano & Kendall, 1998). This leaves teacher discretion as an important factor in what is

	  

22	  

	  
actually taught. The standard statements teachers view as both grade level appropriate and as
important are more apt to be taught.
1.5.3 Research	  question	  3	  
The last question is motivated by the need for developmentally appropriate standard statements
in information literacy, the criticisms of standard statements in general, and the lack of an
analytical review of information literacy standard statements. Do expert, experienced classroom
teachers agree with the information literacy standard statements and to what extent? Are the
views of expert, experienced classroom teachers aligned with the standard statements? To what
degree are they aligned? Are there gaps in agreement, and if so, what and where are they?
What is taught in schools can be viewed in three ways: the intended curriculum, the enacted
curriculum, and the received curriculum. The intended curriculum is the material covered by the
standard statements. This is what the state, the school board, and the local administration intends
to be taught in any particular classroom. The enacted (or taught) curriculum is what the teacher
actually teaches, while the received curriculum is that actually learned by the student. The
enacted curriculum can vary from teacher to teacher and the received curriculum will vary from
student to student as each student takes away their own individual learning (Glatthorn, 1999; A.
C. Porter & Smithson, 2001; Schubert, 2008).
These questions were aimed at examining the potential gap between what is intended to be
taught at different developmental levels and what practitioners believe should be taught based on
their experience.

	  

23	  

	  

1.6 Methodological	  overview	  
This study was a mixed method research project utilizing a sequential explanatory design
(Creswell, 2009). It sought to describe and evaluate information literacy standards from the
perspective of expert teachers. This was achieved by combining a quantitative survey of National
Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) from the state of Washington with two qualitative methods:
1) a content analysis of information literacy standards from the AASL and the Common Core;
and 2) a series of focus groups of NBCTs to examine and offer explanations of the data collected
in the survey and the content analysis. The use of a combination of quantitative and qualitative
methods can lead to a richer understanding of the research questions (Creswell, 2009; Fidel,
2008; Krathwohl, 1998). The investigation consisted of three phases.
The main focus of the research is on expert, experienced practitioners – experienced classroom
teachers who have earned National Board Certification. There are multiple possibilities for
gathering information from teachers – surveys, interviews, observations, and focus groups. Two
methods were selected: a survey and focus groups.
The first phase of the research project was a content analysis of the AASL and the Common
Core standards statements. The first step in this process was to determine which of the standards
statements fit into a particular stage of the Big6 model of information problem solving. Only
those standard statements that deal with information literacy as operationalized by the Big6
information problem solving model stages two, three, and four were included in this research
project. Specific questions the content analysis will address are related to research question
number one: “What developmental differences in information problem solving abilities are
reflected in subject area educational standard statements as they relate to youth at different
ages?” The content analysis will address the following sub-questions of RQ1:
	  
24	  

	  
b) To what degree are standard statements internally (within one document, i.e. the AASL
or the Common Core standard statements) consistent in content level and rigor at each
grade level? To what degree do the standard statements ask students to perform tasks of
the same magnitude, or level of difficulty, at the same grade level, and consistently
increasing as grades levels increase.
c) To what degree are standard statements internally consistent in content level and rigor at
each level?
d) To what degree are standard statements externally (across standard statements issuing
organizations, i.e. between AASL and Common Core) consistent in content level and
rigor?
e) To what degree are standard statements externally consistent in content level and rigor at
each level?
In phase two, a survey of NBCTs was used to collect quantitative data. The survey asked NBCTs
to complete a rating scale ranking standards statements according to the perceived level of
students’ ability to accomplish each item. The survey had three sections.. The first section will
randomly mix standard statements and ask teachers to assign the statement to a grade level. The
second section asked teachers to examine standard statements from the grade level they teach
and judge the standard statement for it grade level appropriateness and its importance for that
grade level. This section of the survey is modeled on work completed by Florian (1999) for the
Mid-Continent Research Laboratory (MCREL). The third section collected demographic data
including years taught; National Board certificate area, grade level taught, age, gender, size of
school, rural or urban school district
	  

25	  

	  
In the third phase, a qualitative method, focus groups of NBCTs, was used to address RQ 3. How
do information problem solving abilities, at different developmental levels, as reflected in
educational standards (both subject area and information literacy), match those identified by
expert practitioners? What areas are aligned and where are the gaps? Results of the survey and
the content analysis will be utilized to generate the discussion questions for the focus groups.
Kuhlthau (1993) used a similar method (using both focus groups and a survey) in a case study
examining the implementation of a process approach for a library skills curriculum. Gullkikson
(2006) surveyed higher education faculty concerning information literacy standards and
recommended using focus groups to analyze the results. Analysis of the results of all three
phases was ongoing and was used to address RQ3.
Both the second and third phases will draw on the knowledge of teachers who have years of
experience with teaching children on a daily basis. Probert (2009) found that teachers generally
have a good knowledge of what information literacy entails. Research done in reading
development indicates that experienced teachers are able to successfully judge the difficulty
levels of texts (Chall, Bissex, Conard, & Harris-Sharples, 1996). Several authors have used
teachers to analyze the importance and developmental appropriateness of standards (Florian,
1999; Gallant, 2009; Hebbeler & Taylor, 2012).

1.7.2 Grade	  levels	  in	  this	  research	  project	  
This research project is being restricted to grade levels to grades 2, 5, and 8. These are the grade
levels that the AASL has benchmarks for its standards statements. Additionally, this separation
offered enough spread in grade levels that it was assumed differences in grade levels would be
discernible to expert practitioners. Grades 9 – 12 are not being considered because they have
been the slowest to adapt to standards at this point in time (McClure, 2005).
	  

27	  

	  

1.8 Contributions	  
This research project makes contributions in the following areas: theory, methodology, and
pedagogy.
1.8.1 Theoretical	  contributions	  
First, this project points to the need for more empirical data to be collected on children’s’
abilities to solve information problems across differing ages. The differences found between the
authors of the standard statements and the capability of NBCTs to place those standard
statements at the intended grade level, indicates a need for more in-depth study of how children’s
abilities to solve information problems changes as they mature.
Second, this research by identifying areas of alignment and also areas where gaps exist between
expert practitioners’ judgments and educational standards. indicates the need for the
establishment of a developmental theory of information problem solving. There is currently no
developmental theory of information problem solving skills. Such a theory could be used both to
inform practice and to guide the authorship of education standard statements that establish the
curriculum for information problem solving in schools. A developmental theory of information
problem solving would help to align the knowledge of both the authors of standard statements
and that of the practitioners who implement these standard statements..
1.8.2 Methodological	  contributions	  
A second area is a methodological contribution. Focus groups have been used as a source of data
for a variety of topics in information science, but not for determining appropriate developmental
levels of educational standards for information literacy. The focus groups in this research utilized
NBCTs, as opposed to Library Media Specialists or Technology Educators. This is similar to
	  

28	  

	  
research done by Gullikson (2006) in higher education but not previously done in information
problem solving at these grade levels.
1.8.3 Pedagogical	  contributions	  
Third, the research indicates areas where the views of expert, experienced teachers tend to agree
that the grade levels of standard statements are appropriate, providing evidence validating the
information literacy standard statements where agreement exists. This provides support for
instructional practices based on current standard statements where there is agreement between
the authors of the standard statements and the NBCTs. The research also reveals inconsistencies
between the views of expert, experienced teachers and the authors of the standard statements,
indicating areas for further research.

1.9 Summary	  
Information problem solving standards exist in many different forms. There are standards
produced by national content area organizations, by organizations focused on technology, by the
various states, and by local school districts. Standards are important tools that allow educators to
design lessons and assessments and therefore should be developmentally appropriate. This
research proposes to make a contribution toward the creation of a coherent, comprehensive
framework, which describes developmentally appropriate information literacy standards for
youth of different ages.
As a means of addressing this question, the investigation proposed three research questions that
were explored in three phases. This research project involved a sequential explanatory mixed
methods design. A content analysis of the AASL and Common Core standards, a survey of

	  

29	  

	  
NBCTs based on existing standards, and an analysis of the survey and content analysis results
via focus group input were conducted.
This examination of what are appropriate standards in information literacy is of practical
importance because it may lead to more effective teaching, and it is of theoretical importance as
it will be a step in the process of developing a developmental theory of information problem
solving. By examining the intersection of these fields – information science and educational
standards – this research advances the understanding of what appropriate standards for
information literacy should be.

	  

30	  

	  

2. Relevant	  Literature	  
2.1 Introduction	  to	  relevant	  literature	  
This research project examined education standards that deal with information literacy through
the lens of expert, experienced practitioners with the goal of identifying what are current views
on the changes that take place in children as they develop from kindergarten to grade eight. As
there is no theory of development that specifically addresses information problem solving skills,
this chapter draws together theory and empirical research from education, psychology and
information science to provide the background this project is based upon. This chapter deals with
the relevant literature from information science concerning information literacy, from education
concerning learning standards, and from psychology in two areas - development and problem
solving. The intersection of these areas provide a background of what is currently known that is
applicable to the development of information problem solving skills and how these abilities
change over time from kindergarten to eighth grade.

2.2 Information	  literacy	  and	  educational	  standards	  overview	  
The idea of information literacy standards rests on other concepts. It is important to discuss and
gain an understanding of some of these underlying concepts in order to understand the state of
information literacy standards. Understanding underlying concepts is important in any field of
study, but it is distinctly important in studying information literacy standards because there has
not been a comprehensive study of these standards that includes national professional
organizations, state educational organizations, and local school district level organizations.
Examining the state of information literacy standards requires an analysis of the component parts
and then using this analysis to make conclusions about information literacy standards.
	  

31	  

	  
One of those underlying concepts is that information literacy is a subject that is important
enough that it should be taught in schools with standards demarcating what aspects of
information literacy students are to be taught. Understanding information literacy standards
requires understanding what information literacy is and understanding what educational
standards are.
One might first ask, “Why is information literacy important enough to be taught?” One answer
is that information literacy is rapidly becoming the fourth “R”, reasoning, to go along with
reading, writing, and arithmetic (Thompson & Henley, 2000). A more thorough answer to this
question requires a definition of information literacy, and then an examination of its importance.
After defining information literacy and its importance, the second part of the concept of
information literacy standards – the concept of standards in education will be addressed.
What are educational standards? How are they created? How are they used? How do the creators
of standards assign the standards to different grade levels? Once an understanding of standards
has been established, it will be possible to put this understanding together with the definition and
importance of information literacy and then examine information literacy standards.
Information literacy standards are multidimensional. Information literacy is a concept that has its
own advocates/practitioners (i.e. Teacher/Librarians and Technology Instructors) while at the
same time it has been incorporated into numerous content areas in the K-12 educational system
(i.e. Social Studies, History, Science, Mathematics, English, and Reading). This leads to two of
the dimensions of information literacy standards, one in the content areas and the other in areas
that tend to be centered on the technology-based aspects of information literacy.

	  

32	  

	  
Another dimension of information literacy standards is the educational organizational level at
which the standards are created. Standards themselves are created at national, state, and local
levels. National organizations in both information literacy pathways create standards. Examples
of professional organizations that have created technology-based standards at the K-12 level
include, but are not limited to, the American Association of School Librarians (AASL)(American
Association of School Librarians, 2009; American Association of School Librarians &
Association for Educational Communications, 1998) and the International Society for
Technology in Education (ISTE) (American Library Association, 2006; International Society for
Technology in Education, 2007). The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL)
also has information literacy standards (American Library Association, 2006), while these are
aimed at higher education rather than the K-12 system they are important for high school
teacher/librarians and content area teachers to be aware of as they describe the skills necessary at
the next level of education. Examples of organizations that create content area standards are
created by the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS) (National Council for the Social
Studies, 2010), the National Center for History in the Schools (National Center for History in the
Schools et al., 1994), the National Research Council (National Research Council, 1996), the
National Council for Teacher of English (NCTE) and the International Reading Association
(IRA) (National Council of Teachers of English & International Reading Association, 1996), and
the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) (National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics, 2000). Recently the Common Core standards (National Governors Association &
Council of Chief State School Officers, 2012) have also created national standards for English
Language Arts and Mathematics. The standards for English Language Arts include subsections

	  

33	  

	  
for reading and writing in content areas such as Science and History and these areas have
standards pertaining to research skills thus incorporating information literacy.
Information literacy standards are also created at the state level by state educational
organizations. Here again information literacy is included in the dual dimension of content area
standards and in technology-based standards. Finally, information literacy standards are also
created at the local school district level. These local level standards repeat the pattern of
including information literacy standards in technical areas and in content areas.
Sections 2.3 through 2.7 discuss the state of information literacy standards by defining
information literacy, describing educational standards, exploring how standards are created and
assigned to grade levels, examining the different dimensions in which information literacy
standards are created, and then analyzing how information literacy standards are assigned to
different age or grade levels in the K-12 educational system. Sections 2.8 through 2.11 review
concepts related to cognitive development, problem solving, information problem solving, and
finally the intersections between these three areas. Section 2.12 summarizes the review of
literature.

2.3 Information	  literacy	  
It is easy to find quotes from educators and theorists on the growing amount of information
students need to be able to deal with. In the 1980s Irving (1985, p. 11) used the phrase
“information explosion”; in the 1990s Eisenberg and Berkowitz (1990, p. 6) turned the words
around and used the phrase “explosion of information.” Lazonder, Biemans, and Wopereis a
decade later (2000, p. 576) wrote of an “impending information overload.” Kuhlthau, Maniotes,

	  

34	  

	  
and Caspari in 2007 (p. 2) wrote of “vast quantities of information.” Kuhlthau had earlier
written that, “Information seeking is a primary activity of life” (2004, p. 13).
It seems clear that the amount of information is rapidly expanding. We live in the information
age and the ability to find the useful information amid all the background noise is a skill that will
benefit students their entire lives. Information literacy may be the most important skill that
students will take away from their education years. In 2009 President Barrack Obama even
declared October as National Information Literacy month (Obama, 2009). But what is
information literacy? This section offers a definition of information literacy at the beginning of
the 21st century.
2.3.1 Information	  literacy	  defined	  
If one is literate one has the ability to read and write, or in other words to derive meaning and to
express meaning using words. Information literacy then is the ability to derive meaning from
information (Thompson & Henley, 2000).
The term “information literacy” was first used by Paul Zurkowski in 1974 (Doyle, 1994;
Eisenberg, Lowe, & Spitzer, 2004). Information literacy has been interpreted to mean a variety
of different things. Should it include computer literacy, visual literacy, media literacy, and
library literacy, or are these separate concepts? Is information literacy best viewed as information
technology literacy? The definition that appears to have become most widely accepted (Bruce,
1997, 2000; Eisenberg et al., 2004) was put forth in the American Library Association
Presidential Committee on Information Literacy’s Final Report (1989), “To be information
literate, a person must be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to
locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information.”
	  

35	  

	  
There are a variety of other versions of definitions of information literacy. In addition to the
ALA Presidential Committee Final Report, Eisenberg, Lowe, and Spitzer (2004) list an
additional seven definitions of information literacy. Bruce (1997) includes a chapter concerning
descriptions of information literacy with over half a dozen varying definitions. These definitions
differ in the level of specificity dealt with, or through describing different the need for different
types of sources of information to be dealt with (visual literacy, media literacy, network literacy,
etc.). However these definitions differ, their essence is that information literacy means dealing
with information through active and critical thinking.
2.3.2 What	  is	  an	  “information	  literate”	  person?	  
Information literacy standards are created to help generate an information literate person. What
then is an information literate person? Doyle provides one answer. She offers an expanded
definition of information literacy, which derives from a Delphi study carried out in 1991 and
1992 for the National Forum on Information Literacy. She defines information literacy as “the
ability to access, evaluate, and use information from a variety of sources” (Doyle, 1992). Doyle
expanded this concise definition by providing a list of characteristics of an information literate
person. This list is shown in Table 2.1 below.
An information literate person is one who:
Recognizes that accurate and complete information is the basis for intelligent decision-making
Recognizes the need for information
Formulates questions based on information needs
Identifies potential sources of information
Develops successful search strategies
Accesses sources of information including computer-based and other technologies
Evaluates information
Organizes information for practical application
Integrates new information into an existing body of knowledge
Uses information in critical thinking and problem solving
(Doyle, 1994, pp. 29-33)
	  

36	  

	  
Table 2.1. Doyle: An information literate person
Integrating the various definitions of information literacy with Doyle’s characteristics of an
information literate person it is apparent that information literacy requires thinking and
processing information in a useful manner along with the ability to seek out needed information.
It is not enough to simply absorb information; information literacy requires critical thinking
skills. Shapiro & Hughes even call for information literacy to be an entirely new liberal art.
But information literacy should in fact be conceived more broadly as a new liberal art that
extends from knowing how to use computers and access information to critical reflection on the
nature of information itself, its technical infrastructure, and its social, cultural and even
philosophical context and impact--as essential to the mental framework of the educated
information-age citizen as the trivium of basic liberal arts (grammar, logic and rhetoric) was to
the educated person in medieval society. (Shapiro & Hughes, 1996, p. 4)
Francis Bacon once said, “Knowledge is power.” A modern day Bacon might say that an
information literate person is one who can use information literacy skills to gain knowledge and
thus be empowered.
2.3.3 Information	  problem	  solving	  vs.	  information	  literacy	  
As noted in chapter one, information problem solving is a phrase often used in conjunction with
information literacy. This dissertation uses the phrase information problem solving as the
application of information literacy skills to solve information problems.

2.4 Educational	  standards	  
Ravitch4 (1995) poses the question, “What are standards?” Her answer is that the word has a
dual meaning. It implies both a model of achievement and the gauge by which the achievement
is measured. Standards in education may be viewed as experts’ opinions on what students are
capable of and should be doing at a particular grade level (Lee, 2002; A. C. Porter et al., 2009).
The national standards movement emerged out of the educational reform movement of the 1980s
and 1990s that was sparked by the report A Nation at Risk (National Commission on Excellence
in Education, 1983).
In education, standards establish what is to be learned. In layman’s terms, standards are the
defined goals and objectives for instruction and learning, which are often established for each
subject and grade level by states and subject area associations. Two other terms often used in
conjunction with standards in national and state documents are “benchmarks” and “strands.”
However, there are a variety of different uses of these terms (Berger, 2000; Bodrova et al.,
2000). These are discussed below.
2.4.1 Standards	  terminology	  
It is important to understand how the terms standard and benchmark are differentiated in
education. Standards come in several types including content standards, performance standards,
and curriculum standards (Goertz, 2010; Kendall, 2001; Marzano & Kendall, 1996c; Ravitch,
1995).

In Ravitch’s latest book she comes out against standardized testing, the No Child Left Behind
Act, and charter schools. She argues that the national standards movement died in 1995 with the
controversy over the United States History standards. Standards creation was left to the states
and she offers many of the same criticism of standards as others which are discussed later in this
dissertation (Ravitch, 2010).
	  
38	  

	  
2.4.1.1 Content	  standards	  
One type of standard is the content standard. This type of standard defines what it is that is to be
learned. A content standard equates to Ravitch’s first definition of standard as that of a model of
achievement.
Academic content standards indicate what a student should know and be able to do in the areas
such as mathematics, history, reading, and science (Goertz, 2010; A. C. Porter et al., 2009;
Stecher et al., 2008). Content standards, as defined by Marzano and Kendall (Kendall, 2001;
Marzano & Kendall, 1996c) are summary descriptions used to organize entire disciplines. As
such they tend to be statements that are broad and inclusive. A relatively few standards will
encompass an entire discipline of study. One example is the AASL’s new standards of which
there are only four (American Association of School Librarians, 2009). These four AASL
standards are shown below in Table 2.2. An example from a national content area organization is
the NCTM standards, which include five content standards (Numbers and Operations, Algebra,
Geometry, Measurement, and Data analysis and probability) and five process standards (Problem
solving, Reasoning and proof, Communications, Connections, and Representations) (National
Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000). An example from a state level organization content
area is the state of Washington’s social studies standards. Washington, has only five social
studies standards, one for each of the discipline areas, civics, economics, geography, and history,
and a fifth for social studies skills (Washington Office of the Superintendent of Public
Instruction, 2008). (Washington refers to its standards as Essential Academic Learning
Requirements or EALRs). Each of the EALRs is broken down into three to five components, but
Marzano and Kendall’s description of standards as overarching descriptions of the knowledge in
a discipline still applies.

3

democratic society
4
Pursue personal and aesthetic growth
Table 2.2. AASL’s Four standards (2009, p. 7)
It should be recognized that in common usage the term “standard” refers to general descriptions
of what should be learned in an academic discipline.
2.4.1.2 Performance	  standards	  
The second type of standard is the performance standard. Performance standards, also referred to
as “achievement standards,” establish at what level a student is to perform a particular task
demonstrating his or her ability in mastering a particular content standard (Goertz, 2010; Stecher
et al., 2008). This is Ravitch’s second meaning of the term standard, that of a gauge of
measurement. Both performance and content standards are obviously important. Students,
teachers, parents, and administrators need to know what is to be learned or taught and how well
students should perform to demonstrate that they have learned the intended material.
2.4.1.3 Curricular	  standards	  
Curriculum standards describe what should take place in the classroom in terms of instructional
technique. Content standards are those that refer to the material that is to be taught, while
curriculum standards refer to the activities that are used to teach the content (Marzano &
Kendall, 1996c).

	  

40	  

	  
2.4.1.4 Benchmarks	  
Benchmarks are indicators of progress toward achieving a standard, as such; benchmarks are a
subcomponent of the more inclusive standards (Bodrova et al., 2000). Benchmarks have a more
detailed description of what is to be learned. Benchmarks generally address what is to be taught
at a particular grade level or band of grade levels (e.g. K-2, or 3-5). The AASL standards have
benchmarks at grades 2, 5, 8, 10, and 12 (2009). NCTM’s standards are broken into grade level
bands with the subcomponent being “expectations” (2000). Washington’s social studies
standards have benchmarks, referred to as Grade Level Expectations (GLEs), at each grade level
(Washington Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, 2008).
Benchmarks are more finely grained than standards. Standards represent the big overarching
picture. They are the main ideas of a particular discipline. Benchmarks are the narrower (though
not necessarily narrowly) defined topics of a discipline. Marzano and Kendall suggest thinking
of standards as what a student will achieve by the end of their time in school, and benchmarks as
those items to be achieved at specified grade levels or even grade bands (i.e. grades 3-5). Neither
standards nor benchmarks are so finely grained that they can be learned in a single afternoon
(Kendall, 2001).
2.4.1.5 Strands	  
Kendall defines a strand as a topic or level of content organization that falls between a standard
and a benchmark. He uses the examples of Shapes and Figures in the NCTM standard of
Geometry (Kendall, 2001). The AASL standards use the term strand in the same way. There are
four strands that fit between the four AASL standards and the grade level benchmarks (2009).

	  

41	  

	  
NCSS uses the term “strands” to refer to the ten organizing themes of social studies. These
content themes or strands, however, appear to be at much the same level as the “standards” for
NCTM (Table 2.3). NCSS calls it standards “Curriculum Standards” (2010, p. 12), not content
standards. NCSS sees its standards as higher-level guidelines for organizing an entire program of
study in a state or a school district, not as a guide to content in a particular class.

2.4.2 Problems	  with	  standards	  
Standards have quite a few problems as they currently exist in the United States. One
acknowledgement of these problems is the Common Core movement that creating a unified
collection of standards in English/Language Arts and Mathematics for all fifty states (as
previously noted, over 40 of which have officially adopted (National Governors Association &
Council of Chief State School Officers, 2012)). The idea behind the Common Core is that one set
of national standards would be simpler and cheaper for the states to use as curriculum and
assessment guides. Content areas subject should not differ from state to state. Math is math and
math taught in Virginia should be the same as math taught in Texas or Oregon.

	  

42	  

	  
2.4.2.1 Identified	  issues	  with	  standards	  
Marzano and Kendall (Marzano & Kendall, 1996c, 1997, 1998) identified several major
problems with national standards some of which as can be seen below are also problems with
state documents. The first is the existence of multiple documents covering the same content
areas. According Marzano and Kendall (Marzano & Kendall, 1998) a school district would have
to consult 116 documents to make a comprehensive review of the various content areas.
A second area of concern is too much information. Marzano and Kendall quote educational
researcher Chester Finn, Jr. who said the educational professional organizations “demonstrated
gluttonous and imperialistic tendencies” (Marzano & Kendall, 1997, p. 30). Content area
specialists love their subjects and no one ever wants to cut something out so content standards
continue to grow. Gagnon (1994, p. 7) argues, “The central failure of the published standards
documents is their length and pretension. They produced encyclopedia, not cores.” Researchers
at the Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning (McREL) have estimated that it
would take 21 years of schooling (compared to the current 13) to teach all the standards
(approximately 200 standards and 3,090 benchmarks) that are promulgated by national
organizations (Marzano & Kendall, 1998). Reitsma, Marshall, & Zarske (2010) found 60,000
state related science and math standards in the Achievement Standard Network. The sheer
number supports Lee (2002, p. 39) who likens standards documents to laundry lists and claims,
“All teachers recognize the foolishness of even attempting to teach everything in these lists.”
The problem with too much information has not gone away. Goertz (2010, p. 59) asserts, “In
contrast with other countries our state standards are unfocused, lack coherence, and have led to a
curriculum in the United States that is a ‘mile wide and inch deep’.” Linn (2010) contends that
there are too many topics in science education standards. She uses the example of California
	  

43	  

	  
where 8th graders learn nine general science topics and 46 specific topics, which she compares to
Japanese 8th graders who learn 8 topics – and outscore the United States on national tests.
According to Linn, “The only area we have been able to control this proliferation is in the weight
of textbooks. Those concerned with stress injuries to children have succeeded in curtailing the
weight of textbooks – for the moment” (p. 103). Interestingly, Linn would like to see
engineering, computer fluency, 21st century thinking skills, and computational thinking added to
the standards.
A third area of concern identified by Marzano and Kendall is controversial content. The history
standards were criticized as being too politically correct and under representing the
accomplishments of traditional historical figures such as George Washington and Robert E. Lee.
The language arts standards produced by the Standards Project for the English Language Arts
(SPELA) was dogged by controversy over instructional methods and which children’s literature
was to be included (Marzano & Kendall, 1997). Goertz (2010) points to the controversy over
the “math wars” and evolution at the state levels.
The fourth area Marzano and Kendall list as a problem is different levels of generality. As noted
above Kendall defines a standard as an overarching statement that is used to organize
disciplinary information into large categories of learning that can then be broken down into
benchmarks.

Another issue that is evident from the discussion above concerning definitions is that the terms
associated with standards are themselves used in a confusing manner (Berger, 2000). Kendall
refers to as a “strand” in the math goals as a subset of a standard. While in the NCSS standards
what is referred to as a “strand” or “theme,” is more closely aligned to the meaning of the term
“standards” in the NCTM document. The state of Washington uses neither the term standards nor
benchmarks, but rather EALRs and GLEs. The different types of standards are in themselves
confusing as Marzano and Kendall point out that they often find content and curricular standards
mixed together (Marzano & Kendall, 1996c).
In work more current than that of Marzano and Kendall, Phillips (2009, p. 28) states that
standards come from a “political sausage factory, in which the most important goal is to respect
each individual committee member’s personal, cherished opinions.” This is quite similar to the
comment by Chester Finn noted above from over a decade earlier. Goertz maintains that
standards are driving educational change, but, “Policy makers must reach consensus on the type,
content, and specificity of the standards; determine who will develop the standards; and facilitate
the implementation of the standards” (2010, p. 52).
A separate issue is that most states have wanted to set their own standards (Marzano & Kendall,
1997). States historically have not been keen on simply adopting standards set by national
organizations, as a result the quality level of state standards is inconsistent. When Peterson and
Hess (2008) examined state standards compared to proficiency tests they found that the quality
of state standards varied widely. One of their conclusions was “If Billy and Sally cannot read in
South Carolina, they should not be able to pass muster simply by crossing the state’s western
border” (p. 72). This particular concern is rapidly becoming a moot point as states adopt the
Common Core curriculum.
	  

45	  

	  
2.4.2.2 Issues	  with	  the	  Common	  Core	  standards	  
The newest aspect of the standards movement is the work of creating the Common Core
standards in Mathematics and English/Language Arts (National Governors Association &
Council of Chief State School Officers, 2012). Forty-three states have adopted the Common
Core standards, yet the Common Core standards are not without issues. Porter, McMaken,
Hwang, & Yang (2010) using the Survey of Enacted Curriculum (SEC), found low to moderate
alignment between both state standards and assessments and the Common Core. The National
Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards did not exhibit a higher degree of
alignment with the Common Core standards than the state standards on average. Porter et al. also
compared the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) to the Common Core
standards and found only slightly higher alignment than with the state assessments.
Tienken (2010) questions the basic assumptions for the need for the Common Core. He argues
that the United States’ educational system neither lags behind the rest of the world nor that the
scores of United States’ students on international tests are an indicator of a coming economic
disaster. Thus Tienken does not think the effort and change needed to have new common
standards are required or worthwhile.

2.5 Information	  literacy	  standards	  
Information literacy standards have several different dimensions. They are like other subject
areas in that they are written at national, state, and local levels. They differ from other subject
areas in that they are virtually always seen as a process skill that is necessary to learn or deal
with the content in the various subject areas. As such information literacy standards are also
created by and included within the various content areas. In many cases, these standards include
information literacy standards, although information literacy is not necessarily the primary focus.
	  
46	  

	  
Professional organizations with a technology or information literacy concentration, such as ISTE
and the AASL, have also established information literacy standards with a technology or
information studies emphasis.
Table 2.5 shows the various permutations of information literacy standards and the flow from
national organization to state to local school district. Standards may vary from being created in a
content area by a local school district to being created by an organization with a technical focus
at a national level. Theoretically the creation of standards flows from the expertise of the
professional organizations to the states to the local school districts.

Table 2.5. Information literacy standards variations
2.5.1 Technical	  standards	  
This dissertation uses the term “technical” standards to refer to those standards that have a basis
in technology such as the ISTE standards or from a library background, such as the AASL
standards.
2.5.1.1 AASL	  standards	  
AASL released its first set of standards in 1998 as Information Power (American Association of
School Librarians & Association for Educational Communications, 1998). Updated standards
were released in 2009 titled Standards for the 21st-Century Learner In Action. These new
standards include a greater emphasis on different types of literacy – including digital, visual,
textual and technological than the 1998 standards (American Association of School Librarians,
2009). As noted above, there are only four AASL standards. There are also four strands between
the standards and the benchmarks. Benchmarks are for grades 2, 5, 8, 10, and 12.

	  

48	  

	  
2.5.1.2 ISTE	  standards	  
First released in 1998, the ISTE National Educational Technology Standards for Students
(NETS*S) were updated and rereleased in 2007. There are six standards and each standard has
four performance indicators. Five of the six standards are related to information literacy skills in
terms of critical thinking, while the sixth, “Technology Operations and Concepts” is aimed at
technological literacy, the ability to understand technology concepts, systems and operations.
2.5.1.3 Critiques	  of	  technical	  information	  literacy	  standards	  
Johnson (2007) argues for a combined set of technology and information literacy skills, urging
the ISTE and AASL to work together to produce one joint set of standards. He contends there is
quite a bit of overlap between the standards and that the voices of educators who are concerned
with information literacy and technological literacy would be stronger if they were united behind
one set of standards. Others disagree with Johnson. Donham (2008) argues that the various sets
of standards are more complementary than overlapping and at this point we still need both.
Bartow (2009), in her account of the revision of Information Literacy/Library Media and
Technology Content Standards of Montana, asserts that it is premature for Montana to combine
these two as areas of its state’s performance standards.
2.5.2 Information	  literacy	  skills	  in	  content	  area	  standards	  
Information literacy skills show up in content area standards that originate in subject areas such
as English/Language Arts, Social Studies, History, Science, and Mathematics. These areas all
have standards dealing with research skills or problem solving skills that can easily be
interpreted to be information literacy skills.

Each of these standards include some portion of the skills identified in the Final Report of the

and have the ability to locate, evaluate and use effectively information.
2.5.2.2 State	  level	  content	  area	  standards	  
Table 2.7 shows examples of information literacy skills in the content area standards from five
states. The states were chosen for examination for the following reasons. Texas represents a large
(population) state and a state that has not joined in the Common Core movement. Montana was
selected for its work with Library Media and Information Literacy standards. Iowa represents the
	  

50	  

	  
middle of the country. North Carolina is representative of the south and the east coast. It
combines Computer/Technology Skills standards with Information Literacy standards.
Washington was selected for its west coast location and because it is the state where this work is
being done.
Three areas were picked for review – Social Studies, Science, and Mathematics. Each state
except Iowa had content area standards in all three areas. Iowa has content standards only in the
areas of Science, Math, and Reading. Table 5 shows typical content standards from these states
that concern information literacy skills. These standards deal with locating, synthesizing, and
evaluating information – critical thinking skills, or the fourth “R” reasoning as Thompson and
Henley (2000) said. As in the national content areas these are also the skills identified in the
Final Report of the Presidential Committee on Information Literacy.

Table 2.7. Examples of State Content Standards that contain Information Literacy
components
These states and standards were chosen to illustrate the various areas where information literacy
standards are found in state standards. Forty-three states have moved to adopt the Common Core
standards, thus it appears to be somewhat of a moot point to look at state standards. However,
table 2.7 does give an indication of the pervasiveness of standards that are information literacy
related.
2.5.3 Issues	  with	  information	  literacy	  standards	  
Marzano and Kendall (1996a, 1996b, 1996c, 1997), Porter and colleagues (A. Porter et al., 2010;
A. C. Porter et al., 2009) and the Common Core (National Governors Association & Council of
Chief State School Officers, 2012) have analyzed standards, but a comprehensive analysis of
standards focusing on information literacy has not been done. The issue noted by Marzano and
Kendall of multiple documents is also an issue with information literacy standards. There are
multiple organizations and agencies that have issued standards in this area. As previously noted
some writers view these multiple documents as complementary and others urge for their
unification.
One aspect of the issue of multiple documents is the potential conflict between the demands
standards place on classroom teachers and the desires of Teacher/Librarians to incorporate
information literacy skills into the curriculum. Standards and high stakes testing do make a
difference in what teachers teach. There are more content area standards to teach than time to
	  

52	  

	  
teach it; as a result, teachers focus on that material that is tested (D. Johnson, 2007; Julien &
Barker, 2009). Eisenberg calls this issue “curriculum information overload” and goes on to assert
that, “The last thing that faculty and students need is more content” (Eisenberg, 2008, p. 45). The
resulting problem is that unless there is a clear connection between the content area standards
and the information literacy standards there may well be a disconnect in attempts to coordinate
teaching information literacy skills with classroom teachers.
In addition, there is little reason to think that information literacy standards differ from other
curriculum area. Thus it seems likely that varying definitions, levels of generality and levels of
subordination are also concerns in information literacy.
Finally, both Marcoux (2008) and Ballard (2009) have written of the need for Teacher/Librarians
to adopt the new AASL standards. There is almost a tone of pleading in these articles for
Teacher/Librarians to (using Ballard’s metaphor) “join the wagon train.” Marcoux argues that
“more and more influential people perceive that the school library program and profession aren’t
necessarily succeeding with these expectations” (p. 18). She goes on to say instead of working
out a partnership with school libraries, these groups are, “incorporating them without the
inclusion of the school library program and professional”(p. 18). Ballard writes, “If all our
efforts do not pay dividends, school libraries and school library media specialists will be a bust”
(p. 15). These comments leave one with the sense that the standards are not as useful for
Teacher/Librarians (and thus not being adopted as widely) as the national organization would

2.6 How	  are	  standards	  created?	  
2.6.1 Standards	  in	  general	  
Standards are frequently created by a group of “experts” (Ballard, 2009; Barnett, 2008; Lee,
2002). The data in Table 2.8 shows an overview of the process that six national professional
organizations used to create their standards documents. In each a task force or committee was
authorized to fabricate the standards. In three of the six organizations a process of sharing a draft
or gathering input was described as being carried out. The feedback obtained was then
incorporated into a draft set of standards, another round of feedback occurred and then a final
version was produced. According to Goertz (2010), the NCTM has used consensus methods to
develop standards. The United States History Standards were developed through a “broad-based
national consensus building process” (National Center for History in the Schools et al., 1994, p.
iii). Apparently the consensus building was not broad-based enough. Shortly before the United
States History standards were released Lynne V. Cheney, the chairperson of the National
Endowment for the Humanities, attacked them. This was particularly damaging because she had
funded the standards development. “Cheney lambasted the standards as the epitome of left-wing
political correctness, because they emphasized the nation’s failings and paid scant attention to its
great men” (Ravitch, 2010, p. 17). Consensus building would appear to the method used by the
other professional organizations given their descriptions of committees of focus groups and
committees. One often repeated criticism of standards is that they are bloated since compromise
equals addition without subtraction (Lee, 2002; Marzano & Kendall, 1996c, 1998; V. Phillips,
2009; Schmoker & Marzano, 1999). This criticism supports the idea that standards are developed
through an attempt to reach consensus.

Table 2.8. National Professional Organization Standards – Overview of process to generate
standards
2.6.2 How	  are	  information	  literacy	  standards	  developed?	  
Bartow (2009) in Montana and Barnett (2008) in Arkansas have each written accounts of the
development of information literacy standards at the state level. Both processes seem similar to
that described by the national professional organizations. Montana had formed teams of
educators to create their original standards, and used the AASL Information Power standards and
	  

55	  

	  
the Big6 information problem solving process as references. In revising their standards, focus
groups were used to gather input and a standards committee was formed with Dr. Michael
Eisenberg of the University of Washington contracted to act as a consultant. Bartow describes
using the new standards from AASL, ISTE and the ACRL as guidelines along with writings from
a variety of experts.
Barnett describes the process of writing state standards for Arkansas as having several major
differences when compared to writing national standards for AASL. First, while the national
standards focused on outcomes, the state standards focused on skills at a particular grade level.
Second, the state required broad representation on the committee resulting in a 45-member
committee. Barnett comments, “My previous experiences have shown that it is nearly impossible
to get that many people to agree on anything” (2008, p. 22). Two other areas of difference
concerned the structure of the frameworks and the level of confidentiality required by the
Arkansas was much greater than that of AASL. Arkansas requires all its subject frameworks to
have the same structure. Barnett asserts that the required framework made it difficult to write
standards for a subject needing to be integrated into other content areas.

2.7 Developmental	  levels	  and	  standards	  
Understanding the differing capabilities of children of varying ages allows for the creation of
standards that are appropriate for different developmental ages. Appropriate in this case refers to
concepts or instructional matter that it is reasonable to expect children of a given age to master.
The goal of age appropriate standards is to allow curriculum planners and teachers to plan and
implement lessons that are appropriate to the children in a particular grade level or classroom.
Developmentally appropriate standards also allow for the proper assessment of children’s
learning and for assessment of instruction.
	  

56	  

	  
2.7.1 Educational	  standards	  and	  children’s	  development	  
Benchmarks should be developmentally appropriate (Bodrova et al., 2000). However there is
scant documentation to help standards writers to know how to place benchmarks at particular
grade levels (Zenger & Zenger, 2002, 2003). Kendall’s work is a guide for school districts
writing their own standards. He states:
The individual state standards documents should be particularly helpful when outside
comparison is needed to determine at what grade a benchmark would best be placed. Absent a
substantive body of knowledge based on empirical research on such a question, we must rely
heavily upon the knowledge and experience of classroom teachers and other educators to help
inform decisions concerning the appropriate grade placement. Considering the consensus process
by which they were formed, these documents represent that information fairly well. (Kendall,
2001, p. 11)
Kendall goes on to say, “Because there is no definitive work on what knowledge and skills
should be addressed at each and every grade level, the work of grade placement of content is at
best an ‘educated guess,’ at worst, and arbitrary assignment” (p. 17). According to Peterson and
Hess (2008) one national metric does exist, the National Assessment of Education Progress
(NAEP) test. How does the NAEP assign a difficulty level to each of its items? “Basically, it
asks informed experts to judge the difficulty of each of the items in its test bank” (Peterson &
Hess, 2008, p. 70).
2.7.2 Information	  literacy	  standards	  and	  children’s	  development	  
Many authors have recognized the importance of cognitive development to information literacy
instruction (Eastin, 2008; Jackson, 2007, 2008b; Kuhlthau, 1981, 1987; Kuhlthau et al., 2007;
	  

57	  

	  
McGuire, 1998; Orme, 2008). Kuhlthau’s (1981) book is a guide enabling teacher librarians to
implement developmentally-appropriate library skills lessons, a pre-cursor to the both the current
standards movement and the concept of information literacy skills. However, there is little to
indicate that information literacy standards are based on empirical research any more so than
other educational standards. Kuhlthau’s 1981 work was written based on her personal experience
and through her application of the theories of the theorist Jean Piaget.
Standards often cover a band of grade levels (e.g. Grades 1-3) defining an expected outcome
only at the end of third grade. Educators would find finely grained standards more useful than
benchmarks covering grade bands. Most useful for educators would be a developmental theory
of information problem solving that could be used to establish standards at a level so that
standards could be clearly differentiated for each year in school (Marzano, 2001). This may not
be possible. The shifts in thinking may cover too broad an age range to be able to generate such
fine-grained differentiation. Marzano (2001) describes this as a problem with standards in
general. As Marzano points out, benchmarks covering grades 1-3 leaves teachers in first and
second grades with out clear guidance as to what to expect of their students. Therefore refining
standards to be as finely grained as possible is an important goal.
The dynamic ecological perspective emphasizes each individual child’s unique development
(Daniels & Clarkson, 2010). Thus, since all individuals are unique, it becomes impossible to
have “standards” for grade levels based on age appropriate developmental differences. This,
however, is an intolerable situation given the current structure of the educational system in the
United States. Educational systems have been and are based on age specific grade levels. Each
grade level is expected to teach children age appropriate content. Here then is a conundrum,
children are developmentally unique but placed in a system of standardized grades and advanced
	  
58	  

	  
by age cohorts whether they are ready or not (Daniels & Clarkson, 2010). Does this mean
educators should abandon the search for developmentally appropriate information literacy
standards? No, but it must be recognized that some of what is done is really a best guess
approximation. What might be more important is to begin searching for a developmental
sequence or pattern that is exhibited by learners as more sophisticated information literacy skills
are developed.
2.7.3 Information	  literacy	  and	  educational	  standards	  conclusion	  
A comprehensive framework of developmentally appropriate information literacy standards is
important for a variety of reasons. Standards themselves are important to the process of
education as they provide a roadmap of what should be taught. Information literacy is an
important subject for students to learn at the start of the 21st century as has previously been
noted. Developmentally appropriate standards are important to insure students have the abilities
to accomplish the tasks set before them.
There has been no comprehensive study of information literacy standards. It is necessary to look
at the critiques of standards in general and then apply these critiques to the various levels of
information literacy standards. Doing so this dissertation has found –

	  

•

Information literacy standards are multi-dimensional:

•

They exist in content areas (English/Language Arts, History, Science, Mathematics)

•

They exist in technical areas (ISTE and AASL standards)

•

They exist are different levels of educational organizations:

59	  

	  
o National
o State
o Local
•

They are part of the standards movement

No comprehensive examination of the information literacy standards has been completed, but we
do know there are problems with standards in general –
•

Lack of consistent terminology

•

Too many

•

Too much information packed into the standards documents

•

Lack of a consistent level of specificity

•

Confusion & mixing among types of standards
o Performance
o Content
o Curricular

Information literacy standards have been created in a similar manner to the standards of other
national organizations and thus there is reason to believe they may be afflicted with the same
issues as other types of standards.

2.8 Cognitive	  development	  and	  information	  problem	  solving	  	  
Information problem solving is often said to be the key skill of the 21st century (Eisenberg, 2008;
Eisenberg et al., 2004; Heider, 2009; Heinstrom, 2006; Kuhlthau, 1994, 2004, 2008;
Marchionini, 1999; Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2009). It is a skill that has been taught in
the past, often referred to as “research skills” or “library skills.” With the advent of the World
Wide Web, and an ever-increasing number of sources of information, the ability to expertly
navigate these sources and find the required or desired information has become increasingly
difficult. Yet, as information sources move to electronic versions, this ability is increasingly
important. One result has been an increasing number of proponents urging the inclusion of
information problem solving skills into the formal school curriculum across all grade levels
(American Association of School Librarians, 2009; American Association of School Librarians
& Association for Educational Communications, 1998; Eisenberg, 2008; Eisenberg et al., 2004;
Large, Nesset, & Beheshti, 2008; Walraven, Brand-Gruwel, & Boshuizen, 2008).
When new areas are introduced into the curriculum it would seem logical to review the material
to ensure it is developmentally appropriate for the intended audience (Vygotsky & Cole, 1978).
Applying this to the introduction of information problem solving into the school curricula, one
would imagine that it would be important to link the skills and tasks taught at each grade level to
the theoretically appropriate developmental level. However, little research or attention has been
paid to the general area of assigning content to a particular grade level (Kendall, 2001; Zenger &
Zenger, 2002, 2003). According to Peterson and Hess (2008) one national metric does exist, the
National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) test. How does the NAEP assign a difficulty
level to each of its items? “Basically, it ask informed experts to judge the difficulty of each of the

	  

61	  

	  
items in its test bank” (Peterson & Hess, 2008, p. 70). This work of basing instructional
standards on research remains to be done in information problem solving.
In psychology the field of cognitive development examines the changes in children’s cognitive
abilities as they mature. A second area of psychology investigates the field of problem solving. It
seems reasonable and useful to take the findings from these areas and use as a lens for
interpreting the question, “What skills should be taught at what grade levels?” This research
project is particularly focused on how these factors apply to children of school age, those in the
pre-adolescent and early adolescent age groups, roughly ages 7-14.
A third area of interest is learning theory. The effects of development and learning are often
difficult to distinguish. “Development and learning are not two parallel processes” (J. D.
Bransford et al., 2000, pp. 112-113). Differences in development and learning are discussed in
greater detail below.
This section first discusses a selected views of key theorists from the field of cognitive
development, next the general area of problem solving, then examines some of the key ideas of
how people learn, a brief overview of different models of IPS and finally attempts to put these
areas together to how they might inform teaching and learning of information problem solving in
K-12 education.
2.8.1 Introduction	  
The study of cognitive development began in the late 1800’s with the work of James Baldwin
(Case, 1996; Moshman, 1998). Since then a vast literature and competing interpretations have
developed around the subject. Garton (2004) writes that cognitive development generally divides
into either Piagetian or Vygotskyian lines of research. Miller (2002) on the other hand offers
	  

62	  

	  
seven major theories and an additional five emerging theories. Miller (2002) and Bee & Boyd
(2010) argue that a result of the existence of competing theories is that most developmental
scientists favor the use of an eclectic approach using multiple theories to gain insight into
development. This last approach, carefully applied, is the one taken in this dissertation.
This project is focused around school age children (ages 7 – 14); so cognitive developmental
issues dealing with children younger than five to six years of age are not addressed.
The following sections define the terms cognition and development and briefly describe some of
the key concept of various theorist that may later be useful in examining IPS.
2.8.2 Definitions	  
2.8.2.1 Cognition	  
Flavell, Miller & Miller’s first sentence in their text on cognitive development is, “The really
interesting concepts of this world have the nasty habit of avoiding our most determined efforts to
pin them down, to make them say something definite and then make them stick to it” (2002, p.
1). Flavell et al. are writing about cognition and say it is usually applied to the higher mental
processes (similar to those noted below by Berk) but that most modern psychologists would also
want to include areas such as motor movement and perception. Flavell et al. assert that once you
open the process of including items in cognition it becomes hard to know where to stop.
Berk and Bjorklund offer more concise definitions in their textbooks as seen by the definitions in
Table 2.9.
“Cognition refers to the inner processes and
products of the mind that lead to ‘knowing.’ It
includes all mental activity – attending,
remembering, symbolizing, categorizing,
	  

“Cognition: The processes or faculties by
which knowledge is acquired and manipulated.
Cognition is usually thought of as being
mental.”
63	  

	  
planning, reasoning, problem solving, creating,
and fantasizing”
(Berk, 2009, p. 223)

(Bjorklund, 2005, p. 3)

Table 2.9. Textbook definitions of cognition
2.8.2.2 Development	  
Bjorklund defines development as, “Development refers to changes in structure or function over
time” (2005, p. 3). Miller defines a developmental theory in much the same way, “What is
critical about a developmental theory is that it focuses on change over time” (2002, p. 8). Table
2.10 provides a comparison of development and learning.
Development	  
Example: Puberty – attaining sexual
maturity
Changes are extended – a substantial period
of time
Directed from within
Qualitative – puberty is a qualitative
change
Progressive – extends over time in a
systematic way; has a natural progression
Adapted from (Moshman, 1998, 2005)

Learning	  
Example: Learning to stop when the light is
red and go on green
Not necessarily dependent on time; can
vary from minutes to hours to days
More likely to a result of external forces
Learning a rule represents a Quantitative
increase in knowledge
Learning is often culturally based, and
varies according to culture

Table 2.10. Development vs. Learning
2.8.2.3 Cognitive	  development	  
Berk defines cognitive development as “how the intellectual capacities of infants change into the
capacities of a child, adolescent, and adult” (2009, p. 223). Moshman defines cognitive
development as, “the development of knowledge and inference” (2005, p. 2). In other words,
cognitive development is how an individual’s ways of knowing and thinking change over time.
2.8.3 Piaget:	  Stage	  theories	  of	  development	  
Jean Piaget (1896-1980) was not the first developmental psychologist even though it often
appears so when reviewing the literature, but he has been the most influential (Bee & Boyd,
	  

64	  

	  
2010; Berk, 2009; Bjorklund, 2005; Case, 1996; Flavell et al., 2002; Lourenco & Machado,
1996; Miller, 2002). Piaget built upon the ideas of Mark Baldwin, using Baldwin’s
developmental stages as a base and extending, modifying and renaming some of Baldwin’s
stages (Case, 1996, 1998).
In Case’s view Piaget’s most important contribution to Baldwin’s theory was, “the notion of a
‘logical structure,’ that is, a coherent set of logical operations that can be applied to any domain
of human activity and to which any task in the domain must ultimately be assimilated” (1996, p.
1). Flavell defined Piaget’s principal scientific interests as, “the theoretical and experimental
investigation of the qualitative development of intellectual structures” (1963, p. 15). Piaget
viewed the child’s cognitive processes as qualitatively different from an adult’s, not simply as a
miniature version of an older person’s. He thought that children created cognitive structures and
that these structures proceeded through four separate stages: 1) Sensorimotor, 2) Preoperational,
3) Concrete Operations, and 4) Formal operations (Bjorklund, 2005). See Figure 2.1 below for a
graphic depicting these stages.
This dissertation is concerned with school age children so concrete operations and formal
operations will be discussed in somewhat greater depth. The child who has obtained concrete
operations is “a logical and systematic thinker who can transcend misleading appearances by
coordinating multiple aspects of a situation. She or he understands the logic of classes, relations,
and numbers, and routinely makes proper inferences on the basis of coherent conceptual
frameworks” (Moshman, 2005, p. 8). Piaget appears to have the description of the child at this
age correct (DeLoache, Miller, & Pierroutsakos, 1998; Kuhn, 2008; Moshman, 2005).

	  

65	  

	  
One area of particular interest is the transition between pre-adolescence and adolescence, the
shift from concrete operations to formal operations is described by Inhelder and Piaget as a
matter of the child subordinating reality to possibility (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958). For the concrete
operational child possibilities are limited to what can be derived from their experience of reality
(Inhelder & Piaget, 1958). The formal operations child, however, now considers all potential
outcomes.
Looking at education and learning through the lens of Piaget’s theory indicates that children
learn best when they are working at a level that is appropriate to the stage that they are in.
Children will have difficulty successfully retaining material that not is not at that stage. Piaget
viewed the environment around the child as an important part of development, but in terms of
influencing the rate at which a child proceeded through the stages of development rather than
affecting the order of the stages. Piaget’s theory also generally treats development as domain
general, meaning intelligence is a general ability and that developmental changes happen
simultaneously across a wide spectrum.
As noted above many texts laud Piaget for his contributions to developmental psychology (Berk,
2009; Bjorklund, 2005; Case, 1992; Daniels & Clarkson, 2010; Flavell et al., 2002; Miller,
2002). That said, they also offer criticisms of his theories. First, his stages are seen as too rigid.
Second, many children are capable of completing the tasks of a more advanced stage at an earlier
age when they are provided training or when they have the appropriate content knowledge. In
addition, many argue that Piaget had several things wrong about the stage of formal operations.
Moshman (2005) and Kuhn (2006) both describe Piaget’s work concerning the adolescent and
post adolescent ages as being both too wide and too narrow. It is too wide in the sense that many
	  

66	  

	  
adults never reach the stage Piaget described as formal operational (abstract) thinking. It is too
narrow because many children younger than adolescents demonstrate abstract thinking in certain
areas and additionally there are other ways of thinking than the hypothetico-deductive form that
Piaget used to define formal operations. Though, one thing that Piaget did have right about the
shift in thinking at adolescence is that the ability to think about thinking, or metacognition, does
emerge at this time (Kuhn, 2006, 2008; Kuhn & Franklin, 2006; Moshman, 2005; Wigfield,
Byrnes, & Eccles, 2006). Though, “what needs to be abandoned is the idea that we can pinpoint
its emergence to some narrow window of months or years in late childhood or early adolescence,
or indeed any time” (Kuhn & Franklin, 2006, p. 956).
Moshman asserts that to a large degree adolescents direct their own development through the
process of focusing on their own interests. Thus in areas of interest, adolescents may develop the
ability to think quite abstractly while other areas remain in Piaget’s concrete operational stage.
Learning is also an important factor in adolescent cognition. As a result, one may expect to see
wide variation among adolescent information problem solving skills based on the amount of
interest or teaching individuals have had in information problem solving. Discussed below,
Siegler’s (2005) overlapping wave theory of learning may prove to be a more reasonable
explanation of variation in adolescent information problem solving.
2.8.4 Vygotsky:	  Socio-­‐cultural	  theories	  
Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934) was a Soviet Russian psychologist who proposed that cognitive
development of children occurred through interaction with the child’s culture. According to
Bjorklund, “Vygotsky, writing in the 1920s and 1930s, emphasized that development is guided
by adults interacting with children, with the cultural context determining largely how, where, and
when these interactions take place” (2005, p. 61).
	  

67	  

	  
One of Vygotsky’s important contributions was his description of the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), the mental area in which children learn best (Berk, 2009; J. D. Bransford et
al., 2000). He defined this as “the distance between the actual developmental level as determined
by independent problem-solving and the level of potential as determined through problem
solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers” (Vygotsky & Cole,
1978). The ZPD describes the functions of areas that are emerging and not yet fully developed.
For Vygotsky, development does not precede learning; it is learning that drives along
development. Development results from the proper integration of learning (Vygotsky & Cole,
1978). This is one area where Vygotsky clearly differs from Piaget. Vygotsky sees learning as
pulling development along, while Piaget views development as necessary for learning to occur.
Learning for Vygotsky occurs best when the practice of scaffolding is used. Bjorklund describes
scaffolding as occurring, “when experts are sensitive to abilities of a novice and respond
contingently to the novice’s responses in a learning situation, so that the novice gradually
increases his or her understanding” (2005, p. 65). Scaffolding works best in the ZPD and it
differs from the ZPD in that scaffolding describes the strategy for the actual instruction
occurring, while the ZPD describes the ability level of the child. Learning depends upon having
an interaction between the learner and an expert and thus is a social interaction. Also, as learning
is based on specific interactions occurring within a cultural setting, a child’s developmental level
will vary widely depending upon the opportunities available in the child’s past social
interactions. This is another clear difference with Piagetian theory as Piaget viewed the
development of children as universal across cultures.

	  

68	  

	  
2.8.5 Siegler:	  Information	  Processing	  and	  Overlapping	  Waves	  Theory	  
Siegler’s premise is that stage theories of development are inadequate to describe how change
actually occurs in the development of children’s thinking. In Siegler’s view, variability is the
common denominator of children’s and adult’s thinking.

Formal
Operations

Concrete	  
Operations

Pre-­‐operational

Sensorimotor

Figure 2.1. Siegler’s Piagetian State Model (Siegler, 1996, p. 85)
Siegler’s model of Piaget’s theory is shown above in Figure 2.1. As seen, in the Piagetian model,
children’s thinking works at a particular level for an extended period of time and then suddenly
shifts to a new, higher level. Neo-Piagetians, such as Robbie Case, also use “stair-case” models
and Siegler goes on to write that this model is not specific to Piaget and Neo-Piagetians but is
“omnipresent” as a model in cognitive development (Siegler, 1996). Differences between models

	  

69	  

	  
tend to focus on what skills are tested, what ages various skills are “discovered” at, and
vocabulary.
Based on microgenetic studies, Siegler proposes an alternative theory of overlapping waves
(Siegler, 1996, 2006). According to this theory, children develop successive strategies for
thinking as they mature, but these strategies are supplemented by new strategies instead of being
completely replaced. Siegler’s graphic depiction of overlapping waves theory is below in Figure
2.2 (Siegler, 1996).

As children get older the original strategies are still present and may still be used. Children may
develop a preferred strategy, but other strategies may still be used according to the particular
context.
2.8.6 Bronfenbrenner:	  The	  Ecological	  Model	  
Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model has been described as similar to Russian nesting dolls, one
layer inside another (Miller, 2002). Bronfenbrenner’s model views the child as encircled by four
different layers.
Microsystem
Mesosystem

Individual’s unique characteristics and events experienced in a
face-to-face setting
Events that are linked between two or more microsystems

Exosystem

Events between two or more settings, of which at least one or more
does not include the individual
Macrosystem
Interaction of microsystem, mesosystem, and exosytem with the
larger culture
(Daniels & Clarkson, 2010; Miller, 2002)
Table 2.11 Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Model
One important assumption of the Ecological model is that the subsystems are dynamic. The
individual is growing and changing and at the same time the systems around the child are also
changing. The combination of these interactions then impacts how an individual performs in a
setting such as school.
2.8.7 General	  shifts	  in	  cognitive	  ability	  
During the school years, there appears to be two general qualitative shifts in children’s thinking.
The first is between the ages of five and seven (Sameroff & Haith, 1996). The second occurs as
children enter into adolescence between the ages of 11-13 (Bee & Boyd, 2010; Moshman, 2005).
Consistent with these shifts, Berk (2009) suggests five periods of development including middle
	  

71	  

	  
childhood, ages 6 – 11, and adolescence, ages 11 – 18. Bee & Boyd (2010) suggest four periods
of development, which include the “School-Aged Child” and Adolescence with age periods
similar to Berk’s.
According to Kuhn (2006) there is great individual variability during and after adolescence.
Some adults never achieve levels shown by some adolescents. “Variation in positions along
developmental pathways becomes pronounced. In addition, within specific domains, the range
and depth of individually acquired expertise becomes much greater than in childhood” (p. 65).
These shifts imply that changes in information problem solving skills within these periods will
be due to factors other than development. These factors seem likely to include learning and
experience, both in a formal educational environment (i.e. school) and informal educational
environments; and individual interests and motivation.

2.9 Learning	  
Learning theories offers several ideas that are adaptable to information problem solving. First
ideas addressing the construct of expertise are described. Second are ideas from Bereiter &
Scardamalia’s Learning by Design curriculum.
2.9.1 Expertise	  
As noted above, Kuhn suggests that expertise varies widely after adolescence. Bransford,
Stevens, Schwartz, et al. (2006) offer the following insights from learning theory about expertise.
Expertise and noticing – experts notice feature of problems that are not obvious to others and
may escape the notice of novices.

	  

72	  

	  
Expertise and Knowledge organization – Experts organize their knowledge conceptually and
have readier access to it than do novices. They also appear to be able remember more, but this is
most likely due to their ability to “chunk” together larger pieces into one whole.
Expertise and Teaching – Teachers need considerable content knowledge to teach, but they if
they lack pedagogical knowledge they may struggle to get across concepts to novices. Often
experts’ knowledge has become tacit and automatic and they are unable to remember what it was
like to be a novice. Expert teachers, besides content knowledge, need to have the Pedagogical
Content Knowledge (Buschang, Chung, Delacruz, & Baker, 2012) required to teach the
information to novices.
2.9.2 Learning	  by	  Design	  
A 1998 University of Washington study cited by Bereiter & Scardamalia (2006) surveyed
graduates five and ten years after graduation. Essentially they were asked what are the most
important skills in your life today. The number one answer was the ability to define and solve
problems. The other top answers that (rating a four out of five) were:
•

Locating information needed to help make decisions or solve problems

•

Working and/or learning independently

•

Speaking effectively

•

Working effectively with modern technology, especially computers (p. 697).

Bereiter & Scardamalia call these soft skills as opposed to more job-specific and objective skills
and refer to them as clearly “knowledge age” skills. The first two skills seem to be taken almost
	  

73	  

	  
directly from a definition of information literacy and the last is a skill that is often linked to
information literacy. Bereiter & Scardamalia suggest that Learning by Design is one curriculum
that could be used to teach these skills. Learning by Design includes design problems, problem
based learning, project learning, and knowledge building. These cover a wide range of learning
from designing a car that will cover the most distance by being propelled from the air expelled
from a balloon, planning a mission to Mars, to coming up with plausible solutions to real
problems. In general students are engaged in designing solutions to real situations.
Using a curriculum with multiple possible outcomes fits with the variability noted above in
cognitive development. If students possess a wide variety of skills, abilities, and interests, it
seems logical to address those through a curriculum that has multiple possibilities both in
learning activities and in cognitive requirements of the learners. In assessing educational
standards statements that apply to information literacy, an important consideration will be do the
standards statement include the principals exemplified by this curriculum.

2.10 Problem	  solving	  and	  cognitive	  development:	  Overview	  
This section reviews key aspects of the literature related to problem solving and begins to apply
some of the principles of cognitive development to problem solving. The goal of this process will
be to apply cognitive development principles to problem solving to identify age appropriate
practices that can be used to teach problem solving around information based problems.
2.10.1 Basic	  elements	  of	  problem	  solving	  
Problem solving has been defined as having four basic elements. These are a goal, obstacles
preventing one from achieving the goal, strategies for overcoming the obstacles, and an
evaluation of the process – was the goal achieved (Bjorklund, 2005; DeLoache et al., 1998).
	  

74	  

	  
Planning is a skill that requires an individual to combine the four aspects of problem solving into
a method or strategy for achieving the goal. Reasoning is another cognitive skill involved with
problem solving. Children’s abilities to plan and to reason both improve through maturation.
Both of these cognitive abilities will be discussed in more detail below.
Mayer and Wittrock (2006, p. 287) define problem solving as a “cognitive process directed at
achieving a goal when no solution method is obvious to the problem solver”. They identify four
characteristics of problem solving arising out of this definition.
•

Problem solving is cognitive.

•

Problem solving is a process.

•

Problem solving is directed.

•

Problem solving is personal.

2.10.2 Categories	  of	  problems	  
Mayer and Wittrock identify two categories of problems. Problems can be well defined or ill
defined; they can be routine or nonroutine. Well-defined problems have the parameters clearly
stated. Ill-defined problems lack a clear goal statement and the allowable operators are not
clearly defined. They note that well-defined problems are what schools tend to give children,
while ill-defined problems tend to more closely resemble the real world. Their article discusses
several instructional strategies for improving problem solving by students. These include
strategies for teaching content such as load-reducing strategies by increasing the efficiency of
automatic aspects of cognitive processing (drill and kill), or using advanced organizers to tie new

	  

75	  

	  
material to previous experience. Meyer and Wittrock advocate teaching thinking skills that will
transfer to solving new problems.
2.10.2.1 Categories	  of	  problem	  solving	  situations	  
Deloache et al. (1998) analyzed problem solving by looking at two different categories of
problem solving situations, knowledge-lean and knowledge intensive. Knowledge-intensive
situations are domain specific. Possessing content knowledge makes a large difference in
problem solving ability, with experts having clear advantages over novices. Knowledge-lean
situations are not domain specific and thus describe circumstances that apply over a range of
possibilities. Three general knowledge-lean strategies are trial and error, means-ends analysis,
and hill-climbing. Trial and error is exactly what it sounds like; an individual keeps making trials
at solving a problem and continues through errors until the problem is solved. An individual
using a means-end analysis approach analyzes the difference between the current situation and
the desired and makes a plan for reducing or eliminating that difference. In other words, meansend analysis requires coming up with a plan for all aspects of solving a problem. Hill-climbing is
a less sophisticated problem solving method where the problem solver chooses the path that
leads most clearly toward the goal. It differs from means-end analysis in that the solver does not
need to envision the entire path at once. Hill-climbers constantly choose uphill paths to close on
their goal. They do not consider the possibility of going down and around to reach a higher
point.
2.10.2.2 Educating	  for	  problem	  solving	  
Mayer (1987) posed the question, “what type of an education does it take to develop students
who are excellent problem solvers?” He explored the possibility of teaching problems through
the use of algebra. Another proposed method is teaching toward improving students’ attitudes
	  

76	  

	  
about problem solving skills. Pfeiffer, Feinberg, & Gelber (1987) focus on having teachers work
with students in developing attitudes that accept having a high tolerance for ambiguity, complex
situations, and conflict while maintaining self-confidence and a respect for the facts. They also
suggest that teachers need to change their attitudes away from a mode of providing information
to passive students to one of coaching a skill akin to riding a bicycle or shooting a basketball. It
also seems that in addition to having teachers change their attitude towards their instructional
methods, teachers also need to adopt the attitudes towards problem solving that Pfeiffer et al.
propose.
Problem solving and thinking skills are not just an issue for K-12 education. College students
have difficulty thinking at the abstract level. Halpern (1987) reports that less than 25% of first
year college students score at the formal level of thinking on a series of Piagetian tests designed
to test skills for logical thought. Nummedal (1987) reports that less than 50% of all college
students are able to use formal reasoning and that as a result the California State University
system instituted a critical thinking skills requirement in 1983. This requirement is still in place
(Reed, 2008).
Pitt (1983) in a study combining ideas from information processing and Piagetian models,
compared the problem solving abilities of 10th graders to college juniors using a series of
chemistry problems. She found that the 10th graders had difficulty using formal operational
thinking and that they performed more poorly than the college juniors in the areas of generating
accurate hypotheses and coordinating information. Requiring the students to plan their steps
exacerbated the differences. The results supported the idea that both high school sophomores and
the college juniors used a form of formal operational thinking, but that 10th grader were not as
capable using this mode of thinking as were the college juniors.
	  
77	  

	  
2.10.3 Problem	  solving	  and	  cognitive	  development	  
When are children first capable of problem solving? How do their abilities change as they
mature? The answer seems to be “it depends.” Piaget thought problem solving did not begin until
a child was about eight-months-old (Berk, 2009; Bjorklund, 2005). Problem solving requires a
child to have both a need (goal) and a means (strategy) to achieve the goal. Although some
experiments point to children of earlier ages (2 – 6 months) being able to problem solve, this
seems to be mainly attributable to different authors’ definitions of problem solving (Bjorklund,
2005). Problem solving in some form clearly appears by the end of a baby’s first year (Berk,
2009; DeLoache et al., 1998; Poole, Miller, & Church, 2004). As children mature, the quality of
a child’s problem solving varies greatly with his or her development. Deloache, Miller,
Pierroutsakos, & Damon (1998) use the metaphor of a bricolage, a French word most closely
approximating “tinkerer” – a worker who uses whatever materials are available to build or solve
a problem – to represent a child’s problem solving. As children mature, they have more mental
resources available and greater domain knowledge, both of which they can make use of to
improve their problem solving abilities.
2.10.4 Planning	  
Planning is often seen as difficult and adults, as well as children, apparently prefer hill-climbing
strategies. They tend to avoid the complexity of means-end analysis and are reluctant to make
moves that lead temporarily away from their goal although the path may achieve a higher
outcome in the long run (DeLoache et al., 1998). Bjorklund (2005) lists five reasons why
planning is viewed as something to avoid.
•

	  

Planning requires inhibition of current desires/behavior

78	  

	  
•

Planning takes time

•

Planning is viewed as difficult, wasteful of time, and subjectively unpleasant

•

Plans are not always successful, so why do it?

•

It’s more fun without a plan.

Planning tends to be a skill that humans develop late, and, as noted above, even adults tend to
approach problems with as little planning as possible. The overriding concept here seems to be,
“as little planning as possible,” not that adults cannot plan, just that it is difficult and thus easier
paths are chosen if possible.
2.10.5 Knowledge-­‐intensive	  problem	  solving	  
Knowledge-intensive problem solving relates to domain specific areas in which individuals have
developed expertise. Experts are clearly better problem solvers than novices. Research in this
area has compared the ability to recall the layout of chess pieces by child chess experts to
graduate students who are novices. The children consistently beat the adults. When the task is
changed to recalling numbers sequentially, the graduate students win (Bjorklund, 2005;
DeLoache et al., 1998).
2.10.6 Reasoning	  
Reasoning is another area of problem solving that changes as children develop cognitive ability.
If planning is the problem solving skill that leads to the creation of a strategy to achieve a goal
and overcome obstacles, reasoning is the problem solving skill that applies logic to the plan.
There are several different types of reasoning that psychology has identified – analogical
reasoning, formal reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Analogical reasoning is reasoning by
	  

79	  

	  
analogy, how does something you already know apply to a new situation? Formal reasoning is
reasoning in which the form of the argument is important and is often decontextualized. The
relationship to the real world is not necessarily important. Syllogisms and propositional logic are
examples of formal reasoning. Scientific reasoning involves creating hypotheses about
something in the real world and then systematically proving or disproving each hypothesis.
Scientific reasoning is logic in context.
2.10.7 Reasoning	  and	  cognitive	  development	  
How do various types of reasoning change as children mature? How are these changes in
reasoning viewed by the theories of Piaget, Vygotsky, Siegler, and Bronfenbrenner? First,
examining the ideas of Piaget, he thought that analogical, formal, and scientific reasoning did not
first appear until adolescence (Bjorklund, 2005; Inhelder & Piaget, 1958). As noted above, there
seems to be general agreement that Piaget was correct that some forms of reasoning begin to
emerge in adolescence. Analogical reasoning, however, has advocates for a much earlier
appearance, with some arguing that it is present at birth (Bjorklund, 2005). One experiment that
indicated analogical reasoning appears much earlier than Piaget theorized involved one-year-old
infants solving a toy retrieval problem (either on their own or with parental coaching). Once they
solved the first problem the infants were able to solve similar second and third problems with
greater efficiency. This experiment indicated that infants can learn through the process of
analogical reasoning (Berk, 2009; Bjorklund, 2005; Flavell et al., 2002). Preschoolers also are
able to reason analogically when using information from stories. One explanation for these
findings differing from Piaget’s is the level of knowledge required to answer and explain the
analogies. When children are asked things that are appropriate to their individual knowledge

	  

80	  

	  
level, they can, as early as 24 months, provide answers requiring analogical reasoning
(DeLoache et al., 1998; Gholson, Morgan, Dattel, & Pierce, 1990).
Piaget’s theory of development is a stage theory in which all children go through similar stages
in the same order. Vygotsky, however, did not address normative development (Garton, 2004).
Development is based on a child’s interaction with other more advanced individuals in a social
setting. For Vygotsky a child’s ability to solve problems will be based on a combination of
environmental, biological, and social issues that are unique to the individual and it becomes
difficult or impossible to make general claims about the problem solving abilities of fifth
graders, 10th graders, or college juniors.
In analyzing the abilities of children to problem solve, DeLoache et al.’s metaphor of the
bricolage appears appropriate. Children (as well as adults) use the cognitive abilities available at
any given time. Not everyone thinks at all levels at all times, and some adults never achieve
formal operational thinking (Bjorklund, 2005; Kuhn, 2006; Kuhn & Franklin, 2006; Moshman,
2005). Individuals tend to use what is available and what is easiest. This concept of using what is
available seems consistent both with Siegler’s overlapping waves strategy and Bronfenbrenner’s
ecological approach. Individuals have multiple strategies available and use what seems to them
to be appropriate at for the particular instance (Siegler, 1996). Varying strategies likely arise out
of the varying experiences and environments as indicated by Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Model
(Berk, 2009; Daniels & Clarkson, 2010).

2.11 Information	  problem	  solving	  &	  cognitive	  development	  
2.11.1 Information	  problem	  solving	  models	  
There are a number of different models of information problem solving. Eisenberg (2008)
compared Kuhlthau’s Information Search Process, Eisenberg and Berkowitz Information
Problem Solving (The Big6 Skills), the AASL 2009 Information Literacy standards, the ACRL
Information Literacy Competency Standards, and Stripling and Pitts Research Process. Eisenberg
concluded the different models are more similar than different.
If the models are compared to the commonly accepted definition of information literacy from the
American Library Association’s Presidential Committee on Information Literacy Final Report
(1989), it is clear they are all variations of the abilities of locating, evaluating, and using
effectively needed information.
Kuhlthau’s ISP (2004) is the only model that is research based. It is a descriptive model,
describing the process of research based on studying students engaged in a research project. One
aim of her research is to improve the knowledge of Teacher/Librarians concerning the process
the students they are working are going through. One of Kuhlthau’s important points for
Teacher/Librarians is the Zone of Intervention, which she has modeled on Vygotsky’s Zone of
Proximal Development. This is the point in the research process where students realize they need
help and are willing to take advice from an expert.
The other models are not research based, but rather based on experience and reflection. These
models are prescriptive in addition to being descriptive. The Big6 not only explains how the
research process works, it is a model of how it should work. The same is true of Stripling and
Pitts Research Process model.
	  

82	  

	  
2.11.2 Writings	  on	  information	  science	  and	  cognitive	  development	  
A number of authors in the field of information science have recognized there is a need for
information science research and ISP methods to be developmentally appropriate. Large, Nesset,
& Beheshti claim that developmental theories are important for studying the information-seeking
behavior or children for two reasons.
Firstly, they strongly suggest that it would be rash to apply findings gathered from adults’
information-seeking behavior to their younger counterparts. Secondly, it also argues for the need
to consider differently children at different ages and development levels. Therefore caution must
always be applied when extrapolating research findings gathered from one age group to another.
(2008, pp. 123-124)
Kuhlthau has been a leader in this movement. In 1981 she wrote a grade-by-grade curriculum
guidebook for Teacher/Librarians applying the concepts of Piaget’s stage theory to the teaching
of a library skills program (1981). She has continued to be a strong advocate for teachers of
information literacy skills to be well versed in Piagetian development (1987; 1988; Kuhlthau et
al., 2007).
McGuire (1998) is a librarian who worked with the staff of her elementary school to determine
developmental levels for teaching library skills to students. Her writing does not refer to any
theories or theorists. Working with the different grade levels of the school’s staff to develop a
curriculum was the methods used for creating a consensus to determine appropriate grade levels
for different skills.
Other writers in the field have also called for attention to developmentally appropriate practices.
Eastin (2008) suggests the need for applying cognitive development ideas to teaching credibility.
	  

83	  

	  
Gelderblom & Kotze (2008, 2009), Bilal (2007), Cooper (2005), and Baumgarten (2003) all urge
designers of children’s software to be cognizant of cognitive development. However, along with
Kuhlthau, they all rely almost exclusively on Piaget (with a smattering of Vygotsky thrown in)
and have not taken into account any updated theories in the area of adolescent cognitive
development. Gelderblom & Kotze do use an eclectic approach adding in Fischer and Case along
with their Piaget and Vygotsky. Only Large, Nesset, and Behesti (2008) point out weaknesses in
Piaget’s theory – the too rigid stages and that children with instruction can do things earlier than
predicted by his theory.
Kuhn (2006) points out that current scholarly thought has changed on its view of the
development of adolescent cognition and that developmental textbooks have been slow to
respond to this. This may be a reason why studies in Information Science often fail to go beyond
reliance on Piaget and/or Vygotsky for theories of cognitive development.
Echoing and supporting the call for using cognitive development theory in education, Jackson
(2007, 2008a), Orme (2008), and Gatten (2004) have all written of its importance in higher
education. These writers dealing with higher education rely on the developmental theories of
William Perry (1968).
Yan & Fischer (2004) reported on how children and adults learn to use computers and refer to
both Vygotsky and Piaget. They use Vygotsky to emphasize the socio-cultural approach while
using Piaget for his emphasis on the constructivist process of education rather than his
developmental theories. One interesting point they make is:
For example, a myth about learning to use computers has been popular for years: that it is easy
for children to learn to use computers but difficult for old people to learn. However, there have
	  

84	  

	  
been only anecdotes from daily life and not empirical evidence from scientific research to
support this myth. Very little is known about developmental differences between children
(especially young ones) and adults (especially older ones) in learning to use computers (2004).
Yan (2006) also studied children’s understanding of the Internet and found that while students in
grades 5 and 6 have an adult level of understanding of the technical aspects of the Internet; it is
not until grades 7 and 8 they have an adult understanding of the social aspects of the Internet.
Yan’s study of children’s understanding of the Internet found age differences. This suggests that
one might also find age differences in studying what children information literacy skills children
of different ages have.
2.11.3 Cognitive	  development	  related	  research	  in	  information	  problem	  solving	  
A review of 65 papers (listed in Appendix 3) in information science addressing cognitive
development and information problem solving reveal the following. The research studies tend to
be qualitative studies involving small groups or just one classroom of students. The few
quantitative studies tend emphasize a measurement technique invented by the author such as the
Internet Savviness Index (Geyer, 2008) or Web Traversal Measure (Bilal, 2000) that have not
been widely adopted by others. The most commonly studied age group is that of the middle
school years, ages 11-14 (see Figure 2.3). Using the Big6 as a model to categorize studies shows
that most studies involve steps 2 through 4 (see Figure 2.4). Researchers tend to study
information searching behavior or more precisely, web searching behavior. These tend to
correlate to Big6 # 2 Information seeking strategies; #3 Location and Access, and #4 Use of
information – engage and extract relevant information for a particular researcher imposed task.

The following three points stand out.

	  

86	  

	  
2.11.3.1 Importance	  of	  domain	  knowledge	  
Domain knowledge is important whether it about the subject being searched for or if it expertise
in searching the web. Burnett & Wilkinson studied sixth graders home use of the Internet and
found that there were able to solve many problems that stymied them in school. Students’ lack of
restrictions at home and the use of their prior knowledge allowed them to adopt a problemsolving attitude to finding information on the web.
Chung & Newman found that students put little cognitive effort into searching and the school
librarian in their study said, “I don’t think even the honors kids sit down and really think through
a topic before they start doing research . . . I think they form their research after they read what
its about” (2007, p. 1514). This suggests searching among high school students may be linked to
domain knowledge. High school students are rarely experts or even very knowledgeable in a
specific domain, thus making it difficult for them to begin a search. It seems logical that this
leads them to begin a search and then backfill with knowledge gained from searching.
Madden, Ford, Miller, & Levy found in a small (N=15) “think aloud” study that an
understanding of the subject area in addition to the amount of experience a child had in using the
internet affected their searching ability.
2.11.3.2 Learning	  vs.	  development	  is	  not	  clearly	  addressed	  
As noted above, it is often difficult to tell the difference between learning and developmental
factors. Few studies compare two different age groups. Thus it is difficult to tell whether age and
or development is a factor in the findings. In one study that did compare different age groups,
Bilal & Kirby (2002) found that graduate students were more likely to find correct answers than
were seventh graders and that the graduate students were more focused in their searching.
	  

87	  

	  
However, the authors of this paper saw more similarities between the two groups than
differences. Rouet & Coutelet compared 9- and 13-year-olds’ ability to use document search
strategies. Older students were significantly faster and more apt to use text organizers. However,
it is not possible to tell whether this is a factor of development or learning. Some 13-year-old
students in this study still used basic strategies such as flipping through the pages and not
consistently using text organizers. This seems consistent with Siegler’s overlapping wave theory.
In a study looking at supporting reflective web searching in elementary classrooms, de Vries, van
der Meij and Lazonder’s (2008) intervention failed to generate significant improvement and
concluded that the students needed more support than their intervention had provided. They did
not address the question of whether or not developmental factors might have been a cause.
Pritchard & Cartwright (2004) studied 54 children in grade 6 to determine how information use
and location on the Internet can be improved. Products of the project were less than what was
expected. The authors presented no clear picture of what children can really do. They reported
that the children were engaged to different levels, but did address maturational level (i.e.
development). Nahl and Harada (1996) looked at high school students who were novice
searchers and their use of Boolean logic. The researchers provided a short booklet of instructions
on Boolean logic, search term selection and search statement composition. Two other groups had
other forms of intervention. The instructions on Boolean logic made no significant difference.
The authors suggested two possible explanations. The tasks may not have been hard enough or
since the students who received the instructional booklets on skimmed through them in less than
five minutes, perhaps they did not gain any benefit from this level of instruction. Once again
developmental level was not addressed as a possible factor, although it appears motivation may
have been important.
	  

88	  

	  
2.11.3.3 Motivation	  is	  an	  important	  factor	  
The literature on problem solving indicates that “hill-climbing” is often the preferred mode of
problem solving because it is easier than planning (DeLoache et al., 1998). Browsing may be
seen as a form of hill-climbing in that searchers simply keep going until they find what they
what. The finding that browsing is preferred to a planned search then is consistent with other
types of problem solving. Browsing is preferred to planning a search (Bilal & Kirby, 2002;
Chung & Neuman, 2007; Schacter et al., 1998). Students appear to often want to do the least
amount of work possible. Burnett & Wilkinson students found that students did not read
instructions, “It’s a load of words . . . can’t be bothered to read the words” (page 162). Shenton
& Dixon (2004) in a survey of 188 English school children ranging in age from 4 to 18, found
that students frequently consulted only the minimum number of sources to meet school
requirements, while for personal research typically only looked at one source for information.
This lack of effort in planning is consistent with what has been reported in the problem solving
literature (DeLoache et al., 1998).
2.11.4 Cognitive	  development	  and	  learning	  -­‐	  Implications	  for	  information	  problem	  solving	  	  
First, teachers of information problem solving in K-12 education must consider three groups of
children (those under the age of six or seven; those who are above the age of 11-13, and those in
between these two groups). These three broad splits will likely have cognitive abilities that are
different from each other. (Always remembering that these are group tendencies and that there
are likely to be individuals both above and below their age group peers.) Within each of these
groups it may be that how children learn to solve problems is just as important if not more
important than development.

	  

89	  

	  
Second, expertise and motivation matter in children’s performance. Students who have greater
expertise and experience are more capable. Learning theory argues that experts behave
differently than novices. One way of using this in teaching IPS is to apply Vygotsky’s Zone of
Proximal Development. The ZPD is the most important aspect of Vygotsky’s cognitive
development principles for IPS. Children should be expected to solve information problems
based on whatever level of development they are currently at and receive instruction that pushes
them to a slightly higher level of ability. This argues for continual assessment of a child’s IPS
abilities and an instructor’s thorough knowledge of IPS strategies in order to match a task to a
child’s ability level. A child’s ability to think of sources of information will be based on past
experience and instruction in thinking of sources. If a student has only ever been asked to use a
textbook or an encyclopedia for a source that is all that should be expected. If a child has been in
a class where brainstorming all the possible different sources of information has been modeled,
then that student can be expected to use a wide array of sources of information. A child’s
individual experience with his or her social, cultural, and biological environment will determine
the quantitative and qualitative differences in their IPS abilities.
Third, one should expect children to engage in a variety of information problem solving
strategies. This suggests teaching a variety of methods to children and allowing them to adopt
those that fits their individual needs.
2.11.5 Information	  problem	  solving	  &	  cognitive	  development	  conclusion	  
There are a wide range of competing theories describing cognitive development and a sea of
literature discussing problem solving, but Weir pointed out over 40 years ago that little of the
literature on problem solving looks at developmental differences (1964). That seems to still be
the case today in studies of IPS; perhaps because the competing theories in cognitive
	  

90	  

	  
development make it impossible to clearly state the way in which IPS is affected by changes in
cognition as children mature. However, as noted above, it is possible to apply some of the ideas
of cognitive development and learning theory to IPS.

2.12 Summary	  of	  relevant	  literature	  
This section reviewed relevant literature from the areas information literacy, educational
standards, cognitive development, and problem solving. Additionally areas of intersection were
examined.
Information literacy was defined as the ability to recognize an information need and to locate,
use, and evaluate the appropriate information (Presidential Committee on Information Literacy,
1989). Educational standards were defined, the method of writing standards was discussed, and
a variety of problems with standards were identified. These include ambiguous terminology, the
sheer number of standards exceeding the amount of instructional time available, and the different
levels of issuing organizations from national content organizations to local school districts.
Information literacy also has educational standards, however no study of these standards has
been done so it is unknown if they suffer from the same issues, but there is no reason to think
information literacy standards are the exception.
The theories of Piaget, Vygotsky, Siegler, and Bronfenbrenner in cognitive development were
reviewed. None of these theories is seen as complete and they do have some complementary
aspects. Researchers in information literacy have relied heavily on Piaget and neglected to
include some of the more recent criticisms of his theory. Kuhn (2008) and Moshman (2005) have
especially pointed to changes in views of adolescent development that no longer in agreement
with Piaget’s description of formal operations.
	  

91	  

	  
This research project proposes to use theories of cognitive development as one lens to examine
information literacy standards statements. In a spiral curriculum standards statements should
increase in difficulty as the grade levels increase, yet the tasks described by the standards
statements should be within the capability of students to achieve. Questions arising from the
cognitive development literature include the following.
•

Do educational standard statement take into account the qualitative shifts that happen in
children’s thinking at ages 5 -7 and in early adolescence (ages 10-12)?

•

Do educational standard statements allow for multiple strategies for problem solving
consistent with Siegler’s model of the overlapping wave theory or Bronfenbrenner’s
ecological model?

•

Do educational standard statements adapt Vygotsky’s ZPD, allowing for differences in
problem solving ability with assistance from an experience peer or an adult as compared
to problem solving ability when a student is working individually?

Problem solving has been studied in cognitive psychology and a variety of factors have been
identified as important including planning, domain knowledge, reasoning, experience and
learning. However, little work has been done in identifying developmental differences in
problem solving abilities between adults and children.
Studying problem solving in information science has involved children of different ages but
there has been no systematic study to identify developmental differences or a developmental
progression of skills that individuals go through. Studies also fail to differentiate between

	  

92	  

	  
development and learning. It is clear that domain knowledge and motivation play important roles
in children’s ability to solve information problems.
The findings from studies on information problem solving have implications for educational
standards statements that deal with information problem solving. Do expectations for planning,
amount of domain knowledge, and level of reasoning increase as grade levels increase?
Information literacy is an important skill for individuals and as such there are educational
standard statements that reflect information literacy skills. Standard statements should be
developmentally appropriate, reflecting what is known from the field of cognitive development.
Educational standard statements are known to have a variety of problems and as no study had
addressed information literacy standard statements it is unknown if these same problems are
applicable to information literacy standard statements.

3. Methodology	  
3.1 Introduction	  
This research examined aspects of school children’s developmental levels of information
problem solving as reflected by teachers’ perceptions of information literacy standards. Research
was conducted using a mixed methods approach. The use of mixed methods leads to a richer
understanding of the research questions (Creswell, 2009; Fidel, 2008; Krathwohl, 1998).
Information literacy standards were chosen for examination because as education standards they
represent what the educational establishment believes should be taught and at what grade level
this material should be taught. Standards give insight into what the educational establishment
believes is the developmentally appropriate sequence of instruction in information problem
solving. However, as noted in the previous chapter, research on standards in other subject areas
indicates many shortcomings with these standards. The goal of this research project is to address
information literacy standard statements using the lens of expert practitioners to: 1) either
provide support for validating the standards or identify shortcomings, and 2) to identify to what
extent teachers believe the standard statements are grade level appropriate and the importance of
the standard statements to be taught.
The purpose of this dissertation is to contribute towards a better understanding of the differing
capabilities of children of different age to solve information problems. Findings will help to
identify standard statements and curriculum that are both developmentally appropriate and
viewed by practitioners as important. The end goal is to make a contribution toward a coherent,
comprehensive framework describing developmentally appropriate information literacy
standards for youth of different ages. Three main questions are explored:
	  

94	  

	  
RQ 1) What developmental differences in information problem solving abilities are reflected in
educational standard statements as they relate to youth at different ages?
This question explores to what extent educational standard statements dealing with information
literacy increase in complexity as grade level increases and to what extent the standard
statements are conceptually consistent across grade levels. To what extent do standard statements
deal with the same concept and to what extent do they ask students to deal with this concept in
an increasingly complex manner?
RQ 2) What developmental differences in information problem solving abilities do expert
practitioners identify as they relate to youth at different ages?
RQ 2 seeks to explore how expert practitioners view the abilities of children of different ages to
solve information problems. To what extent do expert practitioners view the standards statements
as applying to the same grade level as the issuing organizations intended? When asked to
describe what children should be able to do, how do expert practitioners respond?
RQ 3) How do information problem solving abilities, at different developmental levels, as
reflected in educational standards match those identified by expert practitioners? What areas are
aligned and where are the gaps?
The last question is aimed at unifying the first two phases of the research project. How do the
information literacy standard statements match up with the views of expert practitioners? The
standard statements are guidelines for what is intended by the educational establishment to be
taught in classrooms. The intended curriculum and what is taught should logically be the same.
This research question aims at identifying to what extent the intended curriculum matches what
	  

95	  

	  
expert practitioners view as important and appropriate for teaching. The goal is to identify the
areas of alignment and what gaps exist, if any.
The mixed method approach chosen is a modified Sequential Explanatory Design (Creswell,
2009). In this model quantitative and qualitative methods are used sequentially. Quantitative data
is collected first and analyzed followed by qualitative data collection and analysis. The
qualitative data collection is meant to inform and explain the data collected in the quantitative
portion of the research. Interpretation is both ongoing during the entire research project and after
the collection of all data in both phases (Creswell, 2009). The modifid Sequential Explanatory
Design as proposed for this research project is in Figure 3.1. The research project modified this
design by collecting qualitative data prior to the quantitative phase and continuously through out
all phases of the research project.

Figure 3.1 Sequential Explanatory Design (Creswell, 2009, p. 209)
The research project included three separate phases. First, a team of experts was used to sort all
the standard statements at grade levels 2, 5, and 8 from the CCSS and AASL into Big6 stages.
Standard statements that were found to match with Big6 stages 2, 3, and 4 were then used to
create a survey that was sent to National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) in the state of
Washington. The survey was initially sent out to 3774 Washington NBCTs in the certificate
areas listed in table 3.5. Later the survey was sent to all NBCTs in the state of Washington. A
total of 291 responses were received of which 96 were completed. The survey sought to
determine if educational standards statements concerning information literacy are aligned with
the views of expert, experienced teachers. Expert, experienced teachers were asked to assess
standards at the grade level at which each participant teaches both for importance in being taught
	  
97	  

	  
and grade level appropriateness. Expert, experienced teachers were operationally defined as
those teachers who have earned National Board certification. The third phase used focus groups
of NBCTs who indicated their willingness to take part in the focus groups as a part of the survey.
These groups discussed feedback from the survey evaluating information literacy standards, the
content analysis of information literacy standards statements, and provided teachers’ insights into
what information problem solving skills are typical of students at different grade levels.
This chapter discusses design rationale and assumptions, the research design, the participants and
their selection, the piloting of the research instrument, data collection methods, data analysis and
threats to the quality of research.

3.2 Design	  Rationale	  and	  Assumptions	  
This research project consisted of three phases, a content analysis of existing standards, a nonexperimental quantitative survey, and a series of four focus groups informed both by the content
analysis and the survey results. The goal of the content analysis was to map standards statements
from the AASL and CCSS to the stages of the Big6 information problem solving process and to
identify issues in the these standards statements related to clarity of writing and number of
concepts involved in each standard. The survey methodology was chosen to gather a large
amount of data relatively quickly and allow statistical analysis of the data. The focus group
methodology was chosen as a follow-up because it has similarities to the actual way educational
standards are created, but allows the researcher to have insight into the level of consensus
achieved by the group. This method, the use of a survey followed up by a focus group of expert
educators to provide feedback on the results, was used by Easley II (2011) and recommended by
Gullikson (2006).

	  

98	  

	  
The tripartite research methodology is used to provide greater understanding of any
discrepancies that may emerge in the survey phase and to provide greater credibility to the
results of the research (Creswell, 2009; McGrath, 1994; Patton, 2002). Each of the various
methods has different strengths and shortcomings as shown in table 3.1. Combining these
methods helps to overcome their individual shortcomings.

Table 3.1 Methodological Strengths and Weaknesses.
An assumption common to both the survey and the focus groups is that expert, experienced
teachers are a group worth studying when it comes to educational standards and information
literacy. Both the second and third phases drew on the knowledge of teachers who have teaching

	  

99	  

	  
experience with children on a daily basis. The sampling for the focus groups in phase three
purposefully sampled expert, experienced teachers, NBCTs.
Other researchers, in information science and other fields have made similar assumptions that
teachers’ perceptions of issues relating to education are valuable (Chall et al., 1996; Easley II,
2011; Florian, 1999; Gallant, 2009; Hebbeler & Taylor, 2012; Kloeppel, Hodges-Kulinna, &
Cothran, 2012; Maccini & Gagnon, 2002; Probert, 2009). Specifically, Probert (2009) found that
teachers generally have a good knowledge of what information literacy entails, and Chall et al.
found that experienced teachers are able to successfully judge the difficulty levels of texts when
studying reading development (1996). Other authors have used teachers to analyze the
importance and developmental appropriateness of standards (Easley II, 2011; Florian, 1999;
Gallant, 2009; Hebbeler & Taylor, 2012). Kloeppel, Hodges-Kulinna, & Cothran (2012) used
teachers to evaluate a physical education curriculum based on teacher implementation of
standards versus pre-packaged curriculum in which the lessons for the entire course were
provided to the teachers. Hebbeler & Taylor (2012) evaluated standards for early childhood
education in the state of Connecticut by using experienced kindergarten and early childhood
educators to rate the standards for grade-level appropriateness and content difficulty level. This
study found that the Connecticut standards were to a very large degree grade-level appropriate.
National Board Certified Teachers are both expert educational practitioners and have years of
first hand experience in the day-to-day life of school classrooms. These teachers are the
individuals who are actually delivering instruction to students on a daily basis. This combination
of expertise, experience, and daily immersion in the practice of education make this group’s
views on educational standards compelling.

3.3 Research	  Design	  
This section provides an overview of the design of the survey, the content analysis of
information literacy standards, and the focus groups. It includes a discussion of the participants
and their selection, the plan to pilot the survey collection and the method of data collection.
3.3.1 Design	  Overview	  
Phase One, part A was a content analysis of standards statements from the AASL and the CCSS
at grades 2, 5, and 8. This purpose of this phase was to sort the standard statements into the
stages on information problem-solving model. As previously noted, the Big6 model was chosen
for this process.
The standard statements that were determined to reflect specific stages of the Big6 information
problem solving model (see Table 3.2) were included in this research process for further
analysis. If Big6 stages 2, 3, or 4 were addressed, the following questions were applied to each
standard statement. If not, then the standard statement was not addressed by this research.

Specific sub-questions to RQ 1 that were addressed in the content analysis phase B:
To what degree do standards statements deal with a single concept?
To what extent does clarity of writing impact interpretation of standards statements?
These questions probe deeper into RQ 1, “What developmental differences in information
problem solving abilities are reflected in educational standard statements as they relate to youth
at different ages?” To deal with development differences, it must first be ascertained if the
standards statements refer to a single concept or multiple concepts. If the questions are referring
to the same concept, developmental differences should lead to an increasing level of complexity
or rigor as grade levels increase. Determining the number of concepts involved in each standard
statement was operationalized by counting the number of tasks in each standard statement. Two
coders reviewed each standard statement and determined the number of tasks in the standard
statement.
Both clarity and specificity are interrelated concepts and important aspects of well-written
standards (Kendall, 2001). Two methods were used to determine the clarity of writing in the
standard statements. First, the coders were asked to rate each standards statement on a three point
	  

102	  

	  
scale for clarity (see Table 4.8). Second, the New Dale-Chall Readability Formula (Chall &
Dale, 1995) was selected to determine the readability level of each standard statement. Using the
New Dale-Chall Readability Formula has the advantage of being a pre-existing and recognized
readability standard. Standard statements with a lower level of readability are clearer and easier
to understand than those with a higher level. Standard statements were tested both individually
and in groups based on both Big6 stages and categories used by the originators of the standard
statements.
In phase Two a survey of teachers was used to collect quantitative data. The survey collected
data to address RQ 1 and RQ 2. These questions ask what developmental differences in
information problem solving abilities are reflected in educational standard statements and what
developmental differences in information problem solving abilities expert practitioners identify.
Sub questions address to what extent expert practitioners can discern the developmental
differences in information problem solving standard statements, to what extent they agree with
the educational appropriateness, and to what extent do they view the importance of the standard
statements. The survey asked teachers first to assess the appropriate grade level of standard
statements, and second to complete a rating scale ranking standards statements according to the
perceived level of students’ ability to accomplish each item and the standards statement’s
importance as part of the curriculum. An additional section of the survey asked for demographic
data.
In phase Three, a qualitative method, focus groups of teachers, was used to address RQ 2, using
the results of the content analysis and the survey to generate discussion questions for the focus
groups. Kuhlthau (1993) used a similar method (using both focus groups and a survey) in a case
study examining the implementation of a process approach for a library skills curriculum. Easley
	  
103	  

	  
II (2011) also combined a survey with focus groups in his study of the high school students’
views of educational standards.
Data analysis was ongoing during the entire research project. Data collected during both the
survey and the content analysis was used to form the questions for the focus groups. Focus
groups responses were used to provide clarification of the data collected in phases one and two.

research questions, actions, and the rationale.

3.3.2 Delimitations	  
This research project was delimited to studying information problem solving model as
represented by the Big6 model. This dissertation used the Eisenberg-Berkowitz model of
information problem solving, the Big65, as a model to serve as a framework for discussing
information problem solving. There were several reasons for this decision. The first reason, as
noted in Chapter One, both Wolf et al. (2003) and Brand-Gruwel et al. (2009) found the Big6 to
be one of three prominent information problem solving models. Wolf et al. point out two aspects
of the Big6 that make it especially suitable for this research. First, the Big6 is a model
specifically aimed at kindergarten through grade 12. This was an important consideration as the
standard statements examined in this research fit into these grade levels. And second, the Big6
proposes to work through the cooperation of the classroom teacher and the school
teacher/librarian. This research examined two sets of educational standard statements, one that is
aimed primarily at classroom teachers (CCSS) and one set aimed at teacher/librarians (AASL),
but both sets of standards aim to inform the practice of both classroom teachers and
teacher/librarians. Using the Big6 as an information problem solving model helps to connect the
classroom teacher and the teacher/librarian aspects of the information problem solving standard
statements. The second reason for using the Big6 is that it is widely used in the K-12 educational
system in the United States, and K-12 educational standards are a major focus of this
dissertation. Eisenberg claims that the Big6 is “the most widely-known and widely-used
approach to teaching information and technology skills in the world” and is used in thousands of
schools (Eisenberg, 2007), though there is only anecdotal evidence and no formal studies
supporting this claim (Wolf et al., 2003). A third reason was that while none of the three
information problem solving models, Kuhlthau, Eisenberg Berkowitz, or Stripling Pitts has a

See Table 3.2 for an overview of the Big6 model of information problem solving.
	  
106	  

	  
research based adaptation to differing developmental stages, Eisenberg and Berkowitz’s Big6 has
a simplified model called the Super 3 aimed at primary level students. This indicates that the
Big6 recognizes the need for differentiation in instructional practices at different grade levels.
Fourth, and finally, Murray (2008a, 2008b, 2010, 2011) has done extensive work aligning
various standards to the Big6 model while neither the Kuhlthau nor the Stripling Pitts models
have been aligned to the standards.
The research project used only Big6 stages 2, 3, and 4 as a further delimitation. The Big6 stages
are described in Table 3.2. These steps were chosen because the researcher believed that teachers
see these as the core of the information problem solving process in the classroom. Researchoriented assignments given by teachers in elementary and secondary schools most often are welldefined problems as opposed to ill-defined problems that require students to do the majority of
task definition and evaluation (Mayer & Wittrock, 2006). For example, in the state of
Washington students are required to do a Senior Project and in Social Studies classes, a
classroom based assessment (CBA) research project. In both these students are given parameters
of a task and may have to translate that into their own concepts, but the Big6 stage of task
definition stage is clearly described for the student. Big6 stages 5 and 6, Synthesis and
Evaluation, are important parts of information problem solving, but with well-defined problems,
students tend to see the evaluation portion as something the teacher does when assigning a grade.
Additionally as noted in chapter two, the review of research studies in information problem
solving indicates that the majority of research in this area deals with Big6 stages 2, 3, and 4.
A second delimitation was the grade levels studied. This research project was delimited to grades
2, 5, and 8. These are the grades the AASL uses for the benchmarks of its standard statements.
Also, McClure (2005) argues that standards have had more of an impact in elementary and
	  
107	  

	  
middle school than in high school, a second reason for delimiting this research to grades 2, 5, and
8. The difference of three grade levels was thought to be wide enough so that expert experienced
teachers would be able to discern differnces between educational standard statements written for
these grade levels.
A third delimitation was restricting the standards statements to be studied to the AASL and the
CCSS. The AASL statements are representative of both the standards statements from a national
organization and those that address the technical side of information literacy standards. The
AASL standards are the most detailed and extensive information literacy standards for K-12
students. The CCSS are in the process of replacing the state content standards for over forty
states and thus represent the content standards side of information literacy standards statements.

3.4 Phase	  1	  Content	  Analysis	  of	  Standards	  
Phase One was to analyze the standards documents that are connected to information literacy for
their content. Does the standard statement reflect the Big6 information problem solving process
Stages 2, 3, or 4? If yes, then the following questions were applied and codes assigned to each
standard statement. If no, then the standard statement were not addressed by this research.
Specific questions addressed in the second phase of the content analysis:
To what extent are the developmental differences in information problem solving abilities
reflected in educational standard statement as they relate to youth at different ages consistent
with the judgments of expert, experienced teachers?
To what degree do standards statements deal with a single task?
To what extent does clarity of writing impact interpretation of standard statements?
	  

108	  

	  
3.4.1 Mapping	  Standards	  to	  the	  Big6	  Information	  Problem	  Solving	  Model	  
The AASL and CCSS standard statements were analyzed as part of an exploratory content
analysis. The method used was a content analysis to examine how standard statements from the
AASL and CCSS could be categorized into the Big6 information literacy process model by a
team of coders with expertise in the conceptual and pedagogical aspects of information literacy.
This sorting method was chosen in order to have multiple individuals with expertise in
information literacy reviewing the standards statements and assigning the standards statements to
Big6 stages. It combined both a straightforward system with increased assurance that the
standards statements assigned to a particular Big6 stage belonged to that stage rather than if one
or two individuals had assigned the standards statements to Big6 stages.
The researcher identified and recruited six individuals to serve as coders (see Table 1). Coders
one through five all have expertise in information literacy and were used in both the sorting of
standards into the stages of the Big6 model and the content analysis. Coder six took part solely
in the second phase of the content analysis – counting the tasks and rating the clarity of the
standard statements. Initial contact and all communications were by email.

This study uses the term “standard statement” to describe a discrete statement of what a student
should be able to do or know. The AASL has four broad standards with benchmarks established
for each standard at various grade levels. The CCSS are made up of strands, anchor standards,
and grade-specific standards. This research focuses on the grade-specific standards and refers to
these as standard statements. The AASL term “benchmark” and the CCSS phrase “grade-specific
standard” are treated as equivalent to “standard statements.” The AASL standards are
benchmarked at grades 2, 5, and 8. The CCSS standards statements were chosen from grades 2,
5, and 8 in order to align with the AASL standard statements.
Coders were asked to review all the CCSS standard statements (377) in English/Language Arts
and Mathematics for grades 2, 5, and 8, and all the standard statements (313) at grades 2, 5, and
8 for all four of the AASL standards. These 690 standard statements were matched to stages of
the Big6 information problem solving process.
Survey instruments were created using IT Connect Catalyst tools from the University of
Washington for each content sub-area of the CCSS and each standard for the AASL. Examples
of these areas from English Language Arts & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and
Technical Subjects include: Reading Standards for Literature K-5, Reading Standards for
Informational Text K-5, Writing Standards, Speaking and Listening Standards K-5, and
Language Standards 6-12. Examples from Mathematics include: Operations and Algebraic
Thinking, Numbers and Operations in Base 10, and Geometry. A total of 20 separate surveys
were created, 15 for the CCSS, four for AASL, and a final survey to deal with errors and
omissions from the first 19.

3.4.2 Data	  Collection	  
The coders independently reviewed the 690 AASL and CCSS standards statements grouped into
20 surveys. Analysts sorted each of the standards statements into a stage or sub-stage of the Big6
information literacy process (see Figure 3.1 for example); analysts were given the choice to
identify the standards statement as “not related” to the Big6. Moreover, analysts were able to
evaluate standard statements as “Unable to tell” for statements that were ambiguous or poorlyworded and not clearly aligned with any stage or sub-stage.
	  

	  
Figure 3.2 English/Language Arts Informational Text to Big6 Stage Rating Chart.
After all 20 surveys from each of the five content analysts were submitted to the researcher, a
60% level of consensus was used to determine where each item fit into the Big6 stages. This
meant that three of the five coders agreed that the individual standard statement fit into a
particular Big6 stage. The researcher then tabulated the results (see Figure 3.2). In Row 1, the
standard statement was categorized as Big6 Stage 4, Use of Information, while in Row 2, the
standard statement was categorized as Big6 Stage 3, Location and Access.
	  

111	  

	  
Using a 60% level of coder consensus, 81% of the 377 CCSS and 85% of the AASL standards
statements were able to be categorized into either a Big6 stage or into the Not Able to Tell/Not
Big6 category. This compared to only 41% of the CCSS and 63% of the AASL standard
statements being categorized when using a consensus level of 80%. The 60% level of consensus
was chosen in order to maximize the number of standard statements included in the research
project. The researcher made a decision to err on the side of being inclusive rather omitting
standard statements.

3.4.2.1 Limitations	  in	  Matching	  Standard	  Statements	  to	  Big6	  
The researcher made the decision to err on the side of inclusion, through using a simple majority
to include standard statements. Only one pass was made through the standard statements. This
was also a result of the decision to be inclusive. No attempt was made to definitively place
standard statements with a particular Big6 stage.
3.4.2.2 Content	  Analysis	  of	  Standard	  Statements	  for	  Number	  of	  Tasks	  and	  Readability	  
The standard statements that were determined to fit Big6 stages 2, 3, and 4 from both the AASL
and the CCSS were analyzed for whether or not they contained a single or multiple tasks and the
readability of each standard statement.
The Task Count Identification (TCI) code was created as a number to represent the total number
of separate tasks included in the standard statement. The number of tasks in each standard
statement was counted by multiple coding team members in order to establish an inter-rater
reliability score. The number of tasks is related to both clarity and specificity. The higher the
number of tasks the less likely the standard statement is to be either clear or specific, two specific
characteristics of quality standards (Kendall, 2001). Clarity of wording for the standard
statements was operationalized by using the New Dale-Chall readability formula (Chall & Dale,
1995).
One additional coder was used for the Content Analysis portion of the research. This was in
adddtion to the coders who sorted the standard statements into the stages of the Big6 information
problem-solving model.

	  

113	  

	  
3.4.3 Content	  Analysis	  Data	  Limitations	  
Not all AASL and CCSS standards statements could be placed in a Big6 stage; thus it was not
feasible to look at a particular concept and follow it across each grade band. The original goal of
tracking a concept across grade bands to look for increasing rigor and complexity was not
possible. Not all concepts matched to a Big6 stage in grade 2 had a corresponding concept in
grade 5 or grade 8. One effect of sorting the standard statements into Big6 stages was to make
tracing a concept through multiple grade bands and looking for increasing rigor and complexity
impossible. Content analysis for readability and single or multiple concepts was done on the
standard statements that were matched to the Big6 stages 2, 3, and 4.
The initial analysis was done by the lead researcher and led to the development of the concept of
Task Count Identification (TCI) for use in coding the standard statements with the number of
tasks identified in each standard statement. Codes were validated by having multiple coders
apply the TCI strategy in order to cross-check codes and determining a calculation for intercoder
agreement. Creswell (2009) suggests an intercoder agreement of 80% as being good qualitative
reliability.

Krippendorf’s alpha (KALPHA) (Hallgren, 2012; Hayes & Krippendorff, 2007) was used to
calculate an inter-rater reliability rating for both the clarity analysis and the task counting
analysis of the standard statements.

Table 3.5 KALPHA Inter-rater reliability ratings for Clarity and Task Counting
Krippendorf (2004) argues against a standard scale for ranking inter-rater reliability ratings. He
suggests analyzing the ratings based on the importance of the data (e.g. life threatening situations
require a much higher inter-rater reliability than non-life threatening situations). Krippendorf
also discourages averaging inter-rater reliability, suggesting that the lowest score should be used
for judging how useful the inter-rater reliability ratings actually are. In this case, the lowest
scores are .6877 for the clarity rating and .9056 for the task count. These are scores that the
researcher believes are acceptable for rating standards statements in an exploratory project.

3.5 Phase	  2	  Survey	  Methodology	  
The survey was conducted on line using Qualtrics web survey tools (Qualtrics, 2013). Access to
the survey was limited to those individuals having both the URL of the survey and a password.
The survey consisted of three main sections. The first section was of a series of standard
statements from the AASL and the Common Core. In part one of the survey, information
identifying grade level was removed, the statements were randomized and participants were
asked to rate each statement as to its earliest appropriate grade level. The underlying idea for this
part of the survey was to see if teachers agree as to what grade level is appropriate for standards
statements. Standards statements are assigned to grade levels by the issuing organizations. Do
expert, experienced teachers agree with these grade level assignments? If so, one would
reasonably expect expert, experienced teachers to closely match the standards statements to the
appropriate grade level. The second part of the survey was to ask teachers to address standards at
their specific grade level and rate each standard as to it grade-level appropriateness and the
importance of its being taught at that grade level. In this area of the survey, the questions were

	  

115	  

	  
arranged by grade level band so that each participant only answered questions at their own
grade-level band.
The AASL standards are representative of standards based directly on information literacy skills.
As of June, 2014, 43 states have opted to use the Common Core standards (previously the total
was 45 but Indiana and Oklahoma have opted out in 2014) and as a result they represent state
level standards for what children are expected to learn. A third area of the study collected
demographic data on the participants.
3.5.1 Survey	  Participants	  
National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) from nine different National Board certificate areas
from the state of Washington were recruited to participate. NBCTs from the areas shown in table
3.6 were recruited. The combination of surveying teachers with Generalist certificates and those
with specific subject area certificates (English/Language Arts, Science, Mathematics, Social
Studies/History) was aimed at ensuring the survey reached teachers in both elementary
classrooms and middle school classrooms. The National Board certificate area of Exceptional
Needs Specialists added NBCTs who are special education teachers.

3.5.2 National	  Board	  Certified	  Teachers	  as	  Expert	  Teachers	  
The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NPBTS) was created in 1987 to
provide a method for national certification of accomplished teachers (National Board for
Professional Teaching Standards, 2012). Since then research has shown, with a few exceptions,
that NBCTs are more effective in the classroom than non-NBCTs. Cavalluzzo (2004) looked at
student gains in 9th and 10th grade mathematics and concluded that being an NBCT is a marker of
high quality teaching. Goldhaber & Anthony (2007) studied NBCTs in North Carolina and came
to similar conclusions about the effectiveness of NBCTs. Berliner (2004) using the construct of
“expertise” from cognitive psychology, concluded that NBCTs meet the criteria to be considered
not just proficient or competent, but expert teachers.
This research project did not seek to identify expert teachers or what skills make a teacher an
expert, but to make use of teachers already identified as expert. Using NBCTs as experts has
been done previously by Hogan & Rabinowitz (2009) exploring the differences between novice
expert teachers in problem representation and by Buschang, Chung, Delacruz, & Baker (2012)
examining the differences in algebra instruction between beginning teachers, experienced
teachers, and pedagogical content knowledge experts (NBCTs).
3.5.2.1 Survey	  Participant	  Selection	  
The Washington Education Association (WEA) maintains a list of NBCTs in the state of
Washington. WEA agreed to send out an email containing a link to the survey and a invitation to
participate to NBCTs with the desired certificates (Meadows, 2012).

	  

117	  

	  
The WEA database of NBCTs does not include grade level taught, just certificate area. As a
result, participants were asked to answer questions by band levels or grades: 1-3; 4-6; and 7-8.
This allowed analysis of responses at the specific grades levels of the standard statements, i.e.
second grade, fifth grade, and eighth grade.
3.5.2.2 Survey	  Population	  and	  Frame	  
The survey population consists of all NBCTs in the nine selected certificate areas in the state of
Washington. The survey frame is the list of NBCTs held by the WEA. WEA estimates that
approximately 98% of the NBCTs teaching in the state of Washington are WEA members
(Meadows, 2012).
3.5.3 Survey	  Instrument	  
The survey instrument was created specifically for this research project and was piloted prior to
use. The survey instrument consisted of three separate sections.
The first section (example in Table 3.7, the survey is included in the appendices) used the
standard statements from the AASL and CCSS that were identified in the content analysis of this
research project as fitting Big6 stages 2, 3, or 4. These standard statements were stripped of
grade level information and randomized. Respondents were asked to match the standard
statement to the lowest appropriate grade level (2, 5, or 8). Additionally, respondents were asked
to provide a confidence rating (low, medium, or high) for their selection.
The purpose of this section was to determine if standard statements are written in a way that
expert, experienced classroom teachers can identify what grade level was intended for the
standard statement. This section’s goal was not to determine the ability of teachers to choose

	  

118	  

	  
grade levels of the standard statements, but to evaluate whether the standard statements can be
identified as to the intended grade level.
	  

	  
Figure 3.4 Survey Part 1 Placing randomly sorted standard statements to a grade
level
The second section of the survey (example in Table 3.8, see the appendices for the entire survey)
asked teachers to examine standard statements at the grade level that most closely approximated
their own teaching assignment and to rate the standard statements for grade level appropriateness
and importance (Florian, 1999; Hebbeler & Taylor, 2012). This provided information at each
different grade level of teachers’ perceptions of the grade level appropriateness and importance
of each standard statement.

Figure 3.5 NBCT survey on Standards Statements by grade level (Grade 2
example)
The final section collected demographic data including years taught; National Board certificate
area, grade level taught, age, gender, size of school, rural or urban school district. (Florian, 1999;
Gallant, 2009; Maccini & Gagnon, 2002; Simmerman et al., 2012). One use of this data was to
sort the survey results by grade level taught. This enabled analysis of the results by grade level.
Were second grade teachers more likely to identify second grade standard statements than
teachers at other grade levels? Were fifth and eighth grade teachers better at matching their own
grade level standard statements than teachers from other grade levels? The WEA database does
not include information on what grade level NBCTs teach. The only way to access grade level
taught information was by self-reporting in the demographic section of the survey.

3.5.4 Survey	  Testing	  
3.5.4.1 Survey	  Pilot	  and	  Advisory	  Group	  for	  Survey	  Feedback	  
The survey was piloted using 18 teachers from school districts in Skagit, Snohomish, and King
counties, Washington. The sampling method for the pilot was a snowball methodology (Patton,
2002). Initial participants were known to the researcher, and other pilot survey participants came
from input from the initial participants. Pilot survey participants agreed to take the survey and
provide feedback. Teachers in the pilot survey were chosen from grade levels to match the plan
for the actual survey.
Pilot participants provided constructive feed back about the survey organization, length, and
graphic arrangement. These suggestions were incorporated in the final version of the instrument
that was used for the survey.
The final version of the survey is included in the appendices.
3.5.5 Survey	  Data	  Collection	  
The survey was posted on-line using Qualtrics survey software (Qualtrics, 2013). Data on
completed surveys was collected using the Qualtrics survey tools. An Internet based survey has
several advantages over a mail survey. These include both reduced cost and elimination of data
entry errors that can result from inputting results from a paper survey.
3.5.6 Survey	  Data	  Analysis	  
Survey results were downloaded into an Excel file for analysis. Excel files were imported into
SPSS for statistical analysis. Part one of the survey data was analyzed in multiple ways.
Averages of the number of standard statements correctly matched for grade level of teacher and
for type of standard were computed. Paired T-tests were computed to determine if a significant
	  

121	  

	  
difference existed between groups of teachers and the number of different types of standards they
were able to match correctly. Each standard statement has three different options for each
participant to choose (grade 2, 5, 8). The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between
teacher perceptions of grade level placement of standards statements and the actual placement of
standards statements.
Part two of the survey data is a Likert scale. Participants were asked to rate standard statements
for “Important to Teach” and “Developmentally Appropriate to Teach” on a scale of Strongly
Disagree – Disagree – Agree – Strongly Agree. These statements were then coded as 1 for
Strongly Disagree, 2 for Disagree, 3 for Agree, and 4 for Strongly Agree. Descriptive statistics
were used to summarize the data. Scores of 3 or higher indicate teachers “Agree” to “Strongly
Agree” the standard statement is appropriate or of importance to that grade level. No standard
statements received a score less than 2.53 indicating general agreement with both the importance
to teach and developmental appropriateness for teaching. Standard statements were ranked and
the order of the ranking was used to indicate which standard statements teachers believe are most
appropriate/important to least appropriate/least important. These ratings were used as a guide for
questions in the focus group section of the search project and for the content analysis (number of
concepts and readability) of the standard statements. Teacher focus groups were asked for their
input on why particular standard statements were deemed to be important/not important or
appropriate to grade level/not appropriate to grade level.
Part three of the survey data was summarized and descriptive statistics of the results of the
demographic data were tabulated. The demographic data was used to seek out patterns in the
matching of the standard statements and the to compare the survey respondents to the entire

	  

122	  

	  
population of Washington state NBCTs to determine to what extent did the survey respondents
match the population.
3.5.7 Limitations	  of	  Survey	  Methodology	  
A general limitation of surveys is the desire of participants to appear knowledgeable and
competent (McGrath, 1994). This survey asked teachers to assign grade levels to information
literacy standard statements and many teachers, though familiar with information
literacy/information problem solving through research projects assigned to students at their grade
levels, may not have been familiar with the information literacy standards. This may be
especially true of the standards statements from the AASL and the CCSS. The AASL standard
statements were more apt to be familiar to library media specialists rather than classroom
teachers. The CCSS statements are new and are in the process of being implemented by many
states. This lack of familiarity may have resulted in frustration as participants attempted to assign
standards to specific grade levels. This limitation was addressed in three ways. First, the
instructions of the survey stressed that the researcher was interested in evaluating the standards,
not the participants. Second participants were asked only for their best effort at selecting the
appropriate grade level and were asked to provide a confidence rating of their choice. Third, all
participants had the opportunity to be anonymous. This should also have helped alleviate
participant concerns about appearing to lack knowledge of the standards.
Dillman, Smyth, and Christian (2009) identify four types of errors in surveys: coverage error,
sampling error, nonresponse error, and measurement error.

	  

123	  

	  
3.5.7.1 Coverage	  Error	  
This type of error happens when not everyone who is in the group to be sampled have a known,
nonzero, chance to be selected in the sample, and when those not included are in some way
different from those included (Dillman et al., 2009). This research project’s population was all
NBCTs in the nine certificate areas identified in Table 3.5. Rather than sampling this population;
this research project attempted to solicit responses from the entire survey frame. Electronic
means of communication made this feasible to attempt. Coverage error will result from the gap
of approximately 2% between the numbers of Washington state NBCTs and the number of
Washington state NBCTs who are not members of the Washington Education Association.
3.5.7.2 Sampling	  error	  
Sampling error results from not everyone in the population being surveyed. In this case the
sampling frame will include 98% of the population in the survey.
3.5.7.3 Nonrespondent	  Bias	  
A third limitation is nonrespondent bias. Nonrespondent bias results when the individuals chosen
to be a part of the survey do not respond. If these individuals differ from the respondents this will
result in the survey data being biased. Nonrespondents are a major concern in this study.
Three methods were used to deal with nonrespondent bias. Resending the survey link was the
primary method. Sending out the survey link up to four times has been shown to be the mostly
likely way to increase the response rate to web surveys (Dillman et al., 2009). This research sent
out the survey link five times. Survey links were sent out October 25, 2013, November 16, 2013,
December 3, 2013, February 6, 2014, and March 12, 2014. Resending the survey link was done
by two different methods. The original email from WEA to the NBCTs was resent three times,
	  

124	  

	  
and, one announcement was included in an email newsletter to NBCTs by the Center for
Strengthening the Teaching Profession (CSTP). Each email resulted in an increased number of
respondents for the survey.
The second method was to analyze the demographic data of the respondents to estimate to what
extent the respondents match the population of Washington NBCTs. This allowed for a
determination of whether or not the participants differed in any consistent pattern from the
population as a whole.
A third method to deal with nonresponse bias was to offer a lottery for a $50 Amazon gift card
for every 50 responses. This was an attempt to increase the number of respondents. Participants
had the opportunity to leave contact information if they desired to enter the lottery for the
Amazon gift card. Lottery winners had their Amazon gift cards delivered on June 18, 2014.
Additionally in order to develop an understanding of what factors differentiated those
respondents who completed the survey and nonrespondents/nonfinishers, the focus groups
members were asked to describe what motivated them to finish the survey.
3.5.7.4 Measurement	  Error	  
Measurement error occurs when the respondents answers are inaccurate and do not reflect the
actual views of the respondent. This type of error can occur when questions are imprecise or
confusing. This was dealt with by conducting a pilot survey and including changes in questions
that the pilot participants indicated were unclear or confusing.

	  

125	  

	  
3.5.7.5 Validity	  	  
Validity issues are concerned with to what extent does this survey measure what it claims to
measure, teachers’ perceptions of information literacy standards. Validity threats were addressed
by reviewing and adopting changes suggested both by the advisory group serving as an advisory
panel and through the results of the pilot study.
3.5.7.6 Reliability	  
Does the survey measure what it claims to consistently? Cronbach’s Alpha was calculated using
the results of various sections of the survey to determine the survey’s reliability (Hinton, 2004).
Table 3.7 shows the results for the different sections of the survey.

Table 3.9 shows that all sections of the survey had high to moderate reliability except for the
CCSS Grade 5 with low reliability. This section also had the fewest items.
	  

126	  

	  

3.6 Phase	  3	  Focus	  Groups	  	  
3.6.1 Teacher	  Input	  -­‐	  Focus	  Groups	  
This phase consisted of conducting a series of four focus groups with expert, experienced
teachers. These focus groups provided insight into what teachers believe children should be able
to do at different ages based on the teachers’ years of observation and experience working with
children. The focus groups served to offer explanations of the data gained in the survey of phase
one of this research project.
The analysis of this information gained via the focus groups provided insights into what teachers
view the different abilities of youths of different ages to be, and to what extent teachers view the
grade level appropriateness and importance of information literacy standard statements from the
AASL and CCSS.
Using teachers for their expertise in analyzing levels of difficulty has been done previously (for
readability, for example) and is actually a long accepted and successful practice (Chall et al.,
1996; Chall & Dale, 1995). The state of Washington’s Superintendent of Public Instruction’s
report to the legislature on adopting the Common Core standards prominently mentions the
results of a survey of National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) as experts (Dorn, 2011). Chall
and Dale (1995) used teachers’ judgments in rating the difficulty of reading levels of texts. As
noted above, teachers and reading specialist scores paralleled those obtained with the New DaleChall Readability test. Feinberg & Shapiro (2009) reviewed a number of studies on the efficacy
of teacher assessment of student success and concluded, “For predicting student success, teachers
typically have the experience of a large, personal normative sample of students and an expertise
in the particular curriculum. Research has been supportive of the assumption that teacher
judgment information provides a generally accurate prediction of student achievement” (p. 453).
	  

127	  

	  
These results support Chall et al.’s (1996) point that using teachers for experts is a long accepted
successful dating back over a century to Thorndike in 1910. The use of teacher focus will tap
into this expertise by examining what teachers believe students are capable of in terms of
information problem solving.
The focus group methodology was selected for its potential to both stimulate ideas and
conversation while at the same time not demanding a consensus. The most important benefit of
using focus groups for this research was the generation of ideas resulting from the interaction of
the group members (Patton, 2002; Young & Von Seggern, 2001). Using focus groups allows the
researcher to report on the level of consensus arrived at or the degree of the lack of consensus.
This type of analysis, determining the level of consensus, is analysis that is not available from
examining standards.
3.6.2 Focus	  group	  Use	  in	  Information	  Science	  
The use of focus groups is common in Information Science. They have been used for a variety of
purposes including a case study evaluating a process approach to a library research program
(Kuhlthau, 1993), examining the services offered by a library (V. Perry, 2002; Von Seggern &
Young, 2003; Young & Von Seggern, 2001), children’s Internet use at home (Burnett &
Wilkinson, 2005) and the study of the information behavior of “tweens” (Meyers, Fisher, &
Marcoux, 2009). In the realm of education, Kong (2009) used focus group methodology for
curriculum development, and Shenton and Dixon (2004) used this method to study the
information behavior of English school children. Kong (2009), Lundh and Limberg (2008) and
Wen and Shih (2008) both used teachers as knowledgeable subjects in focus groups.

3.6.3 Focus	  groups	  as	  Different	  from	  Committees	  that	  Create	  Standards	  
Standards committees involved with creating standards related to information science typically
include a variety of experts on information literacy, education and learning. Thus, on the surface
it may seem that this study repeats work that has already been done. This study differs from
previous work because, although similar on the surface, there are key differences between the
use of focus groups of teachers and a standards creation committee.
First, the goal of a standards committee is to come to consensus, to achieve an end product, the
set of standards that is ultimately issued or the sponsoring organization. According to Morgan &
Krueger (1993) the goal of using focus groups in research is not to come to decisions. In fact,
they argue that the free exchange of ideas will be limited when groups are pushed to reach a
consensus. Bloor, Frankland, Thomas, & Robson (2001, p. 8) echo this argument writing that,
“when one of the tasks of focus groups is to arrive at a group consensus on a given topic, it is to
be expected that deviant experiences will be silenced”. The goals and processes of focus groups
will differ significantly from the goals and processes of a committee that is creating standards. In
this research, one of the goals of focus groups will be to discover differing opinions without
attempting to come to a consensus. Members of the focus groups will be actively encouraged to
state their own interpretations of the questions with the goal of taking advantage of the capability
of focus groups to determine what the degree of consensus is on a particular question without
attempting to move to consensus (Morgan & Krueger, 1993). By not trying to come to
consensus, the “sausage factory” effect described above by Philips (2009) should be eliminated
or reduced as a factor in the process. The use of focus groups may provide either a diverse range
of answers to the questions, or, may trend to consensus. In either case, the responses will allow
the researcher to report on the amount of consensus or diversity in the focus groups’ responses.
	  

129	  

	  
This is information that is absent from standards documents and is one significant way the use of
focus groups in this study differs from the work of standards committees.
A second major difference between standards committees and the focus groups proposed by this
research is the makeup of the groups. The AASL Learning Standards Rewrite Task Force (20062007) contained eight people, none of whom were classroom teachers. According to Johns
(2008) the makeup of the committee was a high school librarian who was also the 2008-09)
AASL president-elect, two library educators, a state librarian, an elementary librarian, and a
school library system director. The acknowledgement in the standards document indicates there
were an additional two members of the committee; one a AASL board liaison and the other a
AASL staff liaison. The development of the first technology education standards by the
International Technology Education Association (ITEA) (now the International Technology and
Engineering Education Association (ITEEA)) involved 27 people divided into three grade band
committees of nine. Analysis of the elementary committee shows that three of the nine members
are affiliated with universities, one is an elementary school principal, one is a staff development
expert, while the status of the remaining members is unclear (Kinser, Dugger, & Newberry,
1997).
Reports on state level committees on standards creation indicate more teacher involvement but
the exact makeup of these committees is not clear. Barnett (2008) describes the Arkansas state
committee on information literacy standards as having forty-five members representing large,
medium, and small school districts, all grade levels, and urban, suburban, and rural areas. She
also states, “My previous experiences have shown that it is nearly impossible to get that many
people to agree on anything” (p. 22). This would seem to indicate a great deal of compromise
was necessary to reach a final set of standards. Bartow (2009) indicates that the Montana Library
	  
130	  

	  
Media standards were created by teams including educators, post-secondary education faculty,
K-12 school administrators.
The proposed research project consisting of focus groups of classroom teachers is clearly
different in makeup from the committees of both national and state organization issuing
information literacy standards. This research project running four focus groups of four to seven
teachers resulted in quite probably having a greater amount of classroom teacher input than
either national or state committees.
In summary this research project differed from the work of standards committees in two
significant ways. First was the ability to report on the level of or lack of consensus achieved
concerning the differing ability levels of students of various ages to solve information problems.
Second, the makeup of the proposed focus groups differed from committees that have created
standards
3.6.4 Focus	  Group	  Methodology	  
The third phase tapped into teachers’ knowledge of student abilities through the use of a series of
four focus groups. Focus groups allow members to express their ideas without the need to come
to a final consensus to produce an end product. This type of forum also provides an arena for
stimulating the thought of individuals through the interaction of the group.
The creation of standard statements appears to be an opaque process. Each standard statements
document generally has a list of who was involved and a brief description of the process. This
process can be summed up: “A group of experts formed a committee and through an iterative
process came to consensus. These are the standard statements that resulted.” This is a
generalization. As noted earlier, a common criticism of standards statements is that consensus
	  

131	  

	  
comes from addition not subtraction. The use of teacher focus groups allows for the researcher to
analyze the level of consensus present as the group discusses students’ ability levels in solving
information problems. This insight into the level of, or lack of, consensus achieved in the
creation of information literacy standards statements is currently not available. This research
project’s focus group methodology will allow the researcher to report on the extent that the
expert, experienced teachers reached consensus concerning the abilities of students of different
ages to solve information problems.
The aim of the focus groups was to have teachers examine the results of the survey and provide
explanatory input about these results. A goal was to address capabilities of students in grades 2,
5, and 8, in areas that the survey results indicate were not well agreed upon. This discussion was
intended to provide a description of the ability levels of students at different grade levels and to
provide insight into why a lack of consensus existed on particular skills. A discussion of how the
focus group process differs from the process used to create standards and thus provides different
forms of insight is included below in section 3.6.3.
Focus groups were made up of NBCTs recruited from the survey participants. Survey
participants were asked to provide contact information if they would be willing to participate in a
focus groups. A $25 Amazon gift care was offered as a gratuity for all participants in the focus
groups. Focus groups were ultimately organized based on the availability of the volunteers. A
survey was created using the University of Washington’s Catalyst tools and sent to those NBCTs
who indicated they were interested in a follow-up focus group (see the appendices). NBCTs were
offered ten different dates to choose from. The results of the survey led to focus groups being
help on January 27, February 10 and February 19, 2014. As a result of increased participation

	  

132	  

	  
based on the additional recruiting emails, a second survey was sent out seeking focus group
participants. This resulted in a fourth focus group that was held on May 5, 2014.
The focus groups were heterogeneous in terms of grade level and area of National Board
specialization. An idea that had been considered, but was dependent upon the number of
participants, was to have homogenous groups of teachers from second, fifth, eighth grades and
special education. This was not possible due to the number and background of respondents
volunteering to participate in the focus groups.
The focus groups were held entirely on-line using Adobe Connect. The first focus group on
January 27 used both a video and audio interface. There were difficulties with participants
attempting to use the audio and video capabilities in the first focus group, and these difficulties
worsened at the start of the second focus group. The multiple audio and video difficulties were
resolved by switching to a text-based interface for the second focus group. Success with the text
based interface led to the third and fourth focus groups being entirely text based.
A standardized set of questions was designed to guide the focus group conversations. The focus
group questions are included in the appendices. Copies of the survey results were provided to
participants in advance. All focus groups members were sent a copy of the Informed Consent
form that was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (IRB). The
information provided to the focus groups is included in the appendices. All participants
acknowledge the Informed Consent form and all agreed to being recorded.
3.6.5 Focus	  Group	  Data	  Recording	  
All focus groups were digitally recorded and the files were transcribed for analysis. The
researcher took notes during each focus group.
	  

133	  

	  
3.6.6 Focus	  group	  participant	  selection	  and	  compensation	  
This research project drew a purposeful sample for the focus group participants. The survey
included a question asking participants if they were willing to participate in a follow up focus
group. One of the focus group goals was to explain the results of the survey and thus having
members of the original survey was both logical and according to Creswell & Plano Clark, a
requirement of an explanatory design (2011). Morse (2003) writes that different sampling
methods will necessarily be used, and that the same participants may (rather than must) be used
in qualitative study following a quantitative study.
Focus group members were compensated with $25 gift cards from Amazon.com. Amazon gift
cards were delivered to all participants email addresses during the week following each focus
group.
3.6.7 Qualitative	  Data	  Analysis	  from	  Focus	  Groups	  
The focus groups were meant to provide explanatory evidence of the survey results, not
necessarily to generate data for creation of a new theory. Thus the focus groups were used to
generate a thick description of the views of NBCT participants concerning both the results of the
survey and information literacy standard statements. The data from the focus groups (both
recorded transcripts and the researcher’s notes) were analyzed for the themes that arose from the
focus groups. This was done in an ongoing basis with the analysis of the first groups helping to
inform the questions directed at later groups. The website DeDoose ("Dedoose Version 5.1.26,
web application for managing, analyzing, and presenting qualitative and mixed method research
data," 2014) was used to analyze the transcripts and create codes.

	  

134	  

	  
The analysis of the data from the focus groups followed the steps outlined by Creswell (2009).
Raw data was collected in the form of researcher’s notes and transcripts of the focus groups. The
raw data was organized, (transcription of session, typing and organizing of researcher’s notes)
and an initial read through was conducted to gain a general sense of the information. Codes were
created for themes and a codebook created. The codes were used to generate themes and
descriptions. Finally, the researcher interpreted the meaning of the themes/descriptions.

3.7 Ensuring	  Research	  Quality	  
This research project utilized several methods to increase the reliability and the validity of the
results. Using a mixed method design data was collected by three separate methods, content
analysis of standards documents, a survey, and focus groups. The combination of methods
provided for triangulation of sources. The evidence was used to create a holistic portrayal of
teachers’ perceptions of information literacy standards. Specific steps included:
•

Pretesting of survey questions;

•

An advisory group for feedback before deploying the survey;

•

Multiple email follow ups to reduce nonrespondent bias on the survey portion of
research;

•

Equipment testing and backups of electronically recorded focus group conversations;

•

Member checks with teachers to ensure themes derived from the data are accurate and
perceived by participants to be accurate (Creswell, 2009);

•
	  

For quantitative data, all statistical measures were performed using SPSS.
135	  

	  
•

Research design and specific tests were confirmed with on-campus statistical consultants
(Statistical Consulting Services, Departments of Biostatistics and Statistics).

3.8 Ethical	  Considerations	  
This research was submitted to the University of Washington’s Institutional Review Board for
compliance with human subjects regulations. This research project was determined to qualify for
exempt status in accordance with the federal regulations under 45 CFR 46.101/ 21 CFR 56.104
on August 21, 2013. (The determination letter is included in the appendices). All survey
participants were asked to read an informed consent form before being able to access the survey
questions. All focus group members were sent an informed consent form prior to focus group
participation. All participants in the focus groups verbally confirmed receiving and reading the
informed consent form and were given the chance to ask questions.
All data is in electronic form with personal identifiers removed from the data except where
necessary for contacting participants. Contacting participants was necessary for scheduling focus
groups, paying participants an honorarium for participating in the focus groups, and contacting
the winners of the random drawing. Data collected is stored in a password protected computer
hard drive.

3.9 Summary	  
A variety of issues have been identified that have a negative impact on various educational
standard statements. Prior to this research project it was not known if these issues also affected
information literacy standard statements, nor what the perceptions of classroom teachers were
concerning these standards. This research project used a Sequential Explanatory mixed method
design to examine perceptions of expert, experienced classroom teachers concerning information
	  

136	  

	  
literacy standard statements and the grade level appropriateness of these standard statements.
Expert, experienced teachers were defined as those teachers who have earned National Board
Certification in an applicable certificate area. The three phases of this research project included a
qualitative content analysis of existing standards, a quantitative non-experimental survey, and, a
follow-up phase of a series of four focus groups comprised of expert, experienced classroom
teachers. The content analysis was used to identify standard statements that fit stages of the Big6
information problem-solving model, and to examine standards for conceptual complexity and
readability. The survey was used to identify to what extent standard statements matched
teachers’ perceptions of grade level appropriateness and importance. The focus groups were used
in an explanatory fashion to gain an understanding of the results from the first two phases. The
use of multiple methods was used to increase research credibility through triangulation of data
from different sources. The results of this research are intended to provide support for validating
existing standards and to provide indications of areas where gaps may exist between the standard
statements and teachers’ views thus pointing to areas of future research seeking to explain any
inconsistencies.

4. Results	  
4.1 Introduction	  
This chapter presents the results of all three phases this research project. The first section (4.1)
describes the results categorizing both the American Association of School Librarians (AASL)
and Common Core State Standards (CCSS) standard statements into the stages of the Big6
information problem-solving method. Section 4.2 describes the content analysis of the standard
statements for concepts and clarity of writing. Section 4.3 describes the results of the survey of
National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs). First, the survey participants are described based on
the information from the demographic portion of the survey. Second is a description of the
results of part one of the survey in which the NBCTs matched randomized standard statements to
the intended grade level. Third, is a description of the results of the NBCTs ranking the standard
statements for both importance to teach and developmental appropriateness for teaching at each
grade level. Section 4.4 of this chapter discusses the results of the focus group sessions. The final
section (4.5) of this chapter is the conclusion.

4.2 Categorizing	  Standards	  into	  Big6	  Stages	  
4.2.1 Introduction	  
This section describes the results of Phase One, sorting the standard statements from the AASL
and the CCSS. A total of 690 standard statements were identified as stages of the Big6 model, as
not Big6 stages, or as unable to tell if it was a Big6 stage. Of the 690 standard statements, 313
were from the AASL and 377 were from the Common Core.

4.2.2 Results	  of	  Sorting	  AASL	  Standard	  Statements	  into	  Big6	  Stages	  
The AASL has four broad standards. These are subdivided into strands and then further
subdivided into skills, dispositions, responsibilities, and self-assessment strategies. Each of these
subdivision have indicators with benchmarks representing what students should be able to do at
grades 2, 5, 8, 10, and 12. The four AASL standards are 1) inquire, think critically and gain
knowledge, 2) draw conclusions, make informed decisions, apply knowledge to new situations,
and create new knowledge, 3) share knowledge and participation ethically and productively as
members of our democratic society, and 4) pursue personal and aesthetic growth (American
Association of School Librarians, 2009).
The final tally of AASL standard statements categorized into Big6 stages is shown in Table 4.1
while Table 4.2 summarizes the data.
Table 4.1 shows the number of standards in each Big6 category, using simple frequencies and
percentages with the goal of detecting patterns. No test for statistical significance was performed
on this data. For example, a Chi Squared test may have indicated if there were a significant
difference between the reported frequencies and an evenly distributed model of the Big6 stages.
However, there is no reason to expect an even distribution, or any particular pattern, in the stages
of an information problem-solving model in a set of standard statements. The intent here was to
determine what stages of the Big6 are present in the AASL to identify patterns and to determine
which standard statements matched Big6 stages 2, 3, and 4 for further content analysis, and
inclusion in the survey portion and of this research project.

Table 4.1 AASL Standard Statements matched to Big6 stages
Table 4.1 shows that all six stages of the Big6 were reflected in the standard statements in the
four AASL standards. The total of AASL standard statements matched to Big6 stages was 202.
The range is approximately evenly spread across the four standards ranging from 14% to 19% of
the total standard statements.
Standard statements that were categorized as Not Big6 were those the coders decided did not fit
into a Big6 stage. Reasons a standard statement might be categorized in this way included both
that the standard statement simply did not address a Big6 concept and that the standard statement
included multiple and differing tasks resulting in the coder being unable to determine which Big6
stage was predominant. Three examples of standard statements that were categorized as Not
Big6/Unable to tell are listed in Table 4.2 below.

Table 4.2 AASL Standards classified as Not Big6
Table 4.3 displays results of the coding by Big6 stage. The AASL standards statements have an
emphasis on stage 5, (Synthesis), and stage 4, (Use of Information). Of the 202 of 313 standard
statements that were placed into a Big6 stage, 87 (43%) were at Big6 Stage 5, another 44 (22%)
were at Stage 4. These two stages make up 65% of the all the standard statements. The remaining
four stages of the Big6, Stage 1 (Task Definition), Stage 2 (Information Seeking Strategies),
Stage 3 (Location and Access), and Stage 6 (Evaluation) were each detected in 10% or fewer of
the standard statements. These four stages of the Big6 made up just over one third (35%) of the
AASL standard statements. Task definition, the most important phase of problem solving (J. D.
Bransford et al., 2000; Willer, Marino, & Eisenberg, 2014) and Evaluation, the final stage of
problem-solving, are the two least represented. Each was detected in less than 10% of the
standard statements.

4.2.3 Results	  of	  Sorting	  the	  Common	  Core	  State	  Standards	  into	  Big6	  Stages	  
The CCSS have two areas of standards – English/Language Arts and Mathematics.
English/Language Arts is broken into anchor standards and then into grade level standards for
each anchor standard. The anchor standards themselves are grouped into categories. Additionally
the standards are grouped into two grade bands, K-5 and 6-12. Table 4.5 lists the various
categories of anchor standards in the left hand column.
The categories of the CCSS Mathematics standards are also listed in Table 4.5. Only 11 of the
CCSS Mathematics standard statements were found to fit a Big6 stage. All 11 of these were in
the Big6 stage 5, Synthesis, and thus were excluded from the survey.
This section reports on the number of CCSS standard statements in each Big6 category, using a
simple tally system with the goal of detecting patterns, not statistical significance. As noted in
the section on the AASL standard statements, the intent here was to determine patterns and to

	  

142	  

	  
	  
identify CCSS statements that fit stages 2, 3, and 4 of the Big6 information problem-solving
model for inclusion in the survey of NBCTs.
The final tally of CCSS standard statements categorized into Big6 stages is shown in Table 4.5
while Tables 4.6 and 4.7 summarize the data.

Table 4.5 shows that the CCSS has an emphasis on Big6 Stage 5 (Synthesis), and to a lesser
degree Stage 4 (Use of Information). However, it is also apparent that no CCSS are related to
Big6 Stages 1 (Task Definition), 2 (Information Seeking Strategies), or 6 (Evaluation). Of the
122 standards statements that were placed into a Big6 stage out of 377, 86 were at Big6 Stage 5
(Synthesis), another 33 were at Stage 4 (Use of Information), and 4 were at Stage 3 (Location
and Access). There were no CCSS standards statements that were categorized into the remaining
Big6 stages.

Tables 4.6 and 4.7 clearly show the CCSS emphasis on Big6 stage 5, Synthesis with 23% of the
standard statements being categorized as this Big6 stage. Big6 stages 1, 2, and 6 have no
representation in the CCSS standard statements, while Big6 3, Location and Access appears only
four times.
The CCSS standard statements have a much higher incidence of standard statements identified as
not Big6 when compared to the AASL standard statements. This is most likely due to the fact the
AASL standards were written for Teacher/Librarians and thus are aimed more specifically at
information literacy skills. The CCSS standard statements that were reviewed included all the
standard statements at Grades 2, 5, and 8 in English/Language Arts and Mathematics and were
not necessarily intended as information literacy standards.

4.3 Content	  Analysis	  of	  Standard	  Statements	  from	  the	  AASL	  and	  CCSS	  
4.3.1 Introduction	  	  
The standard statements from both the AASL and CCSS were reviewed for clarity and the
number of tasks involved in each standard statement. The same coders (with one addition) that
reviewed with the standard statements for coding to Big6 stages were asked to code the standard
statements on these two categories. Coders were asked to count the number of tasks in each
standard statement and also to rate each standard statement for clarity on a three-point scale. The
clarity scale is described below in Table 4.8. One coder coded all standard statements. Three
other coders each scored approximately one-third of the standard statements. This resulted in
each standard statements being coded by two coders allowing for the calculation of an inter-rater
reliability rating. Krippendorf’s Alpha (KALPHA) (Hayes & Krippendorff, 2007)was used to
establish an inter-rater reliability, see table 4.13 for details. All coders coded for both the number
of tasks and the clarity of the standard statements.

The clarity scale was deliberately kept simple and was similar to that used in Hebbleler and
Taylor’s (2012) study of Conneticut kindergarten and preschool standards. The purpose in
coding for clarity was to identify to what extent this was an issue with the standard statements
and to identify particular standard statements that were unclear. According to Kendall (2001, p.
12), “Because the benchmark should communicate clearly what students should know and be
able to do, the language must be more concrete and precise.”

Table 4.8 Clarity Scale used by Coders
There was no scale for counting the tasks in the standard statements. Coders were given
examples of the standard statement with the number of tasks identified. Coders then reviewed a
subset of the standard statements on a spreadsheet and counted the number of tasks in each
standards statement.
4.3.2 Issues	  with	  clarity	  of	  writing	  
A total of 122 standards were rated for clarity using the scale in Table 4.8. Table 4.9 shows the

standard statements, or 18.9% received a rating of 1, “Overly complex, wording is confusing, or
easily confuses the reader.” Of these standard statements rated at a “1”, 11 were CCSS and 12
were AASL. This equates to 29.7% of the CCSS standard statements being rated at a “1” and
14.1% of the AASL receiving a “1” rating.

Table 4.11 Frequency of Tasks Coded in Standard Statements by groups of two
Table 4.11 shows that the CCSS standard statements tendency to have a higher number of tasks
than the AASL standard statements with 19% of the CCSS standard statements having more than
10 tasks compared to 1% of the AASL standard statements. At the lower end, 84% of the AASL
standard statements (73/84) had one to four tasks in each standard statement, compare to only
59% (22/37) of the CCSS.
Table 4.12 shows the average task count per standard statement and breaks the data down by

As noted above, Kendall (2001) argues that standards must be “concrete and precise.” The focus
groups of NBCTs indicated that the standard statements (from both the CCSS and the AASL)
were difficult to place at the grade level intended by the standard statements’ authors was the
number of tasks involved in the standard statements. The CCSS standard statements had a mean
score of 5.53 tasks per item. The AASL standard statements had a mean score of 2.91 tasks per
item. Both set of standard statements would be clearer and more precise if the standard
statements were written with fewer tasks in each statement.
4.3.4 Inter-­‐Rater	  Reliability	  Ratings	  for	  Clarity	  Ratings	  and	  Task	  Coding	  
Krippendorf’s alpha (KALPHA) (Hallgren, 2012; Hayes & Krippendorff, 2007) was used to
calculate an inter-rater reliability rating for both the clarity analysis and the task counting
analysis of the standard statements.

Table 4.13 KALPHA Inter-rater reliability ratings for Clarity and Task Counting
Krippendorf (2004) argues against a standard scale for ranking inter-rater reliability ratings. He
suggests analyzing the ratings based on the importance of the data (e.g. life threatening situations
require a much higher inter-rater reliability than non-life threatening situations). Krippendorf
also discourages averaging inter-rater reliability, suggesting that the lowest score should be used
for judging how useful the inter-rater reliability ratings actually are. In this case, the lowest
scores are .6877 for the clarity rating and .9056 for the task count. These are scores that the
researcher believes are acceptable for rating standards statements in an exploratory project.

	  

149	  

	  
	  
4.3.5 Matching	  Content	  Analysis	  Findings	  to	  Survey	  Results	  
These scores from the clarity ratings and the task count indexing were correlated with each
standard statements number of correct matches from the survey of NBCTs. The correlation
coefficient for the clarity ratings, calculating using Spearman’s coefficient, was 0.123, indicating
little correlation between the two variables. Spearman’s coefficient was selected because the
clarity rating is ordinal level data (Hinton, 2004; Hinton, McMurray, & Charlotte, 2014). The
Pearson’s R correlation coefficient for the task count index was .142 (r = .142, N = 113, p >
0.05) thus indicating little to no correlation between the times a standard statement was matched
to the intended grade level and the number of tasks the standard statement included. Pearson’s
correlation was used for this calculation because both sets of data are ratio level data (Hinton,
2004; Hinton, McMurray, & Charlotte, 2014).
The content analysis of the standard statements, both the Task Count Index and the Clarity
ratings failed to shed any statistical light on the portion of the survey in which participants
matched the standard statement to the intended grade level. However, both these analyses
provide other insights into the standards. The clarity ratings show the sheer number of standard
statements that the raters found to be less than clear. The task count index shows the average
number of tasks per standard statement is 3.70. If all standard statements are to be clear and
easily understood, the number of standard statements that were found to be less than clear and
the number of tasks each standard statement requires are indicators of areas needing change.
4.3.6 Dale-­‐Chall	  Reading	  Level	  Test	  of	  the	  Standard	  Statements	  
One further method of judging the clarity of the standard statements was used. The Dale-Chall
reading formula was applied to all the standard statements via the use of a web-based calculator,
ReadabilityFormulas.com (Scott, 2014). The Dale-Chall reading formula is meant for blocks of
	  

150	  

	  
	  
text with the minimum number of words between 100 (Chall et al., 1996) and 200 (Scott, 2014),
not short sentences, thus not all of the standard statements returned a Dale-Chall score.
Combining the standard statements and analyzing them as a group resulted in a score of 8.6,
grades 11-12 for the Common Core standard statements and a score of 9.2, grades 13-15 for the
AASL standard statements. The grade levels should be well within the reading capability of
NBCTs and thus does not provide evidence that there is an issue with the clarity of the standards.
If the standard statements are to be comprehensible to parents and students though, these reading
levels are may be too high.

4.4 Survey	  of	  National	  Board	  Certified	  Teachers	  
The survey sent to the NBCTs in Washington was constructed from the results of the content
analysis described in section 4.2. The standards that were categorized as Big6 stages 2, 3, and 4
were used to create the survey instrument. This resulted in a total of 115 standard statements
being used in part one of the survey (85 AASL and 30 CCSS). In part two of the survey 121
standard statements were used. The additional standard statements resulted from duplication in a
few of the CCSS standard statements, i.e. the same standard statement was repeated at different
grade levels. Part one of the survey used these duplicated standards just once, asking the
participants to place the standard statement at the earliest intended grade level.

Figure 4.1 Survey Participants’ Area of National Board Certification compared to
Washington state areas of National Board certification
The area of greatest difference in NBCT certificate areas and the survey respondents was the
“Other” category. Statewide, other certificate areas make up 37.1% of NBCTs, in the survey
there were only six (6.2%) of respondents who were in this certificate area. All of six of these
described their certificate area as “Literacy: Reading Language Arts/Early to Middle Childhood.”
This small number of “others” compared to the statewide number is not unexpected because the
survey link was originally targeted at only the 10 certificate areas. The NBCT areas that were
targeted made up 86.4% of the total participants in the survey. There were two other areas that
should be noted are Exceptional Needs Specialist – Early Childhood Young Adult and Library
Media/Early Childhood Through Young Adult. The Exceptional Needs Specialist certificate area
makes up only 6.6% of NBCTs in Washington, but this certificate area made up 10.3% of survey
	  

153	  

	  
	  
participants. NBCTs with a Library Media certificate make up only 1.9% of Washington NBCTs
but they made up 10.3% of the survey participants. This last fact is not surprising since Library
Media specialists generally see information literacy as their area of specialization. One of the
Library Media specialists in the first focus group commented that she was particularly interested
in the research project due to the crosswalk between the AASL and CCSS standard statements

4.4.2 Matching	  standard	  statements	  to	  intended	  grade	  level	  

	  

The first section of the survey asked the survey participants to match the standard statements to
the earliest appropriate grade level. The survey software was set to present the standard
statements to each of the survey participants in random order.
4.4.2.1 Grade	  level	  means	  and	  Confidence	  Intervals	  
Table 4.17 shows the mean percentage of standard statements matched to the intended grade
level for all standard statements, by all participants along with a 95% confidence interval (the
mean plus or minus two times the standard error). As the survey presented the participants with
three choices it is clear that the grade eights standards were matched at a percentage that was
only equal to random chance (33%).

Table 4.19 Paired T – Tests Comparing AASL and CCSS means by Grade Level
These results indicate, with significance at the .05 level, that the participants were more likely to
match the CCSS standard statements to the grade level intended by the CCSS standards writers
than to match the AASL standard statements to the grade level intended by the AASL standards
writers. This was true across all three grade level bands.
4.4.2.4 Matching	  standard	  statements	  by	  Authoring	  Organization	  –	  AASL	  vs.	  CCSS	  
Table 4.20 contains the same data as Table 4.21 but it is organized by the originator of the
standard statements and then by grade level. This table clearly shows that as grade level
increases the ability of expert teachers to match the standard statements to grade level intended
by the originator of the standard statement decreases. The AASL standards start at a 65% match
rate at second grade, decrease to 48% at Fifth grade and drop further to 25% at Eighth grade. The
CCSS standard statements follow the same pattern starting high at 72% in second grade,
decreasing to 56% at Fifth grade and ending at 37% in Eighth grade.

Table 4.21 Standard Statements Matched and Mismatched by Grade Level
Participants matched Second grade standard statements as belonging to Second grade 66.8% of
the time and to Fifth grade 28.1% of the time. Only 4.5% of the Second grade standards were
matched to Eighth grade. Participants matched Fifth grade standards to Fifth grade 49% of the
time, while mismatching them to Second grade at 37.5% of the time more frequently than
mismatching them to Eighth grade at 13%. Eighth grade standard statements were only correctly
matched to Eighth grade 29.3% of the time while they were mismatched to Fifth grade 46.1% of
	  

159	  

	  
	  
the time and to Second grade 23.9% of the time. Eighth grade standard statements were the only
set that were more frequetntly mismatched to a different grade level than matched to the grade
level intended by the authors of the standard statements.

Figure 4.5 Standard Statements matched and mismatched by Grade Level.
Figure 4.5 provides a graphic representation of the data in Table 4.21. The Second grade
standard statements show a pattern that one would expect, where grade level standards are most
likely to be matched to the intended grade level and followed by increasingly fewer mismatches
the further away from the intended grade level.
Fifth grade is equally far apart (two school years) from both Second and Eighth grades. This
would indicate that the number of mismatches would be equivalent. This expected pattern does
not fit the Fifth grade standard statements as a much higher percentage of mismatches went
towards Second grade rather than Eighth grade.

	  

160	  

	  
	  
The Eighth grade standards were the most difficult to match to the intended grade level, to such a
degree that more of the standard statements that were intended for Eighth being matched to Fifth
grade than to the actual intended Eighth grade level.

Table 4.22 Examining standards by Teacher grader level and standard grade level.
Table 4.22 shows that teacher who self identified as either teaching 5th grade or having 5th grade
as the grade level closest to their level of expertise were most likely to match the standard
statements to their intended grade levels at second grade, but they came in second at their own
grade level, and last at Eighth grade. Second grade teachers were better than Eighth grade
teachers at matching second grade standards but this group had the least agreement in matching
to the intended grade level at Grades 5 and 8. The teachers who self identified at Eighth grade
were the least likely to match the second grade standard statements to their intended grade level
but were most likely to match both the Fifth and Eighth grade standards statements. Figure 4.6
contains a line chart of these findings.

Ranking all the standards statements from most frequently matched to the intended grade level to
least frequently matched shows a clear difference between standard statements intended for
Second grade and standard statements intended for Eighth grade. Table 4.24 shows a quartile
ranking of all the standard statements after they were ranked in order by percentage of most
frequently matched to least frequently matched. The data in this table is based on the assumption
that standard statements would be matched incorrectly at equal frequencies across grade levels.

Thus the total number of correctly matched standards statemetns should be proportionate across

Table 4.24 Distribution of standard statements by grade level and quartile.
Table 4.24 clearly shows the difference between the grade levels of the standard statements, but
especially between second grade and eighth grade. Table 4.24 shows that 20 of the 34 second
grade standard statements were in the top quartile of the correctly matched standards statements.
It also shows that 25 of the 44 eighth grade standard statements were in the bottom quartile. A
chi-square test indicates that the difference between the observed values and expected values is
significant at the 0.05 level (Chi squared = 68.2, df = 6, p < 0.05).
4.4.3 NBCTs’	  Ratings	  of	  Standard	  Statements	  as	  Important	  to	  Teach	  and	  Developmentally	  
Appropriate	  
The second part of the survey asked the participants to rank each standard statement as
“Important to Teach” and as “Developmentally Appropriate to Teach” at the intended grade
level. NBCT’s selected the grade level of the standard statements (2, 5, or 8) based on their own
evaluation of which grade level was closest to their level of expertise.

	  

164	  

	  
	  
This section discusses the standard statements from both the AASL and CCSS and how the
survey participants ranked the standard statements for their importance to teach at the particular
grade level and for the standard statements developmental appropriateness for the grade level.
The top ten and bottom ten results are reviewed at each of the three grade levels in the study.
The “Important to Teach” and “Developmentally Appropriate to Teach” were highly correlated
at each grade level. The final section at each grade level contains a scatter plot and a correlation
calculation for the two variables.
4.4.3.1 Standard	  Statements	  included	  in	  the	  Important	  to	  Teach	  and	  Developmentally	  
Appropriate	  Section	  of	  Survey	  
A total of 121 standard statements were included in this section of the survey. This number
differs from the number of standards (115) statements in the section of the survey where the
participants matched the standards to the grade level intended by the originators of the standards
statements. This difference is due to the duplication of some CCSS standard statements at
multiple grade levels. For the matching portion of the survey, standards were only included once
at the earliest intended grade level. Table 4.25 shows the number of standard statements included
in section two of the survey.

Developmentally	  Appropriate	  to	  Teach	  
Participants were asked to rate 35 Second grade standard statements for “Important to Teach” on
a scale of Strongly Disagree – Disagree – Agree – Strongly Agree. These statements were then
coded as 1 for Strongly Disagree, 2 for Disagree, 3 for Agree, and 4 for Strongly Agree. The 35
standard statements consisted of 26 (74%) from the AASL and 9 (26%) from the CCSS. Twentyseven of these grade 2 standard statements had an average score of 3.03 or high for “Importance
to Teach.” Only seven of the standard statements were scored below 3.0 and none were less than
2.0.
Standard Statements were also given a similar rating for the “Developmentally Appropriate to
Teach” at second grade. All of the top ten standard statements had a rating of 3.7 or higher. The
bottom ten scores in this category ranged from a low of 2.59 to 3.15. A total of seven of these
standard statements received a mean score below 3.0. Nine of the ten standard statements in this
list were from the AASL, while only one was from the CCSS.

Figure 4.7 shows a scatter plot comparing the mean scores of the Second grade standard

Participants were asked to rate the Fifth grade standard statements for both “Important to the
Teach” and “Developmentally Appropriate to Teach” on a scale of Strongly Disagree – Disagree
– Agree – Strongly Agree. These statements were then coded as 1 for Strongly Disagree, 2 for
Disagree, 3 for Agree, and 4 for Strongly Agree. There were a total of 40 Grade 5 standard
statements that were rated on the “Important to Teach” variable. All 40 were ranked at 3.13 or
higher. There were no standards below 3.0. The mean scores for the Grade 5 standard statements
being ranked on “Developmentally Appropriate to teach ranged from a high of 3.71 to a low of
3.09. Only seven of the standard statements had a survey respondent select “Strongly Disagree”
as a rating. These were seven different standard statements, thus 33 of the 40 standard statements
received nothing lower than a “Disagree” rating. The highest number of marks for the category
“Disagree” was five (out of 24).

Table 4.27 Correlation between Fifth Grade Appropriate to Teach and Important to
Teach.
The Fifth grade standards are not as highly correlated as the Second grade standards, yet there is
still a clear linear relationship.
4.4.3.6 Eighth	  Grade	  Standard	  Statements	  Rated	  as	  Important	  to	  Teach	  and	  
Developmentally	  Appropriate	  to	  Teach	  
The total number of standard statements rated by participants was 46. The standard statements
consisted of 28 from the AASL and 18 from the CCSS. The overall mean scores ranged from a
high of 3.81 to a low of 2.97 for “Important to Teach,” indicating virtually all participants
thought all the standards were important to teach at eighth grade. Six of the top ten standard
statements were from the AASL and four were from the CCSS. The bottom 10 standard
statements on “Important to Teach” for the Eighth grade had a mean score ranging from 3.23 to
2.97. Since 3.0 is equal to “Agree,” these scores indicate that virtually all of the survey
participants who ranked the Eighth grade standard statements, agreed with importance of
teaching the standard statements.
	  

170	  

	  
	  
The overall mean scores on the “Developmentally Appropriate to Teach” measurement ranged
from a high of 3.76 to a low of 3.13. The bottom ten scores range from a low of 3.13 to 3.33. Ten
of the standard statements received no scores of either Strongly Disagree or Disagreed and there
were only eight total scores of “strongly disagree” out of all 40 standard statements. Not a single
standard statement had a mean score of less than 3.13, thus indicating a rating of “Agree” for all
eighth grade standard statements as being developmentally appropriate. These findings sharply
contrast with the findings in the matching part of the survey where the Eighth grade standards
were matched at no better than random chance. This will be discussed more fully in Chapter
Five.

Figure 4.9 shows a scatter plot comparing the mean scores of the Eighth grade standard

from the scatter plot that the scores for these two variables move together, although, like the
Grade 5 means, they are not as aligned as the means of the Grade 2 standard statements.

4.5 Focus	  Groups	  	  
Four focus groups were held following collection of the survey data with a goal of providing
interpretation of and insight into the survey results. Twenty-one teachers participated in the focus
groups. A broad range of schools was represented both in terms of size and geographic location.
Teachers from schools in eastern Washington, (Kennewick and Riverside) western Washington
(Renton, Kirkland, and Issaquah), the Olympic Peninsula (Chimacum), Seattle, and north to the
Canadian border (Bellingham and Ferndale) were represented in the focus groups. Members of
the focus groups were recruited from the survey participants, thus all members of the focus
groups were National Board Certified Teachers. All four focus groups were conducted on-line
using Adobe Connect through the Information School of the University of Washington. The first
focus group was done using the visual and audio capabilities of Adobe Connect along with the
sharing of documents. Focus groups two, three, and four were done with all participants
communicating via text and with document sharing by the focus group facilitator. The change to
text-based rather than audio/video was made due to participants’ difficulties in manipulating the
Adobe Connect interface. Not all participants were able to use the audio and or video. In order to
not lose members of the focus group while the facilitator was trouble shooting audio/video
difficulties for one or two members, the facilitator decided to use the text only mode. The audio

from the first group was transcribed for analysis; the content from the other three focus groups
was in text format and thus did not need to be transcribed prior to analysis.

Table 4.32 May 5, 2014 Focus Group Members
4.5.2 Focus	  Group	  Findings	  
Focus group transcripts were analyzed and coded by the researcher. The purpose of the focus
groups was to serve an explanatory role for the findings from the survey of National Board
Certified Teachers.
One goal of the focus groups was to develop an explanation of why certain standards were
matched to the grade level intended by the authors of the standards at a high rate and why
teachers were unable to match other standard statements to their intended grade level. There
were several facets to the focus groups’ responses when this question was posed. The primary
answer was that standard statements that dealt with foundational skills (related descriptors
included “basic” and “concrete skills”) were placed at second grade. Standards that dealt with
more complex skills were often thought to belong at eighth grade. However, many of the eighth
grade standard statements were too vague or general for this pattern to work consistently, thus
	  

175	  

	  
	  
the eighth grade standard statements were difficult to match to their intended grade level. The
vague nature of some standard statements led some of the focus groups members to state that the
skill described in the standard statement was a skill they taught at second, fifth, or eighth grade.
The focus groups provided input on standard statements rankings as developmentally appropriate
or important to teach especially at second grade. The results of the survey indicated that, for both
the fifth and eighth grade standard statements, all the standard statements had overall rankings at
or above “2.97” (3 = Agree). This was true for both the developmentally appropriate and
important to teach categories. However, there were second grade standards that had a mean
score of less than three. The focus groups emphatically agreed that the standard statements
concerning social networking skills were inappropriate for second graders. Some members of the
focus group commented that parents would not approve of these skills even for fifth graders.
Focus groups members generally thought that the technology skills asked of second graders were
developmentally inappropriate. One focus group member commented that the use of technology
in testing is driving some skills to a lower grade level. Another focus group member said, “I
think about the fact that my second graders can’t learn to type until they know all of their
letters.” It appeared to focus group members that certain skills are migrating to lower grades
without thought as to whether or not the skills are developmentally appropriate at the lower
grades.
A finding that was not directly related to the research questions, but that came up consistently in
the focus groups, was that of equitable access to technology. The lack of equity has two sides to
it, one is the lack of resources in the schools, especially in the lower grade levels, to implement
the standard statements requiring technology. One focus group member said that the three
computer labs in her school (1000 students) were tied up for “much of the year” for testing
	  
176	  

	  
	  
puposes. The second side is the lack of technology in the homes of many students resulting in
many students needing to be taught basic computer skills before they can be taught the standard
statements’ skills involving technology.
Lastly, one comment from a focus group participant that stood out as a means for elucidating this
research project was, “However, shouldn’t everyone be able to understand and “match” and
make sense of the standards? Don’t we want parents to understand these standards, too, so that
they can further support their own child?”

4.6 Summary	  
This chapter has described the findings from all three phases of the research project. In the
qualitative analysis phase (Phase One) of the research project the lack of specific stages of the
Big6 information problem solving process (Task Definition (Stage 1), Information Seeking
Strategies (Stage 2), and Evaluation (Stage 6)) in the Common Core Standards Statements
indicate that the CCSS are lacking in important areas needed for a 21st century education. While
all six stages of the Big6 were present in the AASL, the standard statements were mostly
concentrated in Use of Information (Stage 4) and Synthesis (Stage 5), with both Task Definition
and Evaluation being present in less than 10% of the standard statements.
Additionally, findings from the content analysis of the standard statements indicated that 14.1%
of the AASL and 29.7% of the CCSS standard statements were rated as “Overly complex,
wording is confusing, or easily confuses the reader.” When looking at the number of tasks
involved in each standard statement, the research project found that the CCSS averaged 5.53
tasks per standard statement and the AASL had a means score of 2.91 tasks per standard
statement.
	  

177	  

	  
	  
The Phase Two survey results indicated that expert experienced teachers as represented by
NBCTs in the state of Washington could not consistently match randomized standard statement
to within two grade levels of the grade level intended by the standard statements authors. At the
eighth grade level, NBCTs matched the standard statements at a rate no better than random
chance (Table 4.17). The power of the mixed method design allows for bringing to bear
qualitative input to provide insight into the quantitative findings. In this case three findings from
the qualitative area of research appear applicable. First the focus group input indicated that the
second grade standards were easiest to place because they tended to deal with simpler tasks or
concepts. When these simpler tasks/concepts were viewed they were placed at second grade
(although the participants still matched 33% of the second grade standards to either fifth or
eighth grades). When more complex standards were seen on the survey, focus group members
reported that they thought, “my kids could do that with scaffolding” and so often identified the
standard statement as being appropriate for a lower grade. Secondly, the task count index showed
that the average standard statement had 3.7 separate tasks. This was another item the focus
groups identified as leading to confusion when asked to match the standard statements to the
intended grade level. Simply put, the high number of tasks contained by the standard statements
caused teachers to question what was really intended and thus uncertainty as to what grade level
to place it. Third, 59% of the standard statements were rated less than “clear and easy to
understand.” When these three findings are combined, it is perhaps not surprising that the
standards were not matched at a higher rate to the grade level intended. These findings offer
emphasis for Kendall’s (2001) advice to the authors of standards statements – be clear, be
precise.

	  

178	  

	  
	  
When asked to rate standard statements at their own grade level for both developmental
appropriateness and importance to teach, the NBCTs tended to agree with both the
developmental appropriateness and the importance to teach of the standard statements. The
exception was at second grade where seven standard statements averaged below a 3.0 (Agree)
rating for both importance to teach and developmental appropriateness. The focus groups did not
offer any insight here. Feedback from the focus groups on this portion of the survey centered
around the second grade standards that scored poorly in this area. The consensus of the focus
groups was that these items should not be at second grade. However, a possible explanation of
this discrepancy arises from the focus group finding that teachers believe with appropriate
scaffolding many of the items intended for higher grade levels can be taught to their students.
Thus when looking at standards which they told were from their grade level, they were generally
predisposed to agree with both the developmental appropriateness and the importance to teach.
Teasing out this discrepancy, where knowing the grade level of a standard statement led to
agreement with developmental appropriateness, while not knowing the intended grade level led
to placement at different grades, is an item for future investigation.
The four focus groups provided explanatory input regarding the survey results. Focus groups
indicated that the standard statements that referred to basic or foundational skills were the easiest
to match to the intended grade level. One reason standard statements were not placed as intended
by the authors of the standard statements was that the standard statements were vague or too
general and thus were often seen as being able to be taught at any level in the curriculum.

5. Discussion	  and	  Implications	  
5.1 Introduction	  
This study sought to examine the developmental differences in information problem solving in
school children as manifested in two sets of educational standards, those of the American
Association of School Librarians (AASL) and those of the Common Core State Standards
(CCSS). Standard statements from grades two, five, and eight were sorted into the stages of the
Big6 information problem solving model. A content analysis reviewed these standard statements
for clarity of writing and the number of tasks involved in each standard statement. The views of
expert, experienced practitioners were sought to see to what extent they agreed with the
developmental appropriateness and importance to teach of these standard statemetns. National
Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) in the state of Washington were chosen as representatives of
expert, experienced practitioners in the field of education. The NBCTs completed a survey that
aksed them to assign randomly sorted standards statements to the grade level intended by the
standard statements authors and in a separate section to indicate their level of agreement with the
developmental appropriateness and importanct to teach of standard statements nearest to their
grade level of expertise. Four focus groups, comprised of volunteers from the survey
respondents, provided explanatory information regarding the survey results.
This chapter is structured around the research questions and discusses each question in light of
the findings described in Chapter Four.
1. What developmental differences in information problem solving abilities are reflected in
educational standard statements as they relate to youth at different ages?

a. To what extent are the developmental differences in information problem solving
abilities reflected in educational standard statement as they relate to youth at
different ages consistent with the judgments of expert, experienced teachers?
b. To what degree do standards statements deal with a single concept?
c. To what extent does clarity of writing impact interpretation of standards
statements?
2. What developmental differences in information problem solving abilities do expert
practitioners identify as they relate to youth at different ages?
a. To what extent do expert practitioners agree with the grade level appropriateness
of individual education standards concerning information literacy?
b. To what extent do expert practitioners view the importance of individual
education standards concerning information literacy?
3. How do information problem solving abilities, at different developmental levels, as
reflected in educational standards (both subject area and information literacy), match
those identified by expert practitioners? What areas are aligned and where are the gaps?
All three phases of the study, the content analysis, the survey of NBCTs, and the results of the
focus groups, provide data for addressing the three sets of questions. Overall, the study found
that educators did not consistently agree with the developmental levels assigned to information
problem solving standards identified by AASL or CCSS. Additional key findings include the
following points.
	  

181	  

	  
	  
•

Standard statements are of uneven quality, often leading to confusion among teachers.

•

Specific standard statements frequently include more than one task or item (overall mean
= 3.7; AASL mean = 2.9; CCSS mean = 5.5) which was both confusing and made the
standard statements difficult to analyze from a developmental perspective.

•

Consensus among subjects as to grade level appropriateness is highest (67%) for
standards designated for second grade but decreases for those targeted for fifth grade
(49%). Eighth grade standards were not matched to the intended grade level at a rate any
better than chance (29%).

•

Standard statements as currently written are insufficient to prepare students for the needs
of the 21st century as they inadequately cover the full information problem-solving
process, especially task definition and evaluation.

•

Teachers believe standard statements should be clearly written and easily understandable
for non-educators, including parents and students.

5.2 RQ	  1.	  What	  developmental	  differences	  in	  information	  problem	  solving	  abilities	  
are	  reflected	  in	  educational	  standard	  statements	  as	  they	  relate	  to	  youth	  at	  
different	  ages?	  
The analysis of the standard statements took multiple forms. First, all standard statements at
grades two, five, and eight from the AASL and CCSS were analyzed to determine whether or not
each standard statement fit into a stage of the Big6 information problem and if so what stage.
Second, the standard statements that fit into a Big6 stage were analyzed for the number of tasks
each standard statement contained, the clarity of writing for each statement was rated and finally
the readability of the standard statements were assessed using the Dale-Chall Readability
	  

182	  

	  
	  
formula. Additional information on the NBCTs views of the developmental appropriateness was
obtained from the survey results and from responses in the focus groups.
RQ 1 has three sub-questions that are discussed below and will be summarized in section 5.2.4
5.2.1 Research	  Question	  1,	  Sub-­‐question	  1:	  
To what extent are the developmental differences in information problem solving abilities
reflected in educational standard statements as they relate to youth at different ages consistent
with the judgments of expert, experienced teachers?
All three phases of the research process provided insight into this question. The results of the
survey indicate that there is inconsistency between the views of the educational establishment, as
represented by the standard statements, and the views of expert, experienced teachers, as
represented by NBCTs. The NBCTs were able to match grade two standard statements to the
grade level intended by the authors of the standard statements only 67% of the time. In other
words, expert, experienced teachers who have received National Board certification failed to
agree with the intended grade level of second grade standards 33% of the time when the other
two choices for grade levels were three grade levels (grade five) and six grade levels (grade
eight) away. As the grade level increased to 5th grade the NBCTs matched only 49%, and at 8th
grade, the standard statements were matched at no better than random chance, 29%. On this
measure it appears that there is some agreement at grade two (but again, not for 1/3 of the
standards analyzed), but agreement decreases as grade level, and supposedly cognitive difficulty,
increases, until at eighth grade, it is difficult to say any agreement exists between expert,
experienced teachers and the authors of educational standards.

	  

183	  

	  
	  
National Board Certified Teachers are expert and experienced practitioners. They have the
highest level of certification available to teachers in the state of Washington and in the nation.
This is an important point to remember. It is not possible to say whether the standards are
“incorrectly” designated by the AASL or CCSS authors or that the NBCTs are unable to identify
the appropriate grade level for tasks contained in the standard statements. Both groups, the
authors of the standard statements and the NBCTs, have their areas of expertise, neither group is
necessarily wrong, but we do have evidence that at grades 2, 5, and 8 there is a great deal of
disagreement.
However, when NBCTs were directly asked to rate the standard statements that were closest to
the grade level they taught, they generally selected “Agree” to “Strongly Agree” for
“Developmental Appropriateness” and “Importance to Teach.” These two findings are
contradictory and point towards issues of clarity of writing in the standard statements and the
context of the presentation of the standard statements. NBCTs had difficulty identifying the
standard statements to within three or six grade levels (i.e. second to fifth, fifth to eighth, or
second to eighth) when examined in random order, but when examined at grade level, only a few
(seven) standard statements at second grade and only one at fifth and eighth grade had a mean
rating of less than 3.0 “Agree.” Input from the focus groups indicated that both clarity of writing
and being out of context6 were issues with sorting the standard statements into the appropriate
grade level. The focus groups provided no feedback on what would be a wide enough grade level
spread to be able to place the standard statements into the appropriate grade level. Additionally,
as mentioned in Chapter 4, feedback from the focus groups indicated that teachers are disposed

particular	  grade	  level.	  	  
	  
184	  

	  
	  
to think they can teach many items to their own students with appropriate scaffolding. Thus
being told the grade level may have led teachers to think, “This is an item I could teach my
students by differentiating instruction and providing the necessary scaffolding.”
The content analysis found that standard statements are not clearly articulated with regards to
information literacy skills. A concept or specific skill in a standard statement at second grade is
not necessarily continued at increasing levels of difficulty in the higher grades. This makes it
difficult to examine one concept or skill from second grade to fifth grade to eighth grade and
judge the level of increasing difficulty. As a result, it cannot be said that developmental
differences in problem solving abilities are consistently reflected in standard statements.
Focus group comments supported this. One participant, a seventh grade teacher, commented, “It
is interesting to me that at the elementary level, the CCSS seems SO rigorous, but at the 8th
grade level seems still so basic.”
The content analysis found that the standard statements do not consistently articulate a clear
series of increasingly challenging steps in information problem solving ability of students.
NBCTs could not consistently place randomized standards at the intended grade level, yet
considered standards at their own grade level to be appropriate to teach. Considering these
inconsistencies, it must be reported that there appears to be limited agreement between expert,
experienced teachers and the standard statements concerning developmental differences in
information problem solving abilities when the teachers do not know the intended grade level.
When it is clear to teachers what the grade level is they agreed with the developmental
appropriateness of the standard statements. However, when NBCTs do not know the grade level
in advance, when they are asked to place random standard statements standing alone into the
	  

185	  

	  
	  
intended grade level, the teachers had quite different ideas about where the standard statements
should be placed. These findings point to a need for further research. For instance, how would
expert experienced teachers rate the developmental appropriateness of eighth grade standards if
they were presented as either fifth grade standards or second grade standards? Would NBCTs be
able to correctly sort standards that were separated by four or five grade levels instead of three?
5.2.2 Research	  Question	  1,	  Sub-­‐question	  2:	  
To what degree do standard statements deal with a single concept?
Determining the number of tasks in each standard statement was the method used to
operationalize this question. Multiple coders reviewed the standard statements and counted the
tasks. The Common Core standard statements that were a part of the survey of NBCTs had a
mean of 5.5 separate tasks per standard statement. The AASL standards had a mean of 2.9. The
combined standard statements had a mean of 3.7 tasks per standard statement. Counting the
number of tasks in each standard statement is only a rough approximation of the number of
concepts involved in each standard statement. It was chosen because it was an objective way of
determining the number of different activities involved in a standard statement.
Kendall argues there is no “grain size” of a benchmark that can be described in absolute terms.
Benchmarks according to Kendall should, “be specific enough that readers are clear about the
instruction and learning it should entail, but not so narrow as to prescribe the day-to-day
curriculum nor so broad that the knowledge and skills it describes could be open to numerous
equally valid interpretations” (2001, p. 3).
The CCSS’ average number of tasks appears to exceed Kendall’s statement while the fewer
number of tasks in the AASL standard statements is more in keeping with this guideline. Focus
	  

186	  

	  
	  
group feedback indicated that the issue of multiple tasks in the standard statements was a key
factor in not being able to identify the intended grade level of a standard statement. The number
of tasks involved led to confusion concerning what was the main activity the standard statement
was asking students to do.
5.2.3 Research	  Question	  1,	  Sub-­‐question	  3:	  
To what extent does clarity of writing impact interpretation of standard statements?
The writing of the standard statements was analyzed for clarity through three separate methods.
First, the standard statements were analyzed for their reading level utilizing the New Dale-Chall
reading formula. Second the standard statements were analyzed for the number of tasks each one
contained. And, third the standard statements were given a clarity rating by the analysis team
members.
The findings from the three methods provided information from different viewpoints. The DaleChall reading formula is meant for blocks of text not short sentences, thus not all of the standard
statements returned a Dale-Chall score. Lumping the standard statements together and analyzing
them in a group resulted in a score of 8.6, grades 11-12, for the Common Core standard
statements and a score of 9.2, grades 13-15, for the AASL standard statements. The grade levels
should be well within the reading capability of NBCTs and thus does not provide evidence that
there is an issue with the clarity of the standards. If the standard statements are to be
comprehensible to parents and students, these reading levels may be too high.
The second method of analyzing the standards for clarity was coding the statements for clarity.
Each of the standard statements were coded by two different coders on a three-point scale for
clarity (see Table 4.32). These scores were then correlated with each standard statements number
	  

187	  

	  
	  
of correct matches from the survey of NBCTs. The correlation coefficient was, calculating using
Spearman’s coefficient, 0.123, indicating little correlation between the two variables.
However, while there is no statistical correlation between the results of the survey and the clarity
and task count measures, there is a qualitative argument to be made based on the frequency
counts of standard statements that were rated at less than clear and easily understood. All
standard statements should be clear, well written and easily understandable (Kendall, 2001). As
was pointed out in the focus groups, standard statements should be comprehensible to those who
are not professional educators, especially parents and students. Table 4.9 (page 146) indicates
issues with both sets of standard statement. The AASL has a total of 52 out of 85 (61%)
standards rated at two or one, and 12, or 14%, were rated as a one. The CCSS has a slightly
smaller percentage at two or one combined, 54% (20 out of 37), but has over double the AASL
percentage (29%) ranked at one. Because there are a high number of standard statements that are
ranked at less than, “clear and easy to understand,” unclear writing can be said to have negatively
impacted the standard statements.
In planning this study it was thought that the data related to answering this research question
would come from the qualitative analysis of the standards. In retrospect it would have been an
excellent question to ask on the survey. The question was raised in the focus groups and all the
focus groups affirmed that the clarity of writing was an important component of the difficulty in
interpreting the standard statements.
Issues having to do with the clarity of the standard statements were a key area of reasons for the
lack of agreement on grade level placement that emerged from the focus groups discussions.
When asked what qualities of the standard statements made the standard statements the most
	  

188	  

	  
	  
difficult to match to the intended grade level, focus group members indicated the following
issues with the clarity of the standard statements, multiple tasks in one standard statement, the
task in the standard statement was unclear, the standard statement itself was confusingly written,
the standard statement could be applied to multiple grade levels, scaffolding could make the skill
in the standard statement applicable to an earlier grade level, no skill level was indicated leading
to confusion over whether the standard statement was meant to introduce a skill or to develop
mastery, the standard statement was too general, and finally, the skill described was not specific
to one grade level.
5.2.4 RQ	  1	  Summary	  
Limited agreement on matching standard statements to their intended grade level, multiple tasks
in each standard statement, unclear writing, and inconsistencies in the task/s being required
indicate that developmental differences in information problem solving skills are not clearly
reflected in these two sets of standards statements. As a result educators are frequently confused
concerning what the standard statements intend and what grade level the standard statements are
intended.

5.3 RQ	  2.	  What	  developmental	  differences	  in	  information	  problem	  solving	  abilities	  
do	  expert	  practitioners	  identify	  as	  they	  relate	  to	  youth	  at	  different	  ages?	  
The research project examined this question in two ways. First, the question was addressed by
the NBCTs participating in the survey who were asked to match the randomized standard
statements to their intended grade level. Second, the question was directly addressed by asking
the NBCTs to rate the standard statements at their grade level on both “importance to teach” and
“developmental appropriateness” on a four point scale, “Strongly Disagree,” “Disagree,”

	  

189	  

	  
	  
“Agree,” to “Strongly Agree.” The RQ 2 sub-questions will be addressed simultaneously as the
results were similar. Section 5.3.3 will provide a summary response to RQ 2.
5.3.1 Research	  Question	  2,	  Sub	  question	  1:	  
To what extent do expert practitioners agree with the grade level appropriateness of individual
education standards concerning information literacy?
5.3.2 Research	  Question	  2,	  Sub	  question	  2:	  
To what extent do expert practitioners view the importance of individual education standards
concerning information literacy?
When asked to rate standards statements on a four point scale ranging from Strongly Disagree,
Disagree, Agree, to Strongly Agree, teachers generally chose “Agree” to “Strongly Agree” for
both the importance to teach and the developmental appropriateness of the individual standard
statements from both sets of standards for both grades five and eight. Grade two results were
more mixed with 7 of 34 or 20.5% of the standard statements receiving an average score of less
than three (see the Appendices for full lists of rankings at each grade level). No standard
statement had a majority of responses in the combined “Strongly Disagree” and “Disagree”
categories, and only one had a plurality of responses in these two categories. The lowest scoring
second grade standard statement was the same for both “developmentally appropriate to teach”
and “important to teach.” This AASL standard statement was, “Use social networks and
information tools to gather and share information. Experiment with online catalog and Web
resources to locate information.” All four focus groups expressed concerns about second graders
(or fifth graders) using social media, did not think it was developmentally appropriate, and thus
was not important to teach.
	  

190	  

	  
	  
At the same time, NBCTs matched these same standards to their intended grade levels at only
67% of the time for second grade, 49% of the time for fifth grade, and 29% for the time for
eighth grade.
5.3.3 Research	  Question	  2	  Summary	  
These two portions of the survey show a disconnect between the NBCT’s abilities to match the
standard statements to the intended grade level and then looking at standard statements at their
own grade level and consistently rating these same standards as important to teach and
developmentally appropriate. Focus group comments indicated that being out of context was one
issue with placing the standards at their intended grade level. Being out of context does not
wholly explain the survey results as NBCTs were much more able, regardless of grade level,
taught to place grade two standard statements at the intended grade level and much less able to
place grade eight standard statements at the grade level intended by the authors of the standard
statements. These contradictory findings indicate an area for further research that will be
discussed more fully below. One of the basic assumptions in this research project is that standard
statements should be written clearly enough that expert, experienced teachers (NBCTs) can tell
the difference between standards that are aimed at grade levels three years apart. The
inconsistent findings of the survey indicate that this assumption may be incorrect. However, the
qualitative portion of the research indicated that many of the standard statements are unclearly
written and contain multiple tasks which made the standard statements difficult to place at a
grade level. These issues confound the findings and point to the standard statements as the source
of the inconsistencies.
This research project has identified inconsistencies in both the NBCTs responses and the clarity
of the standards statements. At this time it is not possible to say whether the inconsistencies in
	  

191	  

	  
	  
the NBCTs’ agreement with the developmental appropriateness of the standard statements are
due to the standard statements lack of clarity and inappropriate grade level placement, or if this
task of matching randomized standard statements is beyond the ability of expert experienced
teachers. However, regardless of the NBCT’s ability to place the standards at the intended grade
level, this research does show that standard statements contain multiple issues that should be
corrected if they are to clearly communicate to all stakeholders what students in grades two, five
and eight should be capable of doing when addressing information literacy problems.

5.4 Research	  Question	  3.	  How	  do	  information	  problem	  solving	  abilities,	  at	  different	  
developmental	  levels,	  as	  reflected	  in	  educational	  standards	  (both	  subject	  area	  
and	  information	  literacy),	  match	  those	  identified	  by	  expert	  practitioners?	  What	  
areas	  are	  aligned	  and	  where	  are	  the	  gaps?	  
NBCTs had the greatest agreement with the standard statements at grade two when asked to
match randomized standard statements, while they were only able to match eighth grade standard
statements at a level equivalent only to random chance. Based on this one could say that the
NBCTs had the greatest agreement with the placement of information problem solving abilities
at second grade. However as pointed out above, the second grade standard statements also had
the greatest number of standard statements that NBCTs disagreed with the developmental
appropriateness when asked directly about each standard statement and NBCTs overwhelmingly
marked grade five and grade eight standard statements as being appropriate to teach and
developmentally appropriate.
These contradictory findings and the focus groups both indicate that viewing the standard
statements out of context as one potential cause of the inconsistencies. However, if standard
statements are going to follow a spiraling pattern of increasing difficulty, of the same tasks
becoming increasingly more complex as students revisit the task at successive grade levels, then
	  

192	  

	  
	  
standard statements should clearly express this increasing difficulty. And, if this increasing
difficulty is clearly expressed, expert experienced teachers should be able to differentiate
between standard statements three and six grade levels apart. Since this was not the case, we are
led back to the finding of the content analysis and focus groups that the standard statements’
number of tasks and clarity of writing were issues that led to confusion over the intent of the
standard statements.

5.5 Additional	  Findings	  	  
This section describes findings from the research project that go beyond addressing the main
research questions. All three phases of the research project provided findings that provided
information that exceeded the research questions. This section describes those findings.
5.5.1 Strengths	  of	  the	  AASL	  and	  CCSS	  Standard	  Statements	  
The analysis of standard statements from the AASL and CCSS provided insights into the general
strengths and weaknesses of both the CCSS and AASL standard statements beyond
developmental appropriateness.
All six stages of the Big6 information problem solving process were represented in the AASL
standard statements. The Big6 stage of Synthesis was well represent in both the CCSS and in the
AASL standard statements.
5.5.2 Limitations	  of	  the	  AASL	  and	  CCSS	  Standard	  Statements	  
The three stages of Task Definition, Information Seeking Strategies and Evaluation were found
to be missing from the CCSS and disproportionately limited in the AASL.

	  

193	  

	  
	  
5.5.2.1 Inadequate	  Coverage	  of	  the	  Information	  Problem	  Solving	  Process	  
Cognitive Psychology defines problem-solving as having four basic elements: a goal, obstacles
preventing one from achieving the goal, strategies for overcoming the obstacles, and an
evaluation of the process, i.e., was the goal achieved (DeLoache et al., 1998). This definition of
problem-solving can be mapped to the information problem-solving model. Equating the goal to
the recognition that information is needed, the obstacles are the need to locate, evaluate, and use
information, the strategies are the acts of locating, evaluating and using information and the final
phase, evaluation, remains the same as in the Cognitive Psychology model, describing the
evaluation of the process and the product. This research project, as noted earlier, has
operationalized the information problem solving process through the application of the Big6
information problem-solving method. This research project’s analysis of the standard statements
from the CCSS and the AASL found the three stages, Task Definition, Information Seeking
Strategies, and Evaluation were completely missing in the CCSS. These same stages were
underrepresented in the AASL standard statements. As a result the standard statements from both
the AASL and CSS may be inadequate for preparing students for a 21st century education/world.
5.5.2.2 Lack	  of	  Task	  Definition	  
Two of the four steps as defined by Cognitive Psychology in problem solving are identifying the
problem and evaluating success of solution and the process. According to Eisenberg &
Berkowitz (Eisenberg & Berkowitz, 1990): “Most people spend too little time on task definition.
The tendency is to push ahead even though they have only a general or vague understanding of
what it is they are seeking to accomplish. By spending time considering the information problem
and then articulating a clear understanding of (a) the information problem and (b) specific
information needs related to that problem, people can move much more efficiently toward
	  

194	  

	  
	  
solutions” (p. 6). Skill at the initial stage of the information problem-solving process is crucial to
success, and that difficultly at this stage typically leads to inefficient and ineffective information
behaviors in later stages of seeking, search, and use.
5.5.2.3 Lack	  of	  Evaluation	  
There is little attention paid to the culminating stage of the entire process – Evaluation. This is a
key stage in which students decide whether or not the problem has been successfully solved and
how successful they were in information problem-solving as a whole as well as in accomplishing
each individual stage of the process. This differs from the concept of evaluation of information.
“Evaluating information” is part of every stage of the information problem-solving process:
determining the nature and scope of information as part of task definition, assessing various
sources in information seeking strategies and also in location and access, considering accuracy,
credibility, usefulness, and relevance in use of information, choosing and presenting information
in synthesis, and evaluating information as part of assessing the product and the process.
5.5.3 Summary	  of	  Limitations	  of	  AASL	  and	  CCSS	  Standard	  Statements	  
The Partnership for 21st Century Skills (2009) argues that information literacy should be explicit
in educational policy documents in order to prepare students for the future. The CCSS wholly
lack three of the six stages of the Big6 information problem solving process, and both of the key
stages of task definition and evaluation are underrepresented in the AASL standard statements.
Thus both these policy documents may be inadequate for preparing students for the 21st century.
Additionally it is recommended that any set of standard statements should explicit address all
stages of the information problem solving process.

	  

195	  

	  
	  
5.5.4 Additional	  Findings	  from	  Focus	  Groups	  of	  National	  Board	  Certified	  Teachers	  
Four focus groups of NBCTs were convened. This section discusses the insights gained from the
discussions with these expert, experienced practitioners.
5.5.4.1 Equity	  issues	  
Teachers in the focus groups expressed concerns that both sets of the standards lead to issues
dealing with equitable access to technology. Many schools do not have the computer resources
necessary for all their students to have the access these teachers see as necessary to develop
competency in the skills demanded by the standards. Concern was expressed about the necessity
of third graders doing keyboarding as part of an assessment.
5.5.4.2 The	  Need	  to	  Think	  About	  Standards	  as	  a	  Continuum	  
Many teachers expressed the idea that the standard statements describing tasks for older children
(8th grade) were tasks that the students in their classrooms (2nd grade/3rd grade) could accomplish
with the appropriate guidance. Some of these standard statements teachers simply thought of as
misplaced, but other standard statements were viewed as a continuum in which mastery would be
reached at higher grades and the standards would be introduced in earlier grades. This suggests
that the organizations constructing standard statements may want to consider removing grade
level benchmarks/indicators and publish the standards as a continuum with increasing difficulty
and mastery expected at the conclusion of the continuum.

5.6 Project	  Limitations	  	  
This research study was limited to two sets of standards, the CCSS and the AASL. While these
are important educational policy documents, the CCSS setting English/Language Arts and
Mathematical standards for 43 states and the AASL setting information literacy standards for
	  

196	  

	  
	  
Teacher/Librarians and schools, there are other important sets of standards that were not
addressed. Other content area organizations, such as the National Council for the Social Studies
(NCSS), the International Society for Technical Education (ISTE), the National Council of
Teachers of English (NCTE) and the have written standard statements that remain to be
examined for their coverage of the information problem solving process. Additionally this study
was limited to grades two, five, and eight. These grades were chosen because these are the
grades at which the AASL sets benchmarks and with the assumption that the separation in grade
levels was great enough that expert, experienced practitioners, such as NBCTs, would be able to
discern the difference between standard statements at a high level. The high school benchmarks
were not examined in either the AASL of the CCSS. The information problem solving process
may be more fully developed in those grade levels.
Only teachers who are National Board certified in the state of Washington were asked to
complete the survey and to participate in the focus groups. Thus this study is unable to generalize
beyond that group of teachers or beyond the state of Washington.
The survey response rate was also a limitation of this research. A total of 96 completed surveys
were submitted. The population of NBCTs in the desired certification areas was 3774. This is a
response rate of 2.5%. However, as the survey took approximation 40-50 minutes to complete,
the results represent over 70 hours of input from NBCTs.
A significant limitation in trying to assess the standard statements as a method of demonstrating
a coherent pattern of increasing cognitive difficulty as grade levels increased was that standard
statements were not able to be consistently matched to the Big6 across grade levels. This made it

	  

197	  

	  
	  
impossible to determine if all stages of the information problem solving tasks had incremental
steps in becoming more challenging as grade level increased.

5.7 Future	  Work	  
Standard statements were presented out of context in the matching portion of the survey and the
focus groups indicated this was a cause of difficulty in matching the standard statements to their
intended grade levels. Future research could try to account for this by showing teachers all the
standard statement in a given strand in random order, and then asking them to sort those into the
intended grade level order.
Teachers responses tended to range from “Agree” to “Strongly Agree” in the survey portion
asking them whether standards at their own grade level were “Developmentally Appropriate”
and “Important to Teach.” Yet at the same time they did no better than random chance at
identifying eighth grade standard statements when those standard statements were presented in
random order and mixed with second and fifth grade standard statements. Future research could
include a controlled experiment with teachers in order to more fully examine this phenomena.
The lack of consistency between NBCTs and the standard statements also points to the need for
research in classrooms with children of differing ages/grade levels in order to seek out
differences in children’s information problem solving abilities through collecting empirical
evidence. This evidence would also provide data that would go towards constructing an
empirically based developmental theory of information problem solving

5.8 Contributions	  	  
This research project makes contributions in the following areas: theory, methodology, and
pedagogy.
	  

198	  

	  
	  
5.8.1 Theoretical	  contributions	  
This research, through identifying areas of alignment and also areas where gaps exist between
expert practitioners’ judgments and educational standards, demonstrates the need for the
establishment of a developmental theory of information problem solving. There is currently no
developmental theory of information problem solving skills. Such a theory could be used both to
inform practice and to guide the authorship of education standard statements that establish the
curriculum for information problem solving in schools. A developmental theory of information
problem solving would help to align the knowledge of both the authors of standard statements
and that of the practitioners who implement these standard statements..
As mentioned above in section 5.7, this project points to the need for more empirical data to be
collected on children’s’ abilities to solve information problems across differing ages. The
differences found between the authors of the standard statements and the capability of NBCTs to
place those standard statements at the intended grade level, indicates a need for more in-depth
study of how children’s abilities to solve information problems changes as they mature.
5.8.2 Methodological	  contributions	  
A second area is a methodological contribution. Focus groups have been used as a source of data
for a variety of topics in information science, but not for determining appropriate developmental
levels of educational standards for information literacy. The focus groups in this research utilized
NBCTs, as opposed to Library Media Specialists or Technology Educators. This is similar to
research done by Gullikson (2006) in higher education but not previously done in information
problem solving at these grade levels.

	  

199	  

	  
	  
Using NBCTs to sort random standard statements is an additional methodological contribution.
NBCTs have been used in other research studies but this appears to be one of the first in a study
on information literacy standards. Additionally, although there is anecdotal evidence of sorting
random standard statements as a workshop activity to familiarize teachers with standard
statements, this appears to be a novel way of gathering evidence about the match between expert,
experienced teachers’ view of the appropriate grade level of the standard statements versus that
of the grade level intended by the authors of the standard statements.
5.8.3 Pedagogical	  contributions	  
Third, the research indicates areas where the views of expert, experienced teachers tend to agree
that the grade levels of standard statements are appropriate, providing evidence validating some
of the information literacy standard statements. This provides support for instructional practices
based on current standard statements where there was agreement between the authors of the
standard statements and the NBCTs. The research also reveals inconsistencies between the views
of expert, experienced teachers and the authors of the standard statements, indicating areas for
further research.

5.9 Conclusions	  and	  Recommendations	  
There is considerable disagreement by expert educators concerning the concerning appropriate
children’s developmental levels designated in the the standard statements from the AASL and
the CCSS related to information problem solving. NBCTs failed to consistently match the
standards to the intended grade level. NBCTs lacked agreement at all levels and at grade eight
matching was equivalent to random chance. This raises the question of whether this
inconsistency in designated developmental levels is a due to problems with the standards or with
the teachers. When asked to directly judge standards designated for their grade levels, teachers
	  
200	  

	  
	  
generally agree that the standard statements are developmentally appropriate. The NBCTs rated
80% of the Second grade standard statements at “Agree” or “Strongly Agree” for developmental
appropriateness. Only one standard from Eighth grade scored less than 3.0, “Agree” and at 2.97
this would round up to a score of 3.0 and be seen as a rating of “Agree,” and no standard
statements from Fifth grade received a mean score of less than “Agree.” This discrepancy may
also be a factor of the research design, i.e., the way in which teachers were presented with the
standards and asked to judge. That is, when the expert teachers were not given any indication of
developmental designation of standards statements, there was inconsistency and disagreement
with the designations. When the expert teachers were asked a more narrow task—to judge
developmental appropriateness for specific standard statements designated for their grade levels,
they agreed 80% of the time at Second grade and nearly 100% of the time at Fifth and Eighth
grades.
This research project does not provide an answer to whether the discrepancy between NBCTs
sorting random standard statements and the more narrow task of judging developmental
appropriateness at the NBCTs own grade level. There are several potential reasons for this. First
the research design, in which NBCTs were told the standards wer from a particular grade level.
This may have predisposed them to agree with that assessment. Second, when examining the
standard statements in random order, the lack of context may have made it too difficult to
accurately place the standards. And third, the issues surrounding clarity and the number of tasks
may have also been too large an obstacle to overcome in attempting to match the standard
statements to their intended grade level.
The quantitative portion of this research leaves questions that require further research to resolve.
However the qualitative portion of this mixed method research process provides information
	  
201	  

	  
	  
supplementing the quantitative results. The content analysis and focus groups findings indicate
that the standard statements studied in this research project have several limitations. These
limitations are independent of the findings that discrepancies in the NBCTs’ ratings of the
developmental appropriateness of the standard statements. The standard statements:
•

Inadequately cover the full information problem-solving process.

•

Frequently are not clearly written and thus may be difficult for all stakeholders to
understand.

•

Contain multiple tasks resulting in confusion over the primary task and meaning adding
to the confusion caused by unclear writing.

In sum, the standards statements as written are likely to be insufficient to prepare students for the
needs of the 21st century.
This work points to the need 1) for the entire information problem-solving process to be
explicitly included in national policy documents such as the CCSS and the AASL standards, so
that the component skills of information literacy can be consistently reflected in and taught from
standards statements for each grade level in increasing complexity; and 2) for greater
collaboration between the writers of standards statements and classroom teachers with the aim of
creating standard statements that are comprehensible to all stakeholders, including parents and
students.

Target	  Success:	  Common	  Core	  &	  AASL	  Standards	  
	  
1	  This	  is	  a	  survey	  on	  information	  literacy	  standards	  from	  the	  Common	  Core	  State	  
Standards	  and	  the	  American	  Association	  of	  School	  Librarians.	  Thank	  you	  for	  your	  input.	  If	  
you	  include	  your	  contact	  information,	  I	  will	  include	  you	  in	  the	  drawing	  for	  the	  gift	  cards	  
that	  are	  an	  incentive	  for	  those	  completing	  the	  survey.	  Contact	  information	  is	  completely	  
voluntary.	  I	  anticipate	  this	  survey	  will	  take	  30	  -­‐	  45	  minutes	  to	  complete.	  I	  realize	  this	  is	  a	  
lot	  of	  time	  to	  ask,	  but	  I	  think	  getting	  National	  Board	  Certified	  Teachers	  input	  on	  an	  aspect	  of	  
the	  Common	  Core	  State	  Standards	  is	  quite	  important.	  You	  may	  stop	  the	  survey	  at	  any	  time	  
and	  continue	  later.	  The	  survey	  software	  automatically	  saves	  your	  answers.	  However	  for	  
this	  function	  to	  work	  properly	  you	  need	  to	  resume	  the	  survey	  using	  the	  same	  computer	  
and	  browser.

PURPOSE	  AND	  BENEFITS	  The	  primary	  purpose	  of	  this	  study	  is	  to	  evaluate	  the	  grade	  level	  
appropriateness	  of	  educational	  standards	  related	  to	  Information	  Problem	  Solving	  from	  the	  
CCSS	  and	  the	  AASL	  from	  the	  perspective	  of	  expert,	  experienced	  teachers.	  Information	  
Problem	  Solving	  has	  been	  defined	  as	  the	  process	  of	  identifying	  and	  locating,	  evaluating,	  and	  
using	  information	  necessary	  to	  solve	  a	  problem.	  One	  way	  of	  looking	  at	  Information	  
Problem	  Solving	  is	  to	  think	  of	  the	  process	  students	  go	  through	  when	  they	  conduct	  a	  
research	  project.	  A	  second	  purpose	  of	  this	  study	  is	  to	  evaluate	  the	  importance	  of	  individual	  
standards	  based	  on	  the	  views	  of	  expert,	  experienced	  teachers.	  The	  anticipated	  benefits	  of	  
this	  study	  include	  understanding	  what	  developmental	  differences	  can	  be	  identified	  in	  
information	  literacy	  abilities	  of	  children	  of	  different	  ages.	  This	  research	  will,	  by	  identifying	  
areas	  of	  alignment	  and	  areas	  where	  gaps	  exist	  between	  expert	  practitioners’	  judgments	  
and	  educational	  standards,	  begin	  to	  make	  a	  contribution	  towards	  the	  establishment	  of	  a	  
developmental	  theory	  of	  information	  problem	  solving.	  Identifying	  areas	  of	  agreement	  
indicates	  where	  there	  are	  good	  indicators	  of	  the	  skills	  students	  are	  capable	  of	  at	  a	  
particular	  grade	  level.	  Identifying	  areas	  of	  disagreement	  provides	  an	  opportunity	  for	  
further	  research	  to	  delve	  into	  what	  capabilities	  are	  at	  this	  point.	  There	  is	  currently	  no	  
developmental	  theory	  of	  information	  problem	  solving	  skills,	  and	  this	  research	  will	  inform	  a	  
discussion	  on	  what	  a	  theory	  might	  look	  like.	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
PROCEDURES	  This	  survey	  asks	  you	  to	  rate	  the	  developmental	  level	  and	  importance	  of	  
standard	  statements	  associated	  with	  information	  problem	  solving	  from	  both	  the	  CCSS	  and	  
the	  AASL.	  Since	  standards	  statements	  are	  written	  for	  individual	  grade	  levels,	  an	  
assumption	  behind	  this	  survey	  is	  that	  if	  standards	  statements	  are	  clear	  and	  well	  written,	  
expert,	  experienced	  teachers	  will	  be	  able	  to	  identify	  the	  appropriate	  grade	  level	  within	  one	  
to	  two	  grade	  levels.	  The	  survey	  consists	  of	  three	  parts.	  	  In	  the	  part	  A	  of	  this	  survey	  you	  are	  
presented	  standards	  statements	  from	  grades	  2,	  5,	  and	  8.	  These	  standards	  have	  been	  sorted	  
randomly.	  Your	  task	  is	  to	  choose	  the	  earliest	  appropriate	  grade	  level	  that	  you	  believe	  the	  
standards	  statement	  is	  developmentally	  appropriate	  to	  teach.	  You	  are	  also	  asked	  to	  provide	  
a	  ranking	  of	  your	  confidence	  in	  your	  grade	  level	  rating.	  In	  part	  B	  of	  the	  survey,	  you	  are	  
asked	  to	  pick	  the	  most	  appropriate	  grade	  level	  band	  (2,	  5,	  or	  8)	  to	  your	  own	  level	  of	  
teaching	  and	  rate	  the	  standards	  statements	  from	  that	  grade	  level	  band	  for	  1)	  
developmental	  appropriateness	  for	  teaching	  at	  that	  grade	  level;	  and	  (2)	  importance	  of	  
teaching	  at	  that	  grade	  level	  for	  each	  standards	  statement.	  In	  part	  C,	  you	  are	  asked	  for	  some	  
demographic	  data	  to	  help	  us	  categorize	  responses	  to	  the	  survey.	  In	  this	  part	  you	  may	  
provide	  your	  name	  and	  an	  email	  address	  if	  you	  wish	  to	  be	  included	  in	  a	  drawing	  for	  a	  $50	  
gift	  certificate	  for	  participating	  in	  the	  survey.	  There	  will	  be	  one	  $50	  gift	  certificate	  for	  every	  
100	  respondents	  (up	  to	  a	  total	  of	  10	  gift	  certificates).	  You	  will	  also	  be	  asked	  if	  you	  would	  be	  
willing	  to	  participate	  in	  a	  follow	  up	  focus	  group.	  These	  focus	  groups	  will	  provide	  additional	  
feedback	  on	  the	  results	  of	  the	  survey.	  	  Agreeing	  to	  participate	  in	  a	  focus	  group	  will	  also	  
require	  providing	  your	  name	  and	  contact	  information.	  The	  researcher	  anticipates	  being	  
able	  to	  compensate	  each	  of	  the	  focus	  groups	  members	  with	  a	  $25	  -­‐	  $50	  gift	  certificate	  
depending	  upon	  the	  number	  of	  participants.	  I	  anticipate	  this	  survey	  will	  take	  30	  -­‐	  45

software	  automatically	  saves	  your	  answers.	  However	  for	  this	  function	  to	  work	  properly

RE:

HSD study #45742
“Targeting success: An evaluation of information literacy standards”

Dear Mr. Willer:
The University of Washington Human Subjects Division (HSD) has determined that your research qualifies for
exempt status in accordance with the federal regulations under 45 CFR 46.101/ 21 CFR 56.104. Details of this
determination are as follows:
Exempt category determination: Category 2
Determination period: 8/21/2013 - 8/20/2018
Although research that qualifies for exempt status is not governed by federal requirements for research involving
human subjects, investigators still have a responsibility to protect the rights and welfare of their subjects, and are
expected to conduct their research in accordance with the ethical principles of Justice, Beneficence and Respect for
Persons, as described in the Belmont Report, as well as with state and local institutional policy.
Determination Period: An exempt determination is valid for five years from the date of the determination, as long
as the nature of the research activity remains the same. If there is any substantive change to the activity that has
determined to be exempt, one that alters the overall design, procedures, or risk/benefit ratio to subjects, the exempt
determination will no longer be valid. Exempt determinations expire automatically at the end of the five-year period.
If you complete your project before the end of the determination period, it is not necessary to make a formal request
that your study be closed. Should you need to continue your research activity beyond the five-year determination
period, you will need to submit a new Exempt Status Request form for review and determination prior to
implementation.
Revisions: Only modifications that are deemed “minor” are allowable, in other words, modifications that do not
change the nature of the research and therefore do not affect the validity of the exempt determination. Please refer
to the Guidance document for more information about what are considered minor changes. If changes that
are considered to be “substantive” occur to the research, that is, changes that alter the nature of the research and
therefore affect the validity of the exempt determination, a new Exempt Status Request must be submitted to HSD
for review and determination prior to implementation.
Problems: If issues should arise during the conduct of the research, such as unanticipated problems, adverse
events or any problem that may increase the risk to the human subjects and change the category of review, notify
HSD promptly. Any complaints from subjects pertaining to the risk and benefits of the research must be reported to
HSD.
Please use the HSD study number listed above on any forms submitted which relate to this research, or on any
correspondence with the HSD office.
Good luck in your research. If we can be of further assistance, please contact us at (206) 543-0098 or via email at
hsdinfo@uw.edu. Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Heather Rieck
Human Subjects Review Coordinator

The first section indicates one of the two issuing organizations, either the American Assoication
of School Librarians (AASL) or the Common Core State Standards (CC).
The second number for the AASL standard statements is the AASL standard number (one of four
standards). That is followed by a number and letter for the AASL indicator and finally by a G2,
G5, or G8 for the grade level.
The Common Core has two types of standards, English Language Art and Mathematics. None of
the Mathematics standard statements were included in the survey. The second part of the
Common Core standard statements is ELA for English Language Arts. Following the ELA
designator comes a combinator of the following indicators followed by a number indicating the
standard statement number and finally a G2, G5, or G8 for the grade level.
L - Literature
IT – Informational Text
LS – Language Standards
RFS – Reading, Foundational Skills
KID – Key Ideas and Details
CS – Craft and Structure
IKI – Integration of Knowledge and Ideas
PWR – Phonics and Word Recognition
F – Fluency
CC – Comprehension and Collaboration
VAU – Vocabulary Acquisition and Use
CSE – Conventions of Standard English
KL – Knowledge of Language

Appendix	  9	  Instruction	  to	  Coders	  –	  Task	  Count	  Index	  and	  Clarity	  
Rating	  
Task Count Identification
1) Please count the number of separate tasks each “Standard Statement” includes. Things to be
aware of are the words “and” and “or.” These indicate multiples of a single task. Also be alert for
the use of a semicolon to tack on an additional statement/s at the end of a standard statement.
If a standard statement lists examples (in parentheses, or with an e.g.) you do not need to count
these as separate tasks. If the standard statement uses the word “including” count all those items
as separate tasks.
Please see the examples I’ve included in the spreadsheet.
The Excel notebook I’ve attached has two sheets – one of examples, and one sheet for you to
code.
For reference, in my own counting of the number of tasks in all the standards statements, the
number of tasks has ranged from one to 18.
2) After counting the tasks in an individual benchmark, please give the standard statement a
rating for clarity based on the following scale –
•
•
•

3 = Clear and easy to understand
2 = Still understandable but a bit awkward and/or confusing
1 = Overly complex, more than 3 “ands/“ors”; wording is confusing or easily mixed up.

I left some identifying information in the spreadsheet.
Type = either A for American Association of School Librarians (AASL) or C for Common Core
State Standards (CCSS).
Number = my number for ordering/sorting
If any of this is confusing, or if you have questions please contact me, either by email or feel free
to call my cell phone (xxx) xxx-xxxx.
Lastly, I would appreciate it if you could have these back to me by the end of August.
Thanks,
Dave
