DEDICATION
It is with much love that I dedicate this endeavor to the love of my life, my
husband Terry, who has encouraged and supported me through this whole adventure. He
encouraged and loved me from the first day, when he took me to class in a wheelchair
due to a recent surgery. And still supported me when he faithfully drove me to the last
dissertation defense. He volunteered to drive me because I was sleep deprived from
being with my daughter for the birth of our granddaughter, Gwendolyn Grace. Terry has
unselfishly given himself throughout this undertaking. Whether it was taking care of
things around our house, errands that had to be run, conquering my elderly father’s many
needs, or fulfilling my requests, Terry was always ready to meet the requirements. This
process was definitely full of obstacles, but Terry was by my side the entire way. Terry
is the reason that I was able to complete this accomplishment.
To my daughters Collins and Amy, my grandchildren, and nieces, I strive to be a
better role model every day for you. I hope you always dream big and go for any goal
you want to accomplish. I would like to dedicate this work to my mother Barbara, who
always told me I could do anything I want with my life, instilling a strong work ethic, and
a resilient will to succeed. Lastly, to Fiver, the cat who inspired me to pursue this subject
for my dissertation and who is lying on my chest as I type these words as she has so often
throughout these years.

ABSTRACT
Fick, Janet L. Teachers’ and principals’ perceptions o f animals as pets and animalassisted therapy in an educational setting. Doctor of Education (Educational Leadership),
August, 2015, Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas.
Purpose
The purpose o f this study was to determine how adults perceive human-animal
interactions in an educational setting. Therefore, this study was designed to explore
perceptions of principals and teachers using animals as pets and animal-assisted therapy
within the school setting. Adult views were explored regarding the use of including
animals as pets and AAT when used within the school setting
Method
A qualitative approach was used to determine adults’ opinions about the use of
live animals as pets and for AAT in their school buildings. A phenomenological
approach was used because this study involves real-life, contemporary settings. Two
schools in Texas, one with a cat in the library and the other using a dog in the office,
were used in this study. Recorded, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the
principal and three teachers at each school allowing the participants to describe their
feelings about and perceptions of these experiences. Using the participant’s responses in
the interviews, I described and interpreted the data to understand the phenomenon.
Findings
The principals of the two schools described the various animals used in their
schools with an optimistic attitude. Even though there were differences in the ways the
animals were used, they both discussed the animals that interacted with the students in a

positive manner. The themes for the principal interviews are relationships, use of
animals, benefits, school environment, and teaching children.
The six teachers were all very cooperative in the interviews and had positive
feelings toward animals. However, they had mixed views about the diverse use of
animals at their schools. All of the teachers were aware of the animals in their schools
and had seen them, though not all teachers interacted with the animals regularly. Some
of the teachers revealed a desire to use the animals more with their students, while others
were content with the amount of interaction they currently had. The themes for the
teachers are relationships, school environment, benefits use of animals, and teaching
children.

KEY WORDS: Animals in education, Animal-Assisted Therapy, School environment

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
My gratitude toward family, friends, my cohort, and my professors who
supported my doctoral pursuit is immense. Professors in the Education Department and
the Library Science Department of Sam Houston State University have significantly
affected my ability to realize this aspiration through their excellent teaching skills and
caring encouragement. First, my deepest appreciation goes to Dr. George Moore, my
dissertation chairman, who shared his knowledge and served as one of the most
encouraging figures during the writing of my dissertation. His positive encouragement
throughout the process allowed me to increase the quality of my writing to meet the
doctoral level. He consistently inspired and nurtured me throughout my doctoral
experience and I will be forever grateful.
My appreciation also goes to the other two members of my committee, Dr. Stacey
Edmonson and Dr. Karin Perry, both of who gave their time and expertise in helping me
with my dissertation. Also, I would like to thank the members of Cohort 26, my friends,
Janie Flores, Jessica Lilly Hughes, Rebecca Novotny, Janie Pickett, and Melanie
Wachsmann for sustaining me during classes and encouraging me throughout the
doctoral process. The spirit, intelligence, and professional heights these women have
achieved has moved and inspired me. I would like to thank my friends, The Round
Mountain Girls, who were there when I needed to talk, but especially for those much
needed breaks o f laughter and good times.
Finally, I would like to specifically acknowledge and express my thankfulness to
my wonderful husband, Terry, who believed and supported me from the first day that I
expressed an interest in getting my doctorate. He sacrificed an enormous amount of time

that allowed me to achieve my goal. I share this degree with Terry, for without his
unconditional love and sacrifice, it would not have been possible. I thank God for giving
me Terry and the determination and strength to overcome obstacles and complete this
task.

CHAPTER I
Introduction
Many studies (Banks & Banks, 2005; Daly & Suggs, 2010; Kramer, Friedmann,
& Bernstein, 2009; Macauley, 2006; Nicoll, Trifone, & Samuels, 2008; Nimer &
Lundahl, 2007) exist regarding the usefulness o f animal-assisted therapy (AAT).
However, there are not as many showing the usefulness o f animals in education.
Scientists have been long-time supporters of animals being usOPed for general well­
being (Nimer & Lundahl, 2007). According to Farenga, Ness, and Hutchinson (2008), in
2007, 57% o f households in the United States had at least one pet, and 81.7 million cats
and 72.1 million dogs lived in the United States. Dogs have been domesticated for about
15,000 years and cats were domesticated around 8,000 years ago (Farenga et al., 2008).
In fact, as early as 1860, Florence Nightingale documented the benefits o f animals in
physical therapy (Macauley, 2006). Animals attract and motivate humans (Melson &
Fine, 2000). Animals easily bond with people, but until recently the therapeutic effects
o f animals on persons with mental disabilities were appreciated (Nimer & Lundahl,
2007). Boris Levinson included his dog as his co-therapist in a paper he wrote in 1962,
giving his dog credit for the significant progress o f his patients (Macaulay, 2006).
Animals are shown to bring good feelings to people, reduce their loneliness, lower their
stress, and improve their quality of life (Banks & Banks, 2005; Kramer, Friedmann, &
Bernstein, 2009). Animals used for humane education teach children kindness will
transfer to kindness to people (Daly & Suggs, 2010). Humane education cultivates
respect, kindness, empathy, and positive attitudes (Nicoll, Trifone, & Samuels, 2008).

Research regarding live animals in medical facilities (Banks & Banks, 2005; Baun
& McCabe, 2003; Berdy & Berdy, 2000; Berget, Ekeberg, & Braastad, 2008; Kramer,
Friedmann, & Bernstein, 2009; and McNicholas & Collis, 2006) is plentiful, and some
documentation exists regarding live animals being brought into schools for brief periods
o f time to be used in AAT (Fonseca et al., 2011; Friesen, 2010; Jalongo, 2005; Nicoll, et
al., 2008; and Zasloff & Hart, 1999). However, a paucity o f research about animals as
pets in educational settings exists. Animals can be used in AAT and used as pets for
positive influences in educational facilities, but more research is needed to discover the
ways live animals might be useful and what approaches might be employed to allow
adults to accept the animals.
Information exists about the positive effects of AAT when used with patients
having medical or emotional disabilities (Banks & Banks, 2005; Berget, Ekeberg, &
Braastad, 2008; Kramer et al., 2009; Macauley, 2006; Nimer & Lundahl, 2007). Children
who undergo physical exams in the presence o f a dog have less behavioral distress than
when the dog is not there (Melson & Fine, 2000). Banks and Banks (2005) suggested
AAT effectively improved loneliness in residents o f long-term care facilities. Berget et
al. (2008) summarized AAT had positive influences on the self-efficacy and coping
ability o f people with long-lasting psychiatric symptoms. Nimer and Lundahl (2007)
established that AAT showed promise o f improving treatment for individuals with health
concerns.
Problem Statement
Animals exist in households to give comfort to those that are lonely, as well as to
bring affection, companionship, and joy to their owners (Wood, Giles-Corti, Bulsara, &

3
Bosch, 2007). The researchers wrote that pet ownership was positively associated with
social interactions, neighborhood friendliness, and sense o f community. They further
suggested that pets influence social and psychosocial factors o f people in a positive
manner.
Schools can affect the social, emotional, and intellectual development o f children.
Ellis (1998) wrote that schools have the opportunity to provide an empathic environment
for children. These environments are needed for the children’s experiences in schools
and to support the healthy emotional development o f children. Helping children develop
empathy is key to their psychological structure (Ellis, 1998). When there is an empathic
school environment, students have more opportunities for positive experiences. The
addition o f animals as pets in schools help to make the school environment empathic
(Ellis, 1998).
Self-esteem is an integral part o f the skills needed for young adolescents to be
successful (Kelley, 1997). High self-esteem is connected to academic achievement,
involvement in sports, and development of coping and peer pressure resistance skills
(King, Vidourek, Davis, & McClellan, 2002). While increasing self-esteem, mentors
provide emotional, social, and academic support (King, 2002). The four conditions of
self-esteem are (a) sense o f connectedness, (b) sense o f power, (c) sense o f uniqueness,
and (d) sense o f positive role models (King et al., 2002). Programs that offer safe
environments, encouragement and support, inspiring activities, and behavior guidelines
increase self-esteem (King et al., 2002). Wigfield, Eccles, Maclver, Reuman, and
Midgley (1991) studied young adolescents and self-esteem and wrote that young
adolescents have lower self-concepts than younger children and part o f this change is due

4
to their change in school environment. Their environments have more emphasis on
evaluation and social comparison, and stricter grading (Wigfield et al., 1991). The self­
esteem o f the young adolescents changed due to their reactions to their school
environment (Wigfield et al., 1991). Some students’ self-esteem begins to rise later as
their social networks are reestablished, however some never regain their prior selfconfidence (Wigfield et al., 1991).
Children see animals as non-judgmental, without the complications and
expectations o f human interaction and the human-animal interaction offers children social
and emotional support (Friesen, 2010). Dogs are used in classrooms as part o f the
reading curriculum as demonstrated through the Reading Education Assistance Dogs
(R.E.A.D.) Program (Friesen, 2010; Jalongo et al., 2004). These researchers suggested
dogs are a positive force influencing children’s physical and psychological well-being.
However, some authors (Daly & Suggs, 2010; Fonseca et al., 2011; Nicoll et al., 2008;
Zasloff & Hart, 1999) indicated that insufficient research exists regarding live animals in
education.
Purpose
The purpose o f this study was to determine how adults perceive human-animal
interactions in an educational setting. Therefore, this qualitative study was designed to
explore perceptions o f principals and teachers using animals as pets and AAT within the
school setting. Adult views were explored regarding the use o f including animals as pets
and AAT when used within the school setting. The potential bias of the researcher is
discussed in the Epoche section below.

5
Significance o f the Study
Animals have been used to improve the mental, physical, and emotional health of
patients (Banks & Banks, 2005; Berget, et al. 2008; Kramer et al., 2009; Macauley, 2006;
Nimer & Lundahl, 2007). Animals have not only been used in the health field, but in
education as well. Teachers stated that using live animals in an educational setting has
improved students’ attitudes toward animals (Fonseca et al., 2011; Nicoll et al., 2008).
Similarly, teachers reported that using animals as pets in schools is an opportunity for
empathy development (Daly & Suggs, 2010).
When Daly and Morton (2009) compared the empathy in adults that owned pets
as children with adults that did not own pets as children, their findings supported the link
of animals with empathic development. The researchers concluded that pets impact
distress, attitudes, and social skills (Daly & Morton, 2009). This study will add to the
information used to determine the social and emotional influence of live animal use in
schools.
Additionally, results from this analysis could help school leaders to determine
whether using live animals in schools will be beneficial to the empathic development of
children. If using live animals in school settings is shown to be beneficial, this study
could be used in decision making when determining whether or not to allow pets in
schools. The information from the study could be used to influence the practice of
including live animals in school settings. Furthermore, results from the surveys,
interviews, and focus groups used in this study will help determine if additional research
regarding live animals would be useful. This study will add to the scant research that
demonstrates the benefits and challenges of using live animals in the school setting. The

6
purpose of this study was to determine how adults perceive human-animal interactions in
an educational setting.
Research Questions
Data will be collected via interviews to answer the following research questions.
1. How do principals perceive human-animal interaction in educational settings?
2. How do teachers perceive human-animal interaction in educational settings?
Theoretical Framework
The theoretical framework for this research was Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.
Researchers (Banks & Banks, 2005; Daly & Suggs, 2010; Maslow, 1943; Risley-Curtiss
et al., 2006) have illustrated how animals often fulfill the needs of providing feelings of
safety, companionship, and improvement in self-esteem. For example, animal-assisted
therapy is a positive influence when added to established interventions in improving
outcomes with people suffering from physical, emotional, behavioral, and medical
difficulties (Nimer & Lundahl, 2007). Because animals have been used successfully with
adults who have physical, emotional, behavioral, and medical difficulties, this thesis
theorized that adults would identify the positive outcomes that occur when animals are
used with children in an educational setting. The librarian can take advantage of the way
animals capture the interest and attention of children and use an animal such as a
domesticated cat as a focus of attention covering all areas of the curriculum (Zasloff &
Hart, 1999). Based on these facts, M aslow’s Hierarchy of Needs was the theoretical
framework for this study.
In recent years, schools are not only places where a traditional education is
provided. Their role has now expanded to include moral development of children. This

7
new role includes positive values, humane attitudes, and ethical conduct (Zasloff & Hart,
1999). As suggested by Daly and Suggs (2010), teaching children to be kind to animals
will transfer to children being kind to people. With the need for schools to become more
active in developing the values, attitudes, and conduct o f students, this thesis theorizes
that a domesticated cat, for example, can be used for the moral development o f students,
as well as a motivator, while being used to enhance interest in other areas o f the
curriculum. This theory anticipated positive findings when animals are used in an
educational setting due to previous findings with animal-assisted therapy with patients.
Definitions
The following terms were used in the literature review section o f this study. They
have been defined by using information from the resources. The definitions were given
to facilitate the understanding o f these terms.
Anim al-assisted therapy. Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) introduces a
companion animal to a person, anticipating that the person will benefit from the animal in
the room (Chia-Chun, Friedmann, & Thomas, 2010). Animal-assisted therapy has been
shown to decrease negative emotions and physical discomfort (Chia-Chun et al., 2010).
Animal-assisted therapy alleviated the stress of people in the hospital, as well as other
health care settings, and diminished displays o f emotional and physical stress o f children
in the hospital (Chia-Chun et al., 2010).
E m pathy. Empathy is a prosocial developmental characteristic that refers to the
increasing ability o f a person to understand and share the emotions o f another (Poresky,
1990).

8
Human-animal interactions. Human-animal interactions include activities such
as animal-assisted therapy, animal-assisted activities, human-animal bond, bondinghuman-pet, pet therapy, and animal use (Wilson, 2006).
Humane education. Humane education is the approach used to instruct children
in treating animals with kindness (Ascione, 1997).
Social support. Social support is a term for positive acts, interpersonal
transactions, and social provisions that arise from social relationships that are widely
accepted to enhance health and well-being (McNicholas & Collis, 2006).
Social network. Social network is made up o f relationships that give a sense o f
belonging and helps fight loneliness and isolation. Loneliness can be a result of the lack
o f a social network or the lack of specific close relationships. Forming close
relationships can be hindered by shyness, low self-esteem, or poor communication
(McNicholas & Collis, 2006).
Epoche
I had a potential bias regarding this phenomenon. My bias stems from a lifetime
love o f animals and pet ownerships, including hamsters, flying squirrels, guinea pigs,
rabbits, birds, fish, dogs, and cats. Stress relief for me has come from observing, playing
with, and petting animals. I believe that comfort, entertainment, stress reduction,
companionship, and improved environment are some o f the positive factors o f having a
pet. The cat that is at the school library discussed in this study is my personal cat that I
brings from my home to the library each day. Opportunity for me to bring the cat came
when I realized that the type o f cat I owned was known to be hypoallergenic. Only a
hypoallergenic animal was allowed because o f the allergies to animals that many children

possess. Due to my personal psychological and human science perspectives, I may have
a potential bias regarding this phenomenon. To avoid problems with bias when writing
about this study, I epoched by setting aside my personal experiences as much as possible
and bracketing out my views (Creswell, 2013) before continuing with the experience o f
others.
Delimitations
The study was delimited to schools in an independent school district in Texas that
used live animals as pets and/or use animals in animal-assisted therapy in the 2014-2015
school year. The study was further delimited to the principals and teachers o f the schools
chosen for the study. Many people have pets and a positive perception o f animals.
However, not all people are familiar or comfortable with around animals. Finally, this
study did not interfere with the daily job requirements o f these employees o f the schools
involved in the study.
Limitations
One limitation o f this study was its small sample size. While two participating
schools is appropriate for a phenomenological study, generalization o f results is limited
to other schools with the same population. Additionally, the animal assisted activities in
each school are fairly new, the dog being used at the elementary school for two years and
the cat being used at the middle school for three years. Because the schools that were
chosen to study had animals at school, they may have been more positive about animals
at school than other schools. The study relied on perceptions o f school employees. The
findings obtained in this investigation may not generalizable to other public schools if
administrators do not give their permission for live animal use. Finally, my personal

perceptions and possible biases in this study are explained in the Epoche section above. I
explained my background, the effect my background may have on the research, and the
strategies I used to prevent bias from influencing the research.
Assumptions
First, it was assumed that all procedures for selection of participants, data
collection, and data analysis were within the ethical standards as prescribed by the
independent school district in Texas, Sam Houston State University, and the Institutional
Review Board. Second, the assumption was also made that the data will be reported,
collected, and analyzed properly and accurately. Third, it was assumed that animalassisted training has many positive effects. Fourth, the truthfulness o f the participants’
answers was assumed. Finally, it was assumed that children are naturally attracted to
animals.
Summary
In the Introduction sections, the author examined the problem, the purpose, and
significance o f the study. Additional research needs to be conducted to find out if there
are collective benefits to those in an educational setting due to the presence o f animals.
The purpose o f this study was to determine how adults perceive the use o f animals as pets
and/or AAT in educational settings. The research question that was used to guide this
study were:
Organization of the Study
This study was presented in five chapters. In Chapter I, the background of the
study, statement o f the problem, purpose o f the study, significance o f the study, research
questions, theoretical framework, definitions of terms, delimitations, limitations, and the

11
assumptions of the study were presented. A review of the literature, which includes
animals and patients, animals in education, animals in the community, physiological
responses and relationships to dogs and cats, and pets and empathy was presented in
Chapter II. Chapter III described the methodology used to conduct this study and
included the research design, selection of participants, instrumentation, data collection,
and data analysis procedures. Chapter IV presented the findings from the analysis of the
data, and Chapter V provided a summary of the study, discussion of the findings,
implications of the findings for theory and for practice, recommendations for further
research, and conclusions.

CHAPTER

II

Literature Review
Animals have been used in advertising to attribute safety, believability, and
trustworthiness to the people with them (Friedmann & Tsai, 2000). Anthrozoology, the
study of human-animal interaction, is becoming more important since more than one half
of the homes in the United States have a pet (Farenga et al., 2008). Recent literature
supports that animal-assisted therapy has a positive influence on patients who had a
variety of medical, behavioral, and emotional difficulties (Banks & Banks, 2005; Berget
et al., 2008; Kramer et al., 2009; Macauley, 2006; Nimer & Lundahl, 2007). In
particular, many studies show evidence supporting the value and benefits animals have
on children (Daly & Suggs, 2010; Zasloff & Hart, 1999). The research of animals and
children in elementary schools support the idea that children are intrinsically motivated to
treat animals well and to respect animal life (Fonseca et al., 2011 and Nicoll, Trifone, &
Samules, 2008). Companion animals can be important to people of all ages and in a
variety of settings (Baun & McCabe, 2003). In many studies, pet owners reported that
pets had increased social interactions, increased civic engagement, improved perceptions
of neighborhood friendliness, and built a sense of community (Wood, Giles-Corti,
Bulsara, & Bosch, 2007).
The strategy used most often in searching for literature on this topic was
electronic search of databases for journals, books, magazine articles, dissertations, and
research studies. The ProQuest Statistical Insight database yielded 264 articles with
animals and education used as key words. None of these articles was used in this review
of literature. The ERIC database produced 5,493 articles with animals and education

13
used as key words. Out of the first 20 articles, one was selected to review. Most of the
articles reviewed were found using the Academic Search Complete database. The first
search in the Academic Search Complete database used animals and education as key
words and yielded 10,037 results. The second search used animal in the title field and
education in the text field, with the delimiters of full test, and periodicals and generated
1,513 articles. The next search in the Academic Search Complete database used animal
in the title field and therapy in the title field, with the delimiters of full text available and
periodicals. This search produced 114 articles and several were reviewed for this paper.
The next search using the Academic Search Complete database yielded only 32 articles
when animal and education were used in the title field, with the delimiters of full text
available and periodicals. O f these 32 articles, two were useful, but had been located in
the previous search using the Academic Search Complete database. The final search used
therapeutic benefits o f animals in the title field and produced 62 results. One of the
articles located in this last search was chosen for review.
Animals and Patients
Research has been conducted with animals and patients in long-term care
facilities. Relationships with animals remain the same when relationships with humans
can change during a serious illness (McNicholas & Collis, 2006). The support received
from animals is valuable during grief, providing a routine, ease of loneliness, and a
means to express feelings (McNicholas & Collis, 2006). Animals give tactile comfort,
sense of being cared for, and trust (McNicholas & Collis, 2006).
Banks and Banks (2005) led a study to determine the contribution of animalassisted therapy on loneliness in residents of long-term care facilities. They analyzed 33

14
residents in long-term care facilities in weekly sessions. The thinking processes of the
residents were not damaged; they volunteered for the study, and they scored as
statistically lonely on a loneliness scale. Banks and Banks (2005) discovered that animalassisted therapy (AAT) was effective in improving loneliness in residents of long-term
care facilities, the lonelier the individuals, the more they benefitted from AAT. They also
discovered that participants benefitted more from AAT when receiving therapy
individually than when in a group. The researchers suggested that nurses in long-term
care facilities conduct further tests.
Similarly, Kramer, Friedmann, and Bernstein (2009) also conducted research with
residents of long-term facilities; however, the people they studied had dementia. Kramer
et al. (2009) compared effects of visitation by a person, visitation by a person
accompanied by a live dog, and visitation by a person accompanied by a robotic pet.
They found that visits by a person alone, a person accompanied by a live dog, and a
person with a robotic pet could be valuable in stimulating social interaction in residents
with dementia, helping them keep contact with the outside world. The visit with the live
dog and the robotic dog both stimulated residents to have more social interaction than the
visitor did when he was alone (Kramer et al., 2009). The robotic dog produced longer
looks and more conversation than the live dog (Kramer et al., 2009). Kramer et al.
(2009) suggested that further research be performed involving visits with people in long­
term facilities. The success of the robotic dog in stimulating conversation by dementia
residents suggests that it may provide a viable alternative to live animal visits (Kramer et
al., 2009).

15
Another study (Fick, 1993) was conducted with residents of a long-term care to
determine the effects of the presence and absence of a dog on social interactions. Persons
in a long-term facility often have a loss of sense of purpose and an absence of activities
leading to loneliness, depression, hopelessness, boredom, and low self-esteem (Fick,
1993). Thirty-six male residents of a nursing home for veterans participated in her study.
The veterans were visited by a dog one day a week. Fick (1993) concluded verbal
interactions, sometimes with the dog and sometimes with other people, increased with the
presence of the dog (Fick 1993). The dog provided a comfortable environment
conducive to social interactions which can improve the social climate of an institution
(Fick, 1993).
Stress, loneliness, depression, and apathy frequently occur in geriatric residents
who have been institutionalized (Berry et al., 2012). Animal-assisted interventions have
been used to stimulate social responsiveness and physical activity which increases the
residents’ quality of life (Berry et al., 2012). In 2012, Berry et al. lead a study of
interactions between two dogs with 19 elderly patients. They wrote that the residents
began to smile and interact more with the dogs and each other every time they visited,
especially during play time when they threw the ball for the dogs. The apathetic state of
the patients decreased and they began to overcome their state of inactivity (Berry et al.,
2012 ).
Comparable to the research conducted with animals and patients in long-term care
facilities, research has also been performed with animals and patients who are able to
leave care facilities. Berget, Ekeberg, and Braastad (2008) examined effects of
intervention with farm animals on self-efficacy, coping ability, and quality of life among

16
adult psychiatric patients with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses. Their study began with
90 patients with various mental disorders completed the questionnaires. Then 60 of the
patients received animal-assisted therapy with the other 30 patients used as the control
group. The patients went to a farm and worked with farm animals accompanied by the
farmer. Some of the behaviors the patients participated in were brushing, washing, and
riding horses; talking to and petting the animals; moving the animals from one pasture to
another; feeding the animals; cleaning the cowshed and washing tools; milking animals;
and receiving instructions from the farmer as to the care of the animals. Berget et al.
(2008) discovered that animal-assisted therapy with farm animals had a positive influence
on self-efficacy and coping ability among psychiatric patients with long lasting
psychiatric symptoms. The authors recommended that further controlled studies be
performed.
Comparably, Wells (2009) used a survey to conduct a study of pet owners who
suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome. The most commonly reported advantage to pet
ownership was companionship with people also commenting to other psychological
advantages such as enhance mood, reduce depression, increase calmness, and provide a
sense of purpose (Wells, 2009). Dog owners brought up the advantage of increased
exercise and social facilitation and cat owners discussed the advantage of physical
warmth they enjoyed when their cat lay on them (Wells, 2009). Companion animals,
particularly dogs, reduce stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depression and boost feelings of
autonomy, competence, and self-esteem (Wells, 2009). Disadvantages in pet care
include increased fatigue, feelings of guilt for not giving the pet enough attention, and
bereavement following pet loss (Wells, 2009).

17
Many research studies have been conducted with dogs and patients with
emotional and medical problems. Nimer and Lundahl (2007) wrote a quantitative review
of animal-assisted therapy (AAT). They analyzed 119 studies that researched AAT used
with people who had problems such as autism-spectrum symptoms, medical difficulties,
behavioral problems, and emotional problems. The researchers found that dogs were
used most often in AAT. Nimer and Lundahl (2007) revealed that AAT usually has the
objective of improving treatment for individuals with mental health concerns. They also
showed that more AAT was used with adults than with children. Nimer and Lundahl
(2007) established that AAT showed promise as an additive to established interventions.
They recommended that further rigorous research be conducted in regards to animalassisted therapy.
Baun and McCabe (2003) wrote about the therapeutic possibilities of the use of
animals with patients who suffered from dementia Alzheimer’s type (DAT). The authors
discussed the comfort, increased social interaction, and decreased agitation that the
animals facilitated. The caregivers of the patients also benefitted with the companion
pets and experienced a reduction in physiological stress (Baun & McCabe, 2003). In
their study, Baun and McCabe (2003) discovered animals in nursing homes promoted
diversity and stimulation, while alleviating helplessness, loneliness, and boredom.
Presence of companion animals reduced verbal aggression and mood swings, especially
late in the afternoon when patients with DAT usually become agitated (Baun & McCabe,
2003). Caregivers can receive some relief from physical and emotional stress with the
use of a companion animal (Baun & McCabe, 2003). The authors suggested that a
companion animal should be chosen in the early stages of DAT. This would allow time

18
for the patient and animal to bond before the disease progresses. Walking a dog and
playing fetch with a dog are examples of acceptable outlets for excessive pacing, which is
experienced by many patients in stages 2 and 3 of DAT (Baun & McCabe, 2003).
Caregivers use animals as a therapeutic distraction for the patient by calling attention to
what the animal is doing (Baun & McCabe, 2003). Animals can be a clue to a memory
for a patient and a reminder to relax for the caretaker (Baun & McCabe, 2003). The
writers observed that birds can also result in decreased depression among patients with
DAT (Baun & McCabe, 2003). Animals can increase the quality of life for DAT patients
and caretakers by providing comfort (Baun & McCabe, 2003).
Allen, Blascovich, Tomaka, and Kelsey (1991) used 45 adult women, who
described themselves as lovers of dogs, to study stress responses. The women had a
mean age of about 39 years, were White nonsmokers, and worked outside the home.
They were asked to perform mental mathematics problems in their head at a laboratory
with only a female experimenter present and later with a close female friend or their dog.
The researchers reported that there was the least amount of stress for the participants
when their dog was present. The presence of the dog helped buffer stress more than a
friend and more than working along with the experimenter (Allen et al., 1991).
Melson and Fine (2000) wrote about therapists that used animals in their therapy.
Some of the examples were therapists who use animal attribution story technique in
family therapy; play therapists who use animals as family members to make children
more comfortable; therapists who use animal puppets because children relate more easily
to animal puppets because they are not as threatening as human puppets. Play allows a
child to control anxiety, externalize problems, and provide a diversion from a situation

19
(Kaminski, Pellino, & Wish, 2002). Bibliotherapy using books with animals as the main
characters helps therapists discuss difficult issues with children (Melson & Fine, 2000).
People feel more comfortable interacting with animals and sharing feelings they are not
ready to disclose to humans (McNicholas & Collis, 2006). Animals offer accepting
interactions (Hart, 2000).
The possible influences of AAT on the state of mind of children who have
experienced inpatient psychiatric treatment was investigated by Prothmann, Bienert, and
Ettrich in 2006. Integration of animals at the beginning of the session was especially
helpful as children felt a sense of security and warmth from the animals in a strange
environment (Prothmann et al., 2006). The four different dogs influenced the patients’
hospital stay by motivating the patients and improving their mood which made the
patients more cooperative in the process (Prothmann et al., 2006). The AAT therapy
group was more popular than other therapy groups, especially for the patients who have a
difficult time participating in group activities (Prothmann et al., 2006). Further a
decrease in isolation and anxiety was seen in patients who interacted with the dogs by
playing, stroking, cuddling, and feeding them (Prothmann et al., 2006). Increase in
alertness, attention, openness, desire for social contact were supported by the dog being
there, which futther promoted the psychological well-being of the children (Prothmann et
al., 2006). These characteristics were observed to be strongest for the children that felt
the worst (Prothmann et al., 2006). Anxiety and fear were decreased which permitted the
children to feel more cared for and secure (Prothmann et al., 2006).
Pets are used in therapy to build a bridge and ease tension and anxiety (Reichert,
1994). Children can hold the pet for support or whisper their personal stories into the ear

20
of the pet (Reichert, 1994). Pet-facilitated therapy group and child-life group with
hospitalized children were compared in a 2002 study by Kaminski et al. They randomly
divided 70 hospitalized children into two groups, one was visited by a Pet Pals trained
dog their play time, and another group that had their play time in the child-life group
without a dog. Mood, affect, amount of touch, heart rate, blood pressure, and salivary
cortisol was measured in the children in both groups. Children in the pet-therapy group
experienced more anticipatory excitement about seeing the dog than children in the other
group, and both groups had fewer comments about being ill after their play therapy
(Kaminski et al., 2002). Heart rate, mood, amount of physical touch, and positive affect
were enhanced in the pet-therapy group showing that pet therapy could provide an
additional supportive activity for hospitalized children (Kaminski et al., 2002).
Animals have different effects on different children because of what they bring
from their past (Melson & Fine, 2000). Benefits from relationships with animals are
dependent on an individual’s liking of animals, pet ownership, and ease around animals
(McNicholas & Collis, 2006). Therapy animals have stimulated social interactions in
socially withdrawn children, decreased aggressive and hyperactive behaviors in children,
and increased children’s focus on the lesson (Nicholas & Collis, 2006). When used with
children with hyperactivity and conduct disorders, animals can calm children and hold
their attention (Hart, 2000). Children in wheelchairs who have dogs are approached more
often than those children without pets. The dogs promote a normal psychosocial
environment for the children (Hart, 2000).
Even though she discussed the use of farm animals in animal-assisted therapy
(AAT), Macauley (2006) used dogs in her research. The dogs were certified Pet Partners

21
who completed behavior and temperament requirements. Pet Partners also certifies cats
for AAT, completing similar behavior and temperament requirements. Similarly, BideA-Wee Therapy utilizes cats for AAT in hospitals (Berdy & Berdy, 2000). A dog’s
social life is organized around dominant-subordinate relationships, whereas cat
socialization is based on give and take and respect of their independence (Turner, 2005).
Pet Partners must be current on vaccinations and have regular grooming, customary
veterinary visits, and be on flea/tick prevention medication.
Macauley (2006) further explored the effects and effectiveness of animal-assisted
speech-language therapy using three persons with aphasia. The participants were not
allergic to dogs, liked dogs, and were frustrated with speech. The therapy sessions were
held individually for 30 minutes once a week for 12 weeks. Macauley (2006) discovered
that the presence of the dog motivated the people to communicate more and provided
them with something to talk about. The participants were less stressed when AAT was
used instead of traditional therapy, and they attempted to talk to the dogs more than they
attempted to talk to humans. The researcher suggested future research using animalassisted therapy.
Janice (2009) observed Pam Moore conducting hospital therapy with cats that
brought about a change in the patients. When Mrs. Moore brought her Sphinx cats to the
hospital, it was reported that the cats brought “peace and happiness to the patients”
(Janice, 2009). Terry True, a family practitioner, and Sharon True, a registered nurse,
also do animal therapy utilizing Sphinx cats. They take the cats to oncology units in
children’s hospitals where the patients are allowed to hold the cats while receiving
chemotherapy and radiation (Janice, 2009). The goal of the therapy is to enable the

22
patients to relax and provide them with extra motivation to heal (Janice, 2009). Research
shows that petting an animal can decrease patient anxiety, lower blood pressure, and help
ward off depression (Janice, 2009).
Research has shown that the use of animals can be beneficial to patients. Lange,
Cox, Bemert, and Jenkins (2006) conducted research using a four-year-old Golden
Retriever with a group of five adolescents. The group consisted of three males and two
females ranging in ages from 13 to 16 and was a counseling group (Lange et al., 2006).
The research of Lange et al. (2006) illustrated valuable benefits, such as a calming effect
on the adolescents, humor relief during sessions, increased feelings of safety in the group,
experiencing empathy, and motivation to attend the sessions while using the dog in the
therapy sessions.
Pets
The domestication of wolves was about 12,000 years ago and the domestication
of cats was about 3000 to 4000 years ago (Blouin, 2012). Domesticated animals are
more docile, curious, non-territorial and less distrustful than other animals (Blouin,
2012). Some people viewed keeping pets disapprovingly until the aristocrats of Ancient
Greece, Ancient Rome, and Medieval Europe kept pets (Blouin, 2012). Even though it
was forbidden, monks and nuns kept bets (Blouin, 2012). In the late 18th century, the
middle class began to own pets, especially dogs, bringing about the first formal dog show
in 1859 and the founding of the Kennel Club in 1873 (Blouin, 2012). The frequency of
pet ownership has continued to expand increasing pet population and rising awareness of
the benefits of companion animals (Blouin, 2012).

23
Relationships between people and their pets has become stronger than ever
before. People think of their dogs as more than pets, they think of them as friends or
children (Blouin, 2012). Over 95% of dog owners hug their pet daily and many are
closer to their dogs than their own parents (Blouin, 2012). Pets are different than other
animals in three ways: pets are allowed in homes, pets are given names, and pets are not
eaten (Blouin, 2012). Humans often prefer to adopt baby animals because they bring out
parental tendencies (Blouin, 2012). Livestock are valued for their utility and pets are
valued for their emotional support (Blouin, 2012).
The three dimensions of children’s attachment to their pets, behavioral, affective,
and cognitive, were studied by Melson, Peet, and Sparks in 1999. The dimensions of
attachment identified were: behavioral - consisting of the child playing with the pet or
caring for it; affective - emotional expressions of interest and closeness to the pet; and
cognitive - ideas about care of the pet (Melson et al., 1991). After conducting
interviews with 120 children, they wrote that pet attachment was higher for older children
and higher for those children whose mothers had jobs (Melson et al., 1991).
Similarly, Kidd and Kidd (1985) studied the cognitive, affective, and behavioral
elements of the attitude o f children about pets. They discussed that boys usually prefer
dogs due to their playfulness and that most girls prefer cats due to the solitariness. Dogs
are described as strong, intelligent, gentle, and obedient and cats are described as soft,
clean, playful, and independent (Kidd & Kidd, 1985). Pets are seen as family members,
friends, companions, and outlets for affection that teach children responsibility, be used
to minimize trauma, alleviate some emotional problems, promote good mental health, and
teach empathy (Kidd & Kidd, 1985). Empathy can motivate children to help a pet or

24
other children who are in distress (Kidd & Kidd, 1985). In their research, Kidd and Kidd
(1985) reported that children said they showed affection to pets by stroking, hugging, and
kissing, and taking care of their pets, but that pets showed affection by licking, tail
wagging, rubbing up against, and purring. Many people have pets because the affection
the animals show make the people feel loved (Blouin, 2012).
In 2012, Blouin conducted a study to determine the types of benefits that people
receive from interacting with animals. The human-animal interaction offers physical,
social, and psychological benefits, especially for children, elderly, and institutionalized
providing support and companionship at various ages (Blouin, 2012). African-Americans
view dogs more often as a source of protection than pets, however, they also refer to then
as part of the family (Blouin, 2012). Immigrant Chicana and Latina women often keep
numerous animals, such as goats and chickens, as pets as a part of their tradition and
memory to their rural past (Blouin, 2012). Women have more empathy and positive
attitudes toward animals than men (Blouin, 2012). Men see themselves as a friend of the
pet and focus on the appearance of the animal, though women see themselves as parents
of the pet and show more tenderness (Blouin, 2012). Unattached young adults, newly
married, empty nesters, divorced, widowed, remarried, and childless people have a higher
pet attachment than others (Blouin, 2012). A change in their feeling toward their pet can
change with other changes in their lives, such as marriage, different job, move, etc.
(Blouin, 2012).
Humans are attached to their pets and show this relationship by viewing the pets
as family members; crediting the pet as a contributor of the family morale; share
activities, responsibility, and closeness with the pet; become committed to the pet; and

25
grieve when a pet dies (Raupp, 1999). Disagreements exist on what makes proper
treatment o f pets.

Some people think that overfeeding, dressing in costumes, letting pets

sleep in human beds are examples of mistreatment of pets (Blouin, 2012). Other people
think that crating, disciplinary measures, and training techniques are forms of animal
abuse (Blouin, 2012). Hitting pets or giving pets away are socially acceptable (Raupp,
1999).
Childhood experiences with exposure to animals have an effect on the ownership
and treatment of animals by adults (Blouin, 2012). Violent childhood events increase the
chances of adult abuse of animals and neglect of animals happens more often than
violence (Raupp, 1999). Children that witness their mother getting battered often turn
children into animal abusers (Raupp, 1999). When a child abuses an animal, it frequently
continues to abuse of animals as an adult and leads to human violence (Raupp, 1999).
The bulk of people who relinquish cats and dogs to shelters state it is because the animals
misbehave out of spite (Raupp, 1999). More pets are returned to a shelter after being
adopted that were adopted to teach a child responsibility than those animals adopted for
the whole family (Raupp, 1999). Some parents threaten to give away a child’s pet to
punish the child for misbehavior and this damages future relationships with animals
(Raupp, 1999).
Cat owners, like dog owners, view their pets as family members and often prefer
cats over dogs for ease of care and the cat’s personality (Zasloff & Kidd, 1994). Owners
are comforted by their cats and have their stress level lowered by their purring and by
petting them (Zasloff & Kidd, 1994). Cats fulfill the needs for companionship,
something to care for, being needed, and enjoy watching their cats (Zasloff & Kidd,

26
1994). Even though cats are known to be independent, aloof and less affectionate than
dogs, cats demonstrate affection by greeting their owners, staying close to them, sleeping
with them, and seeking the company of their owners (Zasloff, & Kidd, 1994). The
benefits o f owning a cat include unconditional love, loyalty, devotion, and acceptance
(Zasloff & Kidd, 1994). The cat is easy to care for, provides comfort, and offers pleasure
without the problems of human companionship (Zasloff & Kidd, 1994).
Stress and Relationships
Teacher stress can affect student behavior problems, teacher-parent relationships,
and relationships with peers (Froeschle & Crews, 2010). The possibilities of lowering of
blood pressure and relieving stress have been long-standing beliefs of the response of
petting a dog or a cat. Watching fish swim in an aquarium can reduce stress, and
watching a hamster run on a wheel can create a calming effect (Ross, 2005). Somervill,
Kruglikova, Robertson, Harrison, and MacLin (2008) investigated the effects of physical
contact with a dog and a cat on blood pressure and pulse among 62 college students. The
researchers stated that there were no significant changes in blood pressure or pulse while
participants held one of the animals; however, there was a significant decrease
immediately after holding one of the animals (Somervill et al., 2008). They also
explained that pet owners had significantly lower blood pressure and pulse than non-pet
owners, which was demonstrated after a stressful math test (Somervill et al., 2008).
Previous research failed to support a significant difference in physiological reactions to a
dog and a cat (Somervill et al., 2008). No support was attained that holding a dog would
result in lower blood pressure or pulse than holding a cat; comparable results may be
expected for both dogs and cats (Somerville et al., 2008). The positive benefits

27
associated with pet ownership affect survival and health, but brief exposure to an animal
may have minimal or no long-term health benefits, however, reports suggest that patients
in a variety of settings enjoy interacting with animals (Somerville et al., 2008).
Somerville et al., (2008) explained, “The benefits of pet therapy may be primarily related
to these pleasurable experiences” (p.526).
Affectionate relationships with pets have benefits for people as well as enriching
their quality of life. The health and well-being of animals and humans has long been
connected, but only recently has the subject of animal-human bond become a research
subject. Risley-Curtiss, Holley, and W olf (2006) investigated the relationships between
animals and humans with regard to race and ethnicity, beliefs about companion animals,
and ownership of pets. They established that a higher percentage of indigenous people
had pets, the next highest percentage or people that had pets were white people. There
were no significant statistical differences in whether participants reported that they
receive emotional support, unconditional love, and companionship from their pets.
Latinas/Latinos reported that their dogs or cats gave them a sense of personal safety.
White people were more likely to say that their pets should be spayed or neutered and say
that it is okay to declaw cats; however, they were least likely to say their pet could teach
their children to be responsible. Further research was suggested that social work
researchers who are studying individual families should include the presence of animals
and their meaning to human participants (Risley-Curtiss et al., 2006).
Animals in the Community
The review of literature uncovered research about the role of animals as pets in
the community. Kellert (1985) analyzed newspaper articles from 1900 to 1975 in an

28
effort to discover the views and behaviors of Americans regarding animals. He used
these definitions to code the newspaper articles: (a) aesthetic— interest in the artistic and
symbolic characteristics of animals; (b) dominionistic— interest in control of animals,
usually in sporting events; (c) ecologistic—concern for relationships between wildlife
and habitats in environment; (d) humanistic— strong affection for individual animals,
especially pets and focus on large animals in wildlife that have human qualities; (e)
moralistic—concern for the right and wrong treatment of animals, oppose exploitation or
cruelty toward animals; (f) naturalistic— interest in wildlife and outdoors; (g)
negativistic— dislike or fear of animals; (h) neutralistic—emotional detachment from
animals; (i) scientific— interest in the physical attributes and biological functions of
animals; and (j) utilitatian— interest in the practical and material value of animals or their
habitat (Kellert, 1985).
Surprisingly, utilitarian attitude was the most prevalent perception of animals.
Followed by humanistic attitude as second, neutralistic attitude as third, negativistic as
fourth, aesthetic was fifth, dominionistic was sixth, ecologistic was seventh, scientific
was eighth, naturalistic was ninth, and moralistic was the least frequent attitude (Kellert
(1985). The frequency of occurrence of animal was examined with dog as the most
frequent at 549 times and cat as the 15th most frequent at 73 times (Kellert, 1985). The
researcher suggested his research cast doubt on the presumption that a major increase
existed in the amount of animal-related awareness and interest in America (Kellert,
1985).
Likability of pet owners and whether the type of pet varied with the likability
were the subjects of a study by Geries-Johnson and Kennedy in 1995. Pictures and a

29
questionnaire were used to ascertain opinions about animal and human likability from
175 college students (Geries-Johnson & Kennedy, 1995). The data revealed that the
pictures of people with animals were more likable than pictures of people without
animals and the pictures of people with dogs were favored over pictures of people with
other animals (Geries-Johnson & Kennedy, 1995).
Wood, Giles-Corti, Bulsara, and Bosch (2007) explored the potential role of pets
as facilitators o f social interactions and sense of community. Small focus groups of about
seven participants in each, with 86 participants in total, discussed perceptions about pets
and experiences with animals in their communities. The researchers also conducted a
telephone survey of 113 participants asking questions about sense of community and
perceptions o f the neighborhood. The participants thought that dog ownership enhanced
the likelihood of owners meeting other people when out for a walk in the neighborhood.
Pet owners spend more time socializing than non-pet owners (Joubert, 1987). Wood et
al. (2007) posited pet ownership was positively associated with social interactions, civic
engagement, perceptions of neighborhood friendliness, and sense of community. Wood
et al. (2007) further suggested that pets positively influence social and psychosocial
factors on health and well-being, and pets have a ripple effect that extends to the broader
community (Wood et al., 2007). They suggested that further studies be completed
dealing with pets and communities.
Animals in Education
Hummel & Randier (2012) reported that the use of living animals in the
classroom leads to higher knowledge. In their meta-analysis in 2012, Hummel and
Randier reported that the group of students working with a living animal showed more

30
interest and competence, which correlate with achievement, than the group of children
working with a film of an animal. The living animals made learning interesting and
motivating while gaining knowledge with the intrinsic motivation variables of interest,
self-sufficiency, self-determination, and competence (Hummel & Randier, 2012).
Researchers (Jalongo, Astorino, & Bomboy, 2004; Wilson, 2006) asserted the presence
of animals tends to reduce stress, as shown by reduced heart rate, lowered blood pressure,
lower heart rate, enhance social environment, decrease depression, and other observable
signs of anxiety.
A well-known program, Reading Education Assistance Dogs (R.E.A.D.), brings
therapy dogs to school. Dogs can be useful in classrooms in teaching a specific task or as
part of the curriculum such as reading, writing, story time, circle time, etc. A dog can be
used as a subject for creative writing, for reading stories about dogs, or the dog can
participate with the children in activities (Friesen, 2010). This researcher (Jalongo et al.,
2004) used R.E.A.D. to pair therapy dogs and students who tested below grade level for
reading fluency. The dogs came to the school for the children to read to them for 20
minutes once a week for a school year. Jalongo et al. (2004) analyzed the data and
observed most of the children improved their reading skills by two grade levels.
Animal assisted therapy has two principles, children’s tendency to open up to
animals and the effect of lowering stress in an animal’s presence (Jalongo et al., 2004).
Animals fascinate children and Jalongo et al., (2004) approximated that 70 % of children
talk to animals. These researchers assert that the evidence of their research supports and
guides the powerful, positive force on children’s physical health, psychological well­
being, social interaction, and academic achievement by using dogs to visit classrooms

and hospitals (Jalongo et al., 2004). Benefits arise whether the animal is interactive and
initiative or simply present in the environment (Turner, 2005). Sitting quietly next to a
dog can lower heart rate and blood pressure (Melson & Fine, 2000). Reading aloud to a
dog creates less raised heart rate and raised blood pressure than reading aloud to a human
(Melson & Fine, 2000). Observing animals is associated with relaxation, watching birds
and even watching fish swim in an aquarium can reduce anxiety and discomfort
improving the quality of life of the observers (Friedmann & Tsai, 2000; Melson & Fine,
2000; Turner, 2005).
In 2007, Chen, Chou, Deng, and Chan conducted a study using a computer
program with animal companions to motivate 31 Grade 5 students in a digital classroom
environment. The roles of the computer-simulated animal companions were to help with
the children’s motivation, reflection, and member interactions (Chen et al., 2007). Pet
nurturing mode and individual learning mode were interactions between the student and
the computer program. Game competition mode and group discussion mode were the
modules that required member interaction. All of the students expressed interest in
raising their pet and motivation to learn; 29 out of 31 students increased effort and stated
that they were engaged in learning; 26 out of 31 students conveyed interest in reflecting
about their learning and communicated that the program was useful to them (Chen et al.,
2007). However, only 15 out of 27 students encouraged learning in their peers and the
other 12 only wanted to improve their own performance, so only one half of the students
were involved in collaboration with other students (Chen, et al., 2007). Students cared
about themselves and their animal companions; thinking of their animal companions as
their second identity (Chen et al., 2007).

Animals have been used in schools for experiments and as pets. Daly and Suggs
(2010) examined teachers’ attitudes and experiences regarding the use of pets in the
classroom. They collected quantitative and qualitative data from 75 elementary
classrooms using surveys. The researchers wanted to ascertain teachers’ attitudes about
classroom pets, their attitudes about the use of classroom pets, and their attitudes about
why pets were or were not used in the classroom. This researcher will also study
teachers’ attitudes about animals in education; however, this study will be about an
animal in the library and another animal used in the counselor’s office, not animals in
classrooms.
Daly and Suggs (2010) identified 23 types of pets reported to be in these
elementary classrooms, including fish, frogs, geckos, crabs, a guinea pig, a hedgehog, a
hamster, rabbits, a cat, and a dog. Teachers used different programs in the curriculum,
such as the Character Counts program, the Roots of Empathy program, and their own
lesson plans. The teachers’ own curriculum employed field trips, books, pictures, and
stuffed animals used for storytelling. Daly and Suggs (2010) observed evidence of the
value and benefits that animals had for children. The animals helped to develop empathy,
other socio-emotional behaviors, and social competence of children (Daly & Suggs,
2010). The researchers explained that animals improved focus for cooperation and
positive interaction in children. Most of the teachers had positive attitudes toward pets in
the classroom. Pets were sometimes not used in the classroom due to denial by the
administration (Daly & Suggs, 2010). They suggested that further research entailing
humane education be performed. Philips (2006) reported that Connor Schultz, eight

33
years old, improved his reading per minute by 38 words in just one month with the help
of reading aloud to a therapy dog.
Fonseca et al. (2011) conducted comparable research when they explored animal
use in elementary schools. They examined children’s attitudes toward the humane
treatment of animals. Grade 4 students were used in this study to determine children’s
outlook on different animals and their use in education. Fonseca et al. (2011) confirmed
that children were intrinsically motivated to treat animals well and to respect animal life,
and the children displayed positive attitudes towards animals. The control group’s
attitudes were significantly increased in the post-test. When asked if animals such as
cats, dogs, and rabbits should receive better treatment than rats or fish, only one child
said they should be treated better (Fonseca et al., 2011). It was established by the
researchers that children have strong beliefs about responsibilities towards animals
(Fonseca et al., 2011). Further research was recommended regarding strategies aimed at
interventions to teach children about animal welfare.
Similarly, Nicoll, et al. (2008) also studied elementary students’ outlook on
animals. They used 154 students in first-grade to study the effectiveness of an in-class
humane education program that incorporated regular visits from therapy animals.
Classroom lessons were conducted for about 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 4 months
using the Connecticut We Love Animals Curriculum, an in-class humane-education
program, and using the therapy animals. The therapy animals included a guinea pig, a
bird, a rabbit, and a dog. Teachers also utilized the KIND News that contained lessons
about animals. Nicoll et al. (2008) found that the in-class humane-education program

34
significantly increased students’ self-reported positive attitudes toward animals. They
suggested that further systematic study be conducted in regards to humane education. '
Italy has two teachers in each preschool classroom, Bone (2013) reported that
some educators describe the environment as the third educator and animals as the fourth
educator. Animals are naturally drawn to animals and if they have a family pet, treat the
animal as part of the family. Schools want to make connections with the family and one
way to make a connection is with animals. Animals are sometimes seen as teachers in
children’s books (Bone, 2013). Animals in the classroom compel students to be calmer
and more focused, animals may encourage positive behaviors in educators, too (Bone,
2013).
In 2013, Bassette and Taber-Doughty evaluated the effects of a dog reading
program with on academic engagement behaviors of three children with emotional and
behavioral disabilities. The researchers wrote that all three students had increase in ontask behaviors. Students indicated they enjoyed the dog reading program, the increase in
on-task behavior, and became more confident because the dogs would listen while they
read without criticizing (Bassette & Taber-Doughty, 2013). Although the handlers did
not assist with the students’ reading, but merely observed the interaction, this program
would be an animal assisted activity instead of animal assisted therapy.
Likewise, Zasloff and Hart (1999) examined the use of animals in elementary
school education. They provided data concerning uses of animals in elementary school
classrooms in California by having 37 teachers complete surveys. There are drawbacks
to having pets such as cost and responsibility, concern about safety of children, and
concern about safety of children (Zasloff & Hart, 1999). Advantages and disadvantages

35
were reported in the surveys. The researchers discovered that animals and information
about animals are effective in elementary. The teachers reported that animals provide
lessons in subjects such as science and other cross-curricular instruction, and are
important for teaching children humane values (Zasloff & Hart, 1999). The teachers also
stated that they recognized the value of live animals for hands-on instructional purposes
(Zasloff & Hart, 1999). Live animals used with lessons are important for teaching
children humane values (Zasloff & Hart, 1999). Zasloff and Hart cautioned that the
teachers had expressed future needs for the success of animals used in the classrooms that
included suggestions on ways in which to use the animals.
Children with Special Needs and Animal-Assisted Therapy
Research supports the positive influences of human-animal interaction in
addressing social and behavioral problems of students (Baumgartner & Cho, 2014).
While observing students with learning, behavior, and emotional disabilities interact with
animals, Baumgartner & Cho (2014) noted that students took turns and treated the
animals with respect. It was apparent that the students felt comfortable with the dogs
because they knew the dogs would not make fun or their reading or behaviors, which
improved their social skills and motivation while reducing reading anxiety (Baumgartner
& Cho, 2014). Trust, nurturing, and friendly relationships can be built through an
animal-assisted program because the animals provide non-judgmental, non-threatening
responses (Baumgartner & Cho, 2014). Trust happens when one person allows another
person to make a decision that affects their well-being (Zak, Stanton, & Ahmadi, 2005).
Responsibility, social skills, empathy, and positive self-concept can be promoted using
animals (Baumgartner & Cho, 2014).

36
Levinson (1971) conducted a study to determine the use of farm animals and pets
in children’s training schools. The training schools described by Levinson were facilities
housing delinquent children when foster homes were not appropriate. Children in these
facilities were described as socially disturbed, antisocial, and delinquent children. Of the
150 surveys mailed, 112 were returned and 38 of those schools had farm animals as part
of their work programs. The most successful farm animal program described involved
horses where each student was in charge of the complete care, training, and riding of one
horse. Rules about pet ownership varied greatly from buying pets to keeping strays to no
pets allowed. Some of the facilities reported that they no longer allowed pets due to the
neglect and cruelty to the pets (Levinson, 1971).
More recently, Brous (2010) wrote about children and animal interaction in 2010.
Children who have trouble communicating to other children and adults have been
observed behaving differently with animals (Brous, 2010). Teachers from a school in
New Jersey that use a Canine Companion with their children with special needs made
comments such as “Students work harder to communicate when teaching dogs”;
“Empathy and compassion are demonstrated in student relationships with the animals” ;
and “Students encourage each other” (Brous, 2010, p. 21).
Martin and Famum (2002) conducted a quantitative study on the interaction of a
dog on children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). PDD is characterized by
an impairment of social interactions and communication and include autistic disorder,
Rett’s childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger’s (Martin & Famum, 2002). Children
with PDD are usually socially withdrawn, disinterested, and disengaged from their social
environment (Martin & Famum, 2002). They wrote that children were more playful,

37
more focused, and more aware of their environments when in the presence of the dog.
The children talked to the dog, were more apt to agree to a request from the therapist, and
less inclined to ignore questions from the therapist with irrelevant answers which
indicated increased meaningful, focused discussion (Martin & Famum, 2002).
Similarly, Katcher and Teumer (2006) piloted research using special education
students and farm animals. Participating students had duties related to the welfare of the
animals and commitment to the ethical treatment of animals. A decrease in depression,
learning problems, and behavior problems was observed in the students who took care of
the farm animals (Katcher & Teumer, 2006). The students who participated in the farm
environment had lower social problem scores than the students who were only in the
school environment and decreased atypical behaviors, such as “babbles to s e lf’ and
“stares blankly” were noted for the students with autism who participated with the farm
animals (Katcher & Terumer, 2006). The children who had human-animal interaction
were more attentive to their environment, more socially active, more accepting of
instruction, and open to learning (Katcher & Terumer, 2006). Teachers were enthusiastic
and positive in their evaluation of the farm project and the students’ behavior and the
program increased social skills and decreased disruptive behavior outside of the
constraining classroom (Katcher & Terumer, 2006).
Kanner first described children who were not interested in other people using the
term autism and today people who are described using the term autism spectrum
disorders (ASD) have deficits in social exchange and communication and demonstrate
repetitive behaviors (Berry, Borgi, Francia, Alieva, & Cirulli, 2013). Studies have shown
that behavior interventions in early childhood have decreased the severity of the

38
symptoms of ASD (Berry et al., 2013). Therapy dogs have been successfully used as a
behavior intervention for children with ASD by decreasing anxiety, anger, emotional
outbursts, and increasing calmness, verbal interaction, and social behavior (Berry et al.,
2013). An increase in hand flapping was reported, but viewed as an expression of
excitement and exhilaration (Berry, et al., 2013). The more relaxing environment
increases receptiveness and communication (Berry, et al., 2013). In fact, the dog benefits
the entire family by becoming the focus of attention, alleviating the embarrassment and
stress of having a child with ASD, and helping the family become part of the community
(Berry, et al., 2013). Families have a sense of security and independence with the help of
the therapy dog (Berry, et al., 2013).
Wohlfarth, Mutschjler, Beetz, Kreuser, and Korsten-Reck (2013) conducted a
study to discover whether a therapy dog can enhance motivation and promote exercise in
children with obesity. When the dog was present, all twelve children participated in more
physical activity than when the dog was not present (Wohlfarth, 2013). The speed of the
children’s activity also increased (Wholfarth, 2013). A dog is the source of motivation,
companionship, and support for physical activity (Svensson, 2014). Pet owners are more
physically active than people who do not own pets and have fewer visits to the doctor
(Wohlfarth, 2013). Animals provide an environment which fosters the increase of
intrinsic motivation (Wohlfarth, 2013). A dog can trigger motivation for activity and
benefit outpatient training with children with obesity (Wohlfarth, 2013). Using dogs in
programs for children with obesity helps motivate children to participate in physical
exercise.

39
Esteves and Stokes (2008) analyzed the effects of the presence of a dog on social
interactions between three children with developmental disabilities and their teacher.
Sessions lasted for eight minutes and were conducted five days a week. An increase in
positive behavior for all three participants was reported by the researchers. The children
showed a decrease in negative behaviors and improved positive social behavior toward
other children in the classroom following sessions with the dog (Esteves & Stokes, 2008).
Esteves and Stokes used the findings in this study support the premise that the presence
of a dog can increase communication and positive non-verbal behavior. Use of an animal
in the classroom benefitted these children.
Mentors, Dogs, and Children
Animals, especially dogs, provide a non-threatening, socially supportive,
interactive audience for children who are reading aloud (Friesen, 2010). Trained therapy
dogs promote children’s reading practices in schools and public libraries. One of the
programs, R.E.A.D., was implemented by Intermountain Therapy Animals. Wellbehaved, gentle animals train with their adults to become certified by the R.E.A.D.
program (Friesen, 2010). The calm, well-trained dogs offer kindness, curiosity, patience,
and unconditional acceptance during reading (Friesen, 2010). The owners of the dogs,
known as their handlers, train with the dogs so they can be certified. Training includes
ignoring distractions, adapting to various situations, and responding to commands
(Jalongo, 2005).
Dog handlers collaborate with teachers and/or librarians so that they will know
the interests and reading level of the child with which they will work. R.E.A.D.
recommends that the dogs and children read together for 20 minutes a week (Jalongo,

40
2005). Children with reading difficulties may lack confidence, have few opportunities to
read at home, little motivation to read, or comprehension difficulties (Jalongo, 2005).
The calm, well-trained dogs help the children build motivation, maintain focus, and
increase their reading endurance by giving children an alternative to reading alone. The
human-animal team provides valuable educational, emotional, and social support for the
children during the regular mentoring opportunities (Friesen, 2010).
Before implementing a reading assistance program using dogs, the R.E.A.D.
program suggested (a) understanding the training that the dogs and handlers undergo; (b)
gaining support from administration by explaining the planned program; (c) addressing
safety issues and enlighten the participants about the rigorous requirements of the
certification program; (d) considering the community and whether or not dogs will be
seen as something to disgust, to fear, a nuisance, a food source or will be accepted as part
of the reading program; (e) planning the budget and who will be responsible for the costs;
(f) determining the children that will participate, usually the program focuses on children
with difficulties in reading; (g) obtaining permission from the parents of the children; (h)
address concerns with cleanliness and insure that the dogs have the required vaccinations
and regular visits with the veterinarian; (i) informing faculty, staff, and families about the
program; (j) preparing children and staff by having a presentation explaining how
children should act around the dogs; and (k) planning for the dog’s safety and well-being
by protecting the dogs from harm and allowing the dog to have no more than 90 minute
ofr work time. After children participated in R.E.A.D. for two consecutive years, all of
their reading scores improved (Jalongo, 2005). Decreased absenteeism, increased library
use, and improved report card grades were also described (Jalongo, 2005).

41
The R.E.A.D. volunteer does not teach the child to read, but by being a friend and
role model fosters the enjoyment of reading, involving the child with activities and
developing the meaningful relationship between adult, dog, and child in a relaxed
environment (Friesen, 2010). Academically or socially at-risk children are usually the
children chosen by the teacher to work with the R.E.A.D. human-animal teams (Friesen,
2010). By petting the dog, two purposes can be accomplished: attention is drawn away
from the child to the dog and the child is allowed to fell accepted and trusted by the dog
(Friesen, 2010). Friesen (2010) wrote about four key aspects of the relationship between
the child and the human-animal team:
1.

A relationship is not a feeling but results from actin, and the action or process
entails some form of giving;

2. If helping adults are like and admired by young people, the young people will
be more receptive to the adults’ guidance, will seek their approval, and will be
inclined to imitate their behaviors and attitudes;
3. Helping adults must be able to bring warmth and stability to their attachments;
and
4. Common elements of positive relationships are caring, respect, responsibility,
and knowledge.
The mentor is a supportive role model who encourages the social and emotional
development of the child including improving their scholastic achievement, nurturing
their self-esteem, redirecting behaviors, and expanding the child’s experiences (Friesen,
2010). Mentors reduce risky behavior in youth and individually connect with them
(Kelley, 1997). Positive effects by mentors are seen when mentors enhance social skills,

42
emotional wellness, and serve as role models (Randolph & Johnson, 2008). Mentoring is
a relationship between an experienced adult and a younger person in which the adult
provides guidance, instruction, and encouragement (Randolph & Johnson, 2008).
Mentorship is most successful when mentors are screened, mentors are match to students,
and there is proper support and supervision for the mentors (Friesen, 2010). Literacy
mentors should display an enjoyment of children, love of reading, show compassion,
sensitivity, flexibility, patience, and commit to regular mentoring sessions (Friesen,
2010). Additional activities should be considered by the mentors, such as reading various
texts (i.e. cartoons, joke books, newspaper articles, children’s magazines, etc.); follow
instructions on a recipe; writing of letters, jokes, and stories; practice public speaking,
learn body parts of the dog; create a game board; design a poster; and perform puppet
plays (Friesen, 2010).
Humane Education
Eddy (1899) wrote “children who are taught to be kind to animals and to each
other make good citizens” (p. 227). Children should be taught to have respectful
interaction with animals (Ross, 2005). Animals can be transitional objects which allow
children to establish primary bonds with them before establishing bonds with humans
(Martin & Farnum, 2002). Humane education programs make use of interventions such
as cooperative learning, rehearse helping in role playing, examples of prosocial values to
promote interpersonal and interspecies relations in educational settings and home
environments (Ascione, 1997). There are some programs that work on counter­
conditioning to foster positive child-animal relations (Ascione 1997).

43
Operation Outreach-USA is a humane educational program that uses literature in
a blended approach to teach children respect for all living things (Ascione, 1997). The
curriculum is used to develop compassion, a sense of justice, and respect for all living
things; provide knowledge and understanding; and nurture a sense of responsibility in
children by blending reading with prosocial attitudes and empathy (Ascione, 1997). By
using literature, they combine cognitive reading ability and affective social attitudes to
accomplish the goal of respect for all living things (Ascione, 1997).
Programs such as People and Animals incorporate direct physical contact with
animals, introduction to animals in zoos, lessons about animal behavior, and literature
that includes animal protagonists (Ascione, 1997). These educational programs range
from a one-time visit by an educator to a program that lasts the entire school year. The
programs focus on socialization outside the home in these school-based humane
education programs (Ascione, 1997). Ascione (1997) suggested three issues to be
addressed in future research, duration of the changes that occur as a result of humane
education; the relation between having a pet and children’s attitudes toward animals; and
the relationship between children’s humane attitudes and their actual treatment of
animals. Stewardship should be taught to students in regards to animals and used to
shape the behaviors of students toward animals and raise the awareness of responsibility
toward pets (Farenga et al., 2008).
Teacher Influence and Expectations
Teachers communicate performance expectations to students and when teachers’
expectations are met through students’ performance it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Brophy and Good (1970) investigated this self-fulfilling prophecy with four first-grade

44
class in a small, rural Texas school district. After observing the teacher-student
interactions they concluded when teachers set high expectations for children and the
expectations are met, teachers praised the performance (Brophy & Good, 1970). In
contrast, when teachers set lower expectations for children the teachers accepted the
lower performance and provided less praise (Brophy & Good, 1970). They also noted
that there was a higher level of negative interaction with boys than girls, including
disapproving criticisms toward work and behavior (Brophy & Good, 1970). Highachieving students received more teacher praise and support for performance and
classroom behavior than low-achieving students (Brophy & Good, 1970). Interestingly,
the teacher who showed the least discrimination did not group the children by
achievement in the classroom (Brophy & Good, 1970). Achievement and performance of
the students was related to the teachers’ expectations. Teachers are sometimes unaware
of communicating their expectations toward students; however, this study demonstrated
the influence that teachers have. When presented with an opportunity to have studentanimal interaction, teachers will continue to communicate their expectations to their
students and only positive attitudes will make the interactions successful.
Students’ Needs Met
Humane education is instigated because of the link between animal abuse and
human violence (Arkow, 2006). For many years, cultures have accepted that children
who are taught to respect animals will acquire empathy and compassion toward humans
(Arkow, 2006). When teachers instruct children about responsibility, nurturing, respect,
caring, and compassion toward animals they expect the students to develop good
character and respect for living things (Melson & Fine, 2000). Additionally, animals may

45
be used to enhance the psychological well-being of a child (Melson & Fine, 2000).
Nagengast, Baun, Megel, and Leibowitz (1997) stated the presence of a dog can reduce
elevated blood pressure, heart rate, and observable behavioral distress in young children.
At the same time, children can gain a sense of reassurance, calm and security from an
animal (Melson & Fine, 2000). Animals can help children to feel the environment is
accepting and is a safe place (Melson & Fine, 2000).
Svensson (2014) interviewed pre-school children, 12 boys and 12 girls, in her
study concerning what children learn from dogs and cats. Her data collection revealed
two categories: the pet supports the child in the language development process and the
child teaches the pet. Through data analysis, sub-categories surfaced: developing
empathy and emotions, being good at school tasks, teaching the pet playful exercises, and
teaching the pet to obey (Svensson, 2014). The results showed that the children had
positive experiences with animals, talked to the animals, and believed the animals
listened to them.
Social Network and Support
Social networks consist of relationships with family and friends that influence a
person’s self-identity and expectations of others (McNicholas & Collis, 2006). Social
networks provide social support that supplies material, information, and practical
assistance (Melson & Fine, 2000). Social support defends a person from emotional and
physical illness (McNicholas & Collis, 2006). People without close relationships suffer
from depression, anxiety, and physical illness (McNicholas & Collis, 2006). Social
support manifests in four parts: (a) emotional, which is the expression of caring and
concern, giving comfort, reassurance, and a sense of belonging; (b) esteem, which is the

46
expression of positive interest, confidence, and competence; (c) practical, which is the
direct assistance with a problem or a task; and (d) informational, which gives advice,
feedback and information to a person (McNicholas & Collis, 2006).
Schools are part o f a child’s social network that supplies the social support.
Children’s social supports help them endure stress; feel (a) cared for, (b) loved, (c)
accepted, (d) stronger self-esteem, and (e) connected to others (Melson & Fine, 2000;
McNicholas & Collis, 2006). Interaction with animals has the potential to decrease
loneliness, depression, stress, and anxiety (Friedmann & Tsai; 2000). Moreover, children
are instinctively drawn to animals (Melson & Fine, 2000) because animals provide
companionship and love, comfort, enjoyment, reassurance, emotional support, and
compassion (Melson & Fine, 2000). Animals make schools more like home (Melson &
Fine, 2000).
Animals can be indirect social support because they enhance interactions between
people (McNicholas & Collis, 2006), and animals can be direct providers of social
support when they have a close relationship to a person (McNicholas & Collis, 2006).
When the animals appear to understand the child’s feelings, the child turns to the animal
for comfort (McNicholas & Collis, 2006). Furthermore, animals can give social support
when no human support is available. Children who do not have a bond with an animal
perceived their family climate less favorably than children who had a strong bond with a
pet (Strand, 2004). The stronger the human-pet bond, the higher self-esteem and selfconcept for the child (Strand, 2004). It is easy for a child to interact with an animal
because there is free expression and no strain from human interaction (McNicholas &
Collis, 2006).

47
In 2001, McNicholas and Collis led a study of children’s personal relationships
and social support. Using questionnaires, a walk in the neighborhood, and stories they
discovered that children name their pets and neighbors’ pets as friends. The children
selected pets as friends in stories, choosing realistic functions that the pets could provide.
All of the pets, even the small ones such as hamsters, were used to build self-esteem by
allowing children to talk to them without judgment (McNicholas & Collis, 2001). Dogs
were regarded as protectors in scary situations and cats were features as providers of
comfort, especially to an ill child. Relationships with cats and dogs were often seen by
the children as more important than some human relationships and were frequently
referred to as important family members and a source of unconditional love and
emotional support (McNicholas & Collis, 2001; Strand, 2004). Thus dogs and cats
provide psychological forms of support to children.
Empathy
Empathy is the key factor in sustained prosocial behavior (Sprinkle, 2008).
Social, emotional, and cognitive development, as well as communication, is enhanced
when a child cares for an animal (Ross, 2005; Rud & Beck, 2000). Human-animal
interaction can promote the development of empathy, self-esteem, self-control, and
independence in children, and the loneliness of old age can be eased by caring for an
animal (Levinson, 1978; Ross, 2008). The presence of animals can improve a child’s
attitude and ability to relate to others (Rud & Beck, 2000). Children who have positive
relationship with animal are usually not violent as adults (Bone, 2013). Daly and Morton
(2009) compared the empathy in adults that owned pets as children with adults that did
not own pets as children. Their findings support the link of animals with empathic

48
development. The authors reported that the participants who had dogs as children scored
higher on the empathy quotient as the social skills factor than those who had a cat as a pet
or those that did not have any pets as children. The participants that did not have pets as
children scored higher on the distress scale. Evidence was provided that revealed the
participants that had pets as children and/or had pets as adults scored higher on the
animal attitude scale, having a more positive attitude toward animals. Daly and Morton
(2009) concluded that pets impact distress, attitudes, and social skills.
Poresky, Hendrix, Mosier, and Samuelson (1988) suggested that adults’ attitudes
toward animals were related to the ages when they had pets and the bonds they formed
with their pets. Their first hypothesis was adults who had interactive relations with
childhood pets will have more positive attitudes toward animals as an adult than people
who did not have interactive relationships with pets. The second hypothesis was adults
who had a pet in early childhood will have more positive attitudes toward animals than
people who had a pet in later childhood. Poresky et al. (1988) gave questionnaires
regarding pet ownership, childhood and adult pet bonding, and attitudes toward pets to
188 volunteer university students. An analysis of the results from the questionnaires
supported the researchers’ hypotheses. The adults who reported a strong bond with a pet
at an early age had more positive attitudes toward animals.
Poresky continued his work regarding children bonding with animals in 1990
when he measured children’s empathy using The Young Children’s Empathy Measure.
The instrument was used to measure the cognitive and affective perspective of thirtyeight children aged 3 to 6 years old. The four emotions that were used in the study were
happy, afraid, sad, and angry. The four emotions are included because they are included

49
in most empathy research (Poresky, 1990). The children’s age, relationships with their
pets, cooperation, and reassurance were associated with their empathy scores, but their
empathy did not increase with their IQ (Poresky, 1990). The author stated that the
children who had a strong bond with a pet had higher empathy scores than the children
who did not have a strong bond with their pet or children without a pet (Poresky, 1990).
This study is further evidence that children who bond to an animal have more empathy
than children without pets.
Another study was performed in 1990 by Poresky in collaboration with Hendrix
involving young children and their bond with pets. Responses to a survey were obtained
from parents of 88 young children involving their rating of their children’s bond with
their pet and social competence. Follow-up home visit were arranged with 74 children to
obtain additional information on children’s empathy, cooperation, and intellectual
functioning. As in earlier studies, Poresky and Hendrix used The Young Children’s
Empathy Measure to assess the children during the home visits. Positive correlations
between the children’s bonds with their pets and the reassurance, empathy, and
cooperation measurements, suggested a beneficial relationship between the children’s
bonds with their animals and their social development (Poresky & Hendrix, 1990).
Hyde, Kurdek, and Larson conducted a study in 1983 to explore the self-esteem,
social sensitivity, and interpersonal trusts differences of college students who owned pets
and those who did not. The Tennessee Self-concept Scale, Hogan’s Empathy Scale, and
Rotter’s Interpersonal Trust Scale were used to measure the variables. Results showed
that college-age pet owners had higher empathy and interpersonal trust score than non-pet
owners (Hyde et al., 1983).

50
Schools sometimes use programs to reduce violence and aggressive attitudes,
beliefs, and behaviors in students (Sprinkle, 2008). Healing Species in an inclusive
nonprofit, animal-assisted violence prevention and character education program used in
schools (Sprinkle, 2008). Lack of empathy and childhood animal abuse are two traits that
are common to people who commit violent acts (Sprinkle, 2008). Teaching children to
treat people and animals with respect is the first step in reducing the development of
aggression (Sprinkle, 2008). Healing Species uses animals to teach children to practice
prosocial behaviors and how to be empathetic (Sprinkle, 2008). The presence of the dog
gives children the opportunity to observe prosocial behavior, practice prosocial behavior,
and to be reinforced for their behavior (Sprinkle, 2008). Examples of prosocial skills are
listening, joining, sharing, helping, apologizing, and empathizing (Sprinkle, 2008).
Through the Healing Species program, children learn more appropriate ways to express
their emotions by modeling, rehearsing, and reinforcing anger management, conflict
resolution, and peer mediation (Sprinkle, 2008).
Motivation and Self-Confidence
Motivation is a contributor to students’ achievement and school success (Guthrie
et al., 2006). When examining motivation, we consider how students perceive
themselves and the process of learning (Ames, 1992). Academic motivation is
characterized by enjoyment of learning, curiosity, persistence, and the learning of
challenging tasks (Gottfried, 1990). Motivation in the early elementary years has
implications on future school success and is related to self-confidence (Gottfried, 1990).
Children who lack self-confidence are at risk for exhibiting a helpless response pattern
(Ames, 1992). Reading motivation contributes to reading comprehension (Guthrie et al,

51
2006). Through Gottfried’s (1990) research, she realized that motivation was positively
related to school achievement, intellectual ability, and self-confidence. Higher
motivation effects higher achievement, school performance, self-confidence, and less
academic anxiety, especially in younger children (Gottfried, 1990). Children with higher
motivation are more successful in school (Gottfried, 1990). When students do not do well
in school, their motivation lowers (Gottfried, 1990). Motivation is independent of
intelligence (Gottfried, 1990). Prediction of report card grades, but not prediction of
standardized achievement test scores, can be made with motivation (Gottfried, 1990).
Sometimes motivation can affect school grades due to participation in extra credit
assignments (Gottfried, 1990). Higher grades are given to students who teachers perceive
as being more motivated (Gottfried, 1990). Teachers may encourage students who they
think are more motivated, which produces more motivation in the children (Gottfried,
1990). Environment and other possible motivations should be researched (Gottfried,
1990). Establishing early motivation interventions is important to prevent future
declining scores and drop-outs (Gottfried, 1990).
Motivation is a concern of teachers as the teachers say that motivation is the
biggest problem in educating children (Edmunds & Tancock, 2003; Ford & Ohlhausen,
1988). Motivation plays a large part in learning and effects children’s reading because
motivated children spend more time reading than children that are not motivated
(Edmunds & Tancock, 2003; Ford & Ohlhausen, 1988). Teachers often get students to
focus using rewards such as verbal praise, grades, privileges, and prizes, but another
motivator is interest (Zahorik, 1996). Hands-on activities are the primary way teachers
create interest in a lesson for students and other ways are personalized content, student

52
trust, group tasks, variety of materials, teacher enthusiasm, practical tasks, and a variety
of activities (Zahorik, 1996). Creating interest sustains motivation which leads to
learning (Zahorik, 1996).
Gee, Harris, and Johnson (2007) suggested therapy dogs were motivators, so they
conducted a study using preschool age children who have learning, behavior, or social
skill deficits to discover if the dogs would also increase performance time and accuracy
when performing gross motor skills. Animals tend to reduce aggression; increase self­
esteem; reduce stress; allow children to express themselves by being non-judgmental; and
increase non-verbal and verbal responses (Gee et al., 2007). While performing the gross
motor tasks in the presence of the therapy dog, the children were relaxed and motivated
to perform the tasks more quickly, however, they made more errors resulting in a lower
performance rating (Gee et al., 2007). Even though the children enjoyed interacting with
the dogs, the authors wrote that the therapy dogs were more useful developing language
in children than developing motor skills (Gee et al., 2007).
Ardent readers practice reading and improve their reading fluency, acquire
vocabulary, gain knowledge, and raise their intelligence (Lee-Daniels & Murray, 2000).
Allowing students to choose the books they read promotes motivation (Sweet, Guthrie,
Ng, 1998). When children start school, they are excited about learning, but their
motivation decreases the most in first through fourth grades (Edmunds & Tancock,
2003). Their motivation decreases because they become aware of their own performance
compared to other children, competition is emphasized, and children’s interests are not
met (Edmunds & Tancock, 2003). Teachers use incentives of rewards such as
certificates, food, books, and verbal praise to enhance reading motivation and encourage

53
children to read (Edmunds & Tancock, 2003). Verbal praise enhances intrinsic
motivation (Lee-Daniels & Murray, 2000). Ford and Ohlhausen (1988) wrote about the
following seven guidelines to use in developing reading incentive programs:
1.

Assess students to know what motivates each one;

2. Set a goal that is within reach of all students.
3. Allow for a variety of means in attaining the goal;
4. Use equitable units of measures in recording progress toward the goal;
5. Individualize progress records;
6. Implement incentive programs that emphasize competition against self- not
competition against the group; and
7. Implement incentive programs that emphasize group cooperation not group
competition.
One of the seven major instructional practices that increase motivation for reading
is rewards (Guthrie et al., 2006). Rewards can enhance achievement, improve behavior,
and increase task persistence (Ames, 1992). Talacek (1992) wrote that a reading
incentive book chain used at her school exceeded their expectations by increasing the
amount of reading done by students and the enjoyment children experienced when they
read more.
Student reading achievement correlates with teachers’ perceptions of their
motivation (Sweet et al., 1998). Motivated, engaged students are more likely to be higher
achievers (Sweet et al., 1998). In 2013, Bassette and Taber-Doughty’s study revealed the
influence of the motivation of a dog when working with children. Children demonstrated
their motivation as the behavior of the children was stabilized in anticipation of and

54
during the special reading time (Bassette & Taber-Doughty, 2013). The children who
read to the dog increased their on-task behavior; discussed enjoyment of reading which
they had earlier disliked; improved their task engagement even when the task was
challenging; and lengthened their focus (Bassette & Taber-Doughty, 2013). Teacher
expectations are influential on student performance (Sweet et al., 1998). Cooperation,
choices, stimulating tasks, responsibility and effort increase student motivation (Sweet et
al., 1998). Experienced teachers who use a range of motivating techniques that stimulate
curiosity, encourage effort, and provide challenging tasks make outstanding teachers
(Sweet et al., 1998). Motivation can be increased by allowing students to have choices,
encouraging cooperation in the classroom, having interesting assignments, and expecting
students to have responsibility for their personal learning (Sweet et al., 1998). Students
perceive caring teachers as ones who consistently enforce rules, expect students to work
to their potential, have equal interactions, are nurturing, and model learning (Sweet et al.,
1998). When students are self-determined, they acquire more knowledge and achieve
more (Sweet et al., 1998).
McQuillan (1997) described a belief about reward programs in education called
“Jump-Start”. Rewards given at the beginning of a program will persuade students to
read more, revealing the joys of reading, which makes them want to read just for the
enjoyment of reading (McQuillan, 1997). In 1987, McGrath authored an article about the
Reading Incentive Program at the elementary school where she was principal. She
discussed the incentives of ice cream coupons that were used to lure students to the
library during the first semester of the school year. The school used listeners to listen to
the students read and discuss the books with them. Individual attention in a friendly

55
environment and a large selection of books from which to choose led to increased
circulation of books in the library and improvement of reading skills in the students
(McGrath, 1987). Children need an engaging curriculum; a safe environment; and a
choice about what they read to become lifelong learners (Lee-Daniels & Murray, 2000).
Connectedness
Connectedness is the cohesiveness between groups (Rowe, Stewart, & Patterson,
2007). Connected is a feeling that one belongs and protects children and youth from
engaging in negative behavior (King et al., 2002). Higher self-esteem increased the
chances that children and youth will connect positively to peers, teachers, and the school
(King, et al., 2002). Adolescents that are successful in public school influence the family
in positive ways and are influenced by the family in positive ways (Masselam, Marcus, &
Stunkard, 1990). When adolescents fail in public school and attend an alternative school
there is less balance and communication in the families (Masselam, Marcus, & Stunkard,
1990). Negative perceptions and less communication increases parent-child conflict
(Masselam, Marcus, & Stunkard, 1990). Communication is more positive and open in
public school families than in families where the adolescent attends an alternative school
(Masselam, Marcus, & Stunkard, 1990).
Elements o f social bonding include attachment, which is the quality of
relationships; commitment, which is the dedication to a goal; and involvement, which is
the involvement in social activities (McBride et al., 1995; Rowe et al., 2007). Social
bonding increases the self-esteem of an adolescent and when one’s self-esteem is
increased risk-taking behavior is decreased (McBride et al., 1995). Strong social bonds
have interpersonal trust and reciprocity (Rowe et al., 2007). A sense of belonging and

56
participation in the school environment helps buffer stress and enhance social integration
(McBride et al., 1995). A sense of connectedness at school can impact the mental and
emotional health of children and lessens risk-taking behaviors such as substance use and
violence (Rowe et al., 2007). Connections can be promoted through participation of
members and supportive structures such as policies, organization, and environment that
endorse positive, caring relationships; community; and common good for all school
members (Rowe et al., 2007). An increase in connectedness can be observed with active
participation of all students and policies, physical environment, and learning promotes
these values (Rowe et al., 2007). The pleasant, welcoming physical environment or a
school can promote and support opportunities for social interactions that are vital to the
feeling of connectedness (Rowe et al., 2007). School connectedness can contribute to the
health and development of children as they transition to adults (Rowe et al., 2007).
School connectedness is the quality of the relationships or social bonds with
school communities (Rowe et al., 2007). School connectedness includes liking school,
perception of belonging at school, positive associations with teachers and friends at
school, and participation in school activities (Thompson, Iachan, Overpeck, Ross, Gross,
2006). Absence of conflict, association that bridge social division, conflict management,
and absence of bullying are characteristics of school connectedness (Rowe et al., 2007).
Student-school bonding protects students from a tendency toward misconduct and loss of
academic ambition (Simons-Morton, Crump, Haynie, & Saylor, 1999). Emotional well­
being, less drug abuse, better health, reduction in suicide attempts, less depression,
decrease in violence, and diminished teen pregnancies are some of the positive outcomes
linked to school connectedness (Thompson et al., 2006). In the past, higher school

57
connectedness has been seen in students who are younger, have two parents, are males,
with good grades, have educated parents, and have a large number of friends (Thompson
et al., 2006). Lower school connectedness has been seen in students who do not
participate in extracurricular activities, skip school, and are African American
(Thompson et al., 2006). Connectedness at the school level has been seen in school with
well-managed classes, high percentage of Hispanic student population, high number of
two parent families, and a large number of students who participate in extracurricular
activities (Thompson et al., 2006). Less connectedness at the school level has been seen
in schools with harsh discipline and large, urban schools (Thompson et al., 2006).
In their 2006 study, Thompson et al. wrote that school connectedness is greater
among young students, two parent families, students who are successful in academics,
students who participated in extracurricular activities, females, and students who have
many friends. They also stated that schools with more parent involvement, students who
thought they were good-looking, and schools with wealthy students were more connected
(Thompson et al., 2006). Parents who are demanding, involved, and supportive put
students at a lower risk o f being involved in problem behavior (Simons-Morton et al.,
1999). Students usually put as much interest and concern on their school academic and
behavioral performance as do their parents (Simon-Morton et al., 1999). Less
connectedness was seen in school with a large percentage of renters and Thompson et al.,
hypothesized that it was due to the students seeing the school as a temporary, transient
environment (Thompson et al., 2006). Populations usually considered as “minorities”
exhibited high levels of school connectedness, as did the populations of non-US citizens
(Thompson et al., 2006).

58
Students who have positive social bonds with their school perform well
academically and abstain from school misconduct, substance abuse, delinquency, and
other antisocial behavior (Simons-Morton et al., 1999). Adolescents are highly
susceptible to antisocial behaviors and problem behaviors such as alcohol abuse, cigarette
smoking, fighting, truancy, bullying, theft, and vandalism which occur during
adolescence (Simons-Morton et al., 1999). These behaviors put adolescents at risk for
school failure, criminal justice system involvement, and health problems such as
addiction, sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, injury, and even death (SimonsMorton, 1999). Students who come from low-income families, who are among the
minority population, and whose parents are divorced are at a higher risk of experiencing
these problem behaviors (Simon-Morton et al., 1999). When students are discontented,
the school often becomes the target and they break school rules, ignore the school work,
are disrespectful, and even vandalize (Simon-Morton et al., 1999). Educational
experience and social affiliation should be developed by the school to allow the student to
experience success (Simon-Morton et al., 1999). School is the main establishment
outside of the family which can direct and shape the adolescent, increasing educational
motivation and decreasing misconduct and other anti-social behaviors (Simon-Morton et
al., 1999).
Environment and School Climate
School environments are more than buildings, and the roles of the schools are
more than just a safe physical environment; they are major socializing environments
(Hawkins & Catalano, 1990). Schools are an important part of the environment of
developing children and can be organized to promote the healthy development of

59
productive citizens (Hawkins & Catalano, 1990). Classroom learning environments
influence student learning (Ames, 1992). Classrooms environments promoting alienation
instead of success and bonding contribute to academic failure, low educational
commitment, and even drug abuse (Hawkins & Catalano, 1990). School climate
influences school bonding or connectedness (Simon-Morton et al., 1999). Students who
enjoy their classes; think their teachers treat everyone fairly and are supportive; have
many friends; and accept their school values and rules are connected to the school
(Simon-Morton et al., 1999). Positive classroom environment can increase academic
achievement, commitment to education, and bonding to teachers and schools (Hawkins &
Catalano, 1990). Schools should function as health promoting environments for children
which will reduce health problems and schools should be created that are more effective
in achieving the mission of education (Hawkins & Catalano, 1990).
Teachers display stress affecting student academic achievement and the school
environment (Froeschle & Crews, 2010). Positive school climate is often included in
schoolwide initiatives because it is a component of successful, effective schools (Koth,
Bradshaw, & Leaf, 2008). School climate is determined by quality of relationships,
teaching, collaboration, and support in schools (Collie et al., 2012). School climate
includes the beliefs, values, and attitudes of students, teachers, and administrators (Koth,
Bradshaw, & Leaf, 2008). Academic achievement and performance are linked to school
climate, as well as, student misconduct, aggression, adjustment problems, and behavior
problems (Koth, Bradshaw, & Leaf, 2008). Interventions have been proposed to improve
school climate, one of which is including a pet in the building for human-animal
interactions. Having animals in the classroom adds to the ambience and emotional health

60
of the room (Rud & Beck, 2000). Animals cause a change in the atmosphere leading to
an atmosphere of warmth, acceptance, and empathy (Prothmann et al., 2006).
Some schools are moving toward a more holistic education of children including
social, emotional, and academic (Friesen, 2012). They work to improve children’s
attitudes about school with the unconditional acceptance and trust of animals through
animal-assisted literacy (Friesen, 2012). The physical touch and interaction with an
animal gives an atmosphere of warmth to an environment (Friesen, 2012). Classrooms
that are receptive to dogs, improve the rapport between children and animals; create a
bridge between the children and adults; and develop a learning environment that is calm,
happy, safe, and comfortable (Friesen, 2012).
Life satisfaction indicates overall satisfaction and contentment with the quality of
one’s present life (Suldo, Thalji-Raitano, Hasemeyer, Gelley, & Holy, 2013). School
climate is the atmosphere for learning, including the feelings people have about the
school, and makes the school a place where teachers and students want to spend time, it is
a good place to be (Suldo et al., 2013). When Suldo et al. conducted a study in 2013 on
the connection o f school climate and life satisfaction, they concluded that higher life
satisfaction occurred with the greater perception of school climate. With youth, life
satisfaction is relevant to educators due to the link with student social emotional,
behavioral, and academic outcomes (Suldo et al., 2013). Happier students perceive better
relationships with teachers (Suldo et al., 2013). Students who have high life satisfaction
experience satisfying relationships, social support, high self-esteem, less depression, and
less aggression (Suldo et al., 2013). Positive perceptions of academic success and

61
supportive relationships promote life satisfaction (Suldo et al., 2013). The environment
in which students learn can promote life satisfaction (Suldo et al., 2013).
Similarly, Collie, Shapka, and Perry (2012) researched school climate, however,
their focus was on the teachers’ perceptions and their sense of stress, teaching efficacy,
and job satisfaction. School climate is viewed as the quality and character of the school
(Collie et al., 2012). Negative perceptions of school climate are associated with bumout
and absence of work commitment for teachers and lack of achievement and school
connectedness for students (Collie et al., 2012). Teacher perception of climate contribute
to their sense of stress, teaching efficacy, and job satisfaction (Collie et al., 2012). Sense
of teaching efficacy is the judgment of one’s capabilities to bring about student
engagement and learning even for unmotivated or difficult students (Collie et al., 2012).
Stress, teaching efficacy, and job satisfaction relate to teacher motivation, engagement,
and commitment to teaching (Collie et al., 2012). Job satisfaction is the sense of
fulfillment from the work (Collie et al., 2012). Motivation, well-being, and commitment
to teaching are related to job satisfaction for teachers (Collie et al., 2012). Teachers who
have less stress, greater teaching efficacy, and more job satisfaction inspire academic
achievement and self-efficacy in students (Collie et al., 2012). Perception of teachers
about their environment influences their stress, teaching efficacy, and job satisfaction
(Collie et al., 2012). Student learning, achievement, and happiness are boosted by
positive school climates (Collie et al., 2012). School climate is a determining factor of
teacher and student success (Collie et al., 2012).
School counselor, Nebbe (1991) used animals to help create rapport with students
at her school by providing a point of interest in an accepting, caring, and relaxing

62
atmosphere. Pets are an important part of a child’s environment, teaching responsibility,
empathy, and sharing (Nebbe, 1991). Children’s self-esteem is raised, they have
companionship, someone to talk to, and a sense of constancy in their environment when
they have a pet (Nebbe, 1991). When using animals in counseling, Nebbe (1991) wrote
that the warmth, acceptance, and uninhibited response make the presence of an animal
enhance the atmosphere and make it one of trust, respect, and concern.
A positive school climate influences academic success as does viewing the school
climate as important for the school outcome (Wang et al., 2014). The school climate
refers to the quality and character of school life (Wang et al., 2014). Bullying and
academic success of children are linked to school climate (Wang et al., 2014). School
climate is also known as school connectedness, school engagement, and student
satisfaction with school (Wang et al., 2014). Safety, peer relations, teacher support,
academic engagement, discipline and fairness, belonging, school liking, student voice,
and extracurricular activities are the concepts tied to school climate (Wang et al., 2014).
Members of the school climate should feel connected, that they belong, matter to one
another, and that their needs are met in the community (Wang et al., 2014). Students who
are bullied have a lower school connectedness and have a more negative perception of the
school climate than students who are not bullied (Wang et al., 2014). When students are
in an atmosphere in which they do not feel comfortable taking academic risks and they do
not feel connected to school, their engagement in school may be limited (Wang et al.,
2014). A positive school climate and school connectedness can improve students’
academic success (Wang et al., 2014). Fair and consistent discipline coupled with
teachers and staff that are available and caring make a supportive environment (Wang et

63
al., 2014). A healthy school climate promotes connectedness, academic achievement,
learning, and development in students (Wang et al., 2014).
Student attitudes and success are influenced by their parents’ attitudes (Schueler,
Capotosto, Bahena, McIntyre, & Gehlbach, 2014). Parents’ perceptions of schools
influence their child’s attitude toward the school, to what extent families engage with the
school, and where the families live (Schueler et al., 2014). A child’s attitude toward the
school influences their motivation, behavior, and academic performance (Schueler et al.,
2014). The perception of the parent influences the child’s opinion about the school
climate which affects the student’s achievement (Schueler et al., 2014). Positive
perceptions o f school climate by parents is tied to their level of engagement with the
school (Schueler et al., 2014). Many parents choose where to live based on the schools
and their perceptions of the school climate (Schueler et al., 2014).
Perceptions o f school climate represent the way that students feel about school
environment (White, La Salle, Ashby, & Meyers, 2014). Positive perceptions are
associated with academic success and negative perceptions are related to negative
behaviors (White et al., 2014). School climates that are positive reduce bullying and
other negative behaviors (White et al., 2014). In positive school climates, the
relationships between students and adults are positive, bullying is lessened, and students
feel supported and seek help when bullying occurs (White et al., 2014). A 2014 study by
White et al., revealed that minority students report more negative perceptions of school
climate than White students. Males are more likely than females to engage in disruptive
behavior and they see the school environment as less safe (White et al., 2014). Student
perception of school climate correlated with bullying behaviors for males (White et al.,

64
2014). However, those students with positive perceptions of school climates indicated
that they would help someone being bullied (White et al., 2014). Student perceptions of
school climate predict student behavior, achievement, and participation in bullying
(White et al., 2014).
Y.A.L.E. Cherry Hill uses five dogs that are currently in training to become
certified therapy dogs to improve their environments (LeGoff, 2010). They have used
other animals such as horses and cats, but currently their dogs are participating in animalassisted therapy involving a goal-directed intervention (LeGoff, 2010). The presence of a
dog in the environments reduces physical anxiety symptoms and increases participation
of students in therapy (LeGoff, 2010). The students in classrooms with the dogs, had a
more positive attitude toward academics, participate more in activities, and are more selfconfident (LeGoff, 2010). Social interaction and communication has been enhanced in
the classrooms with the dogs (LeGoff, 2010). Therapy dogs have enriched the
environment as they act as teaching assistants and therapeutic adjuncts in the classrooms
with positive behavior being initiated and negative behaviors being decreased among the
students (LeGoff, 2010). Needed physical stimulation has been enhanced as outdoor
physical activity has increased for the students as they walk the dogs or throw a ball or
Frizbee for the dogs to retrieve (LeGoff, 2010).
Theoretical Framework
Pets are thought to offer benefits, enjoyment, and companionship to children and
are part of their social support network (McNicholas & Collis, 2001). Because pets fulfill
part of the needed companionship for a child, as well as improving the self-esteem of a
child, animals contribute to the child’s Hierarchy of Needs as explained by Maslow

65
(1943). Maslow arranged the needs into a pyramid (see Figure A), the lower on the
pyramid that the need is the more powerful it is. Only humans have the higher needs.
The base on the pyramid contains the physiological needs for food, water, air, and sleep.
The second level consists of the safety needs of dependence, stability, safety, and
security. The third level comprises the need for love and belonging and includes family,
friendship, and the drive to belong. The fourth level is self-esteem and the fifth level is
self-actualization (Datta, 2010; Litwack, 2007). The physiological, safety, and social
needs reduce motivation when satisfied and the self-esteem and self-actualization needs
increase motivation when satisfied, so growth produces growth (Kampmeier, 1976).
Behavior is prodded by the need to gain a sense of well-being and actions are driven by
the perceived tangible which will satisfy a need since unsatisfied needs create discomfort
(Kampmeier, 1976).
Figure 1 depicts Maslow’s Hierarchy of Human Needs starting at the bottom with
the most necessary needs and going up to the top ending with the least necessary needs.
The bottom layer consists of the needs that are the most necessary to survival, the
Physiological Needs o f water, food, air and sleep. The next level up is Safety and
Security which is comprised of health, dependence, and stability. The third level is Love
and Belonging which contains friendship, family, and connection. The fourth level is
Self-Esteem which entails confidence and achievement. And finally, the top level is SelfActualization which involves morality, acceptance, and meaning.

Figure 1. M aslow’s Hierarch o f Human Needs
Even though Glasser’s beliefs of the needs of people are slightly different than
Maslow’s, interaction with animals would still contribute to fulfill these needs. At
different times, Glasser identified various needs; however, in 1981 he identified basic
needs of survival, love and belonging, recognition, freedom, and fun as the basic needs
(Litwack, 2007). Later, Glasser identified the essential human needs as the need to love
and be loved; the need to feel a sense of worthiness; the need to have fun and enjoy life;
and the need to be free and in control of one’s destiny (Kim, 2002). In fact, Glasser starts
his therapy with the direction of the first step to help oneself is to make friends
(Kampmeier, 1976). Maslow and Glasser started with the physiological needs for
survival, but Glasser did not have safety as part of his needs though Maslow did. They
both had love and belonging as a need; however, Maslow focused on self-actualization as
the highest level and Glasser discussed fun as the highest level. Maslow believed that

67
needs were intrinsic and Glasser believed that the needs were genetic (Litwack, 2007).
Animals could fulfill the need of love, belonging, worthiness, and having fun. In Kim’s
2002 study using Glasser’s Reality Therapy, Kim concluded that when children do not
learn social skills, and they have insufficient social competence, it correlates with
psychological problems as adolescents.
Figure 2 portrays Glasser’s Hierarchy of Human Needs. The bottom of the figure
represents the most necessary needs for a human. Going up the diagram, each need
becomes less necessary until the top illustrates the need which is the least necessary. The
bottom, or most necessary is survival, second is love and belonging, third is power or
recognition, fourth is freedom, and finally, at the top is fun.

In Vygotsky’s theory of learning and development of children, he wrote that the
primary social development is the interaction between children (Bodrova, 2003). With
Vygotsky’s theory, the sequence of stages is determined by the dealings between

68
children’s existing competencies and their social situation (Bodrova, 2003). According
to Vygotsky, the environment shapes the content of the child’s mental functions and
foundation for their future (Bodrova, 2003). Reid, Jaccard, Treder, and Landesman
(1989) used an instrument based on the Vygotskian principals to learn more about middle
school children’s perceptions of social support. The authors noted that the children
surveyed disclosed that friends are the best source of companionship and second only to
parents in offering emotional support. As children sometimes regard animals as their
friends, the animals can provide companionship and emotional support (Reid et al.,
1989).
A social support network provides children with the support connected to overall
well-being, stability, and recognition of self-worth (Cohen & Wills, 1985). When a child
feels helpless and a loss of self-esteem they are stressed (Cohen & Wills, 1985). The
person’s social support network enables them to cope with the stress. Therefore, the
availability of the social support network provides esteem support and protection from
stressful events (Cohen & Wills, 1985). Children often treat animals as friends or
members of their family and see animals as keepers of secret feelings, givers of
unconditional love, and they enhance children’s coping techniques (Strand, 2004). When
children use a pet for comfort it is a self-calming technique that increases their positive
self-concept (Strand, 2004). Children with pets use coping strategies such as expressing
emotions, seeking social support, and problem solving more often than children without
pets (Strand, 2004). When animals are used as part of a humane education program, they
foster compassionate values such as integrity, honesty, and mercy (Daly & Suggs, 2010;

69
Zasloff & Hart, 1999). Animals can provide the consistency, nurturing, and acceptance
the child does not get elsewhere (Strand, 2004).
Teachers’ beliefs and support are needed for a school program involving humananimal interactions to be successful (Solomon, Battistich, & Horn, 1996). Teachers need
to expect the program to have a positive effect on the students for them to accept and
encourage the interactions. Correlations between teacher attitudes and classroom
practices show consistent and meaningful patterns of relationships (Solomon, Battistich,
& Horn, 1996).
Summary
Research involving patients in long-term care facilities and outpatient therapy
supports the idea that animals can have a positive effect on human physical and mental
health. Several studies provide evidence of the value and benefits that animals have for
children. Fonseca et al. (2011) said that children were intrinsically motivated to treat
animals well and validated that students have positive attitudes toward animals. Even
though there is agreement among researchers who have investigated the effects of
including animals within educational settings, the literature reviewed for this study
supports the idea that animals have a positive effect on the community, supports the idea
that animals have a positive effect on students in educational settings, and supports the
fact that animals have a positive effect on patients with emotional or medical disabilities.
In general, most research supports the positive aspects associated with animals and
human interactions. This thesis theorizes that adults will perceive that there will be
benefits in the use of animals in educational settings.

CHAPTER III
Method
Introduction
Interaction with animals has a positive effect on children’s physical health,
psychological well-being, social interaction, and academic achievement (Jalongo et al.,
2004). Children who are taught to respect animals learn to be responsible, nurturing,
caring, empathetic, and compassionate toward humans (Arkow, 2006). Closeness to
animals can reduce alienation (Levinson, 1978). Animals can reduce blood pressure,
heart rate, depression, and distress in children (Melson & Fine, 2000; Nagengast, Baun,
Megel, & Leibowitz, 1997). Animals provide consolation, reduce stress, and help adjust
to traumatic events (Poresky, 1988). When children are around animals, they feel
reassured, calm, secure, and have a feeling of being safe (Melson & Fine, 2000). Adults
who had interactive relationships with pets as children have more positive relationships,
positive attitudes toward animals, and positive self-concepts than those without pets
(Poresky, 1988).
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to determine how principals and teachers perceive
human-animal interactions in an educational setting. Therefore, this qualitative study
was designed to explore perceptions of principals, teachers, and staff using animals as
pets and animal-assisted therapy within the school setting. Adult views were explored
regarding the use of including animals as pets and AAT when used within the school
setting using semi-structured interviews with the administrators and faculty.

Research Questions
1. How do principals perceive human-animal interaction in educational settings?
2. How do teachers perceive human-animal interaction in educational settings?
Research Design
A qualitative approach was used to determine adults’ opinions about the use o f
live animals as pets and for AAT in their school buildings. A phenomenological
approach was used because this study involves real-life, contemporary settings. Creswell
(2013) describes phenomenological studies using the psychological perspective o f
Moustakas (1994) and the human science perspective o f Van Manen (1990).
Psychological and human science concepts were discussed in this study as in the example
o f stress being relieved by animals.
The shared experience o f having a cat as a pet in the library at one school and a
dog assisting the counselor in another school were described. This description included
the adults’ feelings about and perceptions of these experiences. In-depth data were
gathered from these recorded semi-structured interviews.
Selection o f Participants
Two o f the schools in this selected Texas school district use live animals; the
Grade 6 campus uses a cat as a pet in the library and the elementary campus uses a dog in
AAT with the counselor. I chose these two schools because they use live animals and are
in the district in which I work which makes them convenient. Administrators and faculty
o f the two schools were the participants of this study. One administrator at each o f the
two schools was interviewed first. After the principals o f each school were interviewed,
teachers were asked to volunteer to be interviewed at each school. Participants were

72
chosen at random from the volunteers. Data was collected through semi-structured
interviews with between 3 and 15 people as suggested by Creswell (2013). I started with
interviewing 3 teachers at each school and did not need to add more interviews to get a
complete view o f the perspectives of the principals and teachers.
Procedures
To begin the process, permission was asked o f the school districts to do this study
with employees o f the school districts on school property. The approval letter is
Appendix C. Upon successful defense o f this proposal, the next step was the filing o f an
application with the Sam Houston State University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).
When the IRB approved the application, the procedure was able to progress. The IRB
Approval letter appears in Appendix D.
Before the study started, a signed consent form was obtained from the adults
involved. The consent form included the purpose o f the study, the description o f the
study, length o f time the participant would be involved in the study, a description o f risks
that might be encountered as well as benefits that might be expected. A statement
explaining the extent to which the results will be kept confidential was incorporated on
the form as well as names o f people the participant can contact with questions about the
study. The form included a statement that assured participation was voluntary and that
participants could withdraw at any time. The consent form appears in Appendix E.
Due to the qualitative methodology, two schools were chosen. The research
project was clearly explained in layman terms for participant understanding before a
request for participant consent. After the explanation o f the study is made at each school,
faculty and staff were given the opportunity to volunteer for participation in the

73
interviews. Names were selected from these volunteers and an administrator was also
chosen to be interviewed regarding their perceptions and observations of the use of
animals at each school. The semi-structured individual interviews were conducted and
recorded at each school. Field notes were taken during the interviews of the teachers and
administrators. Subsequently, the recorded interviews were transcribed for analysis.
Data Analysis
In 1994, Moustakas wrote that when compiling data in a phenomenological study,
the writer understands that individuals view their experiences in different ways. Data
were collected by interviewing volunteer adults who had experienced the phenomenon of
the use of live animals as pets and for AAT in educational settings. Member-checking
was used to share the transcripts with the participants to assure that he/she agreed with
what was written. Each participant was interviewed once; however, participants were
given the opportunity to add any information at this time. The interviews were recorded
and later transcribed for analysis. The responses were divided into units that convey
distinct ideas. The units were coded into categories. Coding and grouping were used in
the data analysis of the interview transcripts. Significant statements and themes were
used to write about the experiences.
Summary
The Methodology section in Chapter III includes an introduction, the research
questions that guided this study, a description of the participant selection, a report on the
instrumentation, an explanation of the research design, an account of the procedures, and
a data analysis summary. The questions used for the interviews are included in this
chapter. Tables are included to show the results of this study in this chapter. In Chapter

74
IV, the results of the study are presented. The results of the study are followed by a
summary, conclusion, and recommendation.

CHAPTER IV
Data Analysis
Introduction
The purpose of this study was to determine how adults perceive human-animal
interactions in an educational setting. In this study, qualitative data were collected via
interviews and used to determine the opinions of the principals and teachers of two
schools. In this chapter, I presented the results of the qualitative data and the analysis of
the data in regard to the research questions guiding this study.
Research Questions
1. How do principals perceive human-animal interaction in educational settings?
2. How do teachers perceive human-animal interaction in educational settings?
Analysis o f Data
This qualitative study investigated the perceptions of principals and teachers of
human-animal interaction in educational settings. Using the participants’ responses in the
interviews, I described and interpreted the data to understand the phenomenon. The
analysis of the responses began with circling the important phrases from each participant
on the transcribed interview. After color-coding patterns of responses, themes emerged.
The themes became categories and repetitions of responses were noted.
This chapter includes the results of the data analysis. First, I described the
characteristics of the principals and teachers who participated in the interviews. Next, the
results o f the quantitative analysis were examined.

76
Participant Characteristics
The two principals that participated in the interviews are both females, one in her
30s and one in her 40s. The ethnicity of all of the participants is white. O f the six
teachers that were interviewed, five are female and one is male. The ages of the teachers
varies, three of the teachers are in their 30s, one of the teachers is in their 40s and two of
the teachers are in their 50s.
Demographic information about the participants in the study is represented in
Table 1. The two principals and six teachers are included on the table. It reveals the age,
experience, gender, and ethnicity of each participant.

Results
By conducting interviews with the principals and teachers, I sought to clarify their
perspectives of human-animal interactions, including pets and AAT, in school
environments. Each participant was asked the same eight questions, with additional
questions asked when additional information was necessary for understanding. All o f the

77
interviews were taped on my phone using the SpeakEasy application. After each
interview, I transcribed it, and then member-checked, giving the interviewee the
opportunity to make any adjustments to their answers that they felt were needed due to
inaccuracies or clarification. This procedure ensured that there was no misinterpretation
of their views and comments. I began the analysis of the transcribed interviews by
identifying significant statements, categories, and descriptions. Grouping the significant
statements, I established themes. The themes that emerged from the interviews with the
principals were the same themes that emerged from the interviews with the teachers. As
Moustakas (1994) suggested, I closed with something from each of the schools that I
researched that spoke to the essence of the study and inspired me.
Question 1: How do principals perceive human-animal interaction in educational
settings?
The two principals both spoke positively about their schools and the animals that
interacted with the students. Principal 1 not only discussed the cat in the library, she also
spoke of snakes and turtles in classrooms at her school. Principal 2 communicated about
the dogs in the office area of her school and also talked about the guinea pigs that many
of the teachers have in their classrooms at her school. The themes for the principals are
relationships, use o f animals, benefits, school environment, and teaching children.
Benefits. The principals considered several benefits that existed as a result of
having animals in their schools. Principal 2 said, “ It is a happier campus; not that it
wasn’t already happy, but even happier.”
The one word that was used the most by both principals was excite. They
conversed about the excitement of knowing there was an animal in the building and the

78
excited look on children’s faces as they interacted with the animals. Principal 1
expressed it this way:
From what I have seen at our school, from the pets that we have had on our
campus, is it gets the kid interested and excited. Anything that we can do to get
the kids excited about being at school. They are so excited that they get to come
to a school where they have a school pet.
The faces of the children brightened, their mood improved, they were interested
in what was going on with the animal, and were not afraid. Principal 1 talked about the
snake at her campus:
I walked into the science classroom and the child had the snake around their
shoulders and class is going on as normal, but for that kid, they were just focused,
and they just had this snake hanging out with them.
Principal 1 is aware of the fear that children have toward some animals and is
encouraged by the opportunity that children have to interact with animals at school, “I
think a lot of these kids have learned that they do not have to fear some of these animals.”
In reviewing the attitude that the adults in the building have about the pet cat in
the library, Principal 1 said,
I do enjoy seeing the cat in our library, as well, even for our staff like when we
are having a faculty meeting and the cat jumps up on the table in the meeting, it is
just part o f it, and again it brings us together as a family.
After the initial excitement, the students become calm and relaxed, with a
continued focus on the animal. Thrilled parents often communicated their happiness at
the refreshing idea of using pets with children. Principal 1 added, “Parents can be

79
comforted and reassured and we answer those questions carefully, and it ends up being a
positive experience for everybody.”
Related to the discussion of how parents reacted to animals being used in the
building when Principal 2 added
Parents who come in and see the therapy dogs for the first time are just thrilled. I
can’t tell you how many times we see this with new families. W e’ve never had a
parent want us to take the dogs away.
Relationships. When the principals discussed their school environments, they
both discussed the importance of animals in making the school happier. Principal 2
stated, “I think having their presence in the building is a very calming presence for some
reason.” Principal 1 described her faculty as a family and the importance of quickly
connecting the students to the school so that they could feel part of the family:
You know we are really trying to promote a kind of feeling of family around here
and when we have the pets in your environment that feeling of family and making
those connections is just increased. That is what we want for the kids to feel a part
of here, to feel a connection here.
Making a connection with the students is critical and the pets in the building make those
connections increase. Principal 1 suggested, “Animals, pets, are just a refreshing thing, a
thing that kids can attach to, and connect to, and feel a connection with here.”
When the students feel a connection to the school, they care more about the
school, the people at the school, and their performance at school. Van Ryzin, Gravely,
and Roseth (2009) studied autonomy, belongingness, and engagement in schools and they
wrote that belongingness or connectedness is critical to adolescent success in school.

80
Belongingness promotes motivation, engagement, and academic achievement (Van Ryzin
et al., 2009). Higher sociability, competence, self-esteem and reduced hostility,
anxiousness, and depression are linked to the feeling of belonging (Van Ryzin et al.,
2009). Students who believe they are in a supportive environment are more actively
engaged and hopeful (Van Ryzin et al., 2009). Principal 1 said, “Some students find that
connection by becoming attached to the cat.” Both principals also expressed the positive
opportunity students have at schools with animals when they may not have a pet at home.
Principal 1 expressed this opportunity this way:
I just saw the difference she made in the children’s lives. Especially those
children who come from low economic homes where their families are struggling
financially, and they may not have a pet in the home. It gives them the
opportunity to have their own pet at school. I saw the difference it made in those
children’s lives.
Principal 2 discussed the solace that interacting with an animal gives to a child,
“Some children need extra love and the comfort and reassurance they feel by holding,
touching, or just talking to an animal gives them the feeling of closeness they need.”
When a student at her school lost his parent, Principal 2 discussed the beneficial
interaction of the child with the dog:
It has helped him, just his mood. I think it gives them the little bit of closeness
that they are lacking at the time. Whether they are hurting over a divorce
situation or a death or what have you that is going on at home.
The children feel loved and comforted after having interactions with the animals.
Principal 2 said, “The animals make a difference in the children’s lives.”

81
School environment. The principals described that change in the environment
that they experienced due to the presence of animals in their school buildings. Principal 1
communicated the effect of animals on the school environment saying
Just that calming effect for some of them. You would think that having the
animal would make them get rambunctious or worked up, but it does not have that
effect at all. It is comforting and calming to have the animals around. It I think
just their overall presence, just having them in the building is a benefit.
Principal 2 portrayed the feeling of the dog on the school environment when she
added
I would say that the dog has a calming, relaxing effect on the school. I think it
has changed the whole environment of our campus, it really has. Just to be able to
go in there and pet the dog, even hold him, even just for a couple of minutes, it
just makes you relax more and we see that a lot with children.
The positive impression of the animals in the classrooms started with a feeling of
excitement and anticipation from the animals just being in the building. Principal 1
talked about the reputation of having a cat as a pet in the library. “You hear the kids
talking about the cat we have in the library; it makes them want to visit the library.”
When students and faculty have the opportunity to positively interact with the
animals, they experience the calming effect of animals. Students are able to talk to the
animals and open up about their lives. Principal 2 commented, “I have seen some of the
kids talk to the animals and they just seem so calm.”
The relationship of a particular student interacting with the pet cat was described
by Principal 1:

82
We have a young man who is attached to this cat, and he looks forward to coming
in in the morning and checking on the cat, saying hello to the cat that is his
positive interaction that he has during the day.
Whether the animals are used in a central area or in the classrooms, they have a
positive influence on the dynamics. The addition of animals to the school environment
make a difference for these two schools and are good for the staff and students. Principal
1 commented, “It brings us together as a family and that is good for our staff as well as
our students.”
Use o f animals. Principal 1 was satisfied with the use of the pets in the library
and science rooms at her school:
You know, I limit my interaction with animals a little bit more than the kids do. I
think kids are braver that I am with their interaction. For instance, I am still
getting used to the snake that a teacher has in her room.
However, Principal 2 expressed a desire for the teachers at her school to utilize
the dog more:
So he [the dog] is there for them when they need him, but I was telling the
secretary the other day, we really need to talk to team leaders about them utilizing
him more. The teachers need to use the dog more.
Principal 2 gave further examples of the teachers who send their students to the
office to pet the dog as a reward for something special or get to walk the dog outside and
play with him as part of a reward system.
I think that therapy dogs can be used with children like we use them with children
in our ABU (Adaptive Behavior Unit). They get some time with Cowboy, and it

83
helps. For the rest of the year, the student with behavior issues made
improvement with his behavior.
Success was declared by Principal 2 when verbalizing interventions in behavior
and an improvement of behavior of a particular child.
This child really had to work for it. He was in trouble all of the time, but by the
end of the week, he was allowed to have some time with Cowboy Charlie. It
meant something to him because he got to play with Cowboy, nobody else in his
class got to play with Cowboy.
Teacher tolerance was understood by both principals, some people are animal
lovers and some just are not. Principal 2 noted,
Teachers either feel one way or the other. We have teachers here who don’t care
for the dogs to come into their classrooms. Then we have other teachers here who
love for the dogs to come into their classrooms. I think a lot of it is innate. I
think you have to be an animal lover to begin with. I think you have to be able to
tolerate animals. I don’t think you can make somebody like it or motivate
someone to want to use it. A lot of times we have the children come down here to
the office. That could be for allergy reasons, maybe there is a child in there who
cannot be exposed to animal hair— that kind of thing. It also has to do with
teacher tolerance, they may not prefer it.

84
Teaching children. Because the schools had an array of techniques in the use of
animals, the principals felt that a variety of methods are used in the classroom and other
areas with the animals. Principal 2 declared:
You can interact with some of the animals in different ways. Whether it be
needing the animal for behavior intervention with a single student, use it as part of
a reward system, or like I said, a child that just needs some extra love.
However, there were many similarities in what the students learned from the
animals. Types of things that students learn from animals was described by Principal 2:
I think that reading with the dog teaches the students that the dog has to be
patient, too. And that the dogs have to follow the rules. The animals are here for
a reason and their reason is to help our children at school. I think interacting with
the dog teaches the students those things, just some of the important things in life
you can’t always teach, you have to experience.
Compassion was the word used most often when describing what the students
learned from the animals and it was closely followed by patience. Principal 2 continued,
“I think they learn compassion, patience because they have seen that they have to be still
and they have to sit, and they have to listen.”
If students do not already care about animals, most of them quickly do after
interacting with them. The students have to use self-control when approaching the
animals and be willing to adjust to the distinctive situations. Approaching animals was
discussed by Principal 1:

85
Self-control is part of it, you know there are definitely some animals that let you
know they do not want you to get too close. They have to know how to approach
the animal, they have to think about, how do I walk up to this animal?
Principal 1 also approached the necessity for children to learn about inevitable
changes in their lives, “They (children) have to learn how to adjust and transition to
different situations, that is a big benefit for the students to learn.”
Another benefit the principals mentioned was responsibility toward the animals.
Whether it was taking care of the animals or acting appropriately around them. Examples
were given by Principal 2, “Kind of like being the line leader, who gets to feed the pet
today? It is just one of those jobs, those responsibilities that you get to have the kids do
in the classroom.”
Five themes that surfaced during the principal interviews are represented in Table
2. The five themes are Benefits, Relationships, Environment, Use, and Teaching. The
words listed under each theme are the words used by the principals that established the
different themes. The words toward the top of each column were used the most and the
words at the bottom of each column were words that were used the least. The number
beside each word is the number of times that word was used during the principal
interviews. For instance, the word “relax” was used two times and it demonstrates a
benefit. Table 2 presents the words that guided me toward the themes.

Question 2: How do teachers perceive human-animal interaction in educational
settings?
The six teachers were all very cooperative in the interviews. Although they all
had positive feelings toward animals, they had assorted views about the diverse animals
at their schools. Certain teachers were afraid of some types of animals, but not afraid of
other types of animals. Some teachers expressed concerns over the breed of dog at their
school because it is known to be a one person dog, as well as unease about the expense of
having a pure bred dog owned and cared for by the school. The teachers communicated
that more of them would use the dogs in their classrooms if the program was
implemented more like a reading dog program, where only one child would read with the
dog at a time. Other teachers articulated dissatisfaction with the training the dogs had
received, saying that the dogs bark at other pets in the classroom, cry for their owner, and
urinate uncontrollably when excited. They also realized that sometimes they just forget
to use the animals because they are busy with their curriculum. Some of the teachers
thanked me for talking to them because it made them realize how positive working with
animals can be and they want to make a concerted effort to use them more. The themes
for the teachers are relationships, school environment, benefits use of animals, and
teaching children.
Benefits. Even though the addition of animals to a school environment compel a
feeling o f excitement among the students, the teachers expressed that interacting with the
animals also calms and relaxes the students. Teacher 1 enlightened:

88
If you could put an animal in the room with the children and get them to feel
secure and comfortable and confident even, I think that helps the learning
environment in any class. I think it is has a calming effect overall. There is
something about if they are able to be shown how to calmly pet the cat, it does
have a calming nature on them as well.
When the teachers talked about the benefits of animals in a school environment,
Teacher 5 said, “The student who was once embarrassed to read aloud, let down his
guard and began to feel relaxed while reading to the dog.” Teacher 3 added, “Generally I
see the kids pet her (the cat), you know occasionally learning to be calm and let her come
to them and rather than trying to chase her down.”
Through interaction with the forgiving animals, the joyful students improve their
self-esteem and have greater self-confidence. Teacher 4 described the interactions, “Like
I said, unconditional love, when you interact with animals... you know when you are
feeling sad and the puppy runs up to you wagging its tail, it is hard to feel sad.”
One teacher described having an animal as therapeutic because it lessens anxiety,
boosts morale, and raises the spirits. Teacher 1 gave her opinion:
Not being an expert in the area, just based on observations, what I see happening
at our campus, it is almost a therapeutic type situation, where the animal kind of
raises the spirits of the kids. Learning is more fun and enjoyable.
Likewise, Teacher 5 said, “The addition of animals in schools create better
attendance, boosts morale, and improves self-esteem.”
Learning is easier for the children because they are happy and comfortable.

89
Teacher 4 said, “It just makes it more fun.” Teacher 1 elucidated, “The thing is, when
kids are happy and they are comfortable, they learn better. It just is one thing that the
kids enjoy when they come to the library, seeing Fiver there.” Likewise, Teacher 5 said:
I think they can make kids feel comforted when they are nervous. I think they
offer a lot of support. Children are more actively engaged with pets in the
classroom and when students are more actively engaged, learning is easier. They
are just so nonjudgmental.
When children interact with nonjudgmental animals, they are actively engaged,
their mood is improved, and they have fun, smile, and even laugh. Teacher 2 said, “You
walk past the library here and you see Fiver sitting in the window and you just kind of
smile.” Teacher 1 added, “If you have the opportunity to see a child that excited or make
a child that excited in school that is pretty exceptional.”
Relationships. Caring for and about the animals was discussed more than
anything else when interviewing the teachers. Teacher 1 said, “To learn how important
their actions can be, those actions of a child, taking care of a living animal and keeping
that going in the classroom.”
Teacher 6 commented, “I think that they add so much caring and nurturing
aspects to the classroom, the kids leam how to take care of them, they leam what their
needs are, how to handle something that is smaller than them.”
Additionally, Teacher 5 said, “Observing and caring for animals instills a sense of
respect for life. Students will see directly how their behavior and actions affect others.”
They stressed that interaction with the animals allowed the students to experience
caring about an animal and learning what is need to take care of an animal. Teacher 5

90
explained, “These lessons are learned from interactions with animals, but the skills
learned can be applied to human interaction.”
Observing the animals permitted the children a time to enjoy and learn about the
animals, many times becoming focused. A specific observation was described by
Teacher 3, “Fiver was sitting right in the middle of that stack of chairs sort of holding
court and all of the boys were just sitting around watching her do her thing. They were
focused on what Fiver was doing.”
Communication with the animals was another popular topic. The teachers
understood that the children, especially shy children, felt more comfortable with the
animals and often talked to them and opened up about their personal problems.
Connecting with animals was described by Teacher 4:
They can connect with an animal as they have not been able to connect with
people. Or they are afraid to tell an adult something or even another child
something. They may have fears about sharing something, they can share it with
the animal.
Similarly, Teacher 6 described the connection between animals and children,
“There are a lot of times when they just sit and talk to them and it is just so
nonjudgmental and that is a lot of what my kids need.”
That is also why the children like to read to the animals, they are nonjudgmental.
An example was given by Teacher 4:
Just the excitement and reward they get from reading to the animal and the love
they get from them, the puppy kisses are beneficial. Like with the guinea pig and

91
even with the dogs, they are nervous about reading to adults or family, they can
read to the animals.
Similarly, an example of reading to an animal was given by Teacher 5:
I had a reading dog that would come and the kids could take turns reading to the
dog. A very quiet student I had come to life when given the opportunity to read to
the dog. The student ‘came out of his shell’. He felt as if he had an important
purpose for coming to school. The dog provided unconditional love, and was a
very good listener. The dog did not criticize or judge his reading ability. This
was fun and non-stressful to the student, amazingly enough the students reading
dramatically improved!
Furthermore, Teacher 6 gave her opinion about children reading to animals:
My guinea pigs loves to be read to. The guinea pig likes to sit on the table or on
their lap and they read to the guinea pig and they just like to read to the guinea
pigs because they are just so nonjudgmental, I don’t know how else to say it. The
guinea pig doesn’t correct them or care about mistakes.
Human interaction also increased as an effect of animals in the class. Teacher 6
said, “They are calming, it de-stresses you.”
The classroom environment became a place where the students had to cooperate
and work together as a class with the animals forming friendships with each other and the
animals. An explanation of her class interacting with a guinea pig was given by Teacher
4:

92
When we get the guinea pig out, we have to sit in a circle and they all have to
work together so he does not run between their legs and run off into the other part
of the room. They kind of rally together and cooperate with each other.
When a school has an animal and the teachers see the animal, it becomes like a
mascot and like a team building experience. Visiting the dogs in the office was
articulated by Teacher 4:
I go on my conference period and play with them, but they are just very sweet and
fun to be around. I love, love, love those dogs. I am an animal lover though. I go
and visit them on my off time of I will go walk them sometimes when we have inservice days or work days, they are sweet. Even as an adult, after a bad day, there
are many times that I go to the office and there are teachers in there playing with
the dogs. So, they are just very calming, loving.
Companionship is a benefit for the children when with the animals. The bond that
formed between the children and the animals increased with the arrival of animals. In
describing the staff and students feelings toward the cat, Teacher 1 said, “Yea! There is
our cat! Fiver is our cat!”
School environment. Two of the teachers felt that they should use animals on
their campus more than they do. Three other teachers enjoy having animals on campus,
but did not express the need to start using them in their classrooms. One teacher felt that
she uses animals all the time and appreciates what they add to the classroom. When

asked about how they could use animals, the answers included read with, incentive,
motivation, use as a special treat or part of a reward system.
Motivation and companionship were mentioned by Teacher 3, “I think it
definitely motivates, it can be a motivator to get kids to do things because most of us
enjoy the companionship of being around an animal.” Teacher 6 said:
It made kids that were absent a lot want to be at school, especially when they
were given responsibilities helping to take care of the pets. To have the dogs
come and visit is a special treat. My kids, if they need the dog, we get the dog.
They have tokens that they earn spending time with the dog, to play with the dogs
and the guinea pigs. Rotating through jobs, petting, interaction with the pets,
could also use the pet as a reward. Animals can be used to strengthen social
skills. It just makes us more aware of the different style to teach and what else it
takes to teach, it is not all textbook and everything, you have to teach a lot of
those social skills, and the emotions, and how to care for things.
Teacher 5 and Teacher 4 said, “You can read with an animal.” One teacher
discussed the use of writing about animals in their past teaching assignment, however,
they do not employ that tactic at this time. Teacher 2 described it:
Years ago, when I was teaching a GED course, when I would teach how to write
an essay, the first topic I always used was, and these were young adults, 18-21
years old, the prompt was: Every year Americans spend millions of dollars on
their pets, pets are important to people for many reasons, explain some reasons
pets are important. So that was always a real easy essay to get the topic to get
people started. Because then we would brainstorm, okay why are pets important.

94
They would say companionship for an older person, protection like a dog in your
yard to protect the place. So that was always a good topic to start off because
everyone could relate to having a pet.
Teacher 6 uses guinea pigs as well as the dogs:
They love math, the guinea pigs love to do math. So when they are working on
their math with the guinea pigs, they are walking through the processes to tell the
guinea pigs what to do so it just works for them.
Teacher 4 considered using an animal in a “safe spot.” She described a safe spot
in her classroom as:
a spot in the classroom for conscience discipline. It is where the kids go
whenever they are feeling sad or upset. There are some things there. It might be
a picture book, a stuffed animal, and then some exercises they can do to either
wind down if they are uptight or upset or just to comfort them.
Continuing, Teacher 4 said,
I would use the animal for a safe spot or reading groups or just as a reward, if the
children were having a hard day, to turn it around. I would probably let them go
visit with the dog or the guinea pig.
Finally, Teacher 6 discussed how she would use animals and said:
I would use the animals to teach a sense of responsibility. If the children want to
bring carrots for the guinea pig, they get to feed it to them when they do. They
have to show responsibility before they interact with the pet.

95
Use of animals. Exciting was the word most used by the teachers when
discussing the school environment with animals as a part of the environment. Teacher 4
said, “They get excited when they see them walk down the hall.”
Seeing the cat was described by Teacher 1, “My kids, when they go into the
library, some of them, they all enjoy Fiver in the library. But some of them are so
unbelievably excited to see Fiver.” Teacher 3 added, “When Fiver would come over and
actually let them pet her, they would be so excited, they would be like, and ‘She actually
let me touch her’ or ‘Look She likes me.’” Teacher 3 added, “They get excited at first
and then calm down.” The benefits for children was described by Teacher 4 when she
said:
The animals provide kids with not only excitement, but also a sense of comfort
when they need it. They get really excited and they get really still and they will
try to get the guinea pig to come over to them. We use it in ways to show them
they have to use quiet voices when around the animal or it scares them when you
don’t. They can write about it, describe it with adjectives or they can write about
their feelings toward it.
When discussing the school environment, Teacher 2 said, “The addition of
animals lightens the atmosphere, makes it more homelike, welcoming, and positive.”
Teacher 1 added:
I think that animals are an important part of our lives outside of school. I think
that most of us have really great experiences with pets. I think the more we can
bring outside things into a school and not make them so total different worlds,

96
kind of helps the kids understand that it is a loving place, it is a natural, normal
place where they can make connections from their real life to their school life.
It makes it more homelike.
The addition of an animal to the school environment was described by Teacher 4,
“Our atmosphere, since we have had the guinea big, is a lot more positive.” Teacher 6
added, “It was positive before, but now the dogs are so much fun, and they bring so much
joy to us and the kids.”
A friendly atmosphere, enhanced by animals makes it appear softer and more like
a natural, normal place. Teacher 2 portrayed the environment, “The school is a place
that they can visit with a pet and it makes it a friendlier atmosphere. She just kind of
softens the atmosphere.” Teacher 1 elucidated, “Bringing animals into the school is a
way to bring the outside in so it does not seem so strange, especially with young children.
I think it is spirit lifting.”
It gives students and staff a feeling of confidence in a comfortable, secure
environment. Teacher 6 revealed, “It (the addition of the dogs) made kids that were
absent a lot want to be at school.” Teacher 5 added, “They are calming and loving.”
An environment with animals is unique and the teachers said it was healthier to
have animals in their classrooms. Teacher 3 informed, “There are studies showing that
people who have animals are healthier.”
They believed that the animals compelled the students to feel happy and
comfortable which caused the students learn better, they had seen it work. Teacher 1
explained:

97
With Fiver, I love to go in there and just knowing that she is in the library makes
me happy, even if I don’t get to see her. Sometimes, just trying to pet her is fun,
it just makes you giggle.
Teaching children. Responsibility was mentioned most often by the teachers
when asked what students learn from animal interaction. Responsibility was mentioned
by Teacher 4, “You could motivate them by saying if you could do these things you are
definitely responsible enough to do things for the pet. They learn responsibility, and
love, unconditional love.” Teacher 6 also mentioned responsibility, “I could help teach
them responsibility. I could help them learn how to work together to keep something
alive.” Continuing the tie between animals and responsibility, Teacher 3 said, “Kids who
grow up with animals develop more responsibility and on the converse, people who
mistreat animals are likely to mistreat adults later on.”
Teacher 5 supposed that children would learn responsibility from the animals,
“They are welcoming, and they teach you responsibility.” Teacher 2 thought of several
things that children learn from interacting with animals: “Responsibility, compassion,
patience, those are probably the main things that are learned from interacting with
animals.” Finally, Teacher 1 said, “It is always something that they leam about
responsibility. How you behave, how you take care of animals.”
Empathy was the second most often used word when discussing use of animals in
schools with teachers. Teacher 1 described what children leam, “I think on top of
responsibility, they leam empathy; they learn how to be kind and be nice and how to
approach in a way that is not so aggressive.” Teacher 5 added, “Animals teach children
empathy.” Lastly, Teacher 6 described:

98
And to really empathize with them, because children are so much bigger. So
when the guinea pigs or dogs are on the floor they have to realize they are more
fragile, there is a different perspective when they have them out.
The teachers easily came up with several traits and emotions that children leam
when given the chance to be around animals, including patience, niceness, compassion,
kindness, and nurturing. The many characteristics enhance by animals were listed by
Teacher 5, “Animals can teach responsibility, compassion, empathy, kindness, friendship,
and patience. Care, empathy, love, communication, they leam so much.” Similarly
Teacher 6 listed traits, “Students leam respect, respect for animals, respect for other, and
respect for life. Their social skills improve as they learn to think outside themselves
because their behaviors and actions affect others.”
Teachers 1 and 2 mentioned research. Teacher 1 said, “It is proven that animal
can reduce the stress in an environment, Petting a soft, furry animal lowers your stress
and anxiety.” Teacher 2 added, “There are studies showing that people who have animals
are healthier.”
Teacher 5 added a personal interaction, “Working with animals instills a sense of
a respect for life in children. My son sleeps with a dog every night and he is healthy and
I think part of it is because of the dog.” Supporting the use of the pet cat in the library,
Teacher 3 said, “I think that it really speaks well of the idea of the fact that the kids seem
to respect her and give her space.” Finally, Teacher 4 said, “They do love the animals.”
Illustrated in Table 3 are five themes that emerged during the teacher interviews.
The five themes are Benefits, Relationships, Environment, Use, and Teaching, the same
that were revealed in the principal interviews. The words listed under each theme are the

99
words used by the teachers that established the different themes. The words toward the
top of each column were used the most and the words at the bottom of each column were
words that were used the least. The number beside each word is the number of times that
word was used during the principal interviews. For instance, the words “calm” or
“lessens anxiety” mean about the same thing and were used fourteen times during the
teacher interviews demonstrating a benefit of animals in education. Table 3 exhibits the
words that guided me toward the themes.

Sum m ary
The responses o f the participants were honest, heartfelt, and to different degrees
positive. The teachers apologized if they said something that was not completely
positive. I assured them that I wanted their honest opinions. The principals were proud
of their unique schools and the fact that they had a school pet or therapy dog. Often, the
classroom pets seemed more important to the teachers than the school pet or therapy dog.
Themes of the principal interviews and the teachers’ interviews were relationships, use of
animals, benefits, school environment, and teaching children.

103

CHAPTER V
Implications and Recommendations
Introduction
The purpose of my study was to investigate the perceptions of principals and
teachers about human-animal interaction in educational settings. I wanted to compare the
opinions of the principals and the teachers. Contrasting the pet cat at one school and the
therapy dog at another school was also an interest. The research questions I used were:
1. How do principals perceive human-animal interaction in educational settings?
2. How do teachers perceive human-animal interaction in educational settings?
My qualitative research study was to investigate the perceptions of principals and
teachers about human-animal interaction in educational settings. I interviewed the
principal and three teachers from an elementary school with a therapy dog and several
classroom pets. Also interviewed were the principal and three teachers from a middle
school with a pet cat and a few classroom pets. After transcribing the eight recorded
interviews, I analyzed the data to compare the responses. Several themes were revealed
from the principal interviews and the teacher interviews and discussed in Chapter IV.
Principal 1 expressed the benefits, excitement, connections, and calming effect
the school cat has on the students and faculty at her school. She also shared a story about
seeing a classroom snake draped around the shoulders of a student while he was working
and her amazement and disbelief at his focus and calmness. The enthusiasm o f Principal
2 about her therapy dog was infectious as she revealed a story about the dog and a student
who lost his mother to cancer recently. The pleasure of the comfort shown to the student

104
by the dog was satisfying to her. Principal 2 also discussed that she wanted the teachers
to utilize the therapy dog more than they do.
None of the teachers at the middle school with the cat had any classroom pets,
even though several of the classrooms at that school have fish, snakes, and turtles.
However, they all had positive comments about the school pet, the cat in the library.
Two of the teachers rarely visit the library, but walk by the glass windows daily and see
the cat. They also hear about the cat from their students. One of the teachers at the
middle school visits the library regularly, sometimes interacts with the cat, sees it in the
window, and hears about interactions with the cat from her students.
The cat in the library at the middle school is owned by the librarian who brings
her to school almost every day. I am the librarian. The exceptions to bringing her to
school are when there is bad weather or if I have an appointment immediately after
school and do not have time to take her home first. She is a four-year-old Ragdoll cat
named Fiver. Fiver is a pet and has no formal training.
As librarian of the middle school with the library cat, I was surprised of the
amount of positive comments received from the teachers who rarely visit the library. The
comments of Fiver being owned by the school family instead of just myself has made me
more aware of the feelings of the school community and the importance of the cat to
them.
Two of the teachers at the elementary school with the therapy dog also have
guinea pigs in their classrooms, as do many of the teachers at that school. They all have
positive feelings about animals, but two are hesitant to use the therapy dog at their school
very often. One teacher uses the therapy dog on a one-to-one basis with her students as a

105
reward in her behavior system. She also revealed that she uses the dog as a behavior
intervention to keep a child under control when he is having an especially rough day.
The school has a second dog, but they do not allow her around the students as she is still
being trained.
The male dog is a two-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel by the name of
Cowboy Charlie that attended the Circle K9 for obedience training and Pet Partners for
therapy training. He has not yet been certified. I was surprised that they refer to the dog
as a therapy dog when he has not been certified as a therapy dog. The female dog is a
one-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Lady Charlotte. She has not yet
completed training. It also needs to be pointed out that the dogs are not usually used by
the counselor. The principal and the principal’s secretary are the main two adults that
deal with the dogs. In fact, the secretary’s office is where their beds, food, and water are
and where the dogs stay most of the time. She is the one that takes them outside to go to
the bathroom and the one that takes them home every night.
Cowboy Charlie, the therapy dog at the elementary school, also surprised me.
The school has a very positive reputation in the school and it was astonishing to me that
the dog has not been certified yet, but they call it a therapy dog. More revealing still,
were the statements by the principal and the teachers that they do not use the dog enough.
Before the interviews, I assumed the dog was used by the counselor throughout the day to
assist counseling children. Disclosure that the counselor was not really an animal person
astonished me. However, the love of animals by the secretary has certainly filled the
need of someone taking care of the dog.

106
One of the teachers that I interviewed at the elementary presented me with a plan
last week. I did not ask for a plan, nor expect a plan. The plan was explaining exactly
how she will use the therapy dog, starting in February, at her school. She confessed that
she had not used the dog enough, had not made time for it. So, she is going to choose
one child that she feels would benefit from reading to the dog. The child will read to the
dog for 30 minutes, one day a week, under the supervision of this teacher during her
conference time, she is sacrificing something precious to teachers, their time. She told
me that I had reminded her how powerful animals can be and after she thought about it,
she knew she had to implement a plan soon. Knowledge of her as a strong teacher gives
me hope that others will follow her lead and use the dogs with the students more.
The following are some of the examples of positive interactions with Fiver. A
boy with autism is brought to the library to see Fiver in hopes that the interaction will
calm him down. One girl brings a bag of treats to Fiver for Christmas to give her one at a
time to make friends with her. Another boy has almost taught Fiver to play fetch. Fiver
approaches the quiet, shy girl who sits in the farthest comer so the girl can talk to Fiver.
Finally, a boy brought some leftover string from art to play with Fiver. There are
probably other children I do not know about. These examples are the reasons that I bring
Fiver to school, in hopes that she will touch their lives as she has mine.
Implications
Most people have a strong, positive reaction to animals and animal therapy. Even
though the idea of having a pet for a whole school is fairly unique, teachers have had
classroom pets for a long time, and reading dog programs are seen in many schools and
libraries. R. E. A. D. (Reading Education Assistance Dogs) is a national program that

107
uses registered Pet Partner teams to provide humanitarian lessons and improve the
literacy skills of children in an effective, unique, fun environment (Hughes, 2002).
Along with other programs such as “Sit, Stay, Read”; D. E. A. R. (Dogs Educating and
Assisting Readers); “Reading with Rover”; and “Read to the Dogs” they train children
how to approach and behave around animals and increase eagerness and confidence when
it comes to reading (Hughes, 2002). The teachers at the elementary school with the dog
talked quite a bit about the pet guinea pigs in their classrooms. Fish and small caged
animals have been in school environments in the past, but the exposure of dogs and cats
to school environments as pets or therapy animals that stay at the school is fairly new.
Classroom pets contribute to the development of compassion, responsibility, self-esteem
and social-emotional development, benefitting children with companionship, bonding,
supporting wellness, stress relief, caring (Meadan & Jegatheesan, 2010). Having pets
such as fish and small caged animals promotes positive human-animal relationships that
transfer to human-human relationships; provide supportive environments; and build
social and emotional skills (Meadan & Jegatheesan, 2010).
The children who are part of the educational community have to be taught how to
take care of the pets and to be concerned with their welfare, which advances the sense of
belonging (Meadan & Jegatheesan, 2010). Even though the cat in the school library is
just a pet, the students must be given directions on interacting with her. Learning the
clear routines, rules, and expectations helps children become comfortable, feel safe, and
facilitate learning (Meadan & Jegatheesan, 2010). When children understand the benefits
of respectful interactions with animals, they will transfer to interactions with other people
(Meadan & Jegatheesan, 2010). Some children have not been around cats and do not

108
know how to approach them. Also, every animal is different and Fiver, the library cat,
needs to be introduced to students so they can get used to her. Children leam appropriate
social behavior by watching other people, however, some children need direct instruction
to leam how to correctly express their feelings and emotions; problem solve,
communicate, and interact with others (Meadan & Jegatheesan, 2010). Many students
enjoy observing Fiver, some have developed a bond with her, and some students do not
like her. These varying relationships of the cat and the students must be accepted by
everyone, the other students, adults, and the librarian.
Recommendations
Because of the unexpected discovery that the therapy dogs at the elementary
school were not certified, my first recommendation is that the dogs go through the
training and become certified to work as therapy dogs. Certification needs to be
completed by the dogs at the elementary campus. The animals used in the R. E. A. D.
program are certified by Pet Partner; the animals used in “Sit, Stay, Read” are certified by
Hand in Paw; the animals used in the D. E. A. R. program are certified by Fidos for
Freedom; and the animals used in “Reading with Rover” are certified by Paws for Health
(Hughes, 2002). At that time, I recommend an organized program be developed for
implementation of the use of the therapy dogs. Programs need to develop a pet policy
with safety and sanitation procedures (Meadan & Jegatheesan, 2010). The teaching
pyramid supports social competence, prevents challenging behavior, is based on positive
behavior support, research on successful teaching, and effective strategies for promoting
correct social behavior (Meadan & Jegatheesan, 2010). However, teachers can continue
to have the opportunity to participate or not to participate based on their desires. Some

109
people are comfortable dealing with dogs and other animals and other people are not
comfortable. After teachers who are comfortable with the animals make an effort toward
interaction, other teachers are more likely to follow their example and plan interaction
between their students and the animals. It is also my recommendation to implement
humanitarian education for the children at the school that has the pet library cat. This
program would enable the children to learn more about the proper way to treat animals
and would encourage empathy, compassion, and kindness.
Overall, results from this study are positive toward the use of animals as pets and
in animal-assisted therapy. I would recommend research using different questions as the
questions used in this study may have been biased leading the participant to answer in a
positive manner. I would also recommend that research be completed without the use of
a personal pet, as the use of a personal pet may have biased participants toward positive
answers. Further research is recommended with different types of schools, such as
private and urban, since this study was done with two public schools in a small rural area.
Research involving different age groups would also be helpful as this study involved one
school with only sixth graders and another school with kindergarten through fifth graders.
Because school pets are not often found, some more examples of school pets need to be
studied. Researchers are encouraged to find other school campuses that have a variety of
live animals used at one school to determine the animals that are most beneficial to
students. A comparison can be made between programs that incorporate the reading dogs
to determine what program would be the fit if one is considering starting the program on
their campus. The large assortment of ways to use live animals in education can be

110
considered by educators because of the variety of benefits for children that human-animal
interaction can achieve.
