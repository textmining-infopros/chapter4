Stephens, Wendy Steadman. The Influence of Engagement with Graphic
Narrative Text Formats on Student Attitudes Towards the School Library. Doctor of
Philosophy (Information Science), December 2014, 113 pp., 38 tables, 4 illustrations,
references, 107 titles.
Comics, graphic novels, and manga differ appreciably from textual narrative
formats, and materials with increasingly visual elements have found their way into
progressive and student-centered library collections. But many educators and librarians
still resist inclusion of graphic narratives in school libraries and devalue the reading
practice of students who prefer more visual texts. Using the framework of radical
change, which posits that both text conventions and reader expectations for text are
increasingly multimodal as they possess characteristics of evolving digital media, this
study considered the relationship of the characteristics of text individual students prefer,
particularly those they select from the school library, and their attitudes towards aspects
of reading practice as evidenced through the Adolescent Motivation to Read Profile
instrument. Survey data was supplemented with circulation history from the library
management system to inform a correlational study punctuating attitudinal differences
based on reader preferences. Findings include high school students who engage with
graphic narrative text formats reporting more favorable views of libraries and reading.
There is a demonstrable distinction in attitudes between students who prefer more
visual text when compared with peers with more traditional print affinities. Student
engaging with graphic narrative texts also report more frequent engagement with text
overall. These demonstrated relationships should help to legitimize the inclusion of
more graphic narrative text formats in school library collections.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
Statement of the Problem
As we make the transition from an overwhelmingly print textual universe to more
digital text formats, works with more visual elements offer an unprecedented area for
innovation and new constructs of storytelling across media for integrated and immersive
narrative experiences. This shift in the nature of text, what Eliza Dresang (1999) termed
radical change as “the colorful, boldly graphic nature of the contemporary digital
environment is reflected in words and pictures which together tell powerful stories” (p.
81), means educators will have to confront their own inherent beliefs about the nature of
text and reading and its role in developing literate adults. Data on how today’s students
use print texts and their subsequent self-concept as readers will be increasingly
important as a baseline to punctuate both opportunities and limitations of the graphic
narrative reading experience.
In this increasingly digital era, school libraries, like their academic counterparts,
are struggling to re-define their role within the context of the overarching educational
enterprise. School librarians must demonstrate that their services contribute to the
overall academic attainment of students in their schools and substantiate how they
improve information literacy skills in school environments where learners have both
desktop and mobile access to networked resources. The U.S. Congressional No Child
Left Behind Act of 2002 and the federal Race to the Top education funding initiative, the
two driving forces in contemporary U.S. public educational policy, concentrate entirely
on tangible student learning outcomes rather than outlining ideal environments and

1

programs to meet the more rigorous goals. In this environment, school libraries have
been urged by flagship professional organizations like the American Association of
School Librarians (in AASL’s Standards for the 21st Century Learner) and the
International Society for Technology in Education (in ISTE’s National Educational
Technology Standards for Students and Teachers) to embrace instruction in information
literacy, align closely with the curriculum, and spearhead a range of integrated
technologies and digital production within the school building (AASL, 2007; Harris,
2007; Whelan, 2012; ISTE 2007; SIGMS 2009; Valenza, 2011).
These new roles often come at the expense of what has typically been the
touchstone of the school library, provision of a range of reading materials and support
for reader engagement with text. In an era when many librarians are trying to provide a
range of materials and services, books remain the library “brand” (Storey, 2006). For
school libraries to remain viable in the increasingly data-driven and standards-based
school environments, it is important that research cement the link between their
programs and students’ overall academic achievement (Lance, Welborn & HamiltonPennell, 1993; Lance & Loertscher, 2005). It has never been more important that the
school librarians and media specialists in the trenches understand and support the
effect that reading for pleasure has upon the overall literacy of young people and how
access to books can offset the effects of household and neighborhood poverty.
Access to reading material is a demonstrated predictor of a child’s academic
success. Children growing up in homes with many books will go on to receive, on
average, three years more schooling than children from bookless homes, regardless of
their parents' education, occupation, and class (Evans et al., 2010). The availability of

2

books within the home has been found to create an advantage equivalent to having
university-educated parents in household where parents instead have minimal
educational attainment. In a study of schools with demonstrable reading achievement,
students were found to have “access to an extensive selection of quality, engaging, high
interest books and other reading materials both in their classrooms and in the school
library media center” (North Central Regional Education Laboratory, 2000). But the
materials which most appeal to young people can be excluded by well-meaning
educators; as recently as 2012, Lapp, Wolsey, Fisher and Frey (2012) found that 41.4%
of elementary teachers surveyed “strongly disagreed” with using graphic narrative
formats in reading instruction. And despite the overwhelming connection between
availability of a range of texts and desired learning outcomes, the planning, collection
development, and promotion of voluntary reading outside of class has been minimized
by the professional organizations dedicated to the school librarians serving those same
young people.
With 45 of 50 U.S. states adopting the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) to
align curriculum nationwide with the end goal of improving college and career
preparedness, many school libraries are preoccupied with identifying and obtaining
materials of sufficient complexity to support the CCSS mandates (Gewertz, 2012,
Harris, 2012). But are those CCSS-aligned texts the best use of scarce resources? This
exploratory study hopes to suggest how the availability of a range of school library
materials can affect overall student literacy and other aspects of academic
achievement.

Research Questions
The overarching research problem is concerned with how and why young people
use schools libraries for independent, voluntary reading, and whether that reading
practice can be characterized as related to the types of text formats students select.
This study is centered on the following research questions:
Q1: How do students engaging with graphic narrative text view the school library
and reading?
Q2: Is there a difference between attitudes concerning libraries and reading
when students engage with more visual text in comparison with those of their
peers who prefer more textual formats?
Q3: Do student engaging with graphic narrative text formats report engaging with
text more often?
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this research concerns the reading habits of young people,
specifically seeking insight into the frequency and intensity with which young people
engage with texts located in the school library, the nature of those materials in the era of
radical change, and how their experience can predict favorable attitudes about the
library and literacy. Lonsdale (2001) conceptualizes the relationship between school
libraries and student achievement as existing in three dimensions: academic
achievement (as reflected on standardized tests), reading literacy (which includes
reading for pleasure), and broader learning (improved information skills, self-concept).
As with much educational research, the relationship between library usage and student
academic achievement has not been established using empirical studies. Student and
librarian demographics and backgrounds, combined with the tremendous institutional
autonomy characterizing the U.S. public educational system, provides an extensive

4

range of potential variables, as do variations in school library staffing qualifications, and
scheduling.
If they are to remain viable within the data-driven accountability systems of
modern education, school librarians must demonstrate the relationship between their
promotion of voluntary reading and the value of individual selection from a broad range
of materials. Past research has firmly established that the volume of an individual’s
reading, rather than the nature of the text, correlates with improved literacy performance
in an academic context (Gambrell, 2009; Ross, McKechnie & Rothbauer, 2006;
Alllington, 2001; Krashen, 2009). This investigation attempts to systematically examine
the attitudes and reading habits of students who have obtained graphic narrative
materials from the school library. Survey data will be elicited from all readers, and
circulation records will be used to identify a group of readers who have historically
engaged with graphic narrative text to compare their attitudes towards those of students
who have not accessed these types of resources in the library collection. Those
relationships will be explored using quantitative methods to develop a model of the
relationship between types of texts readers choose and those readers’ attitudes towards
libraries and literacy. A number of theoretical approaches inform the extrapolation from
data to model, most specifically radical change (Dresang, 1999) as a construct to
understand the reiterative relationship between text and reader.

Theoretical Framework
The connection between digital age youth and graphic narrative text formats has
become conspicuous. In the late 1990s, Dresang noticed that the formats of texts for

5

youth had been shifting to reflect more digital conventions, with characteristics including
shorter chapters, shifting points-of-view, more lists, less emphasis on complete
sentences, and an increased emphasis on paratextual content. She recognized these
elements as the hallmarks of digital communications. In her definition of radical change,
Dresang (1999) asserts that young readers encountering these newer text conventions
demonstrate an ease breaking from more textual narrative, which in turn reinforces the
validity of these mechanisms for communication and increases the reader’s
expectations for these sorts of devices within texts.

Limitations of the Study
It is still unclear how students’ independent interactions with text from the school
library collection inform their developing attitudes about reading and literacy. Friese
(2012) asserts that the interaction of the individual reader with a range of texts remains
a poorly understood aspect of literacy education and especially librarianship.
Contextualizing this transaction within a single school library setting, given the myriad
influences at play on any given media program in any school and across any student
body, would have necessarily limited generalizability across populations. Another
limitation stems from the self-reporting inherent in survey data. To offset these
limitations, the survey design uses multiple questions to get at the same data point, to
effectively serving as a repeated measure in determining the student’s attitude
surrounding books and literacy.
A central limitation of non-experimental design is the limited validity of
correlational study. Without control groups, the causality of relationships between

6

variables cannot be determined.

Significance of the Study
School libraries adequately staffed by trained professionals have a demonstrated
effect on the academic achievement of students (Achterman, 2008), as does the
availability of books within the school library (Krashen, 2009). But librarians sometimes
have a difficult time explaining “why” reading in the abstract is a social good (Ross,
McKechnie, & Rothbauer, 2006). Less fully understood are the collection variables that
can contribute to literacy achievement throughout the school. Patronizing the library for
leisure reading selection is indicative of student’s independent engagement with text,
and engagement presages literacy growth (Allington, 2001). In addition to seeking a
model for understanding how young people access leisure reading through the
information agency located within the school, the study provides support for alternative
resource allocation and promotion of materials that may increase students’ overall
volume of reading. Additionally, by examining less “authorized” texts within a scholarly
framework, the researcher hopes to legitimize consumption of a broader range of text
as a constructive practice (McGill-Franzer & Botzakis, 2009). By paying attention to both
the young people who choose to read both the text-based formats traditionally
considered to be edifying for secondary school students and other, less text-based
formats, the researcher hopes to lead school librarians in more audacious collection
development directions and benefit young readers in many settings through the
validation of increased access to a broader range of materials for literacy practice.

Definitions
Some specialized vocabulary used in this study reflects the particular users and
reading behaviors on which the research centers:
Engagement with text: used here to refer to the act of selection of materials from
the library collection, most usually in the form of checking out the items for consultation
outside the physical space
Graphic narrative formats: a blanket term to cover the range of visually-enhanced
materials, most often found in the Dewey class 741.5, used for “Comic books, graphic
novels, fotonovelas, cartoons, caricatures, comic strips.” Lapp, Wosley, Fisher and Frey
(2012) call this graphica
Graphic novel: A graphic novel as described in a glossary devoted to comic
books as “any self-contained story in a single binding that uses a comic book-like page
layout. In the comic book industry, the term is sometimes used to refer only to selfcontained stories of 48 or more pages that have not been previously published serially.
The minimum page count varies; 64, 72, and 96 pages are other popular cut-off points”
(Hahn, 2006). As topics and narrative approaches vary widely, graphic novels are often
described as a format rather than a genre, and the designation “novel” can be a
misnomer, as many graphic format materials deal with nonfiction topics.
Imposed-query model proposed by Gross (1995) as an imposer transferring an
information need onto another party, or agent, most typically encountered in school
settings where students work to complete assignments
Literacy practice: the action of students who chose to read texts distinct from
assigned or required reading

8

Literacy support: the role of the school library in providing texts that students
choose to read as distinct from assigned or required reading
School library: a library located on a school campus, overseen by the local
education authority, whose chief function is fulfilling information needs of students
enrolled
Student: used here to denote high school students between the ages of 14 and
20; references to prior research involving high school students described will be explicit
about the setting.

Background
This work is grounded in my personal experience at a large rural secondary
school. When I went to work in a high school library thirteen years ago, the first specific
materials request I received was for the magazine Shonen Jump, which samples and
serializes chapters from a range of popular Japanese manga in English translation.
Eventually, a student brought me a subscription card, and I paid it out of pocket for a
couple of years before adding it to my periodical renewal list with EBSCO.
As a beginning school librarian newly charged with public money, I was rather
obsessed with rationalizing every purchase I made from school funds. I clung rather
obsessively to standard collection development resources, wanting my fiction to mirror
H.W. Wilson’s High School Catalog. I chose new titles from awards lists and starred
reviews. I solicited teacher purchase requests, only to spend thousands of dollars on
multimedia they did not, upon reconsideration, want to use with their students. Within a
few years, I had changed strategies. I would identify interesting resources, and then ask

9

a teacher if particular titles or volumes would address materials needs for their
curriculum, rather than soliciting purchase recommendations wholesale.
I was in that initially cautious mindset when I worked with the social studies
department chair to identify the content standards for my first real investment in graphic
formats. I decided to purchase Chester Comix, a series I encountered in the exhibit hall
of the American Association of School Librarians biennial conference in Pittsburgh in
2006. I picked up a sample of Chester Comix because I couldn’t find the staffers for
neighboring Tokyo Pop, the publisher of Shonen Jump, and was impressed by
Chester’s Harvard-educated cartoonist, who managed to infuse more content in a single
panel than much educational media contained overall. I had sought grant funding from a
local education foundation to cover the modest cost of seven class sets of the Comix,
since I could not justify spending my limited state allocation on … comics.
Several teachers, including those in charge of remediating seniors, were excited
about those resources. While I had been quite preoccupied with buying the best
materials as recognized by my profession, it was surprising that I thought enough about
the local population, rather than some abstract ideal of high school students, to identify
the content standards students needed in American history. Those Chester Comix did
seem to make the events underpinning and during Revolution, the Civil War,
Reconstruction, and World War II more explicable to these students who had struggled
with history. The year I won the grant and ordered our first sets of Comix, our school
had a record number of students passing the state’s graduation exam in social studies,
which at that point was one of five subject areas in which students must demonstrate

10

mastery before their senior spring. I heard from both teachers and students that these
supplementary materials were not insignificant to that success.
Following that success, I spent a thousand dollars of my state allocation each
year for four years on graphic novels. Those caused me more anxiety that any
equivalent materials purchase. I would routinely spend the same amount on Playaway
audiobooks or e-readers without batting an eyelid. Building a graphic format collection
gave me an opportunity to confront my own prejudices about reading and to explore a
changing definition of adolescent literacy.
The formats became an area of academic interest when, while on leave of
absence in the spring of 2007, I sat in on Eric Rabkin’s course on “The Graphic
Narrative” at the University of Michigan. The crowd was a strange assortment of
undergraduates and a few graduate students, but the common denominator was a
defensive posturing and a sort of existential angst about the very fact of being enrolled
in the course. Despite the highly intellectualized discussion of art, literature, and history,
students felt nonetheless their curricular pursuit was less than serious. Given this
shaming from within the academy, is it any wonder that the incorporation of comics and
graphics novels in school libraries remains one of the more controversial areas in
collections?
Many school librarians and teachers have fallen prey to the suggestion, most
recently informing the Common Core State Standards, that, given the opportunity,
students will read only one form of texts, that those texts will not stretch their literacy
skills voluntarily, and, given any choice, will only take the easy way out. The concept of
productive struggle seems predicated on the belief that students will only read a set

11

amount and that there is an optimal investment in terms of difficulty of text. I began to
witness the fallacy in this line of thinking over the past decade as I worked with the
same students throughout their four-year high school career. Again and again, students
revealed rather diverse taste across genres, with only the rare student adhering
slavishly to a particular series, author, or textual format.
I framed my investigation of students’ engagement with a range of formats
around this observation, seeking to better understand the nature of book selection in a
high school library. The current literature and historical research agenda for school
librarianship does not explicitly take ownership for the rich literacy experiences of
teenage readers. In abdicating our responsibility for creating a climate and culture of
literacy, school librarians are working towards our own extinction. Demonstrating the
deep reciprocal and reiterative relationship between the formats of graphic novels and
comics and more textual narrative form should help validate the full range of adolescent
literacy practices. The same student who checks out Fullmetal Alchemist will request
Dante’s Inferno and The Art of War, and any real distinction between the inherent merit
of one or the other is artificial and fallacious.

CHAPTER 2
REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE AND THEORY
Research Potential
When contrasted with the research into the information seeking behaviors of
adults and college students, the body of research into how young people identify,
evaluate, and make use of information is in its relative infancy. Hultgren and Limberg
(2003) express surprise at the scant amount of literature concerned with children’s
information seeking in a school context and discuss unsuccessful attempts to search for
research information using alternate terminology they hoped might be employed in more
pedagogically oriented education literature. Their subsequent citation analysis
confirmed the small size of that body of extant work. On the heels of Hultgren and
Limberg’s work, Chelton and Cool (2004, 2007) published two anthologies, much of the
research published previously elsewhere, on youth information seeking. Chelton and
Cool preface the first collection of the information behavior of young people with the
caveat that “much remains to be accomplished” (2004, p. xiii).
There are many possible reasons for the dearth of investigation into young
people’s information needs and behavior. Walter (2003) suggests that the bias against
young people as research subjects come from the ghettoization of youth services.
“Children’s and young adult librarians, while they are often reflective practitioners, are
usually too busy to conduct research studies themselves, and academics have often
found children to be less interesting or somehow less legitimate subjects than adults,”
writes Walter. “There are, therefore, many gaps in what we know about library services
to people in their first two decades of life” (p. 572). Even the historical contextualization

13

and evolution of modern youth services has not received the same treatment as that in
other information seeking contexts. In 2005, Jenkins, Chelton and Pierce confirmed that
youth services librarianship historiography “as a field of study is still as wide-open as
ever. As with many other activities involving women and children, youth services
librarianship has been simultaneously revered and ignored.”
Rarer than research into youth information seeking are models developed from
young people’s searching that are then transferred to other user groups. With the
imposed query model and the information search process (ISP), both Gross (1995) and
Kuhlthau (1991) produced influential information literacy models from embedded
observation in school libraries, supplemented with quantitative data. But few of the
compelling theories developed in other contexts have been applied to students as
information users.

Young People and Information Seeking
Children and young adults often lack agency to access the resources necessary
to fulfill their information needs. Walter describes young people as fundamentally
“information poor,” using the small world criteria established by Elfreda Chatman (1991).
Walter attributes this information poverty partially to “the low level of communication
between adults and children,” in addition to the “low status of children in society.”
Riechel (1991) found children to be systematically disenfranchised in both the school
and public library context, with constant reinforcement “that their needs were not as
important as those of adults” (p. 6). This second-class status constrains the information
ecology surrounding children and teenagers and ultimately affects their interactions with

14

resources. Gross identified one consequence of information poverty as young people
tend to meet their more sensitive information needs “from the media and from other
children” (Gross, 2006, p. 41). The marginalization of young people led Dresang (1999)
to develop “a sense of the ways in which Radical Change may be particularly relevant to
youth who have previously been denied access to information” (p. xix).
Walter (2003) called young people navigating electronic resources as “the only
subtopic within this area to have yielded a significant body of cumulative research
relevant to children and teenagers.” Many early evaluations of online searching habits of
school children center on students accessing electronic resources, most typically CDROM encyclopedias and automated card catalog systems, studying search behavior
when navigating an artificially small set of records (Hirsh, 2004). Watson (1998)
suggested that, in the wider Web environment rather than laboratory settings, students
are bound to feel more successful with retrieval tasks because of the sheer number of
records retrieved, regardless of the actual quality or utility of the information obtained.
Nonetheless, the body of literature concerned with student interaction with smaller
databases can be valuable when considering students’ information needs and utilization
holistically.

An Assumed Hierarchy of Information Value
The belief that some reading materials are inherently superior to others
underpins the philosophy of library collection development. In the fourth century B.C.,
Plato’s attack on epic and tragic poetry was fueled by a fundamental suspicion of
creative art. Perhaps in no area of librarianship does this distinction between books

15

considered worthy and those not esteemed persist as strongly as in children’s and
youth services. At the root of any discussion of collections for youth is a persistent and
historical undercurrent warning of the corruptibility of children by less-than-wholesome
literary depictions and the overarching role of the library as an institution to support
education rather than entertainment. “Historically, literature for children has been a
vehicle to impart religious values and beliefs, moral behavior, and the fear of God,”
writes Hilbun (2004, p. 9). Heins asserts that the rise of “pedagogic literature for
children” can be traced “the modern concept of childhood as a period of prelapsarian
innocence was an invention of the Seventeenth Century” (pp. 18-19). Prior to the early
modern period, young people did not have their own body of texts. The emergence of
literature for young people as a distinct body can be dated to 1750 (Ellis, 1968).
Eighteenth century English bookseller John Newbery is credited with writing as well as
publishing a majority of the first adaptations of adult works and homilies penned
especially for children, books praised and imitated by contemporaries for their
“simplicity,” “homeliness,” and the role they played in the moral instruction of youth
(White, 1897, p. 13). Appropriately, Newbery’s name has been preserved by the
Association for Library Service for Children, a division of the American Library
Association, through the prestigious annual award often criticized for denoting
outstanding literary merit rather than reader appeal. The earliest texts for children,
Newbery’s among them, were almost always didactic, as “the prevalent view of the 18th
century was that children’s stories should always be designed to inculcate a moral; no
sooner did the young being finish their reading than they were called upon to reflect”
(Ellis, 1968, p. 5). This was partly an outgrowth of the religious doctrine of original sin,

16

one that demanded strict correction through patriarchal domination, corporal
punishment, and the use of children’s primers, the production of which was dominated
by Puritans who saw widespread conversion as a way to achieve a godly society
(Stone, 1979, p. 125): In early children’s books, learning, and this included moral
education, separated man from animal. The survival of these sorts of overtly
instructional books for young people outlived the religious movements which inspired
them, since even with the decline of “a Puritan hegemony” in American education,
“children’s literature assumed the role of inculcating morals and defining behavioral
principles” (Murray, 1998, p. 21).

Library Services for Young People
As American public libraries began to organize, standardize, and professionalize
their services in the nineteenth century, the literature in this nascent field is ripe with
dismissal of particular materials. In an early edition of Library Journal, pioneering
librarian Samuel Swett Green (1879) argues for a range of materials “if the library is to
do its whole work in the community”:
Were it necessary, it would be easy to show that good novels and stories for the
young aid materially in the work of educating children and men, and that they are
of great value on account of the power which lies in them of affording rational
entertainment…I take it for granted that nearly all librarians and friends of
education consider novel reading desirable when the selection of books read is
judicious, and when the practice is indulged in only in moderation; and that it is
not only harmless but very profitable for children to read story books, provided
they are of the right kind and not used in excess. A considerable portion, then, of
the books in a popular library must be novels and stories, if the institution is to do
its whole work in the community. It is well to state here emphatically that a town,
in establishing a library, aims not only at giving instruction, but seeks also to
afford rational entertainment, and that this purpose should be kept in mind in
deciding how many stories should be put into it. (Green, 1879, pp. 346-47)

17

Green goes on to acknowledge, “There are classes in the community of grown-up
persons and of children who require exciting stories if they are to read at all” (p. 348).
But Green seems to have offered a lone voice in the wilderness of early children’s
librarianship. Stauffer (2007) identified 250 articles on reading promotion published
between 1876 and 1920, which she summed up with “the concern was not so much to
interest children in reading as to interest children in reading the books that parents,
teachers, and librarians wanted them to read, books that would provide class- and
gender-appropriate role models and instill socially acceptable values in both boys and
girls” (p. 403). In the late nineteenth century, a true popular press emerged to serve an
increasing desire for escapism for readers of all ages. Ellis describes the library’s new
role in stocking an increasing range of materials which appeal to what were described
as “backwards readers,” including tracing the introduction of the comic strip to publisher
Hanesworth’s 1890 series, “intended for semi-literate adults, later adapted for children”
(p. 132).
But the moral imperative remained, and within this framework, it is not surprising
objections about children’s collections persist as a cultural flashpoint. “Complaints are
often made that public libraries foster a taste for light reading, especially among the
young,” wrote William Fletcher in an 1876 paper for the U.S. Bureau of Education, who
chose to advocate for choosing only books “which have something positively good
about them,” to draw students “away from frivolous reading” (Hazeltine, 1917, pp. 1214). The same distinction between popular materials and serious, aspirational tomes
like the ones Hewins and Fletcher recommend persisted into the late twentieth century,

18

which found “public librarians censoring the very books which children appear to prefer”
(Ellis, 1968, p. 218).
As with collections, early incarnations of children’s services in American public
libraries were likewise didactic, existing as they did in institutions preoccupied with
democratic edification. In the late nineteenth century, Caroline Hewins, who played a
pioneering role in codifying children’s services as an area of professional librarianship
and was the first woman to speak at the second American Library Association
conference in 1877, wrote with tremendous certainty of “the Right Use of Books,”
advising librarians serving young people to “give children something they are growing
up to, not away from” (Hildebrand, 1996, p. 192). Hewins was among the first to identify
young people as a “special group” requiring dedicated spaces, staff, and collections for
appropriate library services. Within materials, Hewins’ emphasis on the importance of
guiding children towards “better reading” had persistent implications for how
generations of librarians “viewed books, children, and the importance of their reading”
(McDowell, 2005, p. 16). Simultaneous to the rise of public libraries, the “moralphilosophical” approach to literary analysis pioneered by the Victorian poet and critic
Matthew Arnold stressed that all great literature must possess “high seriousness,”
emphasizing that “moral or philosophical teaching” should be as aspect of a worthy
literary work (Guerin et al., 1979, p. 30). Given that youth services quickly “became the
defining component of American public libraries” (Grotzinger, 1983, p. 143), the
imperative that books improve rather than entertain their young readers punctuated the
goals for the institution within the community and ensured their continued support.

19

In contemporary practice, Pattee (2007) sees the myopic nature of the profession
as partly to blame for the absence of some of the more populist works in libraries
serving young people: “Because popular fiction doesn't get the same amount of
attention in our professional journals as it does in the mainstream press, it's up to us to
keep abreast of the popular critical movements and recognize the impact of these
statements on our patrons and their families. Even more importantly, we should use
these opportunities to model critical media literacy and investigate these so-called
controversial texts on our own” (p. 31). A 1999 De Witt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund
survey of teen library users found that “libraries need to provide better books and
materials” (Ross, McKechnie & Rothbauer, 2006, p. 112): it is unlikely that the
respondents’ definition of “better” would be the same as the librarians who serve them.
Libraries are still grappling with the implications of some works being considered
inherently more edifying than others. Is the role of the library to promote high culture or
facilitate access to all culture, including the popular? This tension exists in every
institution, but it is particularly apparent in libraries serving young people.

Libraries within Schools
As schools in the United States initially developed as an outgrowth of local
governance, the origins of school libraries is similarly piecemeal and parochial. The
relationship of public libraries to schools was explored in Christine Jenkins’ (2000)
survey of the existing scholarship on the history of youth services: “Although school
district funds have supported libraries in a sporadic fashion since the nineteenth
century, school libraries as they are currently configured grew out of early public library

20

services to schools in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Thus, much of the early history of
school librarianship must be gleaned from sources that focus on public library history,”
writes Jenkins, with most historiography in that area descriptive rather than analytical
(pp. 107-08). The pragmatic Victorians advocated the establishment of school libraries
“as a material encouragement to the habit of reading at home, and as forming important
aids to the school coursework teaching in securing a taste for reading” (Ellis, 1968, pp.
102-03). Yet that cultivation of a love for books has been mitigated by persistent
questions surrounding what was appropriate to hold in a school library collection.
Guidance for librarians was included among considerations concerning school issues
addressed by schoolmaster Christopher Wase, who allowed that school libraries “not be
confined to dictionaries and concordances but extended to a wide range of books” (Ellis,
1968, p. 38). As education became universal, producing “a dawn of literacy” in
nineteenth century America, a broader range of materials was concurrent with the
widespread availability of inexpensive books. Ellis (1968) writes, “in addition to school
books, children’s books were available at this time, published with the purpose of
guiding their readers’ pleasure, and not principally to teach them or provide them with
moral guidance” (p. 14).
But even after public library collections began to increasingly reflect reader
preferences and requests, school libraries, with their mandate to support the curriculum,
grappled with additional complexities when it comes to the support of leisure reading,
despite the demonstrated relationship between reading volume, not reading quality, and
reading facility (Krashen, 2009, p. 19). The persistent anxieties surrounding fictive
depictions and children’s moral development is demonstrated annually with the release

21

of the American Library Association’s list of most frequently banned and challenged
materials, a disproportionate number of which are materials published for young people.
A rote solution for public libraries holding materials deemed objectionable is relocating
items to the adult or parenting collections. Censors manifest a fundamental societal
belief about the vulnerability and impressionability of youth. Without the recourse of
shifting materials to older patrons, some school libraries, in a condemned but still extant
practice, limit access to particular books to particular grade levels or from students with
parent permission.

Literacy Development and School Libraries
School libraries fulfill an important equity function, as Krashen notes (1996) since
there is huge disparity among children with regard to access to books in the home:
Affluent children have more books at home, better public libraries, and often go
to schools with better school libraries and classroom libraries. In fact, it is
probably the case that many children in school today have practically no access
to books and no quiet, comfortable place to read. There is a powerful relationship
between free reading and literacy development. Thus, affluent children do well in
school at least partly because of the print-rich environment they experience
outside of school. School should not simply be a test that privileged children
pass. The school library can be an equalizer. (pp. 3-4)
The link between literacy practice and improved comprehension is emphatic. The
California State Department of Education asserts “the single most valuable activity for
developing children’s comprehension is reading itself. The amount of reading that
children do is shown to predict growth in reading comprehension… among older
students and adults, [the amount of reading] predicts receptive vocabulary, verbal
fluency, content area achievement, and all manner of general knowledge even when
other measures of school ability, general intelligence, age, education, and reading

22

comprehension are taken out of the equation” (p. 11). Downhower (1987) found metric
measures of reading aptitude, including reading rate, accuracy, comprehension, and
prosody (fluency in reading aloud) were significantly improved by repeated reading
practice. Even a relatively modest reading volume – 40 minutes of reading a day – is
linked to significant academic achievement (see Table 1). But little research into school
libraries in concerned with literacy practice. In their volume on literacy in libraries, Ross,
McKechnie and Rothbauer (2006) saw this particular lack of emphasis on the role of
reading as disciplinary, “Much of the research on young adults’ reading comes from
those interested in literacy practices associated with education and school contexts. As
a result, the acquisition of literacy skills and development of reading fluency are primary
targets of concern” (p. 107).

The relationship between volume of reading and achievement “is so
commonsensical that many have trivialized this work and too many have, seemingly,
ignored the potential implications for the design of reading instruction” (Allington, 2001,
p. 28). Ross, McKechnie and Rothbauer (2006) propose that relationship is directional:
“There is now considerable evidence that the amount and quality of students’ access to
23

reading materials is substantively related to the amount of reading they engage in,
which in turn is the most important determinant of reading achievement” (p. 42).
But the National Reading Panel, a study group formed in 1997 by the National
Institutes of Health, believed it impossible to conduct a meta-analysis of experimental
and quasi-experimental research on reading volume and literacy. Instead, in discussion
of the role of schools in literacy support through an analysis of programmatic silent
sustained reading (SSR), they dismissed most of the existing research as
methodologically flawed in that it was correlational rather than causal. So while the
group acknowledges that “literally hundreds of correlational studies find that the best
readers read the most and that poor readers read the least…. it could be that the more
that children read, the more their reading skills improve, but it is also possible that better
readers simply choose to read more.”
Though the panel did not dismiss SSR as a practice, they did decry the lack of
research-based evidence:
Even though encouraging students to read more is intuitively appealing, there is
still not sufficient research evidence obtained from studies of high methodological
quality to support the idea that such efforts reliably increase how much students
read or that such programs result in improved reading skills. Given the extensive
use of these techniques, it is important that such research be conducted. It
should be made clear that these findings do not negate the positive influence that
independent silent reading may have on reading fluency, nor do the findings
negate the possibility that wide independent reading significantly influences
vocabulary development and reading comprehension. Rather, there are simply
not sufficient data from well-designed studies capable of testing questions of
causation to substantiate causal claims. (National Reading Panel, 2006)
Nonetheless, the importance of young people’s access to books is among the most
persuasive evidence for early childhood literacy initiatives and public library outreach to
young families. Research finds even access to a relatively modest home library

24

improves students’ school readiness. In the digital age, this issue of access has been
reframed as whether providing low-income families with e-readers might have the same
effect. But not all books are equal in this regard. Krashen (1996) notes that “correlation
between books per student [in school libraries] and reading fall dramatically when
access is limited and collections are out of date” (p. 3) In the meantime, Allington (2001)
suggests policy shift to create literature-rich home environments: [Schools and libraries]
“can make it easy and unrisky for children to take books home for the evening or
weekend by worrying less about losing books to children and more about losing children
to illiteracy” (p. 69). The role of school libraries, to which students have accesses on a
daily basis, is critical, and Krashen and McQuillan found that access to books in the
school library is particularly important after fourth grade (2012). Allington (2001) found
that “library adequacy is one of the better indicators regaring reading achievement with
a correlation of .85 between library adequacy and NAEP reading achievement scores.
In other words, you could quite accurately rank the states’ NAEP scores just by knowing
their rating on school library quality” (p. 57).

Literature in Graphic Narrative Formats
While graphic narrative text formats have become a full-fledged academic
discipline with its own literature and scholarly concerns, the integration of this form of
literature has not been without skeptics. “For the last half-century librarians, educators,
and academics have pooh-poohed sequential art as a throwaway form of entertainment
with little or no value” (Weiner, 2010, p. 5), concerns that sound remarkably similar to
the complaints about gothic novels in the early nineteenth century and penny dreadfuls

25

later. But graphic narrative text formats can be undeniably complex. McCloud (1993)
describes the possible elements of graphic narrative texts, including idea and purpose,
form, idiom, structure, craft, and surface, “properties that comics share with all other art
forms” (p. 182), in addition to seven ways “words and pictures collide” (see Table 2).
Most comics are likely to employ multiple devices over the course of telling a story,
relying process of making meaning at least as complex as that required for textual
narrative formats. Educators like Phillips (2012) use McCloud’s primer on comics as an
introductory text, “in addition to developing the vocabulary for analyzing the visual
elements of graphic novels, comic books and other visual text, it is also important to
know the grammar and techniques for telling visual stories” (p. 87). The art of comics
can be read as an outgrowth of the rejection of realism in favor of logical abstraction,
“the main thrust was a return to meaning in art, away from resemblance, back to the
realm of ideas” (McCloud, p. 147).

Table 2
McCloud’s Typology of Image and Text Interaction (Phillips, 2012)
Word-specific: Words providing all you need to know, while the pictures illustrate
aspects of the scene being described
Picture-specific: Pictures providing all you need to know, while the words accentuate
aspects of the scene being shown
Duo-specific: Words and pictures both sending roughly the same message
Intersecting: Words and pictures working together in some respects while also
contributing information independently
Interdependent: Words and pictures combining to convey an idea that neither would
convey alone
Parallel: Words and pictures following seemingly different paths without intersecting

26

The history of comics in the United States is long and politically fraught. “The first
mission of the funny pages was to convoke the lower classes (Hadju, 2008, p. 9).
Joseph Pulitzer introduced cartoons in color Sunday supplements designed to
differentiate his populist New York World in a market crowded with daily newspapers.
As early as 1909, popular magazines were alleging that the cartoons appearing in
Sunday supplements were “undermining literacy” (p. 10). Hadju contextualizes this
backlash:
The criticism echoed already familiar charges against the dime novels of the late
nineteenth century, which had delivered short, readable doses of blood and
thunder to a working to a working-class readership, thereby imperiling Victorian
propriety. Comic strips essentially supplanted the dime novels and, in their
accessibility to nonreaders in the immigrant population, surpassed the books in
popularity. To watchdogs of American esteem in the early post-Victorian years,
the earthy and raucous pages of the Sunday funnies threatened to devalue the
United States’ emerging status as a civilized world power. Magazine articles
derided comic strips as infantile, brutal, unsophisticated, and subliterate… even
the charge of juvenilia was entwined with class bias in a day when people of low
social rank, like those of color, were often conflated with children. (p. 10)
“Comics are definitely harmful to impressionable people, and most young people
are impressionable,” said psychiatrist Frederic Wertham (1953), whose treatise
Seduction of the Innocent linking the case studies of several troubles patients to an
interest in comics was named the National Education Association’s 1953 “Book of the
Year.” But Wertham’s high-profile demonization was extreme given that, by the mid1940s, “comics were selling between eighty million and a hundred million copies every
week, with a typical issues passed along or traded to six to ten readers, thereby
reaching more people than movies, television, radio, or magazines for adults” (Hadju,
2008, p. 5). During the same period, some 95% of elementary-aged children and more
than 80% of teens read comics, and in a nation of fewer than 200 million individuals,

27

sales of new comics reached one billion issues annually (Tilley, 2012). Nonetheless,
teachers worried “a steady diet of the one-dimensional characters, the simplistic plots,
and the emphasis on the action-adventure story would ruin children’s tastes for other
types of reading.” (Nyberg, 2010, p. 9).
When Wertham’s archives were made available at the Library of Congress, Carol
Tilley (2012) found his own records undermined his research conclusions. She asserted
that Wertham misrepresented and altered children’s words about comics as well as
failing to include other extenuating information about the young people with whom he
worked. Wertham’s report was representative of broader anti-comic sentiment. In 1954,
the U.S. Senate held hearings on comics and juvenile delinquency. The outcome
constrained the comics industry for years. “Comic magazines that focused on horror,
crime, or shock and suspense stories were shut down by the dozens. An industry trade
group, the Comics Magazine Association of America, and its regulatory body, the
Comics Code Authority, were establish to enforce strict guidelines of morality, decency,
and good prevailing over evil. This code held sway for decades, intimidating writers and
illustrators and making them ashamed of their own work” (Itzkoff, 2013, p. C1). It was
only in the 1970s and 1980s, asserts Nyberg, that academia began to accept mass
culture and consider comics within their purview. The concurrence with the rise of digital
media is not accidental, Dresang wrote “today’s children and young adults are astute
about graphics because they interact with digital media…Radically changed literature is
emerging to support their greater sophistication” (p. 98).
The inclusion of comics in library settings was initially controversial, though the
establishment of longer-form visual narratives that began with Will Eisner’s work in the

28

1970s earned a more palatable descriptor, that of “graphic novel.” Graphic novels have
been described as “closely related to literature in their use of metaphor, myth and
symbol,” and, as Mulligan (2014) notes, span the spectrum from “high mimetic” modes
of epic and tragedy to “low mimetic” modes of comic and realistic fiction (pp. 42-43).
Steven Weiner remembers his proposal for a professional resource on comics in
libraries was rejected in 1993 as “although graphic novels added value to library
collections, the bias against them was so great that it could not be overcome” (p. 261).
Yet as early as 1987, 25% of schools had comic books in their library collections. In
Weiner’s (2010) volume the 2002 YALSA preconference devoted to graphic novels is
represented as a sea change in youth services librarianship. Similarly, the dedication of
the January/February 2013 issue of Knowledge Quest, the journal of the American
Association of School Librarians, to the topic of graphic novels is likely to legitimize their
inclusion in many collections. But almost every article in that issue falls prey to old
stereotypes, emphasizes the appeal of graphic narrative formats for “visual learners,”
“English language learners,” and “struggling male students, asserting that “naysayers”
would need to be converted to the idea that these texts “deserved a place in the school
library,” and, as is suggested in the issue’s expressed theme, that school librarians don’t
currently “know” graphic novels. Given the female-dominated nature of school
librarianship, it is possible “that bias against comics and graphic novels in the school
library is rooted in gender bias” (Nyberg, 2010, 33). Lapp, Wolsey, Fisher and Frey
(2012) found that 41.4% of elementary teachers surveyed “strongly disagreed” with
using graphic narrative formats in reading instruction. Friese (2013) reflects on her own
prejudice against the format: “Instead of an inferior type of reading, I realized that

29

graphic narratives represent a more sophisticated, multimodal form of reading than
alphabet-only texts” (p. 26). Fisher and Frey (2004) draw distinctions among the
graphic narrative text formats, writing that they found “having begun with the idea that
graphic novels were comic books at best and a waste of time at worse, we now realize
the power they have for engaging students” (p. 24). Like Friese and Frey and Fisher,
many readers might enjoy some of the range of graphic narrative text formats available,
once they get over their initial prejudices. Boyer (2010) highlights the importance of
enticing readers of more textual narrative formats to try graphic narratives. “Graphic
novels are not only a tool to attract reluctant readers and teens. They are also a very
powerful form of storytelling. However, this medium can only reach its full potential if
librarians are proactive in advocating their graphic novel collection to both their
traditional supporters and the untapped audience” (p. 141). Schwartz and RubinsteinAvila (2006) suggest “educators and literacy researchers need to broaden our
definitions of text and recognize our bias towards written text is a result of our
socialization in a print-dominated world” (p. 48), suggesting that in graphic narrative text
format, “multimodality is difficult to comprehend and build upon to make meaning”
(Schwartz & Rubinstein-Avila, 2006, p. 40). Graphic narrative formats can require much
of the reader, including “comprehending a range of literary devices, including narrative
structures, metaphor and symbolism, point of view, the use of puns and alliteration,
intertextuality and inference” (Smeana, Odelson, Burns, and Grisham, 2009, p. 233).
But why do these materials appeal to some readers in particular? When looking
at reading motivation, the notion of “interestingness” recurs. “Access to books and other
interesting reading materials is a critical factor in becoming a good reader,” assert Ross,

30

McKechnie and Rothbauer (2006), but without any specification of what interestingness
might constitute (p. 42). In Hirsch’s (1999) study of children’s online information seeking
behavior, the “interestingness” of materials were one of four criteria students used in
resource selection, which she considered a potential barrier to information use as the
“desire for ‘interesting’ materials often led them on tangents that hampered their
searching efficiency.” K.T. Horning (2010) suggests that the appeal might be a different
sort of intellectual orientation: “The speed with which graphic novels have taken hold in
the children’s book industry and their increasing popularity with children and teens is
perhaps a testament to a growing recognition of the needs and interests of visual
learners” (p. 34). Smetana, Odelson, Burns and Grisham (2009) describe the elements
important to full comprehension of a graphic narrative text:
The skills students use to interpret graphic novels include analysis, interpretation,
and conjecture, all higher order thinking skills…In graphical novels, pictures
communicate the ideas, themes, and underlying emotions, making the genre
complex. The visual nature forces readers to use what they know to create the
unwritten dialogue – a story not fully conveyed by the words. Students analyze
how use of color, light, shadow, and lines influence the tone and mood of the
story. They determine how color affects emotion, and how facial expressions and
body language convey emotions and feelings not printed in the text, In addition,
students examine how pictures can stereotype people, how angles of viewing
affect perception, and how realism or the lack of it affects the message of the
work. (p. 230)
In addition to engaging the visual literacies, there are other positive aspects to
using graphic narrative text formats. In their comparison of nonfiction graphic novels
with textbook coverage, Guzzetti and Mardis (2014) found that, as far as subject area
content and concepts, they “provide much the same breadth of content as traditional
types of texts, but present the content with the aid of visual representations that can aid
understanding.” Even Horning seems to value the informational in graphic narrative text,

31

as she writes, “those that fall into the nonfiction category are among the best of the
genre” (p. 34). Whatever the subject matter of the text, readers of graphic narrative text
formats, like the manga readers studied by Schwartz and Rubinstein-Avila (2006) who
they found “attend to graphical information at the same hierarchical level as the printed
text. This is a drastic change from traditional reading that involves attending first and
foremost to the written text, using pictures and illustrations only as supplements” (p.
41).
Many academics feel that graphic novels, comics, and manga constitute a format
rather than a genre. Genre is defined as “a way to group books with similar style, form,
or content” (Laminack & Bell, 2004, p. 248). Laminack and Bell (2004) describe the
stretching and difficulty in defining today’s literature for young people in terms of
established genres, positing that, though the literature is increasingly blurring the
established distinctions, young readers need to develop discernment about
differentiating fiction and fact. And the confusing hybrid texts are among the most
popular. Jeff Kinney’s Diary of a Wimpy Kid series and Rachel Renee Russell’s Dork
Diaries include comics supplemented with ample text, with no definitive answer
regarding its format forthcoming from author or publisher. Dreang observed “more and
more authors, illustrators, and publishers are choosing the synergistic relationship of
word and pictures as the preferred means to convey meaning” (1999, p. 88). One thing
is certain, “the reading of these books requires different skills than novels with prose
only” (Griffith, 2010, p. 185).

32

Reading Choice
In their Reading at Risk report, the Carnegie Foundation advanced that, at the
high school level in particular, “students’ engagement increased by not only having
diverse texts and multimedia resources, but by building in student choices. It is
important to provide students with opportunities to select materials they read” (1996, p.
6). But even in settings promoting reading choice, the same derision and lack of
legitimacy once applied by librarians and educators to entire classes of literature seems
to have been absorbed by even the young readers. In their pilot of the Adolescent
Motivation to Read Profile (AMRP), a group of literacy researchers noticed a theme
emerging from the conversational portion of the AMRP interview, there were
“discrepancies among teens’ views of what counts as reading. Adolescents clearly
identified the importance of choice in their literacy lives, an issue long documented in
the literature” (Pitcher et al., 2007, p. 393). Jacobs (2006) also found that, to young
people, “real reading means the reading of certain kinds of books” (p. 102). Rothbauer
identified this as one of the myths leading to the “reading problem” often decried in the
popular press, “sustained engagement with magazines, comics, graphic novels,
newspapers, and a variety of online text typically counts for little or nothing when it
comes to assessments of the reading behavior of young adults” (p. 102). Gavigan
(2013) noted that while “some librarian are quick to pigeonhole graphic novels as a tool
for struggling readers,” the graphic narrative text formats “present information in ways
that are more enjoyably understood by a wide variety of readers” (p. 26).
But educators face challenges in legitimizing student choice in reading practice.
A decade earlier, Goncalo’s (1997) research examined the process young adults take in

33

independently selecting books. More than half the students preferred selecting their
own books rather than having texts assigned by a teacher. Griffith (2008) chose to
investigate the characteristics of “chosen” books, those most highly circulated at a
range of Texas middle schools. But Griffith acknowledges that those books were
constrained by the collection, and a book’s popularity in one local setting did not predict
whether it would even appear in the collection of another middle school. Some
educators and reading programs have countered than, when reading “for fun,” students
tend not to “stretch” themselves by choosing more difficult text. Krashen (1996)
illustrates that voluminous rather than challenging reading is associated with academic
achievement and that “there is no evidence that children who read for pleasure will stick
to easy books and never progress” and, in fact, “the books children select on their own
are more difficult than the reading material assigned by teachers” (p. 5).
Lynne McKechnie (2006), one of the few LIS researchers working at the
intersection of text and reader, studied what constitutes legitimate reading material for
boys and how that material is defined in light of assessed gender differences in reading.
She chose to use book ownership, rather than circulation, as a metric indicating
engagement with text. Many chose nonfiction as a favorite, including “jokes, magic,
sports, survival guides, crafts, science, dictionaries, maps, nature, and dinosaurs” (p.
62). Most boys articulated some anxiety that what they enjoyed reading was “not really
reading” (p. 65). McKechnie states that librarians can play an important part “in
legitimizing the reading practices of boys” (p. 66). Moeller (2013) also discusses the
gender bias implicit with these sorts of texts, “I have found that male and female high
school students enjoyed reading graphic novels, but to varying degrees, with male

34

students expressing more enjoyment in understanding the author and illustrator’s full
intention through text and visuals, and female students conveying that they switch their
graphic novels reading with traditional novel reading to more fully exercise their
imaginations” (p. 14). After interviewing ten young adults who used the graphics
collection at the Central Library of the Queens Public Library System, Zabriskie (2010)
responds to an unstated assumption about reader choice. He found “the vast majority
indicated that graphics had, indeed, lead them to other kids of books in the collection,
with scifi, fantasy, mystery, and drawing books being their favorites” (p. 170).
Given an overarching cultural inheritance which sees some materials as inherently
superior and both school and public library systems contextualizing services for children
and youth as related to academic information needs, it is perhaps not surprising that the
introduction of less traditional forms of text into school library media centers has been
met with both resistance on the part of seasoned librarians, many of whom have
additional concerns based on previous investments in media in now outdated or
obsolete formats, and simultaneously with great enthusiasm by student-centered
educators who embrace the idea of literacy support for different learning modalities.
Inclusion of a broader range of materials can benefit student engagement, improve
library usage, and develop adolescent literacies. Stocking and promoting a variety of
library materials, of varying degrees of seriousness, might actually support reader
selection of canonical and informational text.

CHAPTER 3
RESEARCH DESIGN
Introduction
To explore intensive literacy practice using textual narratives and graphic
narratives from the school library, data was collected from the majority of students in a
grades 9-12 high school using the Adolescent Motivation to Read Profile questionnaire.
The research setting and preparation, including Internal Review Board documentation,
were established according to university regulations and the survey administered
systematically. The results were examined to construct some understanding of the
interaction between student reader engagement with graphic narrative text formats and
attitudes towards libraries. That self-reported attitudinal data was also examined for
statistical significance in light of students’ historical engagement with graphic narrative
text formats in the high school library. There is a correlation between the consultation of
graphic narrative text formats in the high school library and improved regard for libraries
and reading among the adolescents surveyed.

Research Setting
The setting for this research study was a medium-sized rural school in north
Alabama with an enrollment of 894 students. A traditional American high school grade
configuration, the school enrolls students in grade ninth through twelfth. During the
period of the research, students at the school ranged in age from 14 to 20 years of age,
with 425 female students and 469 male students, and 239 students are enrolled in ninth

37

grade, 226 in tenth grade, 206 in eleventh grade, and 225 in twelfth grade. The ethnic
breakdown of all students at the school is reflected in Table 3.

The high school was the only public facility in the school district serving grades
none through twelve and as such educated all students from the rural community. The
percentage of students eligible for free and reduced lunch based on federal guidelines
for household poverty was 26%, compared with 52% of students statewide. With
Alabama high schools divided into six divisions based on school size for athletic
competitions, the school competed in the 5A, or the fifth largest of the six,
classifications. Academic achievement was a priority for the student body and school
faculty, and district-wide scores on the state’s standardized testing program were
second highest in the state in 2011-12 and 2012-13.

38

Sampling
The study made use of convenience sampling, since proximity and ease of
access for the researcher allowed for whole-school involvement. Two processes were
used to categorize respondents based upon their reading format preferences. The first
group, an affinity group, was identified as supportive of visual literacies based on selfreporting on the AMRP. Students in this affinity group answered either A or B on Q22
(na = 343). A smaller, historical group was isolated based on circulation records (nh =
45). The two groups were established so that distinctions could be made between
reader attitudes and demonstrated behavior when appropriate. As it is a correlational
study, the researcher did not manipulate the data but paired existing data from the
school’s library management software with the elicited attitudinal responses from
student participants.
The past academic years’ worth of library transactions were pulled from the
automated circulation system. This method was used to identify known readers of
graphic narrative formats. A slightly larger number of students who had historically
chosen graphic narrative text formats returned assent forms (45 of 50, or 0.90%) in
contrast with 700 of 866, or 0.81%).

Research Preparation
Prior to the administration of the public domain AMRP survey instrument, both
school building and district level approval for research involving students were sought
and received, as well as the oversight of the University of North Texas Institutional
Review Board. In addition to the existing AMRP inventory, the researcher included two
additional questions about graphic novels, comics, and other graphic narrative text
formats. These questions were structured to parallel those in the established
instrument. All students in the school will be recruited to take the survey portion of the
AMRP.

Instruments Gauging Reading Motivation
In the recent past, literacy researchers have turned their attention to motivation
as a factor in children’s literacy. Researchers have discovered that young people with
strong intellectual and cognitive skills may not spend much time engaged in reading
40

practice if he or she is not motivated or presented with material which engages their
interest success (Turner, 1995). A National Reading Research Center (NRRC) project
funded by the United States Department of Education conducted in the 1990s found
that affective elements including values, beliefs, and social factors contribute to reader
engagement and related demonstrably to improved comprehension
(Wigfield & Guthrie, 1997).
In the past few decades, an increasing number of researchers have started to
look at affective components of literacy motivation and tools have been developed to
that end. Instruments developed to gauge reading motivation include Guthrie’s Contexts
for Engagement and Motivation in Reading (Kamil, Mosenthal, Pearson, & Barr, 2000).
Guthrie’s instrument does not easily translate to a library setting as it uses instructional
contexts. While limited to classroom settings, Guthrie found that student’s improved
engagement and motivation improved when students were provided choice and
“interesting texts” which were “familiar, vivid, important, and relevant,” factors, which
nonetheless mirror the goals of many library collection development policies. Another
attitudinal gauge related to literacy, the Denver Reading Attitude Survey (Rhodes,
1992), asks about student’s current practice with reading and writing. Though both the
Denver Reading Attitude Survey and the Motivation to Read Profile (MRP) were
designed for administration to elementary aged students, the MRP differs from the
Denver tool in that it is more concerned with abstract attitudes than concrete behaviors.
The MRP is a public-domain instrument designed by Gambrell, Palmer, Codling
and Mazzoni (1995) to provide classroom teachers with an efficient and reliable way to
assess student’s reading motivation. The MRP can collect both qualitative and

41

quantitative data, evaluating students' self-concept as readers and the abstract value
they place on reading. The MRP consists of two basic instruments: the Reading Survey,
a Likert-type, self- reported, group-administered instrument and a supplementary
conversational interview to be administered on an individual basis. The MRP was
designed so that information derived from an analysis of the results could be useful in
planning instruction and literacy support activities, particularly for unmotivated
individuals.
This 20 question survey and 14 question conversational interview which
comprise the MRP are based on Eccles’ expectancy-value theory (Eccles 1983) which
theorizes that the value that students place on reading activities and the perception or
“expectation” that the student has of their own reading abilities is what drives reading
motivation. The MRP is divided into two sections, the reading survey and a one-on-one
conversational interview. The survey portion is structured to determine how the reader
feels about their reading and the value that the reader places on the act of reading,
addressing each of these areas through ten questions, for a total of twenty items. The
survey’s structure was based on the fact that it needed to be accessible for elementary
age students, to fit into a range of teaching styles, function as a group assessment tool,
and involved the previously defined attitudinal dimensions. In its initial administration,
the MRP survey was given to 330 elementary school students from 27 classrooms,
within 4 schools located in 2 school districts in the Eastern US. That group’s findings
indicated that the survey scores showed a positive correlation with the student’s level of
reading achievement. The MRP reading survey was validated through field testing using

42

construct validity, factor analyses, reliability of subscales, and pre-and post-test
reliability (Gambrell et al., 1996)
THE MRP was adapted for older children as the Adolescent Motivation to Read
Profile (AMRP). The AMRP was designed in 2006 by a team of eleven researchers to
be used with young adults at eight sites in the United States and Trinidad (Pitcher,
Albright, DeLaney, Walker, Seunarinesingh, Mogge, Headley, Ridgeway, Peck, Hunt, &
Dunston, 2007). The AMRP is based on the original MRP, and, like the Denver Reading
Attitude Survey, elicits information about the value students placed on reading activities
by focusing on the frequency of a range of reading tasks. Like the MRP, the main
portion of the AMPR is a survey instrument with a supplemental interview component.
Several of the questions from the MRP were reworked in the AMRP instrument in order
to make the language more appropriate for assessing the reading motivation of
adolescents. Pitcher et al. (2007) found that, across settings and cultures, the AMRP
reflected “students’ self-concepts as readers and their value of reading coincided with
their reading choices and overall enjoyment of reading” (p. 391). As with the MRP, the
survey questionnaire portion of the AMRP is a Likert-type self-reported, groupadministered document. It was been used in a variety of educational settings and
validated through the process of factor analysis to ensure reliability (Gavigan, 2010).
The AMRP was chosen for use in this study as it is available, flexible, and ageappropriate for high school students. The AMPR reading survey is designed to be
administered to a group simultaneously, with a supplementary conversational interview
administered on an individual basis. Both elements of the AMRP survey assess two
dimensions of reading motivation, self-concept as a reader and belief in the value of

43

reading. The AMRP items elicit information about the respondents’ self-perceived
competence in reading and their self-perceived performance as a reader relative to their
peers. Two questions were added to the survey to better meet the needs of this study.
These additional questions, Q 21 and Q 22, were designed to assess adolescents’
responses to materials in a non-textual format.

The Null Hypothesis
When attempting to determine whether there was a measurable difference
between the literacy practice of students who read graphic novels and other graphic
narrative formats compared with students who had not read those formats, this study
relied upon the null hypothesis. When the AMRP survey responses were categorized
according to each respondent’s historic engagement with textual narrative formats, data
analysis assumed there would be no statistical significant difference between students
who engaged with graphic narrative text formats and those that engaged only with
textual narratives, in terms of attitudes towards books, literacy, and libraries.

Quantitative Approach
A variable is “any property of a person, thing, event, setting, and so on that is not
fixed” (Connaway & Powell, 2010, p. 53). Treating engagement with graphic narrative
text as an independent variable, this study examined and teen reading motivation as
reported through the AMRP instrument. The null hypothesis was used to evaluate if
expanded text format preference can be considered to be associated with differences in
attitudes towards reading and libraries. As a correlation study, this examination sought

44

to explicate the relationship between student engagement with graphic narrative types
and attitudes towards literacy practice. This provides a theoretical basis for future
research to determine possible causal relationships, which would suggest the
availability of graphic narrative text formats in school libraries could improve student
attitudes surrounding reading and libraries.

Data Collection
Data collection representing individual or collective reading interest has been
amassed in other studies using a wide range of methods, including self-reporting,
observation, and more isolated metrics. Self-reporting techniques can include surveys,
interviews, and questionnaires where the reader names past selections or chooses or
ranks titles listed on the instrument. Behavioral observations include the researcher
focusing on children’s demonstrated behavior, which can suggest new theories or
approaches through either analysis of book discussions and observations in field notes.
A less commonly used method involves examining library circulation records, either of a
particular student or cohort of students.

Researcher Access
Additional issues are raised when, as in this study, the researcher is what
Clawson (2009) terms, “part of the community.” As the researcher works as the school
librarian in the building, an existing rapport between her and some respondents may be
present. The survey was administered to participants with assurance that the
researcher will be soliciting their honest opinions, that the data would be anonymized,

45

and that there were be no right or wrong answers or repercussions from participation or
non-participation. The researcher had only been working in the community for one
semester at the time of data collection, which does mitigate the issue of familiarity.
This study opted to recruit participants though the school-wide announcements
(broadcast daily to students) and messaging software (to ensure parental awareness
about the paperwork required). The questionnaire was administered to students in their
English classes. The instrument was designed to take between fifteen and twenty
minutes to administer, and time allotted was ample. Since the majority of the faculty has
not been trained in human subjects research considerations, the local school
administration decided that the researcher would be the best person to administer the
survey to the students, which I did over the course of a week.

Problems with Self-Reporting
The data from the survey is self-reported. “it is impossible to determine from selfreport instruments alone whether or not students actually feel, believe, or do the things
they report” (Gambrell et al.,1996, p. 9). Bowling (2005) identified three elements of selfreporting approaches that can influence data quality: the methods of contacting the
respondents, the medium of delivering the questionnaire to the respondents, and the
mechanism used to administer the questionnaire (p. 282). Using Bowling’s taxonomy of
data collection by questionnaire, this study falls into the mode she defines as “traditional
paper and pencil self-administration interview methods,” carried out by “handing paper
questionnaires to people in person and asking them to complete them by hand and
return them to the researcher” (p. 282). This method of administering the instrument

46

eliminates many of the concerns Bowling raises about electronic data collection
mechanisms or telephone contact with respondents, but it should be noted that paperand-pencil administration requires respondents to have basic literacy skills and be able
to follow directions. As the AMRP has been designed particularly for adolescent
respondents, comprehension of the questionnaire should be a minimal concern as the
language and survey structure are age-appropriate.
Another potential pitfall to data quality is that connected with what is termed
social desirability bias, the concern on the part of questionnaire respondents to provide
a “correct” response based on societal expectations: “Respondents have been shown to
give more positive and socially desirable responses in interview (face-to-face and
telephone) surveys than in self-administration surveys” (Bowling, 2005, p. 286).
Acquiescence bias, where it is easier to agree than disagree with the questions posed,
is another factor that had been demonstrated to have less influence in self-reporting
methods than in other methods of data collection. This can be countered through
purposeful instrument design, specifically alternating between strongly agree and
strongly disagree as the first option presented on Likert-type scales (Bowling, 2005, p.
287). Gambrell et al. (1996) describe incorporating this sort of structure, with some
response alternatives proceeding “from the most positive to the least positive while
others are ordered in the opposite way,” into the MRP, “to control for the threat of the
‘response set’ (i.e., children selecting the same response for each item)” (Gambrell et
al., 1996, p. 4) The researcher follows Babbie’s (1990) recommendation with regard to
oral administration of the questionnaire – adhering to the instrument’s question working
exactly (pp. 191-92).

*Students in the library circulation data include withdrawn students, bringing the total number of
students in the software to some 66 students more than the enrollment (n = 850).

Using Circulation Records
The use of circulation records to determine graphic format reader’s attempts to
counter an acknowledged problem with reliability surrounding self-reporting of reading
interest. Favat (1977) believes closely examining library circulation records provides a
technique that “probably does give an accurate indication of children’s interest in a
particular book, and by generalization, in particular types of books” (p. 87). In using
circulation records, Gross (2006) suggested that it is necessary to quantify information
seeking activities to explain and predict those behaviors (p. 69). Gross interviewed each
student at the point of checkout to determine whether the transaction was either selfgenerated or imposed by a teacher. She equates circulation with information use,
overlooking items used to satisfy information needs within the library and assuming
those materials checked out would help students to fill their information gap. Gross does
not attempt to track the needs of student who left without materials, nor does she

48

acknowledge that leaving with materials does not necessarily imply consumption of
materials checked out. By relying on data already existing in machine system, the
methods in this study, unlike Gross’, required no researcher intervention.
Brenner (2009) wrote about the importance of circulation records in collection
analysis and development of collections of graphic novels (the catch-all term she uses
for what this study instead terms graphic narrative formats). She models methods to
contrast series and volume popularity and to parse reports to look at what is currently
versus historically popular. Brenner acknowledges that “circulation numbers for graphic
novel collections have always been a selling point,” expanding:
those of us who work with graphic novels know that all graphic novels circulate
more than prose novels for one simple reason: they’re faster to read. A patron
may walk out with 12 graphic novels and come back three days later for 15 more,
but that is less true of patrons checking out a pile of novels. That doesn’t make
graphic novel circulation numbers insignificant, it just means you have to
remember what you are talking about.
Bearing in mind Brenner’s caveats, the researcher, like Gross, will rely upon
circulation records, but those will be used to characterize the readers rather than the
transaction. Based upon the past year’s circulation data, a user-defined field within the
automated catalog system has historically been used to divide the student population
into two types of readers, those who engage with graphic formats or those who read
only text-based formats, for the purpose of grant funding and other forms of data
analysis. This method is less invasive than Gross’s collection of imposition status at the
point of checkout. The designations remains invisible to those library patrons and staff
while allowing an easy contrast between the borrowing habits of two groups of readers
in search of important pattern by age, gender, ethnicity and other demographic criteria.

49

Gross developed her model of the imposed query from a combination of
qualitative and quantitative data. In 1996, she gathered and sorted 369 circulation
transactions to inform her theory, which is well regarded within the LIS literature. As in
Gross’ study, reliance on circulation is somewhat problematic for the reason that
selection of any title does not necessarily mean consumption of the text and certainly
cannot be interpreted as an affirmative endorsement of the text. Nonetheless, any
reader having made the decision to select and check out a title out of a library will
examine that material to confirm some interest in the material, be it fleeting.
Some additional problems are inherent in close scrutiny of circulation data.
Students have a variable degree of access to books at home, from friends, and in other
library settings. Some students might have extenuating circumstances that they feel
does not allow them to take materials from the school library, resulting in only in-house
consultation, unauthorized borrowing, or outright theft. This is of concern not only
because it indicates that circulation records will not capture every iteration of a student’s
engagement with or consumption of a given text, but also because misshelved or
missing materials are often reflected as part of the overall collection until the library
undergoes an inventory and, as such, the catalog as reflected in the status of materials
within the automation system is not necessarily a representation of what is on the shelf
for student use at any given moment.
Another limitation concerning circulation data and generalizability is the
inconsistent nature of collections of reading materials found across school libraries.
Library professionals often disagree about which titles are appropriate for public schools
to hold and circulate, demonstrating their own philosophical biases about what readers,

50

and in particular young people, should be reading (Asheim, 1953). A range of more
pragmatic factors ranging from professional staffing to materials funding can sway
selection and result in a library collection which that does not meet the best practices for
serving students of a given age group. Among school librarians, in particular, selfcensorship or selection-as-censorship is considerable (Cordell, 2008). Many school
libraries are closely oriented around instructional support, while others see their mission
as supporting leisure and pleasure reading. The distinctions between the two sort of
environments map roughly to what Heath & Street (2008) term the formal/informal
dichotomy within educational environment: “formal suggests an authority who instructs
verbally from a given body of knowledge and with predictable skills” while informal
transfer is less likely to involve absolute directional interaction with adults (p. 75). The
philosophies of the individual school librarians are unstated variables, as well as the
librarian’s and previous librarian’s selections for the collection over time.

Data Analysis
In this exploratory study, I strove to establish easily replicable procedures to
identify participants and generate data in a way the information can be both sorted for
further analysis and replicated in other settings. Manipulation of the data began with the
sorting of the student respondents into two groups based on historical reading patterns.
Those designations are nominal rather than ordered in ranking, and provided
descriptive statistics, including prevalence rates, about the two groups. The next
chapter presents statistically significant differences and the calculation of confidence
intervals related to survey data. A combination of these techniques allows a picture to

51

emerge of how student engagement with text affects attitudes surrounding literacy. I
used Excel spreadsheets and SPSS to track and analyze data generated through the
AMRP.

Summary
This study sought to investigate the relationship between materials consumption
and attitudes surrounding books and literacy. The researcher hoped to characterize the
broad trends visible in the data to make inferences about the effect of interaction with
graphic narrative text formats in the school library on reader attitudes and reader
engagement. The findings demonstrated statistically significant differences between
groups of high school student readers based upon their self-reporting of text formats
preferences and an even stronger relationship between historical engagement with
graphic narrative texts in the school library and attitudes towards literacy and libraries.

CHAPTER 4
STUDY FINDINGS
Research Procedures
The data collection portion of the study was carried out in the spring of 2013, as I
administered the standard Adolescent Motivation to Read Profile (AMRP) instrument
developed by Pitcher et al. (2007) with two additional questions related to reading
preferences of graphic narrative print formats. The research setting was a rural high
school in north Alabama where students were surveyed in every English classroom over
the course of one week. Students who did not return assent paperwork were not part of
the study group.

Demographic Characteristics of Survey Respondents
The number of respondents in each grade was roughly equivalent to the
enrollment at each grade level, demonstrating both attrition through students dropping
out of school, students leaving the campus for dual enrollment and early enrollment
options at the local community college, and emancipated students without parent
assent.
In the ninth grade, there were 215 student respondents. In the tenth grade, there
were 187, and in eleventh grade 172 (Table 5). By twelfth grade, that number was 171
respondents, for a total of 747 total study participants. In the survey instructions,
students were advised that they could skip any questions they chose, and two students
did not respond to grade-level questions, possibly because of a difference in
chronological age and anticipated grade levels due to previous failures.

There was a slight difference in gender among student respondents reflecting the
slightly higher enrollment by male students, possibly attributable to students who
choose to attend from out of district or enroll instead of in local private school for the
purpose of participation in competitive athletics. Some 366 male students responded,
and 345 females responded (Table 6). The 742 total responses included 31 students
who did not specify a gender.

The ethnic breakdown of student respondents reflects the relative homogeneity of the
community (Table 7). Of the students, more than 82%, or 617 individuals, identified as
54

white, non-Hispanic. Hispanic heritage was reflected in 47 students, 24 students
reported multiracial backgrounds, and there were 15 African American and 10 Asian
respondents. Among the students, 32 did not respond to this particular demographic

Another demographic consideration was factored into the data analysis. As the
instrument was administered in the English classroom setting, the control numbers
assigned to each survey reflected the class period and type of English coursework each
class setting represented. Students enrolled in honors course sections of ninth and
tenth grade English and Advanced Placement English Composition and English
Literature coursework were designated as honors students. A little more than 23%of

Data Preparation
Student responses were captured on a paper survey instrument, which the
researcher transferred into data files for analysis using SPSS and Microsoft Excel. In
the process of coding the instruments, I excluded five surveys based on either mostly
incomplete surveys or “response set” errors occurring when the student chose the same
response to each survey question, producing internal contradictions. The coding
scheme for the transfer of the responses is reflected in Appendix D. The responses of
students who skipped questions or even whole pages of the four-page survey were
included, with missing data indicated through SPSS coding. The result was some
16,456 data points, the Likert-type instrument producing scalable data ranges for the 22
items from the survey as well as categorical variables like race, gender, coursework,
and engagement with graphic narrative format materials through library checkout. The
data was normalized and statistical procedures were carried out as recommended by a
range of resources, including Field (2005), Creswell (2004), and Urdan (2005).

Reading Attitudes Captured by the AMRP
The Adolescent Motivation to Read Profile assesses student confidence related
to reading practice, the pleasure and importance the student affords reading, and their
social perceptions related to reading practice. For the purposes of this the research
questions, the items related to reading pleasure and attitudes towards libraries were
most germane.
Two additional study-specific questions were added to the instrument. These
were designed to gauge student preference for graphic narrative text formats while
mimicking the question structure of the existing validated instrument. Question 21
(reflected as Q21 in the data set) asked students to complete the phrase “When you are
deciding what to read, illustration are…” with options for answering being not very
important, sort of important, important, or very important. Like the AMRP items, the
responses were scaled. Question 22 (reflected as Q22 in the data set) read “I think
comics, graphic novels, or manga are…” with options for response stated as boring, not
very interesting, interesting, and very interesting. The “or” operator was deliberately
included so that respondents would be as inclusive as possible when considering these
text formats. As with the rest of the instrument, the directional order of occurrence of
scaled items in Question 21 and 22 were reversed to ensure students paid ongoing
attention to the response task, which was demonstrated through correlation of the two
final questions, which was found to be statistically significant. The normal distribution of
responses to Q21 and Q22 is reflected in Tables 9 and 10.

Views of Reading and Libraries
Q1: Is engagement with graphic narrative text formats, ranging from comics to graphic
novels and manga, on the part of high school students related to a more favorable view
of reading and libraries?
This research question involved identifying student who had historically chosen
graphic narrative texts from the high school library. Data from the survey instrument was
matched against the circulation system’s log of transactions involving materials in these

58

more visual formats, and those students historically engaged with graphic narrative text
formats were reflected by the grouping designation GF=1 (Table 11).

AMRP survey item ten relates to libraries. Respondents are asked to complete
the phrase, “I think libraries are…” with the provided options being a boring place to
spend time, an okay place to spend time, an interesting place to spend time, and a
great place to spend time. The question did not specify school or public library settings,
but the administration of the instrument within the school environment might have led
students to believe it was related to the library on campus. It is worth noting as well that
while the “okay” response is second from the bottom of the scale, it is still relatively
affirmative. AMRP survey items correlated with survey question ten are ranked in order
of the strength of the correlation, indicating the relationship between variables. (Table
12).
The correlational research design requires standardization of scores to determine
the relationship existing between groups. The Pearson correlation coefficient is
considered to be significant when measuring relationship between numerical values at
59

the 0.01 level, and among categorical variables (in this study, those include ethnicity,
gender, honors coursework, and grade level as grouping variables) at the 0.05 level for
scaled variables. The graphic narrative format readers did show an improved correlation
with affinity for libraries when contrasted with the group as a whole (Table 12), but it did
not appear as strong as more abstract enjoyment of reading and books.

Two paired t-tests were used to further elucidate the relationship between engagement
with these text formats and attitudes towards libraries. The first t-test confirms the
likelihood of the more positive attitude towards libraries occurring in the population as
well at the sample (Table 13).

The difference between the means (GF readers = 3.36 and non-GF readers = 2.51) is
marked between students who have engaged with graphic narrative print formats from
the school library and those who have not. It is understandable that, given the relatively
small sample size of the graphic narrative format readers, the measurement of standard
error in this group would be larger. To better understand the role that experience in the
school library pays in shaping reader attitudes, the same question was evaluated in

61

terms of the affinity group (students who answered in the affirmative to Q22) was
contrasted with students without demonstrated affinity (Table 14).

While the possibility for error is decreased in the affinity group, the difference between
the means decreases as well. While the positive attitude towards libraries is present
among readers in the graphic narrative format affinity group, but not to the extent it
exists in readers who have a history of reading graphic narrative print formats from the
school library.

Differences in Attitudes Based on Historical Engagement with
Graphic Narrative Text
Q2: Is there a difference between attitudes concerning libraries and reading when
students engage with more visual text in comparison with those of their peers who
prefer more textual narrative formats?
The same historical categorical demographic flag (GF) was used to examine
correlations with other survey items. Not surprisingly, the strongest correlation was with
a preference for comics, graphic novels, and manga in response to Q22, the
supplemental survey question designed to get at student openness to these visual
formats, which was used to construct the affinity group. Characteristics of students who
had historically engaged with graphic narrative text formats are represented in Table 15.

62

Also, student responses to the instrument suggest that those graphic narrative
format readers can be characterized as predicting they will read as adults, find reading
fun, and want to receive books as gifts (Table 16).

have confidence in their reading ability.

The Interaction of Format and Reading Frequency
Q3: Do student engaging with graphic narrative text formats report engaging with text
more often?
The second question in the AMRP instrument (AMRP2) asks students to
complete the phrase, “Reading a book is something I like to do…” and offers four
options: never, not very often, sometimes, and often, which was intended as a scale
representing relative scale indicating the frequency of student enjoyment of reading.
Using the students flagged as historically engaging with text in graphic narrative formats
from the school library, we examined the relationship towards reported reading
frequency between students who had chosen graphic narrative text formats in the past
with their peers who had not. The difference between means is reflected in Table 17.

In the same way we established an affinity group in response to Q1, we
determined that the students who expressed an affinity for graphic narrative text formats
through their responses to the survey Q22 were much less likely to differ in their
reported reading frequency (Table 18)

The relationship between the two groups appears much closer when considering
reading frequency than when considering attitudes towards libraries.

Effect Size of Graphic Narrative Format Engagement in
Relation to Reading Frequency
Given the distinction between the reported frequencies of reading among the two
groups, I was interested in gauging how much that effect must be related to the small
sample size of historically engaged graphic narrative format readers. To determine that
effect size, I used the online calculator tool developed by Lee Becker (2000) at
University of Colorado at Colorado Spring as suggested by Salkind (2005, p. 171) at
http://www.uccs.edu/~lbecker/. Note that any negative or positive value produced by the
calculator is a function of the order in which the means and standard deviations were
entered into the calculator. Becker’s effect size calculator produced a Cohen’s d = 0.570
and an effect size = 0.2740402351034146, which Salkind classes as being a “medium”
effect size, falling between 0.20 and 0.40. Computing the effect size indicates the
relative position of one group to another. With an effect size of 0, the groups tend to be
so similar as to overlap entirely, with no difference between the distributions of scores.
Instead, the effect size as computed here suggests that the difference in reading

66

frequency as reported is meaningful as well as significant. While it must be noted that
the independent samples t-test assumes that the amount of variability in each of the two
groups is equal and that the groups are not related, the strength of the relationship
between graphic narrative format preference and reported reading frequency is
demonstrable.

Difference in Attitudes by Demographic Groups
Analysis of responses by grade level found that response trend lines seemed
consistent across grade levels, as visible in Figure 2, with the two largest distinctions in
the averages of responses reported on Items AMRP Q14 (Reading is boring or fun) and
Q18 (Preference for teacher read alouds). Ninth graders were more likely to report
reading was fun (AMRP Q14 M9th = 2.53 and AMRP Q14 M12th = 2.18.) The students’
responses to this item were progressively lower in each successive grade. But another
distinction in average responses was not linearly distributed across grade levels. In
answer to AMRP 18, twelfth grade students average the highest affirmative response
(AMRP Q18 M12th = 2.64), while eleventh grade students indicated the least enthusiasm
for teacher-read alouds (AMRP Q18 M11th = 2.29), likely indicating the teacher was an
important variable.
As might be expected from students with a history of success is coursework, in
sorting responses based on course levels, students enrolled in honors or AP classes
indicated more positive responses overall (Figure 3), with the exception of the first
supplemental question. The question that asked about the importance of illustrations
had more positive responses among the non-honors students (Q21 Mnonhonors = 2.25)

67

than among the honors students (Q21 Mhonors = 2.08). This response seems to
punctuate the emphasis that traditional texts have enjoyed in the established
curriculum, particularly for higher achieving students. But in contrast, when asked
specifically about graphic format materials in the second supplemental question, honors
students indicated a stronger preference (Q22 Mhonors = 2.31) for those than did their
non-honors peers (Q22 Mnonhonors = 2.25).
The demographic fields linked to race are not statistically significant because of
the relatively homogenous student body, but the gender demographics do reveal
significant distinctions in attitudes among the two groups responding to that question,
visible in Figure 4. There are three question where there is particular distinction
between responses based on gender: AMRP2, AMRP7, and AMRP 20. These
responses indicate that teen girls are particularly more likely to say they enjoy reading,
talk about good books with friends, and are happier to receive books as gifts when
contrasted with male peers. Other questions, such as willingness to respond to teacher
questions about what they have read (AMRP 13) and whether reading is easy
(AMRP15) elicit fewer differences in average responses when sorted by gender.

CONCLUSIONS
Findings
The data collected supports a positive relationship between students who have
engaged with graphic narrative text formats and more favorable attitudes towards
reading and libraries. While the relationship was most demonstrable among students
who had historically engaged with graphic narrative formats from the school library,
students who expressed an affinity towards those formats, regardless of means of
access, also reflected a more positive view of libraries than their peers who did not have
those same format preferences. The respondents in the sample also demonstrated a
positive relationship between a graphic narrative format borrowing history and a more
positive view of libraries as a place to spend time. There are also demonstrable
correlations with a number of positive attitudes related to reading, including confidence
in their own reading ability. Furthermore, students who have historically engaged with
graphic narrative text format reported reading more often than their peers. Since
reading volume is so significant to academic success, it seems obvious that school
libraries structure their collections and policies to encourage engagement with visual as
well as more textual narratives if they lead to increased literacy practice.

Characterizing the Opinions of the Graphic Narrative Format Reader
Though only 46 students from the sample of 746 had historically borrowed
graphic narrative format materials from the school library, there were statistically
significant differences among those respondents on 13 of 22 items. The demographics

72

of grade, ethnicity, and type of coursework, and most surprisingly, gender, bore no
significant relationship with graphic format preference. This challenges many of the
preconceptions around graphic narrative formats, particularly those who maintain the
format is preferred by younger, male, or less academically oriented readers.
As demonstrated in a recent national Pew study (2013), the feelings among
these students surrounding libraries mirror those of adults in that they are positive on
the whole. This held across grades and ethnicity, though some gender characteristics
were associated with reported library enjoyment, which provides a direction for future
investigation. For library media specialists this should be reassuring about the existence
of social capital within our communities. As discussed above, students who preferred
graphic narrative text formats were particularly positive when responding to the “library”
question in the instrument.
This finding support Dresang’s assertion that “children who live in a graphic
environment do not leave pictures behind as they grow up. Words and pictures continue
to intermingle in recent text-based stories for older readers” (p. 95). These correlations
have implications for instructional practice, as these students seem to dislike reading
aloud themselves, or having the teacher read to them. But this same group of students
seemed to like talking about books with friends and peers. Replacing read-alouds with
discussions would better meet these students’ learning preferences. Most importantly,
the affinity for libraries as a place to spend time was particularly significant among the
graphic narrative format readers, though the very strongest relationship among the
group was, appropriately, reporting liking comics, graphic novels, or manga.

73

Limitations
When contrasting the students who had read graphic narrative text formats in
the past year with those who hadn’t, responses to the first additional question (Q21)
regarding preferences for illustrative materials did reveal any statistically meaningful
relationships This calls into question the validity of this addition and suggests that
perhaps students think of illustration as fundamentally different from the paratextual
conventions of graphic narrative text formats. It would be interesting to flip the order of
appearance of Q21 and Q22 to draw the relationship between comics, graphic novels,
and manga and illustrated materials prior to the question about illustration appearing
within the instrument. The limitations outlined in the correlational design included the
inability to test validity outside of an experimental design. As a correlational study, this
research can describe relationships but not determine causality.

Directions for Future Research
The AMRP instrument is so robust and considers so many different aspect of
adolescent literacy that the data collected from these 747 students is ripe for clustering
of variables to provide a comprehensive understanding of how a range of students in
one school read and understand their literacy practice, particularly the social aspects
which recur in the instrument questions. The data set is also ready for multivariate
analysis, grouping the AMRP survey items into clusters using the LISREL software for
standard structural equation modeling, would allow for an exploratory factor analysis
with the goal of establishing new relationships between theoretical constructs. The
study could be replicated in a library without a sizable collection of graphic narrative text

74

formats in the collection, which might suggest the role that library access plays in this
aspect of student reading practice.
This research could be expanded with the addition of a second phase of data
collection, using the AMRP interview instrument to probe students more directly on the
selection process and engagement with text outside as well as inside the library and
school settings. The variety of information collected through the interview process would
allow for triangulation of data to present a fuller and more nuanced understanding of the
way these students identify and use text.

Theoretical and Methodological Significance
The data revealed the considerable differences in attitudes existing between the
numbers of students who check out graphic narrative formats in the past academic year
versus those who said they liked those materials. Though only some 6%, of students
had obtained graphic narrative format materials from the school library collection, the
number of students responding to the instrument items related to graphic narrative
formats suggests that some 45% possess an affinity for graphic narrative formats.
Though the existing attitudes towards libraries of the graphic narrative format affinity
group (students responding to Q22 in the affirmative) is not markedly different from their
peers who eschew the graphic narrative formats, actual engagement with those formats
from the school libraries does produce marked differences in attitudes towards libraries.
This suggests an opportunity for school libraries to market their graphic novel, manga,
and comic collections to students who may not realize those materials are available to
them. That population seems primed for strategic outreach and, if the materials in the

75

collection do not prove to interest these students, perhaps incorporating more patrondriven acquisitions would be worthwhile, since engagement with graphic narrative
formats in the school library is associated with improved attitudes towards libraries.
Given Lapp, Wolsey, Fisher, and Frey’s (2012) recent findings that teachers
express reluctance to include graphic narrative formats in instruction, it is clear that the
prejudice against these materials persists. In insistence on inciting productive struggle
as a part of reading practice, the Common Core State Standards assert that academic
reading should be an inherently unpleasant experience. But the consumption of graphic
narrative formats is associated with positive attitudes towards reading and literacy as
well as more intensive reading practice, suggesting that the validation of student
reading choice has much to gain by encompassing narrative formats. By perpetuating
the distinction between these sorts of graphically-oriented texts and those which are
exclusively text-based, teachers and librarians are endorsing an outdated
understanding of how meaning is constructed from text and ignores the equally valuable
skills needed to concurrently decode visual messages.

Implications for Practice
School librarians and teachers working today are among the last generation
socialized into an educational universe where text narratives had primacy. It will be
interesting to see how millennial practitioners develop collections in a world where
graphic formats are not as demonized. In engaging students with conversations around
the graphic format materials, I have discovered how these texts had the potential to
engage students in intense levels of fandom, through a range of literacies at work in fan

76

fiction and fan art; the costumed, live-action text-based role play known as cosplay,
often captured in video productions and photo shoots; and through fully developed
interactive social networking profiles for text-based role playing.
I believe school libraries need to have a support for literacy and reading across
the curriculum at their most fundamental core. The current educational climate
emphasizes on quantitative measures, producing anxiety based on the computed
reading levels for most young adult literature. Many school librarians are echoing claims
of reading specialists and other educators that these texts do not sufficiently challenge
readers with the necessary rigor to prepare them to college and careers. The emphasis
on text complexity has recurred most recently with the introduction of the Common Core
State Standards. The Common Core offers exemplar texts for English Language Arts at
each grade level that seem determined to strip any enjoyment from the experience of
reading literature.
As with the programmatic text students are confronting on standardized tests and
through an increasingly nationalized curriculum, graphic and comic content requires
complex decoding, processing, and interpretation, but in these cases students make
sense of image as well as text, producing a more complicated reading experience.
Young readers repeatedly return to these texts for re-reading, signaling that they
contain sufficient complexity to engage teens with many other media options.
It seems understandable, in the current hotbed of anxiety and justification, many
school librarians worry that support for any one type of materials will lead to students’
overreliance upon that modality, with the implied threat being that all other literacies will
suffer from less attention. In my own practice, I found that incorporating range of graphic

77

format novels for literacy practice as well as curricular support actually increased
involvement with more traditional texts.

Revisiting Radical Change
In conclusion, it is appropriate to revisit Dresang’s concept of radical change, “an
approach which proposes the connectivity, interactivity, and access in the digital world
explain the fundamental changes taking place in the body of literature for young
readers” (1999, p. 14) as it applies to this study. This dissertation research used
Dresang’s framework to identify student readers exhibiting the strongest characteristics
of radical change, but I would be remiss in not pointing out that many other materials
held by libraries today fall along the continuum she outlined. Dresang (1999) suggested
“a book need not have illustration or color to be classified as graphic, but something
about it must be visually striking – if not pictures, then layout, typeface, or special
treatment of words.” (p. 83).
The students who engaged with graphic narrative formats who participated in this
study demonstrated that digital age expectations Dresang outlined have indeed
informed their reading preferences. The even larger number of high school students
who responded that they enjoy reading either graphic narrative formats or illustrated
materials reflects a generally more visually-oriented generation whose expectations for
texts have moved beyond words on a page. My expectation would be that, in other
settings like public libraries with a more intense concentration of voluntary young
readers, the relationship between graphic narrative format preference, professed
enjoyment of reading, and intensity of reading practice could be even stronger. This

78

research also has implications for publishing, advertising, and any other media trying to
reach young people.
The same framework could be applied for students reading online, an
environment that is producing much research at the moment. Whether reading text on
the page or on the screen, Dresang notes that radical change finds “readers interact
with these books by making decisions as they read; they may approach the text in
various nonlinear or nonsequential ways the author does not determine in advance” (p.
14).
The end result is that, in one particular school environment, students engaging
with graphic narrative formats demonstrate many favorable distinctions between those
readers’ attitudes and more intensive reported reading habits when contrasted with their
peers with more textual narrative preferences. It is my hope that this will help to
legitimize the expanded reading practice of young people and provide some justification
for school librarians to stock materials for students who prefer to access to the sorts of
resources Dresang describes “including graphic elements and word-picture
relationships that go far beyond the traditional options of agreement, extension, and
contradiction to arrive at synergy”. These finding support Dresang’s assertion that “an
increasingly thoughtful audience of digitally-wise youth are not only able to read graphic
books but thrive on them” (1999, p. 98).

Adolescent Motivation to Read Profile Reading Survey
Teacher Directions

Distribute copies of the Adolescent Motivation to Read Survey.
(General directions)
Say: I am going to read some sentences to you. I want to know how you feel about your
reading. There are no right or wrong answers. I really want to know how you honestly
feel about reading. I will read each sentence twice. Do not mark your answer until I tell
you to. The first time I read the sentence I want you to think about the best answer for
you. The second time I read the sentence I want you to fill in the space beside your best
answer. Mark only one answer. If you have any questions during the survey, raise your
hand. Are there any questions before we begin? Remember: Do not mark your answer
until I tell you to. OK, let’s begin.
(Read the first sample item.)
Say: Sample 1: I am in (pause) ninth grade, (pause) tenth grade, (pause) eleventh
grade, (pause) twelfth grade.
(Read the first sample again.)
Say: This time as I read the sentence, mark the answer that is right for you. I am in ninth
grade, (pause) tenth grade, (pause) eleventh grade, (pause) twelfth grade.
(Read the second sample item.)
Say: Sample 2: I am a (pause) female, (pause) male.
(Read the second sample again.)
Say: Now, get ready to mark your answer. I am a (pause) female, (pause) male.
Read the remaining items in the same way (e.g., number _____, sentence stem
followed by a pause, each option, followed by a pause, and then give specific directions
for students to mark their answers while you repeat the entire item).
