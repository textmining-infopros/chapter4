ABSTRACT
At-risk students have a complicated scenario of needs that arise from
multiproblem situations and self-destructive behaviors. In schools, literacy is one basic
need. Socially and economically disadvantaged students often read below grade level
early in their school careers and are moved forward regardless of literacy competency.
The No Child Left Behind Act’s requirement to demonstrate adequate yearly progress has
made it more difficult for schools to justify this behavior; however, teaching literacy
skills to disaffected youth has become highly problematic because teachers are
attempting to manage behaviors while teaching their students. Librarians are highly
skilled in literacy and technology, but, ironically, they are isolated from the daily
academics of the school and have a reputation as staff who just “find books” for children
and conduct literature searches.
In an inner-city middle school in North Carolina, various programs were initiated
to attempt to address academic problems and increase adequate yearly progress. The
author of this study, a librarian, developed a program for this school that was designed to
enhance the literacy and technological skills of several students who were identified as
most “at risk.” Concentrating on one-to-one mentoring with school and public librarians,
the author developed a 5-month program called the Weekly Readers Program, which
involved specific weekly curricula, goals, and assignments oriented toward developing
students’ literacy and technological skills. Using one-on-one mentoring and focusing on
iv

students’ self-reflections, the program demonstrated significant successes in many areas,
including a drop in antisocial behavior and an increase in self-esteem.
The focus of this study was to determine the effects of a librarian–student
mentoring program on the academic, behavioral, absenteeism, and self-esteem outcomes
of at-risk students in an urban North Carolina middle school. The author utilized a socialaction research method and continued to gather data and to modify the program through
short feedback loops from student feedback and personal observations. The sample
consisted of 10 at-risk, urban middle school students; additionally, 10 librarians served as
the mentor population. Qualitative data from this study showed significant improvement
in participants’ attitudes toward school and their ability to comprehend information in all
forms during and after mentoring. Significant outcomes surfaced for participants’
disciplinary referrals, which decreased for all participants by the end of the mentoring
experience. An improvement in student self-efficacy was also noted in a presurvey–
postsurvey evaluation model. These improvements suggest that the mentoring effects of a
caring professional librarian can have far-reaching results in an at-risk student’s life.

Him, all things are possible, including this study. To all the at-risk youth whom I have
had the pleasure of mentoring, you are my motivation. Thank you.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Completing this doctoral dissertation has been one of the most significant
academic challenges in my life. This would not have been possible without the love and
support of a great many people, all of whom have nourished me academically, spiritually,
or emotionally—I owe you all a debt of gratitude. In particular, I would like to thank Dr.
Margaret Moore-West, who undertook the role of acting as my advisor and my
committee chair. Despite her many other academic and professional commitments, she
took me under her wing and believed in me when I struggled to believe in myself. Her
wisdom, knowledge, and commitment to the highest standards inspired and motivated
me. I would also like to thank Dr. Richard Abel, my dissertation committee member, for
his leadership and mentorship. He accepted me into the doctoral program and has been
extremely helpful to me in this process. I am also thankful for Dr. Sonal Kumar for taking
time to read and guide my work. Donald Edge III, your love, support, and constant
patience have taught me so much about sacrifice, discipline, and compromise. My
mother, Theresa McDowell, who continually stressed the importance of education,
supported me in times of need and made me realize how lucky I am to have had the
opportunity to become educated. I would also like to thank my sister, nieces, and
family—without them, this effort would have been worth nothing. Finally, I would like to
thank all of my mentors, friends, and educational colleagues, whose help, guidance, and
influence cannot be measured.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. It is a tool for daily life in modern
society. It is a bulwark against poverty, and a building block of development, an
essential complement to investments in roads, dams, clinics and factories.
Literacy is a platform for democratization, and a vehicle for the promotion of
cultural and national identity…. For everyone, everywhere, literacy is, along
with education in general, a basic human right... Literacy is, finally, the road to
human progress and the means through which every man, woman and child can
realize his or her full potential.
—Kofi Annan
A growing number of teens can be identified as at risk throughout the United
States, requiring libraries and schools to collaborate to find new and innovative ways to
serve this population. The purposes of this action-research study were to explore how a
mentoring program assisted with implemented literacy standards and to evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses for programmatic change. Specifically, the study aimed (a) to
assess whether an in-school mentoring program would work to increase at-risk teenagers’
self-esteem, school engagement, and leadership skills and (b) to analyze a 5-month,
librarian-led mentoring initiative designed to promote literacy activities for at-risk teens.

Background
Located just a few miles north of the uptown part of a city in North Carolina,
Middle School, 1 a Title I public school, serves approximately 1,170 students in Grades 6
through 8. Middle School is one of the many middle schools in the North Carolina School
District. 2 At the time of this study, about 86% of the students were on the free or reduced
National School Lunch Program. The student body consisted of approximately 75%
African Americans, 14% Hispanics, 3% Caucasians, 4% multiracial individuals, 3%
Asians/Pacific Islanders, and 1% American Indians/Alaskan Natives. Middle School
teens were struggling with extreme educational inequalities; a concentrated group of atrisk students lived in a neighborhood just a few miles from the flourishing banking
industry of Center City.
I joined Middle School as the school’s media specialist in 2012. During the first 3
weeks of the 2012–2013 school year, I conducted library orientations with students of all
grade levels and reviewed the rules, rewards, consequences, and procedures for the media
center. I also informally surveyed the students to determine their reading interests and
collected information on their demographics, reading levels, and behavioral tendencies
from the school’s secretary, attendance personnel, and literacy and test coordinators. I
also explored the North Carolina Department of Education website, school report, and
system-wide report. I spoke with the school’s principal and many teachers and staff to
find out more about the culture of the school. I quickly noticed gaps between the

privacy.

academic-achievement and college-readiness levels of students at Middle School, and
literacy was the central problem in placing students at risk.
The term at risk can have undesirable connotations, and the average person’s
perception of what an at-risk teen looks and acts like is not usually very pleasant. With
the goal of helping teens at risk, Middle school attempted to place these teens in at-risk
programs that met certain criteria (e.g., socioeconomic, racial, or familial background).
However, without a solid foundation of reading and technology skills, I expected that the
children would continue to struggle throughout their schooling and adult life. By teaching
the best comprehension and information literacy strategies to the students, I hoped to
provide the foundation that these students needed to succeed. Although the school’s test
results did not meet the state’s expectations, I formulated a way to improve it.
The State of America’s Libraries report for 2010 affirmed that the beginning of
the new decade would be “a perfect storm of growing demand and shrinking resources”
(American Library Association, 2010, p. i). During the recession of 2010, libraries across
the country became the only source of information, computer access, entertainment,
continuing education, and employment resources for many. While the sluggish economy
drove people of all ages to their libraries in record numbers, funding for libraries also
lagged behind. Many libraries, whether public, academic, private, or school, decreased
programs and operating hours, released staff, and even closed their facilities. School
media centers nationwide faced severe budget cuts, layoffs, or in many cases, were no
longer given control over their designated funds (Allen & Bradley, 2009). Due to drastic
budget cuts and staff shortages, the momentum that the teen-services movement had

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

4

gained in libraries during the first decade of the 21st century practically came to a
standstill. With shrinking library budgets and reductions in staff and operating hours,
library services for teen patrons, and by extension, for at-risk teens, declined as libraries
scrambled to keep their doors open and make ends meet.
According to a 2004 study completed by the Wallace Foundation, library-based
youth-development programs could provide both specific job skills and personal and
social development for teens. Additionally, such programs could provide opportunities
for teens to develop positive relationships with adults and peers and increase their
knowledge, appreciation, and use of the library. From a librarian standpoint, youth
reading and technology programs could also improve the skills and attitudes of staff
working with teens, fostering more positive attitudes toward reading and learning.
Changing staff members’ mind-set regarding teens can influence the “broader culture of
the library and lead to future positive interactions” (p. 6). The Wallace Foundation’s
study indicated that “more positive staff attitudes towards teens generally have a positive
impact on a library’s ability to attract youth patrons and interact with them in
developmentally appropriate ways” (p. 7).
In support of my research, youth-service librarians, school-media specialists,
institutional librarians, and library paraprofessionals who serve at-risk teens agree that
this population requires more patience and attention than average teens but also that they
are worth the effort. It is very important that leaders are passionate about the teens they
serve. My observations about the difficulties that library leaders and staff encounter when
working with at-risk teens in libraries or schools are mainly that they have limited time

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

and ability to reach them. Library staff are usually unaware that they have everything to
do with how teens perceive and utilize library services. Because libraries are constantly
changing leadership, resulting in inconsistent learning strategies for the at-risk teens, it
becomes difficult for library staff to connect with the at-risk population on a consistent
basis. Librarians are always willing to support shared leadership but are often forced to
lead singly because of lack of support from other leaders. School administrators do not
often prioritize librarians’ program ideas, research efforts, or partnerships with other
organizations:
There is a growing debate within leadership studies over whether or not
leadership should be regarded either as an individual or as a shared activity. When
suggesting that leadership is a shared or group-level activity, an individual might
step forward to lead or step back to follow depending on the moment and the
skills and knowledge required. (Jackson & Parry, 2011 p. 99)
This action-research study addressed the ethical and moral aspects of leadership.
All adults working with teens in the context of providing leadership, mentoring, or other
services have a crucial and privileged role, one that can carry a great deal of power and
influence. Whether acting as a librarian, youth advisor, or teacher or in any role, they
have a special opportunity to interact with the young people in ways that are affirming
and inspiring to them as well as to other adults. Ciulla (as cited in Jackson & Parry, 2011)
briefly summarized three moral facets in her definition of ethical and effective leaders:
“someone who does the right thing, the right way, and for the right reasons . . . [and are]
pillars of virtue in one or two of these areas but wrong in one or others” (p. 114).

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

I have seen many ethical failures in leadership during my career as public
librarian that substantiate this statement. Librarians who serve youth usually attempt to
do the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons and, therefore, believe that they are
being ethical. They lead teens with character and integrity by setting positive examples.
However, some librarians feel demoralized when most of their time and energy is spent
disciplining unruly teenagers who have no respect for the library or other patrons. For
example, I have noticed that librarians who were not hired to work specifically with
young adults and teens have a hard time working with teens, especially those at-risk. It is
important that all library staff think of teens as people first and teens second. They should
be friendly and nonaggressive if a teen doesn’t need or want their help. Librarians must
ask teens questions, engage in conversation, and not assume that, just because somebody
is an adolescent, he or she is up to no good. Many librarians are unaware of the impact
they have on teens, and this causes an imbalance to the culture of the library. All
librarians should take pride in knowing that teens look to them for advice, guidance, and
structure; therefore, it is their responsibility to be prepared and properly trained to
demonstrate effective leadership while positively interacting with children and young
adults. My research focused on the important values of librarians as well as leadership
values in serving teens at risk. It is ultimately the responsibility of the entire organization
and community, not just those in leadership positions, to create and maintain a climate
that supports the growth and welfare of all youth.
Many teens have more than one risk factor affecting their lives and well-being.
Unfortunately teens struggle with poverty and other disruptive lifestyle factors, such as

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

7

academic disparities, behavioral issues, low self-esteem, violence at home, and mental
illness. People tend to believe the generalization that all at-risk teens come from lowincome or underprivileged backgrounds, which is simply not the case. It is true that many
at-risk teens come from disadvantaged socioeconomic circumstances (e.g., low family
income, ethnic- or linguistic-minority background, parents without a high school
diploma; Druian & Butler, 1987); however, privileged youth can also be at-risk for
failure, as they are sometimes isolated, neglected, and suffer from the pressures of their
families. For instance, children from upper class families have been found to “manifest
elevated disturbance in several areas--such as substance use, anxiety, and depression”
(Luthar & Latendresse, p. 49), and research has shown that “children with very high
perfectionist strivings—those who saw achievement failures as personal failures—had
relatively high depression, anxiety, and substance use, as did those who indicated that
their parents overemphasized their accomplishments” (p. 50).
Guerra (2010) reported common risk factors that teens face, including “abuse, high
rates of drop-out and expulsion, grade retention, gang involvement and many are
involved with transitioning from the child welfare or juvenile justice systems” (p. 51).
Druian and Butler (1987, p. 3) noted that risk factors that may contribute to risky
behaviors among teenagers are that many of them live in high-growth states, live in
unstable school districts, have low academic skills (which does not necessarily mean low
intelligence), and are children of single parents.
Although these are valid conditions and usually represent divisions of the at-risk
population, school staff can help improve their situations in many ways. It is imperative

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

8

for libraries, schools, and other youth-serving organizations to acknowledge that
socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds are not the only factors that can place teens in
jeopardy. Teens who come from a stable home environment and have supportive adults in
their lives can also be at risk for drug or alcohol addiction, teenage pregnancy, dropping
out of school, suicide, gang activity, bullying, depression, or not reaching their full
potential. The term at risk is a label, and labels for teens can be tricky. Youth are labeled
immediately when they enter any environment, whether it is academic, sports related,
social, or any other realm where adolescents are found. However, I have yet to find a teen
who self-identifies as being at risk unless an adult told him or her that this was the case.
Once youth accept the at-risk label, they begin to identify with it, and many of the adults
who work and interact with them end up serving the label and not the actual teen.
One could argue that all teens are at risk in one way or another, but that is not
entirely true. The term denotes a certain demographic of teen, yet it is a demographic that
is quickly growing, and the definition of what it means to be at risk is expanding.
Disconnected youth is a term to describe teens at risk. This rising population consists of
youth who are not enrolled in school or do not have a form of employment. For various
reasons, they are disengaged from healthy social activities and are more likely to engage
in crime, to become incarcerated or homeless, and to rely on public systems for support. 3
The youth of today face different challenges than those of even 5 years ago. The pace of

These forms of risk factors are identified in “Disconnected Youth: Federal Action Could Address

Accountability Office, February 2008.

society is faster; information spreads quickly, requiring teens to keep up or get left
behind. When speaking with counselors, social workers, and behavioral therapists who
work with at-risk populations, examples consistently show it is becoming much easier to
fall through the cracks in the system as schools, juvenile facilities, and public services
scramble to meet the demands of an ever-increasing at-risk teenage population.
The at-risk label follows these young people into their adult lives and has
detrimental effects on how they perceive themselves and how the world perceives and
reacts to them. It has been found that, without a solid foundation of reading, writing, and
technological skills, teens will struggle throughout their schooling and adult life. When
children perform poorly on cognitive skills tests and general coursework in the preschool
years, they are likely to fail academically in the future. For instance, “They perform less
well in elementary and high school than their higher-performing peers and are more
likely to become teen parents, engage in criminal activities, and suffer from depression.
Ultimately, these children attain less education and are more likely to be unemployed as
adults” (Rouse, Brooks-Gunn, & McLanahan, et al. 2005, p. 6). The authors reasoned
that,
given the close links between race and ethnicity and family socioeconomic status,
on the one hand, and socioeconomic status and school readiness, on the other, it is
not surprising that family socioeconomic status appears to explain a substantial
portion of the racial and ethnic gaps in readiness. (p. 8)
An untapped resource in dealing with at-risk populations is the library and the
librarian. While librarians are encouraged to understand the teen population, it may not

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

10

be a major component of their education. As a result, they are often uncomfortable
actively engaging adolescents within their own communities and schools to assess
teenagers’ individual needs. In addition, the issues that place adolescents at risk are everchanging, requiring those librarians who wish to serve youth effectively to be continually
aware of the problems and obstacles that they face. Because librarians are associated with
a particular place, it is difficult for teens to view them as potential sources of support.
Ironically, librarians today work in socially complicated organizations, whether schools
or public libraries, where all stakeholders must collaborate to best meet the needs of atrisk adolescents. Accomplishing goals that positively impact an organization requires
effective leadership skills, a strong power base, and comfort with risk taking. Building
strong relationships and developing effective influence strategies to produce effective
leadership is an important challenge in the library field. Librarians can be active leaders
of schools and communities, although students do not often view them in this way. The
librarian can serve on school committees as well as provide training on technology and
library resources to teachers, parents, and the community. They must also be willing to
actively search for opportunities to demonstrate to teachers and principals how they can
play an integral role in supporting their teaching and goals. Two primary barriers that
school and public librarians face is not having a recognizable role in leadership and
instruction and administrators not understanding the librarian’s role. In essence, librarians
are as shackled by their label as are at-risk teenagers.
At-risk teens need a mentor, motivator, friend, and confidant—whether they know
it or not. In many ways, a youth librarian can fill that role. As information professionals,

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

11

librarians operate outside the normal parameters of school, parents, and teachers. They
can offer teenagers access to information, books, and ideas that can stretch and challenge
their perspective of the world. Librarians cannot, and should not, try to take the place of
other youth-serving professionals, such as counselors and social workers. However, they
should provide refuge from the classroom and a comfortable study environment for the
adolescent. Because Librarians are not formally accountable to curricular goals and
objectives, so they have a great deal of flexibility in engaging teenagers. They can talk
with at-risk teens about pop culture and life issues and have fun facilitating teen programs
that are beneficial to them. Librarians can also provide resources to at-risk teens and can
guide them to the proper organizations that offer services that can assist them through
difficult situations when the library cannot.
A review of the literature about librarians and their experience working with atrisk teens revealed a serious gap in empirical knowledge. Although at-risk youth are
highlighted in articles and other texts, not much research has focused on the population
and how a librarian-led mentoring initiative can assist them with their academics.
Librarians are hidden jewels in communities, businesses, and schools. School
librarians, often called media specialists, exist to support classroom endeavors but are not
regularly utilized. School librarians wear many hats, including instructor, technology
specialist, collaborator, social worker, and mentor. Therefore, they have a distinct
advantage and opportunity to fill some of the gaps that exist in the education field. It is
their responsibility as library media specialists and librarians to develop their leadership
skills so that other members of the learning community will recognize them as leaders.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

12

Educators in public schools understand that the No Child Left Behind Act is a barrier
between them, their students, and the books. It is difficult to teach reading and writing
when you are forced to teach to the test. Teachers and librarians have strong teaching
tools for reading and writing that can help struggling students with their academics, and
they often discuss ways to remedy the entire inadequate educational system, but often,
teachers and librarians are unsure of what to do to help these teens and stay within the
guidelines of the policy.
We live in the Information Age, and because of this, information literacy and
technology have become a librarian’s fortes. This is especially true when serving youth,
who, now more than ever, must be equipped to access, use, and evaluate information
competently in both print and electronic formats. Unfortunately, the digital divide is
prevalent within the at-risk teen population and prevents many disadvantaged youths
from learning how to effectively utilize information technology and keep pace with their
peers. A variety of barriers prevent at-risk youth from having access to and training with
information technology. Many do not have computers or Internet access at home. Their
schools, libraries, and academic environments might have inadequate technology labs and
classrooms due to budget cuts. The teens might even be in a state of transition, such as in
foster care or in a youth shelter, where access to technology is minimal. Vahlberg (2010)
noted, “Teens from lower-income families are less likely to own cell phones or
computers, buy things online or use Web sites for news or information than teens from
wealthier families” (p. 14). A question that one might ask is, what causes the student to
feel confident when using the Internet and online resources for personal inquiry but

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

13

insecure when using it for educational purposes? If a student has trouble reading and
comprehending and lacks the resources necessary to succeed, how can a librarian help?
What information competencies, information skills, and problem-solving techniques does
a student need to successfully navigate this ever-changing, information-based global
society? Can librarians bridge the gap by mentoring and teaching these teens about
information literacy?
Students who have access to technology at home are usually self-confident and
relaxed when searching the Internet for personal use but are sometimes “wary of
accessing web sites for school research purposes” (Jinx, 2001, p. 15). Such is the
situation at the school where this research was undertaken. Most North Carolina schools
provide networked information resources, such as the Internet, an online library catalog,
online database services, informational web pages, and web search tools. However,
teachers struggle to incorporate the newest Internet technologies and information
resources into their curriculum because of time and availability. At the school where this
action research was conducted, more than half of the students were reading below grade
level and lacked information literacy skills. As the principal investigator of this research,
I found that many of the students in Grades 6 through 8 were unable to read fluently and
had difficulty answering the “how” and “why” questions to analyze and understand texts.
Unlike the majority of teens, most of the students at Middle School were considered at
risk and did not have access to technology at home, which caused them to struggle
academically. For many teens, access to technology is as simple as utilizing a personal
computer, cell phone, or gaming system or using the equipment within an academic

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

14

environment. A 2010 study conducted by the Kaiser Foundation found that today’s youth,
on average, spend 7 hours and 38 minutes per day consuming media, with the majority of
it being music, television content, computer/online content, and gaming (Rideout et al.,
2010). The ability to effectively utilize technology is one of the most essential skills that
teens can acquire, affecting pivotal social indicators, such as academic accomplishment
and future career earnings, and if a teen does not have access, he or she is more likely to
fall behind. The Kaiser Foundation Study also noted that “understanding the role of
media in young people’s lives is essential for those concerned about promoting the
healthy development of children and adolescents, including parents, pediatricians,
policymakers, children’s advocates, educators, and public health groups” (Rideout et al.,
2010, p. 2).
Mentoring became an important aspect of this research as the program evolved.
The impact of a one-on-one relationship between a student and an adult over a period of
time was critical to the program’s success. Mentoring has been identified as a positive
intervention for students who exhibit at-risk behaviors, especially if it is done with an
adult at school (Tobin & Sprague, 2000). Students involved in a mentoring program may
be going through challenging situations, be at a period of life in which they need extra
support, or need another adult presence in their life. Many schools use mentoring for
students who are at-risk for school failure. In mentoring, an adult is paired with an at-risk
student with the goal of developing trusting relationships outside the family.

Problem Statement
Middle School did not make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in 2011. A goal of
No Child Left Behind was to ensure that schools and districts measure and report
students’ annual progress toward proficiency in English/language arts and mathematics
by 2013–2014. Under the act, a school can make AYP if it achieves the minimum levels
of improvement determined by the state of North Carolina in terms of student
performance and other accountability measures. In 2011, Middle School had 16 students
for every full-time licensed teacher, which meant teachers worked harder to exceed the
academic guidelines established by the North Carolina Department of Education by
providing a challenging and engaging curriculum for the students. The school followed
North Carolina District guidelines. The school district adopted content standards and
assessments that allowed teachers, students and parents to see where individuals were in
reaching and/or exceeding District Standards. The results of these measures enabled
teachers to teach to the students’ individual needs and strengths.
The End-of-Grade (EOG) standardized test was used in Grades 3 through 8 to
measure reading and math skills. Students were required to pass the Grade 8 EOG tests
and the North Carolina Test of Computer Skills to receive their high school diploma.
According to the 2011-2012 EOG scores, 50% of Middle School’s scholars scored as
nonproficient readers on their state exams. The gaps between the academic achievement
and college readiness levels of students persisted with the greatest concentration of
chronically under performing schools in this North Carolina city. A similar pattern
existed in terms of student behavioral incidents, which may include horseplay, rude

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

16

gestures, name calling, teasing, social aggression, emotional blackmail, electronic
bullying, and profanity, threats of emotional or physical violence, severe physical contact
or severe harassment. The average number of behavioral incidents per student at Middle
School was higher than other middle schools in the district, which caused the overall
average out-of-school suspension days per student at the middle school to be a major
concern because of the loss of instructional time. My research did not focus on behavioral
issues because the culture of at-risk students involves many antisocial behaviors; still, it
was important to discuss behavioral issues in this study. Educational disparities went
beyond performance on standardized tests, and all of these issues demonstrated the
reason why Middle School required more assistance to ensure that students received an
adequate amount of effective services from the school librarian.
The definition of literacy has shifted to incorporate technology. As a result, teens
need to understand how to use these skills in positive and collaborative ways. Technology
programs have been used to build teen self-awareness, promote creativity, and foster a
desire for self-expression. Ultimately, these programs could help at-risk teens appreciate
what they are learning and to see the library as a resource for books as well as
information technology. Through understanding the cognitive and affective behaviors
exhibited and problem-solving techniques used in the information-seeking process of
youth, I created a social-action study to develop and modify an information literacy–
based mentoring program for at-risk teens. This research explored the importance of
applying scenario planning to libraries as an example of challenging conventional
thinking and creating organizational change.

Significance of the Study
Middle School is a thriving school that was recently chosen as one of North
Carolina’s schools that has been successfully narrowing the achievement gap and has
been focusing on effective teachers and leaders. The district was praised by Eli Broad,
founder of the Eli and Edyth Broad Foundation for “creatively supporting the most
challenged schools with dollars and people and by empowering teachers to tailor
instruction to students’ needs” (North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, 2011).
Middle School’s administrators and leaders provide a strong foundation for school
reform. A lot has been done to demonstrate the will to advance student achievement, but
there is so much more work to do to ensure that all youth receives high quality education.
The school system has attempted to address the at-risk population through various
interventions, educational and social services. However, the initiatives have lacked
coordination, accountability, and urgency, causing student progress to stagnate.
Educational disparities between Middle school and the other middle schools in the district
have been documented.
This study was important for two reasons. First, many of Middle School’s
students were receiving a Level 1 or Level 2 reading score on the North Carolina
standardized test. Mentoring programs were established at Middle School in 2004–2005
to identify at-risk students. Students who were struggling academically were specifically
identified. A list of these students was submitted by teachers and staff members. Adults
who were interested in providing mentoring services were asked to identify students with
whom they wished to build a relationship and would be interested in mentoring. Mentors

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

18

and students were later matched by the administrative team. Some mentors had a
previous relationship with their student, and some did not. Some students were matched
with mentors who applied specifically to the student’s area of weakness. Most were not
matched thus. The guidelines for mentoring were very general. Mentors were asked to
meet with the student at least once a week.
Communities In Schools (CIS) is one of the programs within the public school
system that offers mentoring to at-risk youth. Bill Milliken, founder of CIS, believed that
every child needs five basic essentials for healthy development: a one-on-one relationship
with a caring adult, a safe place to learn and grow, a healthy start and a healthy future, a
marketable skill to use upon graduation, and a chance to give back to peers and
community. Founder of CIS Bill Milliken stated,
it is relationships, not programs that change children. A great program simply
creates the environment for healthy relationships to form between adults and
children. Young people thrive when adults care about them on a one-to-one level,
and when they also have a sense of belonging to a caring community. (CIS, 2011,
p. 7)
The national CIS Web site (www.communitiesinschools.org) explains that the program
was based on determining student needs and establishing relationships with local
businesses, social service agencies, health care providers, and parent and volunteer
organizations to provide needed resources to struggling youth. According to the website
they, “measure success by the results they are able to achieve for the young people we
serve.” They carefully evaluate all aspects of their programs, and use that information to

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

19

constantly improve. Communities In Schools (CIS) builds a support system within
schools so that students can focus on achievement:
What sets us apart is our model of integrated student services. Communities In
Schools positions a dedicated staff member—a school-based coordinator—inside
partner schools. The site coordinator works with school staff to identify students
at risk of not graduating; assess school and student needs; and establish
relationships with local businesses, social service agencies, health care providers,
and parent and volunteer organizations to harness needed resources.
(www.communitiesinschools.org)
A Child’s Place (ACP) is another program that provides mentors for their
caseloads only. They work to
erase the impact of homelessness on children and their education. ACP began in
1989 when a group of women were walking and noticed a group of kids playing.
When asked why the kids were not in school they explained to the women that
they couldn’t enroll in school without a permanent address. The women began
offering school for 27 children in a one room schoolhouse provided by First
Presbyterian Church with a teacher from CMS. In 1989, the McKinney-Vento Act
was passed protecting the educational rights of homeless children ensuring
children are provided the necessities they need to regularly attend school. Since,
the first class of 27 ACP client children we have grown to help 2,228 homeless
children during the 2011-12 school year. (ACP, n.d.)

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

20

According to the ACP website, they work
to break the barriers that children have to attain their education and make school
the most stable part of their lives. We provide educational and emotional support
services as well as medical referrals to keep our client children healthy and in the
classroom.
The After School Enrichment Program was incorporated into all of the district’s
middle schools to provide a warm and caring environment during after school hours to
ensure that youth had the opportunity to interact with school friends and receive
homework help. ASEP was a program that focused on exciting activities used to
stimulate youth to be healthier and happier through sports, art activities, and computer
exploration. The program operated inside of all of the city’s schools, usually accessing
the media center. It utilized a curriculum that complied with the NC Standard Course of
Study, ASEP Site Coordinators, school administrators, and teachers to ensure that the
material that was learned during the day is reinforced. The program leader’s primary goal
is to act as mentors and encourage students to develop friendships.
These programs offered mentoring mostly by providing students who were not
preforming well in classes with support outside the classroom through relationship
building. After analyzing and interviewing the staff of CIS and the ACP, as well as the
mentoring efforts in the district’s After School Enrichment programs at all district
schools, it became clear that a more effective approach was needed in mentoring for
literacy. Although, mentors are not tutors, they are often asked to help their mentees do
better in school. Because Middle School’s overall goal is to improve the academic

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

21

performance of teens, leaders of school-based mentoring programs were particularly
interested in finding effective ways to achieve academic success.
Second, this study was significant because teachers usually face numerous
challenges in ensuring that at-risk youth have access to quality technology and
information literacy programs. The use of librarians and school library media specialists
could eliminate some of these issues because these individuals are uniquely positioned to
meet the needs of at-risk students outside the structured curriculum. Librarians can
provide teens with free Internet access, databases for research, homework help, and
technology lessons. In an outreach capacity, having focused partnerships within the
community that target librarians who serve at-risk students could complement the
faculty’s attempts to mee the technology needs of this population. A technology and
information-literacy mentoring program does not need a large budget to be successful.
The Weekly Reader Program
The mentoring program described in this social-action study was called the
Weekly Readers Mentoring Program, which was a series of interactive weekly mentoring
workshops that aimed to inspire leadership, information literacy, and reading in teens
ages 12–14. The program was created for the 2012–2013 school year to meet the needs of
10 at-risk middle school students. The Weekly Readers Mentoring Program was
developed initially to determine if using professional librarians would increase the
students’ reading scores and technology and information-literacy skills. The program was
also created to understand if the attitudes that at-risk students normally have toward
school would change if given proper attention. I decided to develop the program to offer

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

22

assistance to students who did not receive enough one-on-one attention from their
teachers. In addition, I wanted to target students who were at risk of failing their reading
EOG test, lacked leadership development, and needed information-literacy skills.
Purpose of the Study
The questions involved action research focusing on the success of the then
existing school-based mentoring programs and to determine what might be modified to
better meet the needs of the student. By incorporating librarians as mentors to increase
reading and information-literacy skills, I expected that students would be able to
understand and connect with all subjects. I believed that incorporating reading strategies,
showing students how to reflect about what they have read, and using available
technology to improve reading would change their behavior and attitude toward school
and make them more confident. I also thought that equipping these students with
knowledge of all avenues of information literacy, especially new technologies, would
help them become more secure in learning new things.
Research Questions and Hypotheses
The aim of this study was to add to the scholarly literature by analyzing the
mentoring practices used in one middle school to support at-risk students’ reading,
information-literacy, and technology skills. The focal question that guided this study was,
can librarian-led mentoring programs improve reading scores and promote positive
school perspectives and personal experiences in low-achieving, at-risk teens?

CHAPTER TWO
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
The purpose of this action-research study was to determine if participating in a
librarian-led mentoring program that focused on reading and technology could improve
at-risk students’ motivation to read and reading, technology, and information-literacy.
Librarian assistance is an instrumental way to help disadvantaged youth improve
academically because they have the expertise and opportunity to fill the gaps that exist in
at-risk teenage students’ reading and information-literacy skills. To provide more insight
on this issue, this study examined the relationship of professional librarians, mentoring,
and reading achievement for at-risk youth in the middle grades using 5 months of
archival data from a large urban school district in North Carolina.
In recent years, much discussion has centered on 21st-century technology skills,
libraries, and mentoring for at-risk youth. Several journals and professional articles
currently discuss school-wide literacy initiatives, tutoring, and intervention plans that
may or may not work. Many of the articles and journals discuss implementing approaches
and success stories of school-based mentoring programs. However, few articles and
journals discuss the implementation, advantages, or disadvantages of librarian-led
mentoring programs in the public or school libraries. My literature searches quickly
produced ample information on mentoring and school-based interventions, including
historical data and current trends. Additionally, literature is available that specifically

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

24

discusses at-risk teenagers; low-performing middle school teens; information literacy;
and librarians’ characteristics, success, and how-to stories. What is lacking, however, is
literature that links these topics together, especially the connection between librarians
leading mentoring programs in low-income schools to improve reading and informationliteracy skills. Therefore, this literature review expands beyond a search for material on
the topic of mentoring and at-risk teens and their attitudes regarding school and
experiences and looks for writings that can be connected through analysis.
I identified articles that provide some information on areas that are important to
this study. The literature includes articles on successful school-based mentoring that
focuses on literacy as well as a variety of articles and books that discuss Action Research.
Analysis of articles that focuses on the significance of librarians as information
professional, organizational leadership theories, at-risk teens and adolescent
development; and librarians and information literacy has also been identified.
First a review of the development stages of adolescents specifically will be
discussed to determine risk factors. Second, a brief overview of the processes and
components of mentoring at-risk teenagers as it relates to adolescent development is
discussed to give meaning to why it would be important for a librarian to serve as a
mentor to middle school students. It has been said that mentoring relationship affords
students the chance to seek guidance, problem-solve, and most importantly build selfesteem and resiliency (Flaxman, 1992; Terry, 1999).
Third, school-based mentoring initiatives such as Community In Schools, A
Child’s Place and the Afterschool Enrichment programs that are in place in the North

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

25

Carolina school district is explored, to determine the significance or effectiveness they
have on the at-risk middle school population. School-based mentoring programs usually
focus on preventing dropout, building relationships and changing student attitudes toward
school to improving academic grades and standardized test scores (Thompson, & KellyVance, 2001; Tierney & Grossman, 1995; White-Hood, 1993). Analysis of these
programs will determine if this is the case for those particular intervention initiatives.
Finally, an evaluation of literature which signifies the importance of librarian
practices and elements of effective mentoring that emerge in the studies on school-based
mentoring for at-risk teens are described and refined.
At-Risk Teens and Adolescent Development
According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry
(AACAP, 2003) the development of adolescents are divided into three stages: early,
middle, and late. Based on these stages, teens should be able to master the ability to
articulate ideas and beliefs, gain independence from their parents family and childhood
friends; understand adult sexuality and personal intimacy and make new connections
while retaining significant personal ties, as they begin to mature into adults. Adolescence
is a time of growth for teens as physical, emotional, cognitive and social changes are
happening very quickly. Spano (2004, p. 1) argued that feelings and behaviors of the
middle school and high school adolescent can be categorized into four broad areas:
moving toward independence, future interests and cognitive development, sexuality, and
ethics and self-direction. While teens are developing at such an accelerated rate, they

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

26

experience many risk factors in their home and school environment, culture, religion, and
the media.
Spano 2003 and Winters, 2009 agree that changes to parts of the adolescent brain
which develop first are responsible for functions such as physical coordination,
motivation, self-control, judgment, emotions, and organization occur between puberty
and adulthood which could explain why teens make poor decision, indulge in reckless
behavior (p. 36). Winters (2009) suggest that part of the brain that “controls reasoning
and impulses - known as the Prefrontal Cortex - is near the front of the brain and,
therefore, develops last. This part of the brain does not fully mature until the age of 25.”
Spano (2003, p. 38) attested that teens and adults actually use different regions of the
brain when responding to certain situations. Additionally, the development of the
adolescent brain and behavior are linked, and hormones can change a teen’s emotions
instantly, “leading to unpredictable—and sometimes risky—actions” (Winters, 2009).
The Search Institute identified a list of assets that are believed to be important to a
teen’s developmental process (i.e., developmental assets): “positive relationships,
opportunities, competencies, values, and self-perceptions that youth need to succeed.”
The organization focuses on providing leadership, knowledge, and resources to promote
healthy youth development. They categorized the developmental assets into the criteria of
external and internal assets. External assets are considered, “resources imposed upon
youth through family and society, such as family or neighborhood support, positive adult
role models, youth programs, and a safe environment.” The internal assets are “values or

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

27

competencies that youth have internalized, such as achievement motivation, honesty,
integrity, and self-esteem” (Brautigam, 2008).
The Search Institute has established that all youth, regardless of their economic or
social background, require a combination of external and internal assets to succeed in
life. Many youth in America lack many of these assets, especially the youth at-risk. To
transition successfully in to adulthood, “teens need to develop a commitment to learning,
positive values, social competencies, and a positive identity” (Brautigam, 2008, p. 124).
Which means libraries can play a significant role in building these assets in at-risk youth
because, they are in an excellent position as they already implement many activities
(Brautigam, 2008, p. 124).
While librarians will want to be aware of average adolescent developmental
stages, they must also understand that each teen is unique with a distinct personality,
likes, dislikes and comfort levels, and that at-risk development varies. Although librarian
services benefit at-risk teens, libraries are not the primary institutions working with them.
Engaging the youth at risk can be a challenge as the youths may be defensive, or they
might have difficulty trusting or recognizing people who are genuinely trying to help
them. Consequently, librarians serving the at-risk population are recommended to defer
to qualified professionals if these youths exhibit behavior that could be harmful to
themselves or others. Librarians are not counselors or therapists, yet they can support
teens with skills that are unique to their profession. As information specialists librarians
and staff are able to connect at-risk teens with resources designed to improve their
understanding of the world and provide them with the tools to live productive lives.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

28

Ultimately librarian can create a safe and supportive environment for the youth at-risk,
and can tailor programs and collections specifically to meet their needs.
Developmentally, teens need structure, yet also the freedom to explore and form
their own opinions. The library is uniquely positioned to be a place where teens can
access materials and technology and participate in age-appropriate activities such as
mentoring that support their growth in a safe environment. Librarians offer services that
are unique to the growth opportunities of teens as they are in a transitional phase of life
and are quickly approaching adulthood, yet are still minors. As such, their options for
independent growth and decision making are limited. Libraries, whether they are public,
school media, or part of a youth facility can be a haven for at-risk teens during their
turbulent adolescent years.
Librarians are skilled at incorporating culturally relevant literature, artifacts,
graphic and technical organizers, and other media to activate and build on urban students’
background knowledge. Strategies of prereading experiences will focus on all
information literacy and relevancy that actively engage and empower students. The goal
of reading is to make meaning, so librarians and other educators must remember what
students take away from the text is based in part on what they bring to the text, including
their ability to reason (Cramer, 2003).
School-Based Mentoring
According Whitehood 2003, African-American students experience roadblocks to
learning; a substantial gap in achievement existed between the African-American and
white students. To understand the gap, we must acknowledge that many students come

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

29

from low socioeconomic backgrounds. “Poor home situations, the “put-downs”
associated with failing grades, and the number of out-of-school suspensions and referrals
all contributed to their negative attitudes. They told us they felt disinvited, alienated from
school.” (Whitehood, 2003 p. 76) She suggested that mentors help students achieve
academic parity; through responsibility training, conflict and stress management training
and an examination of learning styles, they developed thing and research skills
(Whitehood, p. 77).
Middle School has a program called CIS, which has been put in place to provide
mentoring, service learning and counseling for the at-risk students. Although the program
is active there is no solid evidence that it is effective. According to the CIS website:
Communities In Schools of North Carolina brings together all sectors of the
community—from businesses and other nonprofits to government agencies and
faith-based organizations—to make sure students are graduating on time, prepared
for college, career and life. It is not enough to fund programs that address
individual problems children face, such as poor health care, academic challenges
and family issues. Instead, we collaborate with the community to bring these
already existing resources into the schools to help meet both the academic and
personal needs of a child. As a result, Communities In Schools is providing the
link between educators and the community. That means teachers are free to teach,
and students – many in jeopardy of dropping out—can focus on learning. We are
building a stronger state and nation, one where all youth deserve the opportunity

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

30

and support they need to graduate from high school, prepared for college, career
and life. We hope that you will join us in our mission.
This mission sounds clear cut and to the point but the program leaders do not
utilize assessment tools to measure success or enhance their program. CIS in this
particular middle school only serviced six students with their mentoring program, when
there are 1,108 students who need help and guidance, this seems to be a discrepancy.
According to an article written in the Carolina Journal, “Community In Schools is
working hard to serve North Carolina’s children. CIS has programs in 32 counties and
serves more than 76,000 students. But there are 350,000 children who need CIS services.
So to those in leadership positions, to solve the dropout problem the answer is, in the
words of Jimmi Williams, “‘simple’—invest in CIS.” (Hamp, p.9) “The Communities In
Schools track record of helping young people prepare for life has is absolutely amazing,”
said Graeme Keith, chairman of the Board of CIS North Carolina. This is hard to believe
because there isn’t sufficient enough data to back these allegations. Other quotes in the
article stated suggest similar implications, “The CIS program is the finest that has ever
been developed to prevent school dropout, and we must find a way to continue expanding
this program throughout our state” (Hamp. p. 9). This is not an attempt to discredit the
efforts of CIS, however there is a need to access. The Implementation of a communitybased mentoring project at Middle School was important and enhanced the overall school
system’s goal of a world-class literacy by providing assistance through mentoring which
will help students read better, positively impact their behavior and prepare them for
success in high school. An enhanced mentoring initiative will also provide measurable

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

31

data that may be useful for CIS. Hamp also mentions in her article that, the CIS’s
program, identifies the highest risk students, determines the impediment keeping them
from succeeding, and helps fix the problem. If a child doesn’t have a caring adult in his
life, Community In Schools gets him an adult mentor. If a child is struggling with math,
CIS gets him a tutor. If a child is failing because he can’t see the blackboard, CIS gets
him glasses. CIS has one goal to keep kids in school so they will succeed in life. CIS uses
whatever strategy is needed to reach that goal and does not employ the one-size-fits all
mentality that permeates our education system (Hamp, p. 9). Although, CIS sounds like a
very successful program, more research has to be conducted to find out the depth of these
claimed services.
One of the most important aspects of a mentoring program (school-based or
otherwise) is alignment of program activities with desired outcomes. Many
school-based programs promise funders that they will impact areas like grades
and test scores, drug and alcohol abuse, and family and peer relations, without
ever really articulating how the intervention of mentoring is designed to achieve
those results. (Garringer, p. 2)
The Middle School Enhanced Mentoring project will be utilized to implement strategies
in the three focus areas: Literacy, Behavior, and Community Support. These focus areas
are not equally limited because there is an overlap among the strategies and by working
together with CIS to achieve the desired outcomes the Enhanced Mentoring Project will
create change in literacy and community collaboration.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

32

Adjusting the after-school mentoring program to focus primarily on how the
school library, as central cultural environment, affects both academic and nonacademic
aspects of adolescent development and literacy is important to the culture of the middle
school. A mentoring project designed to encourage literacy and behavioral improvement
among at risk students will ensure sufficient protected time for regular weekly mentoring
meetings; mentors will promote independence reading activities for their student
mentees; this will be a team mentoring approach, including behavioral expectations; and
explicit and clear expectations outlined goals between the student and mentor.
Successful mentoring is all about quality interactions that take place consistently
over long periods of time, and both the daily school schedule and the annual
calendar of the school year can get in the way. In many programs, mentors are
usually not recruited until school starts; meaning matches are often made right
before the Thanksgiving or Christmas breaks. (Garringer, p. 3)
This program utilized ten professional librarians to conduct a mentoring project aimed at
determining increasing better outcomes of reading scores and information literacy of
high-risk middle school students over an five-month time period beginning after the
Christmas break 2012.
School library media specialist partnering with the public librarians to serve atrisk teens is an excellent way for librarians to reach the at-risk population. Often, teens
who would benefit most from library services do not go to public libraries or use their
school media center and this is especially true with the at-risk population. School-based
library programs guarantee a teen audience and also help make connections within the

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

33

population. Collaborating with other school-based programs can be challenging, yet with
preparation librarians can establish effective partnerships. Librarians will need an
understanding of how the program operates and how trends can affect library services to
teen patrons. Learning to work within the guidelines of the program and with the
personnel will make the difference between a successful or unsuccessful partnership. This
knowledge is just as important as any professional qualifications that librarians have and
is best gained through firsthand experience. To close the mentoring gap, we must create
specialized approaches to serving youth populations with unique characteristics or needs
and measure our potential for serving them in the future (Mentor 2005, p. 5). School
libraries are designed to be places where all students can search for a variety of
information, whatever their circumstances. At-risk teens desperately need an environment
where they are not judged. Regardless of the student’s situation, it is the librarian’s job is
to help, not criticize. Therefore, school librarians can most benefit teens by providing a
safe place for them to congregate with their mentors, work on homework and reading
projects, browse for information, use computers, or just hang out and read.
To become an integral part of a the Communities In Schools mentoring program,
and be able to enhance it, it is important to learn the program’s routine, keep abreast of
any changes in its operation, and accommodate those changes if possible, all while
attempt to implement changes. Flexibility will go far when working with a partner that
serves youth. The professionals who staff youth programs have many demands on their
time, from state and federal regulations and internal issues to handling the teens
themselves, sometimes 24 hours a day. The majority of youth programs have limited

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

34

resources and personnel, requiring that they stretch what money and people available, as
far as they can. They may reject library media center partnerships initially not because
they do not value the services offered, but because of inadequate funds, personnel, and/or
space.
An evaluation of the Big Brothers Big Sisters mentoring program was held in
2007 and revealed that
at end of the school year, there were significant improvements in participants’
academic performance, perceived scholastic efficacy, school misconduct, and
attendance relative to nonmentored youth. These effects were again generally
small in magnitude and, when youth were reassessed a few months into the
following school year, they had for the most part eroded to nonsignificance.
(Herrera et al., p. 3)
Mentoring may contribute to how teens view of themselves as future leaders and
to their motivation to further their education. Getting adults to mentor is a factor that
should be addressed. There are several aspects that are important when recruiting mentors
to help with school-based programs.
Recent research (Karcher & Spencer, in preparation) indicates that communication among program coordinators and other school staff, including front
office personnel, is key in School Based Mentoring. Teachers, counselors, and
administrators can all share important information about students, help mentors
feel welcome on the school campus, and provide enrichment opportunities for the
mentoring relationships.” (Garringer, p. 2)

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

35

Mentoring relationships are unique and effective mentoring can have more positive
outcomes depending on the attitudes and goals of the mentors. At-risk youth are more
likely to benefit the most from mentoring if their mentor is faithful, remain consistent
with them and get to know their families.
In 2005, Drs. Jean Rhodes and David DuBois, assessed and evaluated the
progress of a mentoring community. According to their report, “the mentoring
community has made significant progress in increasing the number of young people who
benefit from a mentoring relationship. The findings were that a majority of the mentors
were satisfied with their mentoring experience and would recommend it to others. This
fact, combined with the 44 million adults who would seriously consider mentoring,
presents a tremendous opportunity for the mentoring field. So, too, does the growing
interest among after-school and other youth development programs in adding stronger
mentoring to their existing programs. However, the findings also indicate that there is
still a great deal of work to be done. There are millions of young people who could
especially benefit from a mentor who don’t have one. MENTOR is committed to leading
the effort to close this gap and ensure that every young person has a mentor.” (p. i)
Mentoring relationships can help at-risk young people become leaders. However,
at-risk young people are not the only ones that will benefit from an effective mentoring
program. Avolio, Walumbwa, and Weber (2009) stated, “relatively little work has been
done over the past 100 years to substantiate whether leadership can actually be
developed” (p. 425). I believe that although it has yet to be proven, leadership can be

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

36

learned and developed if given the right tools and the right foundation. Kelling and
Hoover (2004) discussed described leadership development as follows:
Leadership is a complex process by which an individual influences others to
accomplish a mission, task or objective” (Nahavandi, 2003). Nahavandi goes on
to discuss leadership development as the creation of leadership abilities and
characteristics through formal and non-formal methods. Furthermore leadership
development is a life-long process that occurs at multiple levels, from individuals
to organizations. Future leaders are made, not born and one strategy, which
develops these leaders, occurs within student-based clubs and organizations. (p. 4)
Avolio et al. (2009) also stated that “understanding what constitutes an
individual’s level of developmental readiness or one’s capacity or motivational
orientation to develop to one’s full potential. Prior authors have defined developmental
readiness as being made up of components such as one’s goal orientation (Dweck, 1986)
and motivation to develop leadership (Maurer & Lippstreu, 2005)” (p. 426). This is
motivation to analyze how libraries can contribute to the developmental processes of an
adolescent through strengthening followership and mentoring to possibly create future
leaders and improve literacy. Also to develop a partnership with teens who are personally
committed to themselves and want to reach success. In the same literature, “the authors
argue that leaders who are more motivated to learn at the outset and who have higher
motivation to lead will more likely embrace trigger events that stimulate their thinking
about their own development as an opportunity to improve their leadership effectiveness”
(Avolio et al., 2009, p. 426). In the coproduction of leadership through mentoring; youth

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

37

at-risk will no longer be viewed as subjects or clients but as citizens with important
contributions to make in libraries. Coproduction can create interventions that will enable
the teens to become genuine resources, contributors and change agents.
Significance of Librarians
The gaps between the academic achievement and college readiness levels of
students in this North Carolina city are seriously prevalent in their many chronicallyunder-performing schools. Braun et al. (2014) wrote an article discussing the current state
of teens, education, and libraries where they suggested that the “library profession has
come to understand literacy as much more than a cognitive ability to read and write, but a
social act that involves basic modes of participating in the world.” (p. 6) This means that
school and public librarians no longer view literacy as being “a technical competency that
can be added to people as though they were machines, but rather as a social practice that
varies from one context to another and is part of cultural knowledge and behavior.” (p. 6)
There is still much to be learned about teen service within libraries and
application of new information literacy ideas along with new information about
adolescent development can help librarians greatly improve teen services within their
libraries whether public or schools. Libraries are no longer just places to get books and
retrieve information. They explained that libraries are now ‘a place, physical and virtual,
to learn how to connect and use resources of all types from physical books to apps to
experts in a local, regional, or national community.” (p. 4) They described the new age
library as being “a kitchen for “mixing resources” to empower teens to build skills,
develop understanding, create and share, and overcome adversity.” (p. 4)

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

38

These disparities go beyond performance on standardized tests and all of these
issues demonstrate the reason why the middle school needs more assistance in ensuring
students are getting an adequate amount of effective school based intervention services.
Today’s society demands that its citizens be literate to hold jobs, earn a living, and
considered successful adults. These demands are far greater than those placed on the
majority of literate individuals a quarter of a century ago. This escalation in required
literacy skills creates even more grievous consequences for those who are illiterate. With
a growing number of at-risk adolescents in both urban and rural areas of the country,
libraries and communities need to work together to find new ways to serve this
population. According to Braun et al., the lives of teens are adversely being affected by
the social and political landscape such as ‘poverty, homelessness, failing schools, and
bullying have physical and psychological ramifications for teens.’ (p. 4) They suggested
that it is the libraries responsibility to connect with the community and continue “solving
and alleviating the problems that negatively impact teens and to help all of them grow up
to be successful, productive members of society.” (p. 6)
The term literacy initially meant the ability to read and write and is now used to
discuss various topics including technology. Braun et al. (2014) wrote that ever since
computers were integrated in public and school libraries they have been on a ‘precipice of
change.’ They indicated that during the early stages of library based technology it was
not very clear what changes would occur, however, since its arrive “all libraries changed
from “dumb terminals” (p. 4) available to customers for searching a catalog, to computers
connected to the Internet, to e-content and mobile devices, the role of the library in the

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

39

community has shifted. A central part of that shift is how library staff working with teens
effectively serve the age group.
Literacy in the form of information, technological, and traditional is a problem for
at-risk youth as they are most likely to read below grade-level, lack of access to updated
technology tools, and have limited access to informational literacy tools for example, the
internet. According to the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress report,
about 67% nationwide and more than 80% of those are from low-income families and are
not proficient readers by the end of their third-grade academic year. The report also states
that 85% of low-income students who attend high-poverty schools and who took the
reading test do not read proficiently even by the time they reach the fourth grade. The
report highlights what we have already known, that poverty is directly connected to
achievement in school. This is very much a fundamental problem -- the fact that so many
children in poverty are behind in reading means that they struggle academically in all
areas and basically sets them up for failure when they hit high school and middle school.
Even those who graduate from low-income schools with low graduate rates are
significantly behind their wealthier counterpart peers. This has significant and long-term
consequences for these youth and their communities as a whole. The efforts to end
intergenerational poverty and close the achievement gap will continue to diminish if
changes aren’t made. The major contributors to the achievement gap impacting at-risk
students is caused primarily by families/communities not able and often not welcomed by
the school system to support the youth, a lack of supplemental services such as mentoring

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

40

and tutoring to young, people whose backgrounds subject them to the inequities and risk
factors.
An exploration of literature has shown that literacy involves more than the ability
to read and write. There has been a lot written about teenager learning patterns,
adolescent development, leadership as well as many theories on what should be taught to
at-risk teens. There is also a plethora of library and school based programs that have
proven to be effective in improving student engagement, close the academic achievement
gap and increase graduation rates.
The questions of what role does a librarian have in the lives of the youth at-risk?
What are the underlying needs of the at-risk youth in our communities and schools and
how can we effectively increase their reading levels and prepare them for successful
adulthood? The answer is that librarians provide valuable and potentially life changing
resources to at-risk youth that they might otherwise not have access to. Librarians/Media
Specialists can best serve the youth at-risk by providing the services they excel at;
offering access to technology, supplying educational support, developing interest in
books and reading, and helping meet the informational needs of their adolescent patrons
by providing useful, measurable youth development programming.
According to a 2004 study completed by the Wallace Foundation, library-based
youth development programs can provide both specific job skills and personal and social
development for teens. Additionally, these programs can provide opportunities for teens
to develop positive relationships with adults and peers and increase their knowledge,
appreciation and use of the library. From a library standpoint, youth programs can

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

41

improve the reading skills and attitudes of education for these teens, fostering more
positive attitudes towards their future. Changing the mind-set of teens and teen serving
staff can influence the “broader culture of the library and lead to future positive
interactions.” The study indicated “more positive staff attitudes towards teens generally
have a positive impact on a library’s ability to attract youth patrons and interact with
them in developmentally appropriate ways” (Spielberger et al., 2004). As adults that
serve at-risk teens continues to be educated about the needs of at-risk teens and how the
library can provide appropriate services, libraries become a more welcoming
environment and a preferred destination for teens who need help with reading and
personal life skills.
How can school libraries better serve at-risk teens? The concept seemed
straightforward yet when researching material it is realized that first there is a need to
define what, exactly, is an at-risk teen. At-risk teens have been defined as “adolescents
whose potential of becoming healthy and productive adults is reduced because they are
high risk of encountering serious problems at home, in school, or in their communities”
(Trachtman, 1991, p. 28). To further define the term and to put it in context for the library
world, I have defined an at-risk teen as an adolescent, aged 12–18, whose developmental,
intellectual, emotional, educational and information needs are not being met, which
potentially places them behind their peers and hinders their successful transition into
adulthood.
The ever-changing definition of literacy has begun to impact libraries. Much of
the concern years ago seemed to have revolved around getting teens into the physical

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

42

library building, but this has changed as well and librarians are making courageous
attempts to serve the teenage population by meeting them in their own learning
environments. “Often students at-risk of academic failure are those who do not connect
with school” (Jones & Zambone, 2007, p. 31). Library professionals have realized the
need to cater services to the sometimes difficult, yet dynamic teenage population.
Despite these challenges, this literature review explored literature about how
libraries, working in partnerships within their communities, can make a considerable,
positive impact on the lives of young adults by striving to meet their informational needs
through mentoring. To address the specific leadership characteristics and literacy skills of
at-risk students at Middle School and to try and reconnect students with their own
community and its many resources, collaboration with the CIS through a mentoring
project will accommodate the various learning and leadership styles demonstrated by atrisk students. This will provide a clear connection between the library media center, the
classroom and the world/community outside of school. Mentoring will improve students’
achievement, develop new skills and improve attitudes towards education.
Although middle school librarians will want to be aware of average
adolescent developmental stages, they must also understand that each teen is unique with
a distinct personality, likes, dislikes, and comfort levels, and that at-risk development
may not follow the norm. Although library services benefit at-risk teens, libraries are not
the primary institutions working with them. Engaging youth at risk can be a challenge as
the youth may be defensive, or they might have difficulty trusting or recognizing people
who are genuinely trying to help them. Consequently, librarians serving the at-risk

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

43

population are advised to defer to qualified professionals if these youth exhibit behavior
that could be harmful to themselves or others. Librarians are not counselors or therapists,
yet they can support teens with skills that are unique to their profession. As information
specialists, librarians are able to connect at-risk teens with resources designed to improve
their understanding of the world and provide them with the tools to live productive lives.
Ultimately librarians can create a safe and supportive environment for youth at risk, and
can tailor programs and collections specifically to meet their needs. The school library is
the perfect setting for a stabilized mentoring program.
According to Jones and Zambone (2007), in their article “The Power of
the Media Specialist to Improve Academic Achievement and Strengthen At-Risk Youth,”
the way to identify affective and instructional strategies for working with low-achieving
students, it is important to implement the concept of systems change to transform the
school library into a “turnaround place” for students and schools, and the media specialist
into a “turnaround teacher.” They state that, “turnaround” media specialist cares about
students and connects with them. The connection with this teacher gave students the
strength to become resilient adults despite childhood traumas and trials (Jones &
Zambone, 2007, p. 30). This is the future leadership role of the media specialist that
serves at-risk youth. There is a significant need for library teachers who care and who are
willing to implement programs in low-achieving schools, that make differences in the
lives of the students. A media specialist has the ability to develop programs to support all
teachers but they must be utilized. Literacy as we know it is changing and so is the role of
the librarian and leadership.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

44

Jones and Zambone (2007) stated that media specialists can utilize the
“‘turnaround’ qualities of connection and competence to influence what is perhaps the
biggest academic shortcoming faced by students—reading. For children to become
literate they must have the vocabulary to understand ideas, concepts, and experiences, but
many of the students come to school without the fundamental knowledge to support
vocabulary development and literacy. Even the most carefully chosen collection is not
going to improve this situation, but a proactive media specialist who connects with
students, identifying their interests and strengths as well as their needs, will be able to use
her competence to build the students’ background knowledge.” In their article, the
author’s mention, a library media specialist that demonstrated the ‘turnaround’ attributes.
They quote “Marzano, in his book, In What Works in Schools: Translating Research into
Action, found that one way to develop background knowledge is through mentoring. In
their resiliency research, Werner and Smith found that mentoring was the most
significant way to strengthen struggling youth (Jones & Zambone, 2007, p. 32).
Providing youth with the opportunity to meet with someone once a week to discuss a
book or build their literacy skills will help the student gain confidence in reading to
understand not just looking at the words. Mentoring as it relates to an adult that reads
with a student or book buddy is important to this research.
Developmentally, teens need structure, yet also the freedom to explore and form
their own opinions. The library media center is uniquely positioned to be a place where
teens can access materials and technology and participate in age-appropriate activities
that support their growth in a safe environment. Library services offer unique growth

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

45

opportunities for teens, as they are in a transitional phase of life and are quickly
approaching adulthood, yet are still minors. As such, their options for independent
growth and decision making are limited. Having a space to call their own where they can
browse the Internet, hang out with friends, or read their favorite magazine —all for free
—allows them to grow and develop into the adults they will soon become. Libraries,
whether they are public, school media, or part of a youth facility, can be a haven for atrisk teens during their turbulent adolescent years.
From the standpoint of library media centers, the most efficient way to support
teen development is to provide services and space for teens and by extension the youth
at- risk such as mentoring. However, advocates for teen services routinely must justify
funds, staff time, and effort spent on a population that some believe do not have a place
in libraries, particularly the youth at- risk. To counteract this negative attitude, supporters
of teen services can point out that, if utilized properly, libraries provide powerful
resources for everyone in their communities, including at-risk teens. As detailed below,
libraries hold.
Many libraries, whether they are public, academic, private, or school media, have
been forced to cut programs, cut operating hours, lay off staff members, or even close
their facilities. Libraries nationwide have faced severe budget cuts, layoffs, or in many
cases, are no longer given control over their designated funds (Allen & Bradley, 2009).
Due to drastic budget cuts and staff shortages materials and programs in middle school
library media centers have also taken a hit causing a significant lost in the quality of
services provided. However, I believe that there is a relationship between library

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

46

leadership, young teens and mentoring to increase reading skills and change attitudes
about learning. Although many library media centers across the country face financial
troubles, there are still ways to help struggling at-risk student reach success.
Leadership Development in Youth
Avolio et al. (2009) also said, “Understanding what constitutes an individual’s
level of developmental readiness or one’s capacity or motivational orientation to develop
to one’s full potential. Prior authors have defined developmental readiness as being made
up of components such as one’s goal orientation (Dweck, 1986) and motivation to
develop leadership (Maurer & Lippstreu, 2005).” This is motivation to analyze how
libraries can contribute to the developmental processes of an adolescent through
strengthening followership and mentoring to possibly create future leaders and improve
literacy.

CHAPTER THREE
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Interdisciplinary Research
According to Allen Repko (2008, p. 13), multidisciplinary studies are different
than interdisciplinary studies. Specifically, he argued that multidisciplinarity refers to
placing insights from two or more disciplines side by side but makes no attempt to
integrate the insights produced by those perspectives into an interdisciplinary
understanding of the topic. This action research was interdisciplinary, which gave me the
ability to challenge different issues that existed at Middle School from different
perspectives.
Repko (2008) clarified what is expected of the interdisciplinarians as far as their
knowledge of disciplines. He explained that interdisciplinary scholars just need a working
knowledge of the disciplines whose perspectives are relevant to the problem. That is,
achieving mastery is different from achieving disciplinary adequacy (Repko, 2008, p.
43).
This action-research study incorporated several disciplines, including psychology,
anthropology, history, sociology, library and information science. I drew from
psychology in this study because it is the scientific study of behavior and mental
processes. The discipline defined the impact of the mentoring programs by using teen
developmental analysis as it pertains to at-risk teenagers. It incorporates a diversity of

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

48

specializations, including clinical, child developmental, learning, social, motivational,
physiological, and industrial/organizational. The psychology discipline gave me the
opportunity to understand adolescent development and provided an understanding of
abnormal, normal, and exceptional growth of adolescent brains as biological and
psychological organisms. Adding social economics and environmental studies also
helped me clarify issues in the relationships between teens and family and the means to
enhance teens’ achievement.
Anthropology was important to this study because it allowed me to gain a better
understanding of North Carolina’s regional and community cultures and subcultures and
the value that was placed on at-risk teens. To fully understand the complexity of at-risk
teens, I also drew from the social and biological sciences, as well as the humanities and
physical sciences. Sociocultural anthropology provided me the opportunity to look at
social patterns and practices of this culture, with a special emphasis on how these young
people live in particular places, issues related to poverty, and how they organize and
process information and create meaning. The culture of this North Carolina city was
important because it had a definite effect on how the program was utilized. Research
methods in sociocultural anthropology emphasize participant observation, which involves
placing oneself in the research context for periods of time to gain a firsthand sense of
how local knowledge is used in handling practical problems of everyday life and with
basic philosophical problems of knowledge, truth, power, and outcomes.
The history discipline was useful for discovering what libraries had done to
provide greater accessibility to at risk teenagers. History is a mixture of many fields

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

49

within the humanities and social sciences and is applied to the understanding of human
societies, both past and present. This discipline also enabled me to analyze the effects that
the library, as an institution, has on its creators and to consider how the successes and
failures of past programs and values shaped the library’s cultural discourse.
Sociology played a role because people in the community want more for the teens
at Middle School and may or may not have a good grasp on their needs. Sociology
provides an understanding of the structure and dynamics of society and the intricate
connections to patterns of human behavior and individual life changes. The sociological
perspective assisted me in determining whether librarian-led mentoring addressed any of
the developmental assets of teens who were experiencing hardship. Utilizing sociology
helped me answer questions about the sources and consequences of change in social
situations and school libraries and about the satisfactions and difficulties of planning,
accomplishing, and adapting to such change. I was able to examine culture, values,
socialization, cooperation, conflict, power, exchange, inequality, deviance, social control,
violence, order, and social change through this discipline.
According to Repko (2008), an interdisciplinary study is not just a way to obtain a
degree; it is a systematic method of training one’s mind and developing one’s character.
Repko defined interdisciplinary studies as the process of answering a question, solving a
problem, or addressing a topic that is too complex to explore using one discipline. He
suggested that interdisciplinary studies draw upon disciplinary viewpoints and integrate
different perspectives to better understand a topic. Interdisciplinarians believe that
interdisciplinary research is a process rather than a method because the former allows for

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

50

greater methodological flexibility (Repko, 2008, p. 12). Interdisciplinarity can help to
address today’s complex issues because it is believed that a cross-disciplinary approach
enables a comprehensive understanding (Newell, 2007). These beliefs led to an increased
interest in interdisciplinary higher education over the years (Newell, 2009). In
comparison to the traditional way of learning and researching, these types of studies aim
to cross boundaries.
Repko (2008) and Newell (2007) explained how interdisciplinary research works
as a process to allow a researcher the opportunity to decide which tools and
methodologies may be relevant to the problem, concept, or issue at hand. To do this well,
the interdisciplinarian has to understand epistemological biases, concepts, and
disciplinary insights. As indicated above, the research requires a working knowledge of
the disciplines used without becoming an expert.
The most vital elements to developing competence in the field of interdisciplinary
studies are the abilities to read, to understand, and to interpret interdisciplinarily to
understand the context. The more knowledgeable the scholar knows about the context of
a discipline or disciplines, the stronger his or her interpretation abilities will be and the
more likely that he or she will eventually have something meaningful to discuss.
Interdisciplinary scholarship helps overcome any boundaries that specialization tends to
produce by linking new ideas to the prior knowledge and experiences of those who come
from diverse academic backgrounds. The way scholars read and interpret information
about an issue is important to interdisciplinary studies because it allows them build skills
diversely and to add on to their strengths and research findings. According to Lewin

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

51

(1936), “Every psychological event depends upon the state of the person and at the same
time on the environment, although their relative importance is different in different
cases” (p. 12.).
What is Action Research?
Action research is an experimental research method that originated in 1946 with
social psychologist Kurt Lewin, who has often been recognized as the founder of this
type of research. Action research is used to transform one’s practice leading to social
action:
An attempt to improve intergroup relations has to face a wide variety of tasks. It
deals with problems of attitudes and stereotypes in regard to other groups and to
one’s own group, with problems of development of attitudes and conduct during
childhood and adolescence, with problems of housing and the change of the legal
structure of the community; it deals with problems of status and caste, with
problems of economic discrimination, with political leadership, and with
leadership in many aspects of community life. It deals with the small social body
of family, a club or a friendship group, with the larger social body of a school or a
school system, with neighborhoods and with social bodies of the size of a
community, of the state, a nation and with international problems. (Lewin, 1946,
p. 37)
The action-research process starts with identifying a problem. Data are then
collected to obtain a detailed analysis of what needs to be changed within an
organization. Lewin (1946) described this process in his article, “Action Research and

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

52

Minority Problems”: “planning starts with a general idea for one reason or another it
seems desirable to reach a certain objective” (p. 37). Action research is usually conducted
at the school level as a way to solve particular problems in the classroom. Action research
has been known as participatory research, collaborative inquiry, emancipatory research,
action learning, and contextual action research, but can be simply defined as, “learning by
doing” (O’Brien, 2001). It is a research method that allows educators “to identify an issue
we want to study to determine if we can change our process or procedures to improve our
program.” (Howard & Eckhardt, 2005, p. 32).
Many scholars have attempted to define action research and to explain how the
research method can be used for organizational or situational change. Dick (2002),
McNiff (2002), and O’Brien (2001) defined action research as being a method of
experimental research that focuses on improving a specific community with the goal of
changing the quality of that community. If the outcome is unexpected, then the process is
modified and repeated until the goal is met. Because action research is done in a variety
of disciplines, organizations, and communities, it is has been identified by many other
terms; participatory research, practice-based research, practitioner research, collaborative
inquiry, emancipatory research, action learning, and contextual action research are all
terms that describe a particular method but that have a common theme of change
(McNiff, 2002; O’Brien, 2001). Unlike other forms of research, action research is value
driven rather than objective.
Riel’s (2010) summarizes the concept with the following definition:

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

53

Action research is a process of deep inquiry into one’s practices in service of
moving towards an envisioned future, aligned with values. Action research is the
systematic, reflective study of one’s actions, and the effects of these actions, in a
workplace context. As such, it involves deep inquiry into one’s professional
practice. (p. 1)
Critical self-reflection is important for the action researcher because, in some social
science methods of research, researchers have a tendency to do research on other people,
but with action research, the investigation becomes by the self into the self, with others
acting as coresearchers and critical learning partners (McNiff, 2002).
Overall, the main idea of action research is that it is a collaborative research
method that involves testing or implementing a solution to a community defined problem.
The actions address particular goals of an identified problem in the workplace. For
example, my research examined a solution to the problem at a Middle School of low
literacy and information technology skills in at-risk teens through the implementation and
evaluation of new strategies toward solving the problem.
Action research can lead to program improvement, new research and increased
academic achievement for our students. As a full time media specialist within an urban
middle school in North Carolina I came to realize that a majority of the students were not
interested in reading nor were they reading on grade level. They were even struggling
with learning new technology due to lack of access. A common statement heard from
students is “There is nothing to do at the library and reading is boring.”

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

54

The purpose of this action research study was to explore how the existing
mentoring programs have assisted with implemented literacy standards at the middle
school. It also examined whether the integration of a librarian-led mentoring reading
program with these school-based program would increase student reading scores. This
action research study is twofold: (1) to assess the extent to which CIS, A Child’s Place
and the Afterschool Enrichment mentoring program work to engage at-risk teens in
literacy-building activities, and (2) to analyze a five-month librarian-led mentoring
initiative associated with the promotion of literacy activities in teens at-risk. The goal was
to evaluate the impact of a librarian-led mentoring program on the academic “literacy”
achievement of at-risk youth. Data was collected through staff and student surveys,
leadership team meetings, the literacy coordinator and reading tracking methods used by
the librarians.
The action research method was chosen to challenge the existing school-based
mentoring programs literacy intervention plans and prove that by including library media
specialist and librarians in the reading curriculum reading scores and student ambition
toward information literacy would change. This action research was a continuous process
of program iterations that allowed a librarian or media specialist to, “reflect on a problem,
analyze the problem through the collection of data, implement an improvement to that
problem, and then begin the process all over again—reflect, analyze, and implement”
(Howard & Eckhardt, 2005).

Figure 1. Action research cycle.
While this is the essence of the approach, there are other key attributes of
action research that differentiate it from common problem-solving activities that we all
engage in every day. What separates this type of research from general professional
practices, consulting, or daily problem-solving is the emphasis on scientific study, which
is to say the researcher studies the problem systematically and ensures the intervention is
informed by theoretical considerations. Much of the researcher’s time is spent on refining
the methodological tools to suit the exigencies of the situation, and on collecting,
analyzing, and presenting data on an ongoing, cyclical basis (O’Brien, 2001). Action
research is a flexible spiral process which allows action (change, improvement) and
research (understanding, knowledge) to be achieved at the same time. The understanding

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

56

allows more informed change and at the same time is informed by that change. People
affected by the change are usually involved in the action research. This allows the
understanding to be widely shared and the change to be pursued with commitment (Dick,
2002).
The goal of this study was to address the following research questions: (a) Can
librarian-led mentoring programs improve reading scores and promote positive school
perspectives in low-achieving schools of at risk teens through a particular approach that
connect literature to their personal experiences? (b) Can librarian-led mentoring programs
in low-achieving schools be used as an intervention for at-risk students who struggle with
reading and technology? If so, what impact does such a program have on student
motivation, self-esteem, behavior, self-perception and reading levels when mentoring is
integrated with reading? (c) What do student insights reveal about their own selfperception and self-esteem through integrated mentoring and literacy activities? (d) How
does leadership exhibited by the librarian-mentors influence the implementation of
reading and technology strategies? (e) Are there specific program components and
processes perceived by mentors and mentees as essential to the librarian-led mentoring
program? (f) To what extent does the mentored student’s attitude improve toward literacy
after participating in the librarian-led mentoring program? (g) What experiences do atrisk teens identify, through one-to-one interviews, as being critical to making a mentoring
program successful?
According to Martin and Tallman (2001, p. 8) graduate professionals, teacherlibrarians often figure things out intuitively through examination of a situation. They

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

57

believe because there are four basic steps to action research, pinpoint a problem, collect
and analyze the data, review the literature and then take action teacher-librarians can
apply various action research methodologies to almost any problem. Cook and Farmer
(2011, p. 5) pointed out that while librarians regularly face problems, they have to decide
which problems are worth researching systematically and need to identify at least some
of the variables contributing to the problem and have an idea of how those variables are
related. They need to find which problems are under their control and for the situations
that are not, find a way to influence those who are in charge. Cook and Farmer, (2011)
suggested that librarians should determine if the solution is feasible in terms of available
resources and time and in their final analysis of the problem should be worth the effort,
“that is, the return on investment should be apparent.”(p. 5)
Cook and Farmer (2011, p. 5) also stated that librarians may work overtime but
cannot always insure that lasting change is actually caused by the library. They contest
that students might self-reflect that library programs and activities have indeed influenced
their academic growth, but this kind of measure is understandably subjective. Therefore, I
created an action plan to assist with solving the problem.
Action Research Plan
1. Set up Mentor Group of local Young Adult Librarians
2. Agree on process design and select participants
3. Specify the role of the mentor
4. Interview and train mentors

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

58

5. Communicate more effectively with home about goals, roles, time allotment,
student/parent responsibilities
6. Provide group activities throughout and after the program ends
7. Enlist more librarians (many support staff on mentoring list for next year)
8. Provide leadership guidance than the other school-based mentoring program
9. Provide reading and technology sample tests for parents/students to examine
at home early in the study as well as closer to March to help with end of the
year standardized test.
10. Match students/mentors early (December)
11. Use school functions as mentoring opportunities (i.e. spelling bees, battle of
the books, book clubs, and theatrical performances).
12. Also, the intent was to measure student responses and to provide feedback to
the school and library for improvement of these techniques. However, my job
was terminated before I was able to provide the feedback
Assumption of the Study
The assumption of this action research mentoring project is to evaluate current
school-based mentoring programs and to convey and bridge the gap between information
literacy, reading skills and the youth development. There will be a difference between the
reading levels and technology skills of these youth. It will demonstrate that mentoring
these at-risk youth affects them strongly in their understanding of life, improved behavior
toward school and the project’s obligations and the student’s willingness to improve their

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

59

reading. Results will show that the implementation of a more enhanced mentoring project
will help change the atmosphere of this school.
Findings will reveal that during a five-month cycle, a literacy-based school
mentoring program can provide a productive context for low-income, ethnically diverse,
middle school youths to explore, reflect upon, and ultimately improve their reading
levels. Modest positive effects on the academic performance and/or social integration of
participating students will suggests that, given the chance to interact in mentoring
programs led by professional librarians could yield positive results for more at-risk
students on a sustained basis. This innovative mentoring program will pair together teens
from low-income backgrounds and professional librarians as reading mentors to read
books teach new technologies and discuss the activities during weekly intervention
meetings. It is assumed that all participants in the study have the desire and willingness to
do their best regarding what is required of them. It is also assumed that the students
would tell the truth during the one-to-one interviews. Additionally, it was assumed that
the information obtained from the limited sample of “at-risk” participants will transfer to
all at-risk students who are facing similar circumstances. Evaluating Community In
Schools, A Child’s Place and After School Enrichment Program, will be important to
finding out how the school librarian can affect both academic and nonacademic aspects
of “adolescent development,” through a mentoring project designed to encourage literacy
and behavioral improvement among at risk students.
Today, literacy not only means reading, but includes digital information and
technology. At-risk youth are more likely to read below grade level, have lack of access

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

60

to updated technology tools, and have limited access to informational literacy tools (ie,
the internet). This is very much a foundational problem -- the fact that so many children
in poverty are behind in reading means that they struggle academically in all areas and
basically sets them up for failure when they get to middle school and even high school.
Even those who graduate from low-income schools with low graduation rates are
significantly behind their wealthier peers.
There are three major drivers for the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program;
professional librarians, information literacy tools and teacher support. When combined,
these three levers of change work together to create a supportive environment for the
reform to take place. This reform context is the engine that moved Middle School closer
to reaching their literacy goals. Every aspect of the Weekly Readers Mentoring program
worked to include efforts in these three areas. Proficient reading skills are essential to
learning mathematics, science, social studies and technology concepts. Educators of
content knowledge must also think of themselves, in the broad sense, as teachers of
reading (Cramer, 2003; Reed, 2004). Rereading, reading, and after-reading strategies
must be used by librarian-mentors to support students’ development as independent,
strategic, and engaged readers. The strategies below in figure 2 may help all student
participants to successfully transfer reading skills to other learning areas especially
technology, and are particularly useful for urban students. Cramer (2003) and Reed
(2004) believe that the more a teacher knows about literacy teaching, the more effective
he or she will be at teaching content. Careful selection of reading materials also must be a

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

61

priority of content teachers (Cramer, 2003; Booth & Rowsell, 2002); therefore, utilizing
the library media specialist in literacy-based curriculum development is essential.
Librarians are skilled at incorporating culturally relevant literature, artifacts,
graphic and technical organizers, and other media to activate and build on urban students’
background knowledge. Strategies of prereading experiences will focus on all
information literacy and relevancy that actively engage and empower students. The goal
of reading is to make meaning, so librarians and other educators must remember what
students take away from the text is based in part on what they bring to the text, including
their ability to reason (Cramer, 2003).

Students have ready access to many sites that can help promote reading and
technology activities within the at-risk community. Social networking sites, such as
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or YouTube, allow librarians to engage with teens online
and showcase reading programs and services to teen users. According to a 2011 study by
the Pew Research Center, “Social media use has become so pervasive in the lives of
American teens that having a presence on a social network site is almost synonymous
with being online. Fully 95% of all teens aged 12–17 are now online and 80% of those
online teens are users of social media sites” (Lenhart et al., 2011, p. 2).
Qualitative Research Approach
The most appropriate method for conducting a study on the impact, of action
research on educational practices, is to use qualitative methodology. Because this study
was narrowly focused in one school setting with 10 students and 10 librarians, a case
study methodology was also used. Using case study methods helped provide me with a
means to understand the importance of the action research experience. Although
generalizations could be made, by using a case study design, the feedback loop was
specifically designed for the one library. Understanding the experience of action research
helped me document the experience more precisely. The activities were interpreted and
explained through the participants’ lens and through the framework of mentoring and
action research.
There are various methods, which are generally common to the qualitative
research paradigm, include keeping a research journal, document collection and analysis,
participant observation recordings, questionnaire surveys, structured and unstructured

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

63

interviews, and case studies (O’Brien, 2001). He described a paradigm, a word that
comes from the Latin word paradigma and appears in Greek as paradeigma:
A term used by Aristotle, is the art of acting upon the conditions one faces in
order to change them. It deals with the disciplines and activities predominant in
the ethical and political lives of people. Aristotle contrasted this with Theoria those sciences and activities that are concerned with knowing for its own sake.
Both are equally needed he thought. That knowledge is derived from practice, and
practice informed by knowledge, in an ongoing process, is a cornerstone of action
research. Action researchers also reject the notion of researcher neutrality,
understanding that the most active researcher is often one who has most at stake
in resolving a problematic situation. (O’Brien, 2001)
This study utilized a triangulation approach to explore and guide the development
and evaluation of a librarian-led mentoring project at a Middle School in North Carolina.
The use of the qualitative methodology was necessary to encompass the effects of oneon-one librarian-led mentoring has on at-risk students. In this action research study, the
qualitative methodology was used because it has a philosophical foundation as well as the
interpretive paradigm which supports the view that there are many truths and multiple
realities which accommodates the investigatory aspects of social and human experiences.
Qualitative data collection techniques used were interviews, pre- and posttest,
questionnaires, librarian group interviews, and my field notes of personal observations
and conversations. I gained different perspectives and drew attention to many different
factors that place teens at-risk of failing academically and socially. Through these

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

64

methods I was able to discover, explore, observe and document lived experiences that
could not have been described otherwise. The intent of librarian and student interviews
was to investigate and describe current issues the students had and what the librarians
found. Qualitative interviews were also used to explore the different experiences of the
librarians and the students. The incorporation of librarians as participants in this study
was to enhance the understanding of the importance of librarians and experiences
confronting intervention, the library science field and library professionals working with
and providing education to at-risk students. All participants had to sign an informed
consent before becoming part of this study (see IRB in Appendix V).
Stakeholders: The Librarian
Individuals included as stakeholders were those professionals who have master’s
degrees in information and library science, who were involved with processing,
documenting and reporting of the evidence collected. The librarians were included into
the study as collaborators and partners. After identifying the desired librarians, I called
each of them at their libraries to ask whether they would be interested in participating in
this study. During the phone conversation, each librarian was provided with information
about me, the research project, and the level of commitment their participation would
entail. Once the librarians agreed to participate, a time and place for an interview and the
training session was arranged at the participant’s convenience. In total there were 10
librarian and 10 student interviews conducted. There was one mentoring training session
held, that took place in December 2012 which included the youth. The interviews and
training took place in the middle school’s media center and lasted 90 minutes. None of

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

65

the contacted librarians declined to participate. During the interviews The librarians also
completed consent forms allowing the action research to take place and to solidify their
participation (see Appendix C for the Mentor Consent Form). I stressed the importance of
participants not discussing the individual issues the students had and confidentiality of
librarian-led mentoring program.
Instruments
The action research for this study was five months long. The instruments utilized
for this study included literacy surveys for the students, librarian involvement surveys
and demographic surveys and consent forms for the students and parents. The technology
that was used in the action research was desktop computers, laptops, Ipads, and
audiobooks. Students reading comprehension was measured through oral activities and
literal and inferential comprehension multiple-choice questions. The consent form was
given to Middle School’s principal for approval. All ten parents and/or guardians and all
ten students signed the consent forms giving them permission to be a part of the study
(See Appendix A for a copy of the Assent to Participate Form and Appendix B for a copy
of the Student Assent Form).
To determine the effect the “Librarian-Led Mentoring Program” had on academic
achievement, the students’ scores on the standardized test I had planned to compare the
scores of students from the prior year the study year’s test scores. However, I was unable
to use this information because the EOG tests measurement tool changed for the 2012-13
for North Carolina schools the study year. Instead, The READY Accountability model
was used to evaluate student and school performance. Because it was a more rigorous and

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

66

complicated assessment tool, than that of previous years, study student scores appeared
lower because the grade-level proficiency goal had risen. The state has experienced
decreases in student proficiency levels in past years when curriculum standards and
proficiency levels were raised; however this always caused student performance in North
Carolina to rebound. According to the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction’s
(DPI) website, www.ncpublicschools.org. 4
Therefore, I measured the student’s literacy skills and fluency using technology
through interaction, observations and interviews. The students were given the initial
orientation survey at orientation before the action research started (See Appendix E). This
survey asked the students about their familiarization with technology, about information
literacy, and librarian mentorship. On Friday, December 21, 2012, the ten student
participants were oriented and taught about the mentoring program. Between the months
of January 3rd and June 2nd the ten student participants participated in various activities
once a week with their librarian-mentor. These activities consisted of reading, team
building, developing leadership skills, understanding technology and building selfesteem. In total, there were 27 mentoring sessions. The transcriptions and records were
analyzed to determine if reading skills and fluency improved as the program progressed.
Their motivation to read, utilize technology, leadership skills and literacy skills were
measured through the use of surveys (see Appendix H).
“The State Board of Education adopted the READY Accountability Model which replaced the
ABCs of Public Education. At the same time North Carolina made the transition to new assessments
aligned to college and career ready content standards. The 2012-13 school year is the baseline for the new
assessments’ data and the accountability indicators’ data. The performance results are reported with growth
and targets (federal and state). The READY Accountability website provides detailed reporting at the state,
district and school level.”

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

67

Another method for determining achievement of the students was the percentage
of students who completed their reading homework and computer assignments given by
mentors. One major reason students do not usually complete their assignments or who act
out in class, was due to the fact that they were not able to fully comprehend the text that
they were given and preferred to avoid the struggle than to engage in overcoming such
barriers. If students during the study turned in their mentoring assignments, improved on
tests, participated in all activities and developed a more positive attitude toward school,
then the claim could be made that their literacy achievement had increased.
Students were asked to complete the orientation survey which asked for
demographic information, their attitudes toward technology, and their use of technology.
Students were also asked about their attitudes toward reading and technology use in
supporting reading (see Appendix E).
The Role of the Researcher
My role in this action research study was to be a participant observer in self-study
research. As a participant observer I was able to observe as a researcher as well as
participate in the mentoring activities. This role allowed me to observe the program,
study the student’s interactions with the librarians and watch for patterns, the unexpected,
and to change things if they were not working. I took an active role with one particular
student by being his librarian-mentor. As the researcher, I observed and took field notes
in addition to interacting with all of the librarians and students. This allowed me to
witness the changes and the true actions of the program.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

Sample Population
The study took place in the media center at a large southern city middle school. It
was a social action research study and program evaluation that focused primarily on the
process of the program not necessarily the outcome. The data on which this study was
based consisted of field notes, of participant observations of the 10 students through our
six months in 2012–2013. Periodic taped interviews were conducted with all of the
students during the librarian led-mentoring project. In addition students were interviewed
after they took their EOG test and when the project ended. There were five young men
and five young women. Their ages range from 12 years to 14 years. They were in Grades
6, 7, and 8. The students who were the focus of this study were considered to be at-risk
measured by poor reading levels, poor behavior/attitude toward school, and low
technology and information-literacy skills. Finally they were expected to complete a
critical analysis assignment, which included researching the problem, reflective writing,
presenting information to peers, and working in the location.
Data Collection
The study period lasted for five months, in which participants took one practice
standardize test, and participated in 27 activities, reading groups, independent reading
and End of the Grade test preparation sessions. Students completed pre- and postsurveys
which were administered at the beginning, once in the middle, as well as at the end of the
study period. I administered all surveys in person and also through online web-based
surveys.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

69

Howard and Eckhardt (2005, p. 33) suggested that the most common way to
collect data in qualitative research is through questionnaires, surveys, interviews,
observations, and archival information from the library media center or school records.
Questionnaires and surveys provide a sufficient amount of information in a short period
of time because they are easily and quickly distributed to large number of respondents.
Interviews
Conducting interviews was used to gain an understanding of the teens, librarians,
teachers and the school’s administration perception of the value of the library. It was
important to interview teens were actively involved in the program. Pre- and postprogram
interviews were conducted after the first and last survey. All students completed the
surveys and interviews. During the initial series of interviews, two students were
interviewed at once. I asked a series of open-ended questions (see Appendix J). The
answers provided me short feedback loops to implement strategies that would improve
the program to best meet the needs of the student. In like manner, information from the
librarians aided me in understanding the cultural context within which the program
unfolded. The interview protocol asked about the youth’s experience. The questions were
divided in six sections. The sections included questions about the librarian-led mentoring
experience, about reading motivation, questions about technology, questions about the
qualities and characteristics of a good reader, questions about suggestions and/or advice
to other struggling youth and the last section queried the adolescents to provide any
information they considered important. Demographic information inquired about gender,

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

70

age, grade, favorite and least favorite activities they liked to participate in the most, their
technology and leadership skills and what they gain from the program (see appendix F).
Observation
The purpose of the observation was to gain additional information about the
process of mentoring at-risk teens in information literacy. The observations allowed me
to document the program and the dynamics of individual experiences that took place
when the youth were being mentored by librarians. I conducted the observations
throughout the study. It was carried out during the last thirty to forty-five minutes of the
mentoring workshops. In these observations, the youth were asked to participate in all
activities and take notes about their experience. The observations were audio and visually
recorded and I took notes during and after the observations. Howard and Eckhardt (2005)
stated that if a researcher uses observation to collect data, “then he or she must account
for the items being observed. The terms must be defined so that the researcher will know
what “engaged in research” looks like and assure the reliability of the data collected” (p.
34).
Reflective Journal
According to Morrow and Smith (2000), the use of a reflective journaling adds
rigor to qualitative inquiry, it records reactions, assumptions, expectations, and biases
about the process I kept field notes which also included reflective journaling for detailed
observations and my intuitive responses. The journal allowed me to describe feelings,
actions and observations about this action research. Field notes began on the first day of
the mentoring program of the study.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

71

Data Analysis
I transcribed all interviews, observations, documents, mentor comments and field
notes. I Transcribed hand written surveys into Surveygizmo.com for purposes of analysis.
The recorded interviews allowed me to become acquainted with the data. I created
Microsoft Word files for the interviews, observations, documents, and journal entries. All
files were protected by setting a password and utilizing locked file boxes. All
computerized files were saved in my laptop computer and paper forms were kept in a
locked file cabinet at work and then transferred home, to which I was the only one who
had access. I used the meaning of context as the unit of analysis for coding. In using this
approach the data is not coded sentence by sentence or paragraph by paragraph, but
coded for meaning and themes. I read through each transcript to immerse in the data to
produce a report.
Validation Strategies
As the area of qualitative research increases, social and behavioral scientists
critique the validity of action research methodology. Creswell & Miller state that,
authentication strategies are often used by researchers to ensure the credibility of their
study (Creswell & Miller, 2000). Library media specialist should triangulate the data in a
way that uses three different data collection methods to answer their research question.
Triangulation of data supports the research project’s validity (truthfulness of the data
collected) and reliability (accuracy of the data; Howard & Eckhardt, 2005, p. 34)
Procedures for validity of this research included triangulating strategies of action
research, researcher reflexivity, thick description, and peer debriefing. Credibility for this

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

72

study was achieved by using various forms of data collected for authentication such as
interviews, observations, documents, reflective mentee and mentor journal entries and
field notes.
Ethical Considerations
All of the participants were treated in accordance to the ethical guidelines of the
American Psychological Association (APA) and the Franklin Pierce University
Institutional Review Board (IRB). Even though, there are no identifiable risks for
participating in this study, a couple of considerations were kept in mind when dealing
with the at-risk students. First, all of the parents were notified and asked how they felt
about having their children serve as mentees to librarians. Similarly all the students were
asked about how they felt about participating and discussing their experiences as
mentees. The school and participants privacy were protected by giving all pseudonyms. If
anyone had any objections or concerns in answering questions, participating in the action
plan, interviews or sharing thoughts and reflections, they had the option of opting out. No
student or librarian chose to opt out. Interviews and observations were coded so no
association can be made to any persons. No harm came to participants in anyway. Data
was stored in a locked cabinet in my office. The names used for this study are fictional.
Summary
I facilitated the program throughout the 2012–2013 school year and focused on
developing reading and literacy activities for at-risk students. The librarian-mentors
assisted me in developing an efficient evaluation of the existing mentoring programs. I
also collaborated with staff during the teacher work-days through June. Finally, I met

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS
with the school administrators in November 2013 to report the study’s finding and
discussed the importance of recreating the mentoring program in fall 2013, although I
would no longer be working there.

CHAPTER FOUR
FINDINGS AND RESULTS
The Backstory: The Weekly Readers Program
When the weekly readers mentoring program was initiated, the primary goal was
to establish relationships between identified at-risk students and caring professional
librarians, placing emphasis on study habits, interpersonal relationships, problem-solving
techniques, communication, and leadership skills. By encouraging positive behaviors, it
was hoped that the mentors would provide support and guidance to encourage student
success. The program emphasized the development of young people’s knowledge, skills,
and abilities so that they could become experts on issues important them. Another goal
was to catalyze systemic change in collaboration with their peers and supportive adults.
The goals of the program were to recruit, train, and retain professional librarians for the
in-school mentoring program and to provide support and encouragement for at-risk
youth. The program was also developed to embrace the school system’s mission of
providing a world-class education by offering assistance through mentoring to help
students improve information literacy, which would positively impact their lives and
prepare them for high school. This dissertation examined the effectiveness of this
program in meeting its goals and expectations.

The Development and Implementation
of the Weekly Readers Program
Before the 2012–2013 school year started, I met several times with the school’s
principal, literacy coordinator, and administration to plan the first few weeks of the
school-based program. During these meetings, I discussed how implementing the reading
program would be essential to meeting the school’s literacy goals.
My quest to create the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program began in August of
2012. I wanted to know if professional public librarians could, in collaboration with
teacher librarians, help middle school at-risk students achieve higher literacy rates. I am a
certified public-service librarian, but I decided to leave my position as a lead teen
librarian to take a position as a library media specialist (also known as a teacher librarian)
in one of North Carolina’s disadvantaged middle schools, solely for the purpose of this
study. During the first week of the school year, I was orientated by the principal, which
was the extent of the training I received. She explained the job requirements and made
me aware of her expectations and what she would like to see happen at the school. She
was interested in seeing teacher-librarian collaboration. She wanted a more focused
media program, which would be developed into an elective class. She gave me
permission to develop an effective media program at my discretion. She told me that the
last media specialist had four student assistants and wanted to know if I was interested in
having any assistants, and if so, how many.
I was fascinated by the idea of having the opportunity to work with a group of
teenage students. Because I was new to the education field and lacked adequate training, I

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

76

was unsure of how many student assistants were appropriate. I referred to the media
services department for advice and was told that I was allowed to have as many assistants
as I felt I could manage, although having them was not a requirement. I originally
requested 20 media assistants because, like other underprivileged schools, the student–
teacher ratio was overwhelming and the elective classes were overcrowded. My intention
was to demonstrate leadership and teamwork while taking the opportunity to help
alleviate the class load of the elective teachers. I also wanted to develop the best media
program in the history of the school. During the second week of school I had a total of 36
student assistants placed on my class roster and decided to create a media-assistant
program geared toward mentoring and information literacy. The students were in sixth,
seventh, and eighth grade and were all chosen at random; however, throughout the
selection process, I asked for students who had low reading scores and needed help
developing information-literacy skills.
In the beginning, the overall school atmosphere was unwelcoming, and the staff
did not appear to want to interact with me. I sent out an email introducing myself and
received very few welcoming replies, which helped me realize that it would be a struggle
to obtain collaboration. But I was up for the challenge. This new experience gave me
insight on what goes on inside of a school building on a daily basis. It was intriguing to
me, as I have always worked with the at-risk population in public libraries and in
communities. I immediately noticed a difference in the roles that a school librarian plays
versus the roles that a public librarian plays. In most school systems, students have
dedicated library time each week, during which the teacher librarian or library media

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

specialist instructs them how to use the library resources and how to check in and out
books. Teaching lessons to studentsin public systems is optional, and although librarians
help patrons with researching specific topics, they generally do not provide overall
instruction on library usage unless it is for school visits or specialized information
sessions. I realized early that if the school librarian wanted to be noticed and made part of
the educational team, it is imperative that he or she take initiative and stray away from
just doing busy work.
Although I shared an office with the technology specialist, the only person in
charge of all of the school’s technology, I felt like an intruder who had no business being
in the school. She helped me with the technological issues that I faced setting up
usernames and getting the library’s equipment functional. She informed me that she was
not very familiar with the media center or library procedures and would do her best to
help. She told me that the last media specialist didn’t really collaborate well with the
teachers or other staff members. This prompted me to research the purpose of a media
specialist, how to be an active media specialist, and how to develop an effective media
program. I read library literature, called my colleagues and mentors at schools and public
libraries, requested a training manual from the media department, and began to create a
program from scratch. I was determined to demonstrate my leadership skills.
I noticed an overwhelming majority of students in my library classes who were
confused and had difficulty comprehending the reading materials and instructions they
were given. To them, reading seemed like a daunting task, and their self-esteem and
academic achievement were at risk. The other problem was that the youth considered the

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

78

readings, books, and the library in general to be boring. Many of them were only excited
to come to the media center to engage with their friends and to have a free block of time.
Some of them read only when it was something they enjoyed. Many of the teens read
magazines and books, such as Anime, Manga, and comics; how-to origami books; and
urban teen fiction. They all expressed a need and a desire to explore areas of interest to
them, and our school library lacked such materials. This was a wonderful opportunity for
the students and teachers to help me select books, which allowed them to recognize that
they could do something about the state of their library. This also encouraged teacher–
librarian collaboration.
As the school librarian, I quickly realized that there was much to do. Many things
needed immediate attention, such as the physical aspects of organizing the collection in
an orderly fashion, securing the databases, and establishing a budget for new library
materials. The staff had a range of perspectives about what the library media specialist
should and could do. I also realized that the library media specialist’s knowledge and
expertise were underutilized. Additionally, resources and time were limited, which made
it difficult for me to focus on the core objective of the media center—information
literacy.
The school had a literacy coordinator who made all of the schools’ literacy
decisions but did not collaborate with the previous teacher librarian in making any of
those decisions. She was the point person for textbook ordering, arranging public
librarian visits, curriculum and literacy-based instruction for teachers, author visits and
even the organizer of book fairs. Also, there was also the technology specialist who

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

79

shared the same office as the librarian, and was responsible for all of the school’s
technology issues. I didn’t really understand the structure of the school or why it was
necessary for them to have a school librarian if the combination of these two positions
covered all of the duties.
The time allocated to me was divided between administrative duties and light
library instruction. There were many daily tasks, mainly administrative duties, which was
not mentioned as part of my job description. The organization of the school was odd; as I
reflected on the overall culture and staff’s perception of the school librarian I began to
formulate the following questions: is it possible to use professional librarians to improve
student attitudes towards reading, information literacy and also student academic esteem;
and if the school librarian is one of the few people in the school who has contact with
every student and every teacher, why in this particular school did the librarian not play an
important role in the development of literacy-based programming, book ordering, and
curriculum building?
It was my hope that by engaging students in meaningful interactions with friendly
knowledgeable librarians they would be more receptive to learning the skills that will
also improve their academic reading, and that this improvement would be measurable by
objectively evaluating student reading and technology skills before, during, and after
their experiences with a weekly readers mentoring program. I decided to utilize a small
sample of 10 students, 5 girls and 5 boys who had the lowest reading scores of the group.
These students were failing in English, had behavioral problems and demonstrated weak

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

80

reading comprehension and leadership skills, as witnessed through their handling of
much of the material covered the previous year in their reading curriculum.
In a literacy-centered approach, the student mentees were engaged in the
enjoyable process of hands on experiences. The adolescents learned about the art of
leadership and enhanced their knowledge of reading strategies and technology through
group activities, role-playing and challenging reading games, case studies, journaling and
reflection. There were activities based on self-confidence and positive character traits,
effective leadership, team-building, learning good listening, communication and
technology skills as well as reading to comprehend. The at-risk students developed
confidence by learning new skills and became role-models for other students in the media
program. They learned to value themselves as talented with great potential to improve
their reading and knowledge of technology. The shared experience with at-risk teens and
professional librarians helped sustain their motivation for personal growth and selfdevelopment for successful adulthood. I have always believed that all students can learn
and with the right one-on-one supervision they can achieve their academic goals. This
program assisted with creating a friendly library environment in which students felt they
could freely and effectively express themselves and take full ownership of their media
center.
I researched school-based mentoring programs for literacy as well as librarian led
mentoring projects to see what was out there on this topic. I realized that there was not
much literature or guidelines on the specific subject. Librarian-led Mentoring should be
seen as an important part of the mentoring movement, utilizing innovative ways to get

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

81

more adults involved in mentoring programs that support the literacy initiative. My
primary strategy was to bring at-risk youth and professional librarians together, making it
as easy as possible for librarians to participate with the teaching of information literacy in
schools and for the youth to see professionals in action. We provided the expertise and
guided the process every step of the way. The Weekly Readers program connected
professionals and cultivated minds of at-risk youth by creating the opportunity to
produce, express, and contribute using information literacy and technology. The unique
school media and technology and information literacy mentoring program empowered
middle school boys and girls to learn reading strategies, how to utilize media and to gain
leadership and media technology skills in a safe, open environment, mentored by a
network of professional librarians.
The librarians came to the media center once a week on a Tuesday to read, coach,
and mentor the students. They taught the youth to trust adults, to build relationships, and
to improve other life skills. In this information literacy–based program, the students were
taught technology, research, and leadership skills. Our media assistants came into the
media center at all times throughout the day to “check in” and talk about all of their life
issues. The program was put in place as an intervention and was implemented from
January to June 2013, the 3rd and 4th school quarters.
Librarian-mentors were selected and trained in one orientation session on
December 10, 2012, prior to the third quarter. Student mentees were also selected and
everyone completed the preintervention survey before the winter break. During the 1st
week of the 3rd school quarter, librarians were given their mentees’ names and interest

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

82

and were asked to contact them and develop a weekly schedule of meeting times, during
their library elective class. The librarians provided a copy of the schedule to me and I
provided it to the parents and the school principal for approval. At the beginning of the
first session, the mentor and mentee discussed all possible mentoring activities in which
they would be involved in. I provided biweekly training refreshers and idea sharing via email correspondence. Training refreshers included shortened definitions of effective
mentor strategies and examples of techniques learned in training. We used google to
share ideas and information with all mentors. I provided examples of successful
techniques and advisory activities to be used during sessions.
The librarians were chosen from both public and school libraries. The names used
for this study are fictional. Initially, the librarians decided to focus on reading novels and
letting the students chose the books that we were going to read throughout the program.
However, at the first mentoring session we realized the students were selecting materials
that were not on their reading level. We decided that we would participate in the selection
process and explain to the students why what they selected could not be used and helped
them chose something that they were interested in and on their reading level. The teens
helped tremendously with choosing books that interested them; they also contributed to
decorating the media center mentoring space. All of the students helped with the media
assistant program, they helped with developing craft activities, and they shelved library
materials. Early into the program, we noticed that focusing on just reading activities
made the program feel like a classroom and students began to get annoyed and bored. We
realized the students were not engaged and the program didn’t get the students excited

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

83

about learning new things therefore, we chose to reorganize our mentoring strategies, (see
Appendix: O)
Although the program was information literacy based, we did a lot of character
and leadership building while incorporating reading and technology. Each teen was
encouraged to write about their feelings, thoughts, likes, and dislikes towards the
program. They were all assessed weekly on the skills they have been taught and final
projects were given at the end of each topic.
I held a mentoring “meet and greet” the first week of the program and all of the
librarians came into the media center to meet with the ten students with whom they were
paired. During the first thirty minutes, we all discussed the purpose of the program, our
expectations, the rules and allowed the students to ask us questions. The students
completed a preintervention orientation survey (see Apendix E ). Some of the students
seemed eager and some were skeptical about participating in the program. The librarians
and students were told they were not allowed to leave the school campus during of the
mentoring sessions. During the course of the program we had final and group projects at
the end of each category as well as at home Assignments, which included, Word Study
and Independent reading (see Appendix L).
I worked with all ten students in the media center and discussed the different
activities and brainstormed different strategies and ideas they had to improve the
program. With their help, the librarians and I decided to include interesting topics along
with the literacy-based projects (see Appendix O for the Weekly Reader Mentoring
Activities list). I chose topics I thought would be useful for this study.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

84

The instructional components of this program were divided into six categories:
Respect: Why am I here? This category was an icebreaker unit and occurred
during the first two weeks. Many of the students did not believe in themselves enough to
be successful in school, most likely because of family problems, their living situations or
a sense of feeling intimidated by their peers who they believe were better than they.
During the first session we did an activity called “Introducing yourself to others, Manners
101 (school, public places, &telephone).” We began the activity by explaining proper
telephone etiquette, introductions and how they should conduct themselves in public
settings. We had the teens formally introduce themselves as if they were meeting one
another for the first time. They had to take notes and critique each person’s performance.
The teens were interactive and enjoyed this activity. This allowed the students to warm
up to the program and gain an understanding of why they were participating.
The second week of the program was very interesting as the students were excited
to learn how to resolve conflict and debate. Middle School students tend to have many
problems when it comes to friends and social incompetency’s which cause them to have
constant issues with one another. Each librarian and their mentee started this activity by
discussing the meaning of the word “friend”. The students had to write down their
definition and pass it to their librarian. The librarian searched the word in the dictionary
and had the mentee read the proper definition out loud and they discussed the differences.
The students were asked to discuss what friendship meant to them and how they could
resolve issues described in possible life scenarios. Each student was given a scenario
dealing with a particular conflict and was asked to resolve the issue creatively and present

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

85

it to the group at the next group session. The librarians taught their mentees what it meant
to debate and how to develop skills to be a great debater. There was always time at the
end of the session to talk about personal issues.
Education: How can I make myself better? During weeks 3-8, we worked on
building the teen’s self-esteem and taught them tips to read to understand. The teens were
very interested in learning to type without looking at their fingers. We also discussed how
to be critical thinkers and what it took to be successful and the importance of planning.
Each student volunteered their services in school. We also introduced the students to
shared reading in a “Mini-Lesson”. Each librarian read aloud to their mentee and had
them follow along and then switched.
Keshawn, Tamia and Don wanted to learn how the technical aspects of the media
center operated, improve customer service skills and gain valuable job skills.
Tamia proved that she’s learned from this experience:
I learned how the books are divided while shelving. I taught another student how
to put the books in the proper place and explained why putting the books where
they belong is important to the librarian.
Technology: Tech savvy teens. Technology was the most fascinating to the teens
because they were able to utilize the computers, laptops and other gadgets. Throughout
weeks 9-13, we taught everything from basic internet, library catalog research skills to
how to use and make videos with IPads and tablets. The students had a great time
teaching their librarians how to use the IPads properly. The final project for this category
was that each student researched and typed a 1-page letter in Microsoft Word, educating

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

86

their peers about a Sexually Transmitted Disease or major health issue and created a
PowerPoint presentation. This aspect of the mentoring program allowed students to
provide computer and technology leadership and training for older staff members and
their peers. We gave the student mentees the opportunity to develop leadership,
communication and teaching skills. It is said that most people learn more as they teach.
Each student learned to teach important aspects of computing to others who were not
familiar with technology.
One student commented:
One of my friends was trying to find books for his reading level and I showed him
how to use the library’s catalog and how to find the area with the books he needed
and taught him how to look for the level on the spine or back of the book. I
recommended him some books he might like. He left with an armful of books and
I was excited that I had enough experience to make him smile.
The teens introduced other students to the computer and assisted them in learning how to
use library technology and helped adult staff to overcome apprehension about
technology. The mentees led in-library programs on how to e-mail, use Microsoft Word
applications and internet search engines, work with photos, and conduct research. This
librarian-led lesson allowed students to strengthen critical thinking and problem-solving
skills, to improve communication abilities, and to interact and share information with a
population remarkably different from them. Through student instruction, other teens were
able to communicate better with family and friends, learn new skills, and gain a sense of
accomplishment.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

87

Character: What are your plans for the future? Weeks 13-15 focused on
character building. The students found this category most useful. They all loved the fact
that they were talking about college and making long and short term goals. The most
rewarding part of this section was the resume writing. They enjoyed discussing what
experiences they had that was already valuable in a job search. For the final project each
student created a resume and presented it during a job interview (interviews were
conducted by the researcher and librarian-mentors).
Confidence: What does it take to be a leader? During Weeks 16–20 we decided
to do group projects. We taught the aspects of public speaking, visual poise- good
posture, how to stand, proper sitting, graceful walking, and smiling in a group setting. We
also reviewed the components of becoming a leader, and the dynamics of team building.
The Read Aloud/Modeled Reading and Phonics session proved to be very interesting to
many of the mentees. It seemed to take the pressure off them as they disliked reading but
enjoyed listening to the stories. All of the librarians enjoyed working with the students in
a group session which allowed them to introduce them to different genres and other great
stories with interesting characters. Students saw that many of us stumbled on words and
realized that librarians do in fact make mistakes with words just like they did. Reading
aloud helped to inspire students to read independently. Knowing that topics would
interest all the mentees, I chose stories to read aloud that involved middle school students
or passages from graphic novels or teen romance books. Each Student was asked to find a
test-taking strategy that they would introduce to their peers during the next session. One
librarian commented on this session saying:

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

88

I can’t tell you how proud I am of Jayla. She appears to be shy and very soft
spoken. Even the librarians, teachers and other staff members have noticed these
traits in her and commented on it. However, two weeks ago she really surprised
me! I was conducting the CONFIDENCE: What Does It Take To Be a Leader?
During this session I struggled with preparation and needed some help. I just
didn’t have enough hands. At first, Jayla was hesitant, but with a little coxing, that
all changed. Not only did she make the puppets come to life, she also read lines. I
was so proud of her!
Preparing for the end of grade test. This category was the most tedious to
conduct. By the time we got to Weeks 21–26 the students were ready to unwind. We tried
to make these sessions interesting but no matter what we chose to do to spice up the
activities the students began to drift. It was as if the program came to a halt. It may have
been that all the activities were school and reading related without the fun and interaction
of the previous units. We conducted shared reading/Mini Lessons, covered test taking
strategies, dissected reading passages and showed them how to take notes effectively in
one-on-one and group sessions. For the final project each student wrote a 3-page essay
about the Weekly Readers program and how it had or could change him/her into a leader
for the 21st century.
The facility. The media center’s convenient location was is one of the facility’s
strengths, which made for a perfect place to conduct the mentoring program. Per the
Impact standards, it was one level, located on the “ground floor,” close to the Principal’s
office, with easy access to bathrooms and elevators (NC DPI, 2008, p. 62). The American

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

89

Association of School Libraries (2009) also emphasizes the importance of having the
media center occupy a “space that is centrally located and well integrated with the rest of
the school” (p. 33). Indeed, the Middle School media center’s location lent itself to
natural integration with the rest of the school, as it was positioned along two busy
hallways, just to the right of the main plaza in the school. With a few minor exceptions,
the layout of the media center seemed to effectively maximize their allotted space (see
Appendix K: RMS Media Center Floor Plan). There were areas for quiet reading and
individual study, as well as an area for small group work, and the shelf layout—lining the
perimeter of the main room—was conducive to browsing. There was also a computer lab
big enough to house a class, as well as a large group space that could host up to two
classes at a time. This was important to the Weekly Readers Mentoring program because
although we were having mentoring sessions, other classes were welcomed into the
media center at the same time. In the center of the media center sat a small living-room
type setup—a space that could easily be used for individual work/reading or small group
book talks and story sharing. I chose to conduct the mentoring program in the media
center because the room did not feel cluttered, and the different areas existed in a way
that did not sacrifice accessibility for the sake of having classes visit during the same
time mentoring was in session.
The media center provided ample seating for students. The large group area
seated sixty-two in all, and the computer lab area seated twenty-seven. The quiet reading
areas—space that was used as book talk/story sharing space—seated twelve students,
collectively. The small group work area—comprised of three roundtables— some chairs

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

were missing; housed only seven, but had capacity for at least twelve which, the
librarian-mentors used regularly when doing group activities.
Findings
Through observation and discussions the librarians collected anecdotal evidence
to show that the learning activities provided multiple benefits to both the librarians and
the students. More formal, ongoing assessments of student learning that took place during
these sessions also indicated that the activities enabled students to meet the learning
outcomes of the sessions. Generally speaking, it was noted that students appeared to be
significantly more engaged and interested when the activities were fun and when they
were able to lead the sessions. Most students were excited to participate in planning the
activities and documenting their progress. Librarians have also reaped the benefits of this
program. The tedious nature of sessions and activities that we chose were not only
problematic for students but also for librarians. Some of the sessions had to be adjusted to
fully benefit the students. Having a variety of learning activities to choose from to suit
each student made the program easier. It was helpful to incorporate different teaching
strategies to the different activities. As the program progressed, librarians became more
comfortable with the process of teaching reading strategies as well as mentoring and
began to develop their own activities and adaptations to share with the students. By
changing the dynamics of librarianship utilizing mentoring, the librarians worked hard to
improve our original plan to teach and engage the students. They learned a lot from the
student engagement during information literacy sessions. The use of active learning
activities has helped immensely in achieving this goal.

Results From the Students’ Pre- and Posttest Surveys
The student and librarian presurveys were analyzed and compared with the
postsurveys. The students were asked nine general questions in both the pre- and
postsurveys. These questions were important because the students were able to share their
views about reading, certain aspects of their lives, and their research and technology
capabilities. They were asked to indicate how much they agreed with each statement on a
Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The responses were mixed
on the presurvey, mainly because the students were not confident or sure how to answer
these questions. They were trying to figure out how I wanted them to answer instead of
answering honestly. In the postsurvey, the answers seem to have been influenced by a
better understanding of the questions. The charts below show the differences. When
asked how strongly they perceived the value of reading, all students were clear in the
postsurvey about the value of reading (see Figures 2 and 3).

The responses to positive role models in their lives was telling in that it appeared
the program either helped them with finding positive role models or helped them identify
those individuals in their lives who play a positive role (see Figures 4 and 5).

The students’ confidence in their ability to find credible sources and to be able to
distinguish what they should use in researching information also dramatically increased.
The mentoring experiences gave the kids a lot of resources to make better decisions when
choosing materials for research (see Figures 6 and 7).

One of the main components of raising their confidence was their ability to read
in front of class. This is notable in that students mentioned this as something important in
their classroom behavior and focus. It’s that combination of librarian-led mentoring and
activities that researchers believe can have a significant impact on reversing declining
grades and absenteeism which are factors that eventually lead to students dropping out of
school (see Figures 8 and 9).

Their sense of mastery in researching information and writing projects also
increased among most of the students. This confidence in understanding credible
information sources was further emphasized when they expressed a comfort with
technology and in their awareness that Wikipedia and Google were not the only ways to
find information (see Figures 10 and 11).

Their use of the library as a source of support and enjoyment also increased. Since
the students were involved in the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program they gained
interest in visiting their neighborhood libraries to show off their new skills. This also
shows that the students utilized the media center/ library on a weekly basis because they
enjoyed going and being involved (see Figures 12 and 13).

Another significant finding from the study was that although much attention has
been devoted to literacy, this responses show that technological resources provided to the
teens can have an impact on the way they view themselves. This showed that the Weekly
Readers Mentoring Program encouraged the teens notice their failures, their successes
and their abilities to creatively learn new things through experimentation (see Figures 14
and 15).

In the presurvey the students pretended to know what level they read on. The
postsurvey responses showed that the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program provided
students with the information they needed to know exactly what level they were reading
on. The students were able to acknowledge that they were not where they were supposed
to be. Having this knowledge helped them to successfully choose books they could
comprehend. The students’ attitude and motivation levels increased throughout the
mentoring program and they were no longer “posturing” which belies an increased selfconfidence as well as an understanding, with their future expectations that they will be
able to do something to change their reading competencies (see Figures 16 and 17).

I saw a positive change in student and librarian-mentors attitudes towards the
program and an overall improvement in mentor-student interaction. The students felt
empowered knowing they were learning new things and how to improve themselves. The
attitudes of the students who participated in the Weekly Readers Mentoring project also

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

102

changed. The response from the students at the initial information session in January had
been fairly skeptical. The students felt singled out and resented their participation in a
program that, from their perspective, suggested they were inferior to other students at
Middle School. The librarians attempted to convince the students that this was actually a
great opportunity and that they were really lucky to have been chosen, and the impact of
the program on their literacy skills and overall academic success would be considerably
higher. Despite the doubt, the students still proceeded in the taking the risk of
participating. Teens can learn and grow from taking risks.
As the program progressed, a remarkable transformation occurred and was clearly
visible when I observed and participated in the mentoring sessions. All students agreed
that the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program helped them become better leaders, improve
their behavior in class, made them more responsible and organized. Most students felt
they spent more time reading now that they have took part in the program. This study
showed quantitative evidence that that mentors had a beneficial impact upon mentees.
Qualitative Results
It was notable to examine the levels of responses to certain questions and how
they compared before and after the program. It was also something seen as instrumental
in doing something in their future. When the students were initially asked what does the
term literacy mean to you and your future? Their responses were direct and dealt mainly
with the capacity to read and write.
•

Literacy means to me to be able to read and write well.

•

It means “Read” and you are going to need it in everything.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS
•

103

Literacy means reading to me. To my future literacy is something I will need
to be a teacher.

•

Literacy to me means the ability to read. Reading is very important because if
I can’t read, I can’t go to college.

Responses on the postquestion, suggested a far more sophisticated understanding
of informational literacy. Instead of merely viewing reading and writing as instrumental,
they also connected to the quality of their lives. It was also connected to knowledge.
•

Information literacy is being able to read, write, use technology. It is
important because we all have to get information in life.

•

It means reading information online, in books and newspapers.

•

It means to have all of the information you need and you get it from reading.

•

Information literacy means research and reading. It’s important to know a lot
to be successful in the future.

•

To be able to read and research information.

•

I think it is important because having information literacy is a good resource
for research.

•

To inform yourself through literacy.

•

Knowing how to get information. It’s important to my future because I have to
know how to get the information I need for everything I do.

When asked why they struggled with reading and technology, the students
initially gave simplistic responses indicating that they had given little thought to their

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

104

difficulties. But perhaps it also lent to a sense of helplessness over being able to change
direction.
•

I struggle with time management.

•

When the words are worded differently.

•

Spelling and how to search for things on the internet.

•

Listening, getting distracted, and paying attention. Too much to pay attention
to online.

•

I struggle a lot with understanding what I read. Reading on the internet, there
are too many words on one screen.

•

Big words. Using Excel and PowerPoint.

•

Typing and reading big words and definitions.

When asked after the program what the students believed they could do to
increase their reading level, their responses suggested more reflection and problem
solving on their part. They understood they could do things to increase their reading
level. They also understood that they could take responsibility for change:
•

To read more and pay attention in class.

•

To understand the text and reading over the summer.

•

I think reading for 30 minutes could help increase my reading level

•

Reading every day or increasing reading and learning bigger words.

•

If I read more books that interest me, my level will get better.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS
•

105

Focusing more in my language arts classes will help my reading level get
better. I think if I focus harder and read harder or books that above my grade
level would increase my reading level.

•

Read more challenging books

•

Reading harder books

All of the students felt they had been able to overcome the challenge they faced
with reading and technology at the end of the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program. The
most common theme was they had a hard time comprehending the context of the text
given. Many of them struggled with words they did not know the meaning to and had a
hard time paying attention.
•

I worked with my librarian she helped me read books that are on my reading
level and to use the dictionary while I read to understand the words I don’t
know.

•

I do not understand what I read and I skip over important words that I don’t
know

•

I don’t read enough.

•

I try to read too fast without understanding what I’m reading

•

I say words wrong and don’t know the meaning.

•

I struggle with understanding what I read

•

Understanding big words

•

I don’t take my time and I read over some of the important words.

•

I get bored and stop paying attention

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

106

Mentoring can affect a young person and the adult mentor in many different ways.
At the beginning of the Program, I used increased test scores as a measure of success.
However, after reading the responses such as those above as well as replies to open ended
questions, I realized that the benefit of the program was for more than specific reading
skills. I found six themes that best characterized their responses to the questions. The
themes identified were: Self-esteem and safe space, Trusting relationships, Planning for
the future, Risk Taking, Leadership and Learning skills and strategies. It is obvious that
their self-esteem through reading had significantly improved. The students saw the value
in graduating, getting A, B’s, learning new things and reading better but obviously were
not doing so prior to this program. In many ways the students saw the value of being able
to do these things but were not working to achieve these goals. This is referred to as the
“hidden curriculum”- which speaks to the values, desires, norms and attitudes that
students adopt and hold by spending time in the educational setting. According to Beigi
(2014), “hidden curriculum is the most innovative concepts at school-related studies and
is regarded as a program that negatively or positively changes the attitudes related to
norms, interest and beliefs” (p. 130). The formal curriculum was information literacy, but
what the students really learned from the Weekly Readers Program was far greater what
they identified as being important and also indirectly reflected back on how they felt must
have felt being a “poor” student in the classroom. The themes were related to the
perspectives of the students and their responses. The experience and learning that the
students gained through the hidden curriculum were expressed in a combined body of
values and expectations.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

107

Theme 1: Self-Esteem and Safe Space
One area of change was self-esteem. Most students spoke to feeling more
confident in themselves and their reading from participating in the Weekly Readers
Program. They talked about being more confident about reading aloud and the ability to
choose literature they could understand. Students evidenced a confidence in themselves.
An increasing maturity and responsibility in the classrooms might also be attributed to
the Program. Students were taking more responsibility for their own actions and dealing
with the outcomes. They learned how to solve problems and persevere. Even when
something did not go their way they looked at things more positively. The students were
asked what they learned and what activities they most enjoyed. This interview question
touched on self-esteem and leadership development in the Weekly Readers Program,
their responses were:
My librarian helped me build myself up to be greater than I was. I felt smart like I
knew what I was doing. I learned how to be a better me in this program. I learned
how to be a leader and how to create programs and how to speak in front of other
people. My mentor taught me how to read better and how to work with other
people. I learned how to be a leader and learned different tricks for the EOG test. I
learned how to become more confident and to love myself. I also learned how to
read better and how to type. My librarian also taught me how to be more
confident and know that I am smart and can succeed. I learned to be confident
when reading in class and how to sound out words I don’t know to get
understanding of passages. Can you find any more quotes for this?

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

108

Students in the program also talked about the school environment and being able
to have a safe place to work together, to take risks, and to discuss personal concerns
without repercussions. They spoke about being comfortable with their librarian-mentor
and being in the media center. Students enjoyed being able to come into the media center
to discuss the issues they were having.
Theme 2: Trusting Relationships
The majority of students felt strongly having trusting relationships was important
to them. They really learned how important it was to communicate with their teachers
and other adults. The students commented on the importance of relationships:
The librarians in the Weekly Readers Program helped me get the individual
attention that I needed to make my grades better. I changed my relationships with
my teachers. I liked talking to my librarian about the problems I was having with
my friends and at home. She helped me solve a lot of my problems in a nice way.
I liked being mentored by the librarian. She made me feel safe and what we talked
about was always private. I told her a lot about what was happening with me at
home and why I could not think when I was in school. I felt stressed out and mad
all the time. She helped me calm down and told me that if I read books that I like I
can escape my problems and enter another place. I was comfortable talking to my
mentor about all of my problems. I even talked to her about my teachers and she
helps me work through them in private. We became friends and I trust the
librarian. I feel like she is my mother or big sister she makes sure that I am ok.
We work together in the media center every day. I am her media assistant and

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

109

mentee and I help her do anything she wants me to do, run errands, cut out things
for teachers or check-in and out books for students. We worked together on my
presentations and projects for the program. We created advisory activities that the
other students liked. We read together and she taught me how to get better scores
on the EOG.
Theme 3: Planning for the Future
Many of the students spoke about learning how to write a resume and how to
prepare for college. They definitely wanted to graduate from high school and to go on
into further education. They saw how the skills they learned could directly relate to their
future needs. Although volunteering helped them gain confidence and be a part of a
learning community, it also provided them an understanding of what talents they might
have for jobs or further schooling. Their answers evolved from the initial responses of
“hanging out” to babysitting, going to church, sports, etc. They appeared to connect their
current activities and accomplishments with their future possibilities.
I learned how to make a resume and how to research college. I also learned study
techniques and how to be a leader. My favorite activity was the resume writing
workshop and career planning. This taught me that the more I do in school and in
the community the more information I will have when applying for college and to
put on my resume. I learned how to be professional and how to create a resume. I
learned how to research colleges and information. I learned what will be required
in high school and how to get better grades on the EOG test. I liked the session

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

110

that taught us how to make long and short term goals to help us with our future.
We did all of the projects together and discussed college and high school.
Theme 4: Taking a Risk
For many students, the very act of seriously participating in the Reading Program
was seen as taking a risk. They were chided by friends and peers and warned away from
the participation. The fact that they not only continued but evidenced such
accomplishment as well total enjoyment in being there, all their friends wanted to join.
That initial risk and success allowed them to take other risks and to confront some issues
that needed to be addressed.
When I worked with my librarian she helped me read books that are on my
reading level and to use the dictionary while I read to understand the words I
don’t know and do not understand what I read and I skip over important words
that I don’t know. I don’t read enough. I try to read too fast without understanding
what I’m reading. I say words wrong and don’t know the meaning. I struggle with
understanding what I read. Understanding big words. I don’t take my time and I
read over some of the important words. I get bored and stop paying attention.
Theme 5: Leadership
For some they did not immediately identify their successes and their risk taking as
an act of leadership. However, their behaviors with friends and in the classroom
evidenced a shift in direction. They felt they had a sense of accomplishment and that their
classmates looked to them. The students were no longer the followers.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

111

My mentor taught me how to be a leader and how to help my friends be nicer in
school. We planned things and discussed leadership in and out of school. We
worked with the other teams and also talked about a lot of stuff. I helped as a
student advocate and took people around the school to show them what the
teachers were doing to help the students get involved with literacy. I think I am a
better leader because now I know important steps to being a leader. I am ready for
high school and think mentoring is something I would like to in high school. I am
also involved in Big Brothers Big Sisters and I talked to my mentor there about
what I was doing in school and he liked the idea. They always ask me to ask the
librarian if they can be a part of the program. At first they didn’t know why I was
doing the mentoring program. I didn’t know why I was doing it either but now
they all want to join. The media assistants wanted to know how I was chosen to
be in this program. They want to be in the program with us but everyone can’t be
involved. They use to make fun of me now they ask if they can work with the
librarians. I always tell them that they are not special so they can’t work with us
just because they teased me in the beginning. They didn’t care now they want to
join because we have so much fun and I am learning a lot. All of my friends want
to join us. They all want to help in the media center. They think we are nerdy for
working with librarians but all of them want to be in the program secretly. They
are jealous and want to work with us. A lot of my friends are working with us in
the media center already but they are not getting special help from the librarians. I
always tell them that my grades are getting better and they want to work with the

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

112

librarians too. They all want to work with the librarians. They ask me to ask her if
they can join. I tell them we have too many people in the program already and
maybe they could do it next year.
I liked the leadership session and learned how to speak properly. I learned how to
shelve books, check-in and out library material, how to laminate paper for
teachers, how to pass the EOG test, how to be a leader in my classes and in life. I
learned how to work better with other people and on teams. My mentor taught me
how to be a leader and how to help my friends be nicer in school.
Theme 6: Learning Skills and Strategies
The students learned the following skills: leadership, problem solving,
commitment, risk taking, fun, communication, and discipline to name a few. Many
students took on leadership roles. The students involved in the mentoring program were
also in the media elective class and learned and matured enough that to when they arrived
at the Center, they needed no direction, nor advice. They were able to run the library as if
the librarian was absent and did a good job in with little or no supervision.
I never do well on the EOG reading so the things the librarians taught helped me a
lot. I was not as scared to take the test. I liked learning about new technology. I
liked putting together projects for the other kids to do. I felt like a leader or
teacher because some of the kids didn’t know certain things. I asked a lot of
questions that I wanted to know about getting better grades and focusing on my
school work. I struggle in some subjects but always like to know different things
for high school and when I get to college. My librarian helped me understand how

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

113

to do many things to help me understand what I was struggling with. My mentor
taught me how to get better grades and how to select books that was interesting.
We used different technology and I showed her how to use her new phone. We
found books that were interesting; we worked on the EOG tests. I learned to use
technology better and how to work in groups and read out loud. I learned how to
work in the library and how to search the library catalog. Me and my librarian
used the laptop, Ipad, books and computers to do research. I had to write a letter
about STD’s and we searched for reliable sources and not Wikipedia. We used the
newsroom to make and edit videos. We also used digital cameras. It was difficult
to make changes with the technology but we learned. We used the computer and
books to research. The library catalog shows you where books are in the library
and I learned how to do it. I learned how to use an IPad and it is fun. I used the
computer, IPad and digital cameras and books to research and take pictures. We
had to do many projects in this program and to do it right we had to research. We
used everything in the media center for research. We were taught how to find the
books we need with the library online catalog. We used computers and Ipads to
research for our projects. We used the laptops, computers and Ipads to do research
in the program. We had to do presentations and look for books and we learned to
research better.
The Librarian Responses
Librarians who were the mentors also were surveyed in terms of change in
perception of their role as well as the value the librarian might hold for at risk students.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

114

Librarian presurvey. Before becoming involved in the program, librarians had
confidence in students’ ability, but some held reservations about their ability to work with
students who were not eager to learn information-literacy skills. When asked what they
should focus on in the Weekly Reader Mentoring program, their responses were quite
focused on their role in making sure the students appreciate reading and getting them to
become more proficient. They approached their role as an adjunct to the teacher and
focused far more on tasks than process or on relationships:
•

It is important to focus on phonics and making reading fun.

•

Reiterate what is being taught in English Class

•

Teach them the Librarian is in both school and community and can help with
everything

•

We need to focus on new technology and make the aware of the importance of
reading.

Librarian postsurvey. The librarian responses after the program completion,
demonstrated a remarkable increase in their own self esteem as well as the value of the
program to definitely teach more than information literacy. Responses amongst the
librarian-mentors reflected a consensus that engaging all of the students on a personal
level was the most rewarding mentoring technique, regardless of the activity. All of the
mentors felt that some of the activities needed to be done for longer periods of time and
some of the projects were not closely related enough to the actual problems being faced
by their at-risk students. A general consensus was apparent regarding the value of

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

115

discussing students’ individual issues. All mentors agreed that the program’s structure
facilitated a close relationship between mentors and mentees.
Two librarians believed that there was a great benefit of consistently working with
the same small group of students because it gave students the ability to trust and feel
comfortable opening up to an adult, their comments were:
Many people forget that at-risk is becoming the new majority as they are
sprinkled into every community. If we don’t learn how to work with and
accommodate these types of teens now, they will continue down the path of
destruction that is expected rather than rejected. Most of the teens come to the
library to escape at home situations and we have to be there for them not as a
counselor but as a confidant.
The key to being a successful librarian is, understanding the needs of the teens.
At-risk teens often lack the education and resources to enhance themselves. The
library needs to offer opportunities for these teens to socialize, meet with mentors,
and learn about opportunities that will benefit themselves and their families. A lot
of problems are going on in their environment that is blocking them from their
full potential. Librarians aren’t the answer in all situations but we are equipped
with the expertise to find valuable resources.
The issues students discussed during the one-on-one mentoring sessions were
either school-based or home-based. Discussing situations students faced at home
presented more of a challenge to mentors in terms of understanding their role as a
librarian-mentor and how personal to get with the students without being a counselor. In

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

116

the librarian group discussions there were constant indications that most of the librarians
felt discomfort when discussing the problems the students were having at home.
The Librarians favorably noted how committed students were
I noticed that my Mentees have made improvement with pronunciation, phonics
and really enjoyed working with me, the librarians and the other teens. Hilda is
very shy but as the month progressed she has come out of her shell and showed
her leadership abilities. D.J. is an example of a hard worker and has shown that he
can be a leader by modeling good work ethics.
We work With this population of a continual basis so it always amazing to see
how behavior, interest, and social interactions change as a result of the
programming, rules, and technology that exists in the space. These teens are real.
They have real problems, real personalities, and real stories.
Theme 1. The significance of the space for these students.
As librarians we don’t just celebrate diversity, we live it. We try to fulfill the
needs of at-risk teens whether the library serve as a place to get off the street or an
opportunity to create new knowledge through programming, technology, or
resources.
Librarians are in a good position to find out the teens real interests are and figure
out ways to create programming and collections that reflect the community in
which they work. In addition to this, mentoring program as well as library
programs related to helping the teens by focusing on their interests can serve as a
spring board to get them interested in programming which will in turn enhance

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

117

them is ways they don’t even know yet. By making real connection with the teens,
trust can be established and lead to relationships with the community and beyond
that expose young people to empowerment and the possibilities that exist in the
outside world. When transcribing the librarian reflections four themes emerged.
The four themes were: The significance of the space for these students, the
acknowledgement of how hard this group of students worked; the excitement
around seeing improvement in their skills and the acknowledgement of the value
of their role in shaping these kids’ education.
Theme 2. The acknowledgement of how hard this group of students worked.
Tamia is an outgoing student. In previous months we’ve seen considerable growth
in her; she has truly overcome some significant obstacles. In the month of March
she seems to have regressed a bit. Initially we had issues with her not being
involved or on time to her mentoring sessions and not letting me or her mentor
know ahead of time. Very quickly, Tamia realized that despite her relationship
with me and her previous months of participating in the program she would be
held to the same standards as the other teens. This realization did Tamia a lot of
good. She quickly understood that she was still very much accountable for her
time and choices. I had a conversation with Tamia about truly being responsible
for her choices and also being respectful of other people’s time. The conversation
seemed to resonate with her and she later asked me to cut her from the program
because she didn’t want to commit to more than she was able to give. I realized
that she was afraid of disappointing adults. I explained to her that I didn’t want to

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

118

see her go and that her participation is voluntary but it would benefit her in the
long run. I asked her what was important to her and she said reading better and
getting good grades. I advised her that this program will help her do so if she
could stay focused. Since my initial conversation with Tamia her behavior and
leadership has very much improved. She is more involved with the other teens
and helps with the preparation of sessions. She seemed to need a more active role
in the planning process of the program.
Theme 3. The excitement around seeing improvement in their skills.
This program has helped the student’s self-esteem and leadership abilities by
providing valuable encouragement and allowing him to explore a plethora of
possibilities he has benefited greatly from librarian-led mentoring. I’ve noticed
that DJ was a very quiet teen in the beginning of the program. He was not
particularly outgoing and as the weeks progressed, I was surprised to hear that he
chose, as a task during his time in his elective class, to make a video of what the
students do in the media center. For this task, he interviewed all of the students
asking them questions about their experience as media assistants. He did
successfully complete the video and enjoyed interactive with the other students.
AJ’s confidence has also improved. He started reading more so that he could tell
me about the next chapters in the books he chose to read. He was very excited and
came into the media center every morning to see me. He wrote at note and left it
on my desk toward the end of the mentoring program that said, “To Ms.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

119

McDowell, You are the best librarian in the world. I learned all of my skills from
you, so thanks a lot! This meant so much to me.
Hilda is a rising ninth grader. She is especially interested in working with other
teens who struggle with math and science. She has been a great participant in the
Weekly Readers Program, reading with and engaging other teens struggling with
books. Recently she got a chance to do a book talk in one of her classes,
representing the Weekly Readers Program, and said the experience really made
her feel like she was making a difference in the school.
Theme 4. the acknowledgement of the value of their role in shaping these kids’
education.
I believe that we have the greatest opportunity to affect change in the lives of atrisk teens and their families within our libraries. Ms. McDowell has done an
amazing job transforming our library media program. We have seen the
manifestation of her passion and work toward change right here in our Middle
School. A unified effort, proper planning, care and concern about the youth we
serve, will always make the positive difference. Our mission and vision is to
Connecting People and Building Community and do it with excellence. - Principal
Summary
This innovative Weekly Readers Mentoring program paired together teens from
low-income backgrounds and professional librarians as reading mentors to read books,
learn new technologies and discuss activities during weekly intervention meetings. The
young people and the librarians gave me feedback on each activity and session done

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

120

during the course of the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program. From their comments I was
able to reflect on what worked and what didn’t work for the teens and was able to make
immediate changes in the program. Data from the pre- and postsurveys and interview
questions were analyzed and transcribed. Each transcript was coded for themes. The
Weekly Readers Mentoring Program was a strategic effort to develop a school culture
wherein the students’ attitudes toward school and reading changed to one of positive
engagement and increased confidence.
The one-on-one mentoring relationships developed enabled both the students and
the librarians to build new skills, prepare for growth opportunities, build self-esteem and
self-confidence; and in doing so contributed to the fulfillment of the Weekly Readers
Program goals. Throughout my years as a librarian, I am constantly amazed at how many
intervention resources are available to at-risk students. Throughout this study, I dedicated
hours upon hours observing the students, sorting out field notes and planning mentoring
activities to help them understand the importance of reading and information literacy.
The librarians and I constantly modified the program to the students’ needs and the
school’s culture. In the first section of my findings there were pre- and postsurvey
responses and activities that students enjoyed and that were useful for teaching various
concepts. When asked how strongly they perceived the value of reading, all students were
clear in the postsurvey about the value of reading.
The qualitative results showed positive improvement in pre- and postsurvey
responses by students after the implementation of the Weekly Readers Mentoring
Program, as shown in Table 1. The quantitative analysis of the students’ postsurveys

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

121

(Appendix H) yielded positive results—the students indicated that their librarian assisted
them in various ways (see Appendix U). They agreed that the Weekly Readers Mentoring
Program helped them become better leaders, improve their behavior in class, made them
more responsible and organized. Most students felt they spent more time reading now
that they have took part in the program. This study showed quantitative evidence that that
mentors had a beneficial impact upon mentees. It shows mentorship is useful however, it
is important to understand that the time mentees spent with librarian-mentors was
relatively short (five months) meaning more positive changes might have been seen had
the pairing lasted longer. An important conclusion from this study is that mentoring is not
a quick fix to any given problem. Therefore, quality mentoring is advised. The librarianmentor spent an average of 1.5 hours a week with their student mentee, during a 5-month
relationship the time amounted to 31.5 hours of contact and although changes were seen
in all of the teens it is evident that more time was needed. Another thing I realized was
finding librarian-mentors that were able to devote time to the program was difficult,
however those who did participate were eager to make change happen which made for a
quality program.
The student comments and the librarian observations revealed a positive
relationship between the mentoring activity data and the information literacy strategy.
The responses were affirmative, and the students’ comments and librarian observations
also showed a positive effect on the students. In this action research project, there were
limitations to using data from different student datasets from different years. However,
the similarity of the students were that they were all involved in other intervention

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

122

programs, they were all learning new reading and technology skills with me, and they
were all in my library elective class. I chose to plan the Weekly Readers Mentoring for
the next year immediately because it helped the students so much that I could not deprive
future students from engaging in librarian-led mentoring. Although, I was unable to
continue my work at Middle School for the 2013–2014 school year, I was able to
encourage the new library media specialist, whom was one of the mentors from the
Weekly Readers Mentoring Program, to continue its implementation.
I hypothesized that this action research mentoring project would bridge the gap
between information literacy, reading skills and youth development. I hoped the students
would become more responsible for their behavior in school, their interest in reading
would increase and that they would realize that quality work would lead to a good results
and high self-esteem. I hoped that the students would realize that engaging in new
activities would help them to understand the value of reading and the library to gain
better grades on their End of the grade tests. I hoped that the results would show that
mentoring these at-risk youth affects them strongly in their understanding of life,
improved behavior toward school and the project’s obligations and the student’s
willingness to improve their reading. I also hoped that results would show that the
implementation of a more enhanced mentoring project other than what the school
currently offered would help change the atmosphere of this school. Findings revealed that
during a five-month cycle, a literacy-based school mentoring program led by librarians
provides a productive context for low-income, ethnically diverse, middle school youths to
explore, reflect upon, and ultimately improve their reading levels. Modest positive

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

123

responses about academic performance and social integration of participating students
suggested that, if given the chance to interact in mentoring programs led by professional
librarians they could yield positive results.
I concluded that the qualitative data showed that the Weekly Readers Mentoring
Program helped the students with reading, study skills, self-confidence, and technology,
career building and improved their overall grades. Perhaps they had never developed an
understanding of the relationship between their efforts and their results of their grades.
The students’ comments on the surveys and interviews provided useful insight to their
perspective.
The students seemed to gain a sense of leadership as evidenced by their comments
such as: “I learned that leadership means taking responsibility for your actions, your time,
planning and being able to follow instructions,” “I learned that a good leader speaks well
and sets good examples for other people,” “Leadership is when you teach people how to
act good and when you do good in your classes,” “Leadership is when you are doing
good for others. Leadership is when you lead people to success.”
I concluded that the use of the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program helped the
students earn better grades in their classes and, in the process, learn better reading and
information-literacy skills. I hope that the skills learned will transfer to other classes and
to the students’ future endeavors. I believed the students learned how to learn and felt
more confident as learners after this program was implemented. I think that any librarian
who is passionate about their work can put this strategy into practice, especially with
struggling learners. The time taken to plan and implementing the Weekly Readers

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

124

Mentoring Program is more than just handing out practice standardize reading tests and
assessments, but it is worth the time when the students are successful and feel successful.
I think this librarian-led mentoring program carries over to other subjects and other parts
of the students’ lives where they must put in time and effort to accomplish something.
Within most aspects of life, personal attitudes are often what drive us towards success or
failure. Reading is a subject that evokes very strong feelings that greatly influence a
student’s ability to learn and develop a deep conceptual understanding of literature.
The Weekly Readers Mentoring study mentioned above examined the relationship
between librarian-led mentoring to student academic achievement. A program developed
to measure how students’ attitudes towards reading, school and information literacy
affected their academic achievement. Because self-confidence is so directly related to
students’ academic performance and achievement, it is vital for librarians and teachers to
design literacy-based curriculum around building students’ self-esteem. We need to
arrange our libraries and schools in a way that allow students to experience success and
not failure when investigating reading and information. Identifying a student’s initial
attitude towards reading and school was essential to helping them break the readinganxiety they may have developed throughout their previous years of schooling. Their
attitudes about reading seem to be directly linked to their academic successes or failures
in the classroom and as a result, I examined student attitudes about reading and
technology along with their achievement and engagement levels in various learning
contexts. Since students’ attitudes are strong predictors of levels of engagement and

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

125

achievement, it was essential for me to explore their attitudes towards reading over time
and use my findings to drive my action research project.
It was notable to examine the levels of responses to certain questions and how
they compared before and after the program. It was also something seen as instrumental
in doing something in their future. When the students were initially asked what does the
term literacy mean to you and your future? Their responses were direct and dealt mainly
with the capacity to read and write.
•

Literacy means to me to be able to read and write well.

•

It means “Read” and you are going to need it in everything.

•

Literacy means reading to me. To my future literacy is something I will need
to be a teacher.

•

Literacy to me means the ability to read. Reading is very important because if
I can’t read, I can’t go to college.

Responses on the postquestion, suggested a far more sophisticated understanding
of informational literacy. Instead of merely viewing reading and writing as instrumental,
they also connected to the quality of their lives. It was also connected to knowledge.
•

Information literacy is being able to read, write, use technology. It is
important because we all have to get information in life.

•

It means reading information online, in books and newspapers.

•

It means to have all of the information you need and you get it from reading.

•

Information literacy means research and reading. It’s important to know a lot
to be successful in the future.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

126

•

To be able to read and research information.

•

I think it is important because having information literacy is a good resource
for research.

•

To inform yourself through literacy.

•

Knowing how to get information. It’s important to my future because I have to
know how to get the information I need for everything I do.

When asked why they struggled with reading and technology, the students
initially gave simplistic responses indicating that they had given little thought to their
difficulties. But perhaps it also lent to a sense of helplessness over being able to change
direction.
•

I struggle with time management.

•

When the words are worded differently.

•

Spelling and how to search for things on the internet.

•

Listening, getting distracted, and paying attention. Too much to pay attention
to online.

•

I struggle a lot with understanding what I read. Reading on the internet, there
are too many words on one screen.

•

Big words. Using Excel and PowerPoint.

•

Typing and reading big words and definitions.

When asked after the program what the students believed they could do to
increase their reading level, their responses suggested more reflection and problem

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

127

solving on their part. They understood they could do things to increase their reading
level. They also understood that they could take responsibility for change:
•

To read more and pay attention in class.

•

To understand the text and reading over the summer.

•

I think reading for 30 minutes could help increase my reading level

•

Reading every day or increasing reading and learning bigger words.

•

If I read more books that interest me, my level will get better.

•

Focusing more in my language arts classes will help my reading level get
better. I think if I focus harder and read harder or books that above my grade
level would increase my reading level.

•

Read more challenging books

•

Reading harder books

All of the students felt they had been able to overcome the challenge they faced
with reading and technology at the end of the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program. The
most common theme was they had a hard time comprehending the context of the text
given. Many of them struggled with words they did not know the meaning to and had a
hard time paying attention.
•

I worked with my librarian she helped me read books that are on my reading
level and to use the dictionary while I read to understand the words I don’t
know.

•

I do not understand what I read and I skip over important words that I don’t
know

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS
•

I don’t read enough.

•

I try to read too fast without understanding what I’m reading

•

I say words wrong and don’t know the meaning.

•

I struggle with understanding what I read

•

Understanding big words

•

I don’t take my time and I read over some of the important words.

•

I get bored and stop paying attention

128

Mentoring can affect a young person and the adult mentor in many different ways.
At the beginning of the Program, I used increased test scores as a measure of success.
However, after reading the responses such as those above as well as replies to open ended
questions, I realized that the benefit of the program was for more than specific reading
skills. I found six themes that best characterized their responses to the questions. The
themes identified were: Self-esteem and safe space, Trusting relationships, Planning for
the future, Risk Taking, Leadership and Learning skills and strategies. It is obvious that
their self-esteem through reading had significantly improved. The students saw the value
in graduating, getting A, B’s, learning new things and reading better but obviously were
not doing so prior to this program. In many ways the students saw the value of being able
to do these things but were not working to achieve these goals. This is referred to as the
“hidden curriculum”- which speaks to the values, desires, norms and attitudes that
students adopt and hold by spending time in the educational setting. According to Beigi
(2014), “hidden curriculum is the most innovative concepts at school-related studies and
is regarded as a program that negatively or positively changes the attitudes related to

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

129

norms, interest and beliefs” (p. 130). The formal curriculum was information literacy, but
what the students really learned from the Weekly Readers Program was far greater what
they identified as being important and also indirectly reflected back on how they felt must
have felt being a “poor” student in the classroom. The themes were related to the
perspectives of the students and their responses. The experience and learning that the
students gained through the hidden curriculum were expressed in a combined body of
values and expectations.
Theme 1: Self-Esteem and Safe Space
One area of change was self-esteem. Most students spoke to feeling more
confident in themselves and their reading from participating in the Weekly Readers
Program. They talked about being more confident about reading aloud and the ability to
choose literature they could understand. Students evidenced a confidence in themselves.
An increasing maturity and responsibility in the classrooms might also be attributed to
the Program. Students were taking more responsibility for their own actions and dealing
with the outcomes. They learned how to solve problems and persevere. Even when
something did not go their way they looked at things more positively. The students were
asked what they learned and what activities they most enjoyed. This interview question
touched on self-esteem and leadership development in the Weekly Readers Program,
their responses were:
My librarian helped me build myself up to be greater than I was. I felt smart like I
knew what I was doing. I learned how to be a better me in this program. I learned
how to be a leader and how to create programs and how to speak in front of other

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

130

people. My mentor taught me how to read better and how to work with other
people. I learned how to be a leader and learned different tricks for the EOG test. I
learned how to become more confident and to love myself. I also learned how to
read better and how to type. My librarian also taught me how to be more
confident and know that I am smart and can succeed. I learned to be confident
when reading in class and how to sound out words I don’t know to get
understanding of passages. Can you find any more quotes for this?
Students in the program also talked about the school environment and being able
to have a safe place to work together, to take risks, and to discuss personal concerns
without repercussions. They spoke about being comfortable with their librarian-mentor
and being in the media center. Students enjoyed being able to come into the media center
to discuss the issues they were having.
Theme 2: Trusting Relationships
The majority of students felt strongly having trusting relationships was important
to them. They really learned how important it was to communicate with their teachers
and other adults. The students commented on the importance of relationships:
The librarians in the Weekly Readers Program helped me get the individual
attention that I needed to make my grades better. I changed my relationships with
my teachers. I liked talking to my librarian about the problems I was having with
my friends and at home. She helped me solve a lot of my problems in a nice way.
I liked being mentored by the librarian. She made me feel safe and what we talked
about was always private. I told her a lot about what was happening with me at

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

131

home and why I could not think when I was in school. I felt stressed out and mad
all the time. She helped me calm down and told me that if I read books that I like I
can escape my problems and enter another place. I was comfortable talking to my
mentor about all of my problems. I even talked to her about my teachers and she
helps me work through them in private. We became friends and I trust the
librarian. I feel like she is my mother or big sister she makes sure that I am ok.
We work together in the media center every day. I am her media assistant and
mentee and I help her do anything she wants me to do, run errands, cut out things
for teachers or check-in and out books for students. We worked together on my
presentations and projects for the program. We created advisory activities that the
other students liked. We read together and she taught me how to get better scores
on the EOG.
Theme 3: Planning for the future
Many of the students spoke about learning how to write a resume and how to
prepare for college. They definitely wanted to graduate from high school and to go on
into further education. They saw how the skills they learned could directly relate to their
future needs. Although volunteering helped them gain confidence and be a part of a
learning community, it also provided them an understanding of what talents they might
have for jobs or further schooling. Their answers evolved from the initial responses of
“hanging out”, to babysitting, going to church, sports, etc. They appeared to connect their
current activities and accomplishments with their future possibilities.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

132

I learned how to make a resume and how to research college. I also learned study
techniques and how to be a leader. My favorite activity was the resume writing
workshop and career planning. This taught me that the more I do in school and in
the community the more information I will have when applying for college and to
put on my resume. I learned how to be professional and how to create a resume. I
learned how to research colleges and information. I learned what will be required
in high school and how to get better grades on the EOG test. I liked the session
that taught us how to make long and short term goals to help us with our future.
We did all of the projects together and discussed college and high school.
Theme 4: Taking a Risk
For many students, the very act of seriously participating in the Reading Program
was seen as taking a risk. They were chided by friends and peers and warned away from
the Participation. The fact that they not only continued but evidenced such
accomplishment as well total enjoyment in being there, all their friends wanted to join.
That initial risk and success allowed them to take other risks and to confront some issues
that needed to be addressed.
When I worked with my librarian she helped me read books that are on my
reading level and to use the dictionary while I read to understand the words I
don’t know and do not understand what I read and I skip over important words
that I don’t know. I don’t read enough. I try to read too fast without understanding
what I’m reading. I say words wrong and don’t know the meaning. I struggle with

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

133

understanding what I read. Understanding big words. I don’t take my time and I
read over some of the important words. I get bored and stop paying attention.
Theme 5: Leadership
For some they did not immediately identify their successes and their risk taking as
an act of leadership. However, their behaviors with friends and in the classroom
evidenced a shift in direction. They felt they had a sense of accomplishment and that their
classmates looked to them. They were no longer the followers.
My mentor taught me how to be a leader and how to help my friends be nicer in
school. We planned things and discussed leadership in and out of school. We
worked with the other teams and also talked about a lot of stuff. I helped as a
student advocate and took people around the school to show them what the
teachers were doing to help the students get involved with literacy. I think I am a
better leader because now I know important steps to being a leader. I am ready for
high school and think mentoring is something I would like to in high school. I am
also involved in Big Brothers Big Sisters and I talked to my mentor there about
what I was doing in school and he liked the idea. They always ask me to ask the
librarian if they can be a part of the program. At first they didn’t know why I was
doing the mentoring program. I didn’t know why I was doing it either but now
they all want to join. The media assistants wanted to know how I was chosen to
be in this program. They want to be in the program with us but everyone can’t be
involved. They use to make fun of me now they ask if they can work with the
librarians. I always tell them that they are not special so they can’t work with us

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

134

just because they teased me in the beginning. They didn’t care now they want to
join because we have so much fun and I am learning a lot. All of my friends want
to join us. They all want to help in the media center. They think we are nerdy for
working with librarians but all of them want to be in the program secretly. They
are jealous and want to work with us. A lot of my friends are working with us in
the media center already but they are not getting special help from the librarians. I
always tell them that my grades are getting better and they want to work with the
librarians too. They all want to work with the librarians. They ask me to ask her if
they can join. I tell them we have too many people in the program already and
maybe they could do it next year.
I liked the leadership session and learned how to speak properly. I learned how to
shelve books, check-in and out library material, how to laminate paper for
teachers, how to pass the EOG test, how to be a leader in my classes and in life. I
learned how to work better with other people and on teams. My mentor taught me
how to be a leader and how to help my friends be nicer in school.
Theme 6: Learning Skills and Strategies
The students learned the following skills: leadership, problem solving,
commitment, risk taking, fun, communication, and discipline to name a few. Many
students took on leadership roles. The students involved in the mentoring program were
also in the media elective class and learned and matured enough that to when they arrived
at the Center, they needed no direction, nor advice. They were able to run the library as if
the librarian was absent and did a good job in with little or no supervision.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

135

I never do well on the EOG reading so the things the librarians taught helped me a
lot. I was not as scared to take the test. I liked learning about new technology. I
liked putting together projects for the other kids to do. I felt like a leader or
teacher because some of the kids didn’t know certain things. I asked a lot of
questions that I wanted to know about getting better grades and focusing on my
school work. I struggle in some subjects but always like to know different things
for high school and when I get to college. My librarian helped me understand how
to do many things to help me understand what I was struggling with. My mentor
taught me how to get better grades and how to select books that was interesting.
We used different technology and I showed her how to use her new phone. We
found books that were interesting; we worked on the EOG tests. I learned to use
technology better and how to work in groups and read out loud. I learned how to
work in the library and how to search the library catalog. Me and my librarian
used the laptop, Ipad, books and computers to do research. I had to write a letter
about STD’s and we searched for reliable sources and not Wikipedia. We used the
newsroom to make and edit videos. We also used digital cameras. It was difficult
to make changes with the technology but we learned. We used the computer and
books to research. The library catalog shows you where books are in the library
and I learned how to do it. I learned how to use an IPad and it is fun. I used the
computer, IPad and digital cameras and books to research and take pictures. We
had to do many projects in this program and to do it right we had to research. We
used everything in the media center for research. We were taught how to find the

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

136

books we need with the library online catalog. We used computers and Ipads to
research for our projects. We used the laptops, computers and Ipads to do research
in the program. We had to do presentations and look for books and we learned to
research better.
The Librarian Responses
Librarians who were the mentors also were surveyed in terms of change in
perception of their role as well as the value the librarian might hold for at risk students.
Librarian presurvey. Before becoming involved in the program, librarians had
confidence in students’ ability, but some held reservations about their ability to work with
students who were not eager to learn information-literacy skills. When asked what they
should focus on in the Weekly Reader Mentoring program, their responses were quite
focused on their role in making sure the students appreciate reading and getting them to
become more proficient. They approached their role as an adjunct to the teacher and
focused far more on tasks than process or on relationships:
•

It is important to focus on phonics and making reading fun.

•

Reiterate what is being taught in English Class

•

Teach them the Librarian is in both school and community and can help with
everything

•

We need to focus on new technology and make the aware of the importance of
reading.

Librarian postsurvey. The librarian responses after the program completion,
demonstrated a remarkable increase in their own self esteem as well as the value of the

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

137

program to definitely teach more than information literacy. Responses amongst the
librarian-mentors reflected a consensus that engaging all of the students on a personal
level was the most rewarding mentoring technique, regardless of the activity. All of the
mentors felt that some of the activities needed to be done for longer periods of time and
some of the projects were not closely related enough to the actual problems being faced
by their at-risk students. A general consensus was apparent regarding the value of
discussing students’ individual issues. All mentors agreed that the program’s structure
facilitated a close relationship between mentors and mentees.
Two librarians believed that there was a great benefit of consistently working with
the same small group of students because it gave students the ability to trust and feel
comfortable opening up to an adult, their comments were:
Many people forget that at-risk is becoming the new majority as they are
sprinkled into every community. If we don’t learn how to work with and
accommodate these types of teens now, they will continue down the path of
destruction that is expected rather than rejected. Most of the teens come to the
library to escape at home situations and we have to be there for them not as a
counselor but as a confidant.
The key to being a successful librarian is, understanding the needs of the teens.
At-risk teens often lack the education and resources to enhance themselves. The
library needs to offer opportunities for these teens to socialize, meet with mentors,
and learn about opportunities that will benefit themselves and their families. A lot
of problems are going on in their environment that is blocking them from their

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

138

full potential. Librarians aren’t the answer in all situations but we are equipped
with the expertise to find valuable resources.
The issues students discussed during the one-on-one mentoring sessions were
either school-based or home-based. Discussing situations students faced at home
presented more of a challenge to mentors in terms of understanding their role as a
librarian-mentor and how personal to get with the students without being a counselor. In
the librarian group discussions there were constant indications that most of the librarians
felt discomfort when discussing the problems the students were having at home.
The Librarians favorably noted how committed students were:
I noticed that my mentees have made improvement with pronunciation, phonics
and really enjoyed working with me, the librarians and the other teens. Hilda is
very shy but as the month progressed she has come out of her shell and showed
her leadership abilities. D.J. is an example of a hard worker and has shown that he
can be a leader by modeling good work ethics.
We work with this population of a continual basis so it always amazing to see
how behavior, interest, and social interactions change as a result of the
programming, rules, and technology that exists in the space. These teens are real.
They have real problems, real personalities, and real stories.
Theme 1. The significance of the space for these students.
As librarians we don’t just celebrate diversity, we live it. We try to fulfill the
needs of at-risk teens whether the library serve as a place to get off the street or an

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

139

opportunity to create new knowledge through programming, technology, or
resources.
Librarians are in a good position to find out the teens real interests are and figure
out ways to create programming and collections that reflect the community in
which they work. In addition to this, mentoring program as well as library
programs related to helping the teens by focusing on their interests can serve as a
spring board to get them interested in programming which will in turn enhance
them is ways they don’t even know yet. By making real connection with the teens,
trust can be established and lead to relationships with the community and beyond
that expose young people to empowerment and the possibilities that exist in the
outside world. When transcribing the librarian reflections four themes emerged.
The four themes were: The significance of the space for these students, the
acknowledgement of how hard this group of students worked; the excitement
around seeing improvement in their skills and the acknowledgement of the value
of their role in shaping these kids’ education.
Theme 2. The acknowledgement of how hard this group of students worked.
Tamia is an outgoing student. In previous months we’ve seen considerable growth
in her; she has truly overcome some significant obstacles. In the month of March
she seems to have regressed a bit. Initially we had issues with her not being
involved or on time to her mentoring sessions and not letting me or her mentor
know ahead of time. Very quickly, Tamia realized that despite her relationship
with me and her previous months of participating in the program she would be

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

140

held to the same standards as the other teens. This realization did Tamia a lot of
good. She quickly understood that she was still very much accountable for her
time and choices. I had a conversation with Tamia about truly being responsible
for her choices and also being respectful of other people’s time. The conversation
seemed to resonate with her and she later asked me to cut her from the program
because she didn’t want to commit to more than she was able to give. I realized
that she was afraid of disappointing adults. I explained to her that I didn’t want to
see her go and that her participation is voluntary but it would benefit her in the
long run. I asked her what was important to her and she said reading better and
getting good grades. I advised her that this program will help her do so if she
could stay focused. Since my initial conversation with Tamia her behavior and
leadership has very much improved. She is more involved with the other teens
and helps with the preparation of sessions. She seemed to need a more active role
in the planning process of the program.
Theme 3. The excitement around seeing improvement in their skills.
This program has helped the student’s self-esteem and leadership abilities by
providing valuable encouragement and allowing him to explore a plethora of
possibilities he has benefited greatly from librarian-led mentoring. I’ve noticed
that DJ was a very quiet teen in the beginning of the program. He was not
particularly outgoing and as the weeks progressed, I was surprised to hear that he
chose, as a task during his time in his elective class, to make a video of what the
students do in the media center. For this task, he interviewed all of the students

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

141

asking them questions about their experience as media assistants. He did
successfully complete the video and enjoyed interactive with the other students.
AJ’s confidence has also improved. He started reading more so that he could tell
me about the next chapters in the books he chose to read. He was very excited and
came into the media center every morning to see me. He wrote at note and left it
on my desk toward the end of the mentoring program that said, “To Ms.
McDowell, You are the best librarian in the world. I learned all of my skills from
you, so thanks a lot! This meant so much to me.
Hilda is a rising ninth grader. She is especially interested in working with other
teens who struggle with math and science. She has been a great participant in the
Weekly Readers Program, reading with and engaging other teens struggling with
books. Recently she got a chance to do a book talk in one of her classes,
representing the Weekly Readers Program, and said the experience really made
her feel like she was making a difference in the school.
Theme 4. The acknowledgement of the value of their role in shaping these kids’
education.
I believe that we have the greatest opportunity to affect change in the lives of atrisk teens and their families within our libraries. Ms. McDowell has done an
amazing job transforming our library media program. We have seen the
manifestation of her passion and work toward change right here in our Middle
School. A unified effort, proper planning, care and concern about the youth we
serve, will always make the positive difference. Our mission and vision is to

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS
Connecting People and Building Community and do it with excellence. —

CHAPTER FIVE
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Discussion
Working with the students at a disadvantaged middle school was an amazing
experience for me and the other librarians who participated in the mentoring program.
We learned more about the interests and perceptions of at-risk teens and how to develop
effective programs that promote literacy, technology, and support. The results of a
librarian-led mentoring program showed improved achievement and retention rates,
positive engagement in community activities, enhanced skills and personal growth, and
improved academic advancement. The mentoring initiative described in this study was
called the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program and consisted of a series of interactive,
weekly mentoring workshops that aimed to inspire leadership, information literacy, and
reading among teens ages 12–14. The 5-week program was created for the 2012–2013
school year to meet the needs of 10 at-risk middle school students.
Librarians are incredible assets who often remain unknown to communities,
businesses, and schools. School librarians, often called media specialists, are employed to
support classroom endeavors but are not regularly utilized. Public librarians are also
accessible to provide similar services to their community; however, they tend to remain
underutilized as well. Providing extended learning opportunities and closing the
achievement gap among students were among the most demanding issues that the school

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

144

in this study faced. The Weekly Readers Mentoring Program was initially developed to
determine if using the services of professional librarians would increase struggling
students’ reading scores and technology and information-literacy skills. I decided to
develop the program to offer assistance to students who were not receiving enough oneon-one attention from their teachers.
All librarians wear many hats, from instructor to technology specialist to
collaborator to social worker. It is their responsibility to develop their leadership skills so
that other members of the learning community will recognize them as leaders. One rarely
will see librarians serve as mentors, but this is a very important role that they can fill.
Many librarians may not realize that they are mentoring, but they often provide
mentorship by engaging in simple conversation, locating valuable resources for students,
or offering them life coaching. The Weekly Readers Mentoring Program was designed to
create a culture of reading for teens by providing inspiring reading activities to an
underfunded middle school in North Carolina. It was my desire not only to give library
lessons on reading and technology but also to become an inspiration for information
literacy. The more the program developed, the more I saw that I was truly having an
impact, not only on the at-risk teens in the program but also on all students in the school.
The school came a long way in a short period of time.
When I developed this program, I had no idea what to expect from the students,
librarians, teachers, or staff. As a public librarian, I wasn’t sure what I would learn from
mentoring these youth. I was unaware of what went on inside a school building and was
unsure if librarians could actually help increase the youth’s reading levels or academic

interests. I did know that I wanted the struggling youth to benefit from the librarian-led
mentoring experience. I hoped that, by gaining the librarians’ wisdom, encouragement,
and coaching, the youth would increase their literacy and technological skills. I wanted
the teachers and librarians to deepen their working relationships by collaborating on
projects that would address the needs of the students.
The Weekly Readers Mentoring Program and the knowledge gained from it
ultimately empowered everyone at the school. In providing an enhanced mentoring
program to teens who were labeled at risk, it was important to think of organizational
culture and authentic, charismatic, and transformational leadership. Avolio and Gardner
(2005) and Barbuto Jr. (2005, p. 28) argued that authentic leadership could incorporate
transformational, charismatic, servant, spiritual, or other forms of positive leadership.
Charisma is believed to be the fundamental factor in the transformational process and is
described as the leader’s ability to generate great symbolic power. Jackson and Parry
(2011) pointed out that
leaders are judged according to the degree to which they are able to provide
environments in which followers get a strong sense of belonging and cohesion or
are able to encourage their followers to think and express themselves and fulfill
their dream. (pp. 78–79)
It was important that the culture and leadership of Middle School was strong, in sync, and
able to adjust to create an environment that would fulfill the overall goal of student
success.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

If the culture of any organization that serves at-risk teens—school or otherwise—
has a negative disposition, the culture needs to be changed to support a vision that meets
the needs of those teens. Such changes are needed to shift the culture to a positive one
without destroying the fundamental motivation of all people involved. Jackson and Parry
(2011) noted that
in societies in which people are seen fundamentally good, leaders will rely more
on building trust and being fair and influencing their followers. In societies where
people are considered fundamentally flawed, leaders seek to closely monitor and
directly control their followers. (p. 81)
This was the case at Middle School, which had both good and bad students and good and
bad teachers. The students who were considered to be good were those with whom
teachers, parents, and staff normally tried to build meaningful relationships to help them
follow a path to success. However, faculty and administrators perceived the bad (at-risk)
students as flawed and closely monitored and controlled them instead of mentoring them.
The rules and regulations were made for the at-risk students; the opportunities were
provided for the “good” students. Students who were perceived to be flawed received
negative attention and felt institutionalized and restricted. The immediate priority of the
Weekly Readers Mentoring Program focused on giving the “flawed” teens the hope and
encouragement to reach their full potential. I developed this program around the needs of
these teens and gave librarian leaders a chance to provide an environment for the students
that allowed them to fully express themselves, to collaborate with each other, and to

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

147

demonstrate their expertise. As I discuss below, the librarians also mirrored the students’
self-esteem as they worked with them to develop the students’ expertise.
Authentic Leadership
As an authentic leader, it was essential to demonstrate good intentions to inspire
the teens to participate in a program that was geared to assist them. I stressed to the
librarians that the students easily recognize when people are being insincere. It was
critical that everyone was transparent in their position that this program had the students’
best interests in mind. At the start of the program, we had to show the youth our true
intentions, which were to genuinely help them. Walumbwa et al. (2005) suggested that a
successful authentic leader is able to inﬂuence followers by the cognitive and emotional
reactions of followers. The authors noted that the “journey to authentic leadership will
take you through many peaks and valleys as you encounter the world’s trails, rewards,
and seductions” (p. 282). I believe that the driving factor of this action-research project
was understanding the program’s process rather than constantly focusing on its outcomes.
For the participating librarians, being an authentic leader took dedication and courage.
Most had never worked closely with at-risk youth and had little belief that they could
make a difference. These librarians increased their professional development and growth
(George & Sims, 2007).
Personal Journey
Before I explain how I encouraged the students to participate in the Weekly
Readers Mentoring Program, it is important that I speak about my personal journey. In

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

148

Bill George’s book, True North, the first chapter begins with a quote from John Donahoe,
president of eBay:
Leadership is a journey, not a destination.
It is a marathon, not a sprint.
It is a process, not an outcome.
I explained to the students why they were important to us and that we were there to
support them. I told them about my own experience of being a struggling teen to help
them understand why this project was important to me. This allowed them to become
familiar with my background and to confirm my motive for creating the librarian-led
mentoring program. George and Sims (2007, p. 68) advised that, when you know
yourself, you find the passion that motivates you and the purpose of your leadership.
Speaking about your personal journey humanizes you in an empathic way, and because
teens are usually reluctant to talk openly with or take advice from adults, it is important
that we connect with them on a level that does not include dictatorship. George and Sims
(2007) asked a group of authentic leaders what motivated them to lead, and many of them
agreed that their motivation came from “understanding their own stories, their own
journeys to getting to the desired results” (p. 8). The stories of authentic leaders derived
from their life experiences and their ability to acknowledge the journey that got them to
their leadership positions.
As a former “at-risk” teen, I am fully aware that all at-risk teens have unique
perspectives and challenges; therefore, it is beneficial for librarians to understand their

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

149

needs and treat them as individuals rather than just an unfortunate label. Bartram and
Caismir (2007) argued that,
if followers believe the leader is not genuinely concerned about their welfare,
lacks integrity, or is incompetent, they will be unlikely to trust the leader and
consequently they will be dissatisfied with the leader and not motivated to
cooperate fully with the leader thereby adversely affecting their performance.
(p. 5)
Trust is very important when providing services for at-risk youth; their trust is something
that you earn by being consistent with your actions. When teens know that they can rely
on you without getting hurt or disappointed, they are more likely to trust and follow your
lead. As a result, I made trust an important, cutting-edge component of the Weekly
Readers Mentoring program, and when evaluating the impacts that charismatic and
transformational leadership had on the struggling teens, the other librarians and I had to
ensure that we were seen as being authentic (Bass, 2008; Walumbwa et al. 2005). When
the students perceived their leader to be trustworthy, genuine, and reliable, they took a
risk and became receptive to the program’s objective. Gardner and Avolio (1998),
Cooper et al. (2005), and Walumbwa et al. (2005) agreed that, if followers do not think a
leader displays a positive attitude or self-awareness or tries to recommend positive
psychological states, the leader will not be perceived as authentic. Gardner and Avolio
also noted that, to be perceived as authentic, leaders have to demonstrate extraordinary
behaviors that prove that they are “trustworthy, morally worthy or responsible, and
possess a high degree of integrity” (p. 38).

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

150

When partnering with the outside librarian network, which included public and
school librarians, I had to maintain open dialogue with them to ensure that the goals of
the library and the mentoring program were aligned with the overall mission and vision
of the school. Librarians are often compartmentalized by the institutions where they
work. The public librarian avoids the school librarian. The school librarian remains
within the confines of the schools. As both a public and school librarian, I understood
both worlds and their insecurities. Bridging the two professional worlds not only
increases the librarian’s perspective but also provides far more opportunities and access
for at-risk teens in the program. In addition, it was critical to maintain open lines of
communication with the teens involved in the program to understand what aspects were
working or not working for them. We had to monitor the needs of the teens as well as
those of the teachers and faculty and administration.
Although no set of standard rules will help librarians meet all the needs of at-risk
teens, the librarians offered teens opportunities for growth through a well-planned,
school-based mentoring program that allowed students to expand their knowledge beyond
their immediate surroundings and their current perception of themselves. This approach
allowed the librarians to foster independent thought and actions and help with behavioral
and reading deficiencies through effective, outcome-based programming. School
librarians are now focusing on their role as leader instead of the need to collect data on
library usage and students’ outcomes in information literacy and other areas (Geitgey &
Tepe, 2007). The adolescents were afraid to speak up as individuals and often deferred to
the strongest person in their group. Therefore, the library-based mentoring program

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

151

required the youth to articulate their thoughts and opinions. The expectation for selfarticulation was challenging for teens who lacked self-confidence and proved to be very
helpful in building their self-esteem and leadership skills. We taught the students that
they could count on us to advocate for them but that it was their duty to speak up for
themselves and identify their needs. The librarians and the students depended on one
another to make changes in their reading and technology abilities and realized that they
each stimulated and reinforced each other’s behavior. The librarians initiated, questioned,
and proposed solutions for the struggling youth, and the teens often complied. Leadership
and followership are mutual activities of influence and counterinfluence. Leaders and
followers both give and receive benefits (Bass, Bass, & Bass, 2008 p. 431).
Authentic leaders are usually “deeply aware of how they think and behave and are
perceived by others as being aware of their own and others’ values/moral perspectives,
knowledge, and strengths; (and are) aware of the context in which they operate”
(Walumbwa et al., 2005, p. 321). The latter suggests that authentic leadership can be
examined from the perspective of a leader’s behavior as well as from the follower’s
attributions of these behaviors. The American Association of School Librarians (2009)
suggested, “school library programs are built by professionals who model leadership and
best practices for the school community” (p. 45). School librarians should not perceive
themselves just as partners and collaborators but also as models, motivators, and
examples for all educators in teaching and learning, particularly in the areas of reading,
technology, and curriculum collaboration (Everhart, 2007). Walumbwa et al. (2005, p.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

152

283) claimed that the major factor of a leader is authenticity, which should be based upon
the locus of the leader’s motivation.
It was necessary to display authentic, transformational, collaborative, and
charismatic leadership in Middle School; such leadership was the fundamental goal of the
Weekly Readers Mentoring Program. To demonstrate true transformational leadership,
the librarian leader had to be as seen as authentic in the eyes of the students they served.
After a foundation was established for the Weekly Readers Mentoring program, the
librarians felt authentic because they were all committed to transforming the school’s
culture. The foundation for the librarian leader’s behavior was established through proper
orientation and self-reflection, and the followers’ (teens’) reactions established the
leaders by labeling them as a “true transformational leaders” (p. 284). When the students
were pessimistic, the librarians were able to transform their thinking into more optimistic
viewpoints through encouragement, positive modeling, and trainings. Walumbwa et al.
(2005) pointed out that authentic leaders are able to develop positive emotions within
their followers by avoiding negative emotions and reinforcing positive behaviors.
I truly believe that the outcomes of this action-research study made a substantial
impact on the entire Middle School community. However, this research was not just
about the outcome—it was about the process, the journey to getting 10 at-risk teens to
enjoy and learn through the leadership initiatives of 10 professional librarians. Both
groups took their leadership roles seriously while participating in the Weekly Readers
Mentoring Program. Yukl (1999) suggested that a follower’s commitment to the leader’s
vision depends on the leader’s capacity for building trust with the followers. The

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

153

librarians felt a great deal of responsibility to the students they mentored. Their
leadership was not only about their ability to participate in the implementation of a strong
mentoring program; it was also about the process of developing the teens into leaders and
the differences they made in the lives of these struggling youth.
Transformational and Charismatic Leadership
Yukl (1999, p. 33) argued that transformational and charismatic leadership is
influential in the leadership field, as the traits of this kind of leadership focus on emotions
and values that are necessary to understand how a leader is able to influence followers to
make self-sacrifices, to take risks, to commit to meeting goals, and to achieve more than
they initially believed was possible. In 21st-century learning environments, librarians are
required to intensify collaboration with communities, businesses, teachers, and parents.
The behavioral disparities and attitudes that the students had toward school immediately
changed while participating in the program. Their attendance improved because they
were very excited to come to the school’s media center to interact with the librarians.
Although their reading scores increased minimally, their enthusiasm for reading and
school skyrocketed. In addition, the successes of the Weekly Readers Mentoring Project
made it a model for the other mentoring programs at Middle School and can be used by
other schools looking to address similar issues. This project proved to be a replicable
model for closing the literacy and academic-achievement gaps in low-performing
schools. In this sense, transformational leadership encouraged the student followers to
join the librarian leaders in achieving the original mission of the program—to change the

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

154

culture of the school. The voices of the students themselves provided librarians with the
best description of the quality of the program.
According to Jackson and Parry (2011), transformational leadership can be
defined as “a transformation in the attitudes and motivations, and consequently
behaviors, of followers” (p. 31). Keeping pace with a challenging world and preparing
youth for the workforce and progressive adulthood can be challenging. In their local
teaching efforts, librarians contribute to helping teens become successful citizens in a
global world. Transformational leadership occurs when leaders give rewards in exchange
for specific behaviors by their followers. The rewards for the at-risk youth in this study
were the possibility of a brighter future and greater academic success; developmental
exchange involves a transformation of the attitudes, motivations, and behaviors of both
leaders and followers (Jackson & Parry, 2011). The librarians achieved this by engaging
the teens in useful mentoring activities. We celebrated their accomplishments and helped
them learn from their mistakes. For example, we had Media Assistant Appreciation Day,
which included a celebration for the student mentees and media assistance. I asked all
staff to donate goodies to give out to the students who had worked so hard to help them
with their daily tasks. This was a celebration of their accomplishments and was important
to the students because it made them feel a sense of ownership in the school as well as to
value their role as a useful individual. They felt appreciated, and the acknowledgement
helped boost their self-confidence and overall trust in school personnel.
Transformational leadership allows one to have a clear understanding of what an
organization’s or an individual’s current state is, to be able to clearly express an action

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

155

plan for the future, and to develop strategies to bring that vision to fruition.
Acknowledging my leadership style helped me determine if I would be able to motivate
the followers (the youth) by showing them what their rewards would be—improved
reading and technology abilities, better attitudes toward school, and enhanced leadership
skills. Transactional and transformational leadership go hand in hand. The teachers who
delivered the curriculum needed progressive leaders to collaborate with in helping the
youth reach their full potential. Leadership is an understanding of the thoughts and
actions of leaders and inquires into the improvement of the performance and motivation
of teens.
According to Bernard Bass (1990), transformational leadership is a form of
leadership that occurs when leaders
broaden and elevate the interests of their employees, when they generate
awareness and acceptance of the purposes and the mission of the group, and when
they stir their employees to look beyond their own self-interest for the good of the
group. (p. 21)
The librarians became vested in Middle School and wanted to extend what they had
learned, as well as the mentoring model, to other schools in their communities. They
were eager to tell other organizations about this program and to encourage them to use
librarians to increase the reading and literacy effectiveness of their organizations.
A strong mentoring program that works to enforce literacy outside the classroom
can help turn failure into success. Many at-risk teens struggle academically and are
resigned to failure. Placing them in programs that allow them to be successful is

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

156

important. However, they can also learn and grow from failure. The library media
specialist, with the help of other librarian-mentors, can encourage disadvantaged teens
not to fear failure and to explore new concepts and ideas. Librarians can also help teens
focus on their future. Typically, at-risk teens lack parental involvement or any kind of
adult support, which can result in their lacking guidance regarding the future. Librarians
and mentors can help them look past their present circumstances and concentrate on longterm goals. Many of the young individuals in this study had not considered what to do
with their lives, and presenting options through mentoring helped them set future goals
and find a positive direction. Newell (2007) suggested that a growing trend in leadership
is to inspire followership, and, to this end, coaching and mentoring leaders to transform
their followers into good followers are essential in healthy organizations. Leaders must
participate actively in forming good follower relationships if they want to benefit from
the leader–follower exchange, which promotes the idea of sharing goals consistent with
wide visions and values.
Collaborative Leadership
Leadership is complex and is often defined by followers being led and leaders
leading. Collaboration was important throughout the entire process of the program.
Because all the librarians had leadership abilities, the question of what happens when
leadership teams require inspiration and motivation became relevant. The librarians had
to build new collaborations to connect everyone to the available resources. Collaboration
that focused on the cooperative work of librarians, administrators, parents, and teachers
was fairly new to Middle School. Librarians increased their involvement in the school by

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

157

being available and useful. The librarians were involved in the decision-making process
within the media center, as it was an important step toward influence and leadership. The
students were able to move out of the school and into the communities through their
relationships with the librarians. They were able to volunteer at public libraries and
frequently visited them during the summer and after school. Everhart (2007, p. 55) noted
that librarian leaders do not distinguish themselves from the rest of the faculty but
consider themselves an integral part of the team, and often they mentor new teachers.
Relationship development through a collaborative process was needed to ascertain that
personal connections with others were in place for the librarians and for students to
willingly participate in the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program.
Hackman and Wageman (2010) defined leadership teams as groups of leaders
with different responsibilities that are brought together to collectively ensure that
necessary functions are accomplished. Developing a librarian leadership team created a
structure that established the direction of the mentoring program, which was critical to
the organization of the activities. Understanding the team as a social system and
developing skills in the art of structuring were two competencies that helped the
leadership team be effective. Teams of leaders often have diverse backgrounds,
strategies, perspectives, and skill sets, which can complicate tasks and cause leadership
teams to become dysfunctional. The leaders shared goals and different responsibilities,
which should make them operate smoothly. However, it has been observed that shared
leadership is more effective when the team develops complex tasks related to knowledge

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

158

creation (e.g. research and development, consultancy, and decision making; Alcover, Gil,
Rico, & Sanchez-Manzanares, 2011, p. 43).
Hackman and Wageman’s (2010, p. 476) research showed that teams of leaders
routinely underperform. Some teams are inherently poor at collaborating and fulfilling
key leadership functions. However, the authors identified five functions that can be
performed to help leadership teams operate: creating a bounded entity that is defined by a
clear, shared purpose; crafting an agenda so that the work of the team is always focused
on meaningful, interdependent activities; shaping members in their roles; articulating
explicit norms that promote attention to team strategies that minimize political dynamics;
and coaching the team (Hackman & Wageman, 2010, p. 496–499). I noticed that teachers
had little time to collaborate with me and usually avoided me because they knew I would
ask when they were going to bring their classes to the media center or seek assistance
promoting literacy. Everhart (2007, p. 56) indicated that an effective school librarian
must stay abreast of all education reforms and trends, not just in technology, and
communicate them to teachers and administrators.
I developed a strong relationship with the principal, and because of this, she
constantly encouraged the teachers to bring their classes into the media center. I opened
the media center for meetings, parent–teacher conferences, and other activities that got
parents, teachers, and students involved in and excited about what was happening in the
media center. This allowed me to share with parents what the students were doing, to
inform them of the new literature that we received, and to introduce them to a space
where their children spent a lot of time. In Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

159

Library Media Programs, the American Association of School Librarians (2009) noted
that schools must
move toward a more connected, collaborative form of leadership. School
librarians must lead this revolution to make room for new models of teaching,
learning, and organization to prepare learners for this collaborative environment
and address the needs of a generation that has grown up participating, not just
being broadcast to. (p. 46)
According to Alcover et al. (2011), the “leadership role is divided into distinct
responsibilities exercised by different people at the same time; lateral influence is
produced among group members or there is a leadership role with little differentiation”
(p. 42). George and Sims (2007) noted that leaders do not succeed on their own. They
attested that the loneliness of leadership has been well documented but has not been
remedied because many people have insecurities that they do not like to discuss.
Authentic leaders build support teams that counsel them in times of uncertainty and
celebrate with them in times of success. Strong support teams provide affirmation,
advice, perspective, calls for course corrections when needed, and above all, love
(George & Sims, 2007, p. 118). The great librarian leaders I worked with in this program
believed that it was important to fill their leadership team with talented people and were
not afraid to acknowledge what they did not know. George and Sims (2007) indicated
that members of a team can help you stay focused on your journey, keep you grounded in
reality, and provide the support you need as you venture on your leadership journey (p.
117). They were not threatened by engaging people who were more talented than them

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

160

and acknowledged their shortfalls; this was a very important aspect when analyzing
leadership in this research. Too often, leaders take credit for success and pass along
blame following a failure, which affects the way a team performs. In my opinion, when
leaders can’t acknowledge their weaknesses through self-analysis, they are not able to
lead a successful team because the team will not trust the leader’s ability.
Good communication skills, self-awareness, understanding of others, sensitivity,
problem-solving and decision-making skills, and a positive attitude are important
attributes when evaluating leadership. Jackson and Parry (2011) called this “sensemaking,” that is, a process in which people understand the vision and are not just
following a plan. Such a process can be achieved through face-to-face, personal contact,
not from distant, impersonal contact; it comes from delegation, not control. Sense-making
enabled the librarians to act and not just react; it also enabled them to take risks and not
avoid risk, as well as to initiate change in the teens and not just to accommodate it. As
leaders, the librarians needed to possess a special dedication to working with teens in
ways that affirmed their principles and visions.
A consistent and nurturing relationship with a librarian-mentor fosters a teen’s
ability to learn. The purposes of the relationship between a librarian-mentor and an at-risk
teen mentee were to provide a supportive adult role model who would encourage student
reading and technology ability; to help improve academic achievement and social and
emotional development; to stimulate career motivation; to expand student life
experiences; to redirect students from at-risk behaviors; and to foster improved selfesteem. When making decisions, people tend to focus on their own beliefs without

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

161

considering the effects it may cause others. In a safe and ethical environment, such
decisions are made in the best interests of individuals on a daily basis (Stagich, 2000, p.
124).
George and Sims (2007, pp. 122, 125) explained that the best mentors put the
interests of those they are mentoring above their own. These relations can grow into
strong personal friendships. The authors mentioned that mentors are not necessarily
people who make you feel good about yourself or tell you that you can do anything you
want to do—they sometimes provide tough love by being critical as a means of teaching.
Educators who are building a professional learning community recognize that they must
work together to achieve their collective purpose of learning for all. Therefore, they
create structures to promote a collaborative culture (Dufour, 2004). To create
professional learning communities, librarians must find time to collaborate and seek out
their own professional development opportunities and to advocate for students;
additionally, they must be able to initiate leadership so that they can bring the knowledge
back to their colleagues.
Although there were many challenges in the implementation of the Weekly
Readers Mentoring Program, the librarians sustained their morals, great work ethic, and
drive, which helped them continue on the journey to ensuring that students received a
valuable mentoring experience. According to Stagich (2000, p. 122), ethics are built upon
systems of universal values, which are essential in human nature. Because humans are
moral creatures by nature, we have competitive urges and are still fundamentally

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

162

adaptive, synergistic beings who have the fundamental choice to rise above our
aggression to build safe environments conducive to learning and human development.
Collaboration with the parents of the students involved in the Weekly Readers
Program was a necessary component for the program’s success. It was important that the
parents were kept up to date on the students’ progress. Engaging the families in the
mentoring program as partners was something that posed a challenge in the beginning. In
most Title I schools that have large populations of economically disadvantaged students,
their parents lacked transportation and financial stability and were usually working.
These parents did not always view schools as a favorable place to visit, often because of
their own educational experiences. By requesting all parent–teacher conferences to be
held in the media center, I provided opportunities for collaboration among parents,
teachers, and the librarian; I also provided the parents with a neutral place to meet.
Youth Leadership Development
Relationships developed between leaders and followers must be open to dialogue
regarding the vision of the organization. Shared vision between librarians and students
developed a culture of trust and led to active engagement by the students. The librarians
educated the students to be exemplary followers by providing them with a sense of
confidence that they hold the knowledge to lead themselves as active, engaged members
of the school environment.
The Weekly Readers Mentoring Program included youth leadership development,
which prepared the youth to work in partnership with adults. They developed and
enhanced their leadership skills to become successful students academically and socially.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

163

Leadership development prepared the youth to manage time, work as a team, set goals,
start conversations, facilitate meetings, and make effective presentations. Leadership
development was a key component in the program, in addition to promoting positive
learning of life skills.
To successfully develop leadership in youth, it was imperative to examine how
the librarian’s self-concept and identity were formed, changed, and able to influence
behavior (Swann, Chang-Schneider, & Larsen Mcclarty, 2007). This raises a key
question: What constitutes leaders’ working self-concept and identity with respect to how
they go about influencing others (Swann et al., 2007)? Two questions that seemed
relevant to my research were
1. Does an authentic leader have a different working self-concept than someone
who is described by followers as transformational or transactional?
2. Also, how do these differences develop in the leader over time?
Innovation and constant improvement in self-worth required great effort from the at-risk
teens, who were constantly confronted with new technologies, cultural changes, and
intense peer competition.
Transformational and transactional leadership theories show that leaders influence
follower behavior through substantial follower involvement, which could in turn develop
leaders. With at-risk teens, often the issue is how they might lead. Often leadership is
born out of insecurity and acting out rather than out of positive motivations. Therefore, I
looked within myself to find new ways to influence teens who are considered at risk to
help them reach a confidence level that would increase their developmental assets. This

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

164

was my motivation to discover how librarians could contribute to the developmental
processes of an adolescent through strengthening followership that created future leaders.
Another program goal was to develop a partnership with teens who were personally
committed to themselves and wanted to reach success.
Avolio et al. (2009, p. 426) argued that, when leaders are motivated to learn at the
beginning and have higher motivation to lead, they will more likely embrace events that
stimulate them to think about their own development as an opportunity to improve their
leadership effectiveness. But at-risk teens are not necessarily ready to be leaders with the
vision that we hope they can develop. The concept of coproduction appeared to be the
most viable approach to developing leadership skills. In the coproduction of leadership,
at-risk youth would no longer be viewed as subjects or clients but as citizens with
important contributions to make in their libraries and hopefully to the outside community.
Coproduction could create interventions that would enable the teens to become genuine
resources, contributors, and change agents. It was first necessary for me to change; then, I
was able to encourage the teens to follow me and to develop a partnership with them in
which they were personally committed to themselves and wanted to reach success.
This suggests that students’ achievement improves when their level of confidence
increases, which is certainly a goal for schools, libraries, and other youth-serving
organizations. Given the rising number of universities and colleges that are requiring
young people to have leadership skills or to become involved in service learning, it is
critical to understand that librarians hold unique positions for fostering a coproductive
relationship. They do not need to be viewed as authority figures and do not have the

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

165

academic responsibilities of faculty and administrators. In Middle School, librarians were
the optimal individuals for facilitating the process of learning and leadership
development.
Good and Bad Characteristics of Librarian Mentorship
The exchanges between the librarian and the students were bidirectional.
Leadership related to the conduct of leaders and followers had both positive and negative
influences on the practice of leadership. These mutual influences occurred less because of
the level of a particular leadership theory and more because of the views of the leaders.
The student’s effect on the librarian-mentor depended solely on the librarian’s style of
engagement. A supportive and sensitive leader engages with the follower and enhances
the follower’s satisfaction and performance (Bass et al., 2008, p. 408).
A motivated, personable leader will produce followers who are the same. The
leader as a hero is a concept that causes controversy in the world of leadership. It robs
followers of self-responsibility. Everyone can lead; the fact is, not everyone wants the
responsibility of thinking and doing for everyone else. Bass et al. (2008) suggested that,
as long as there are leaders, there will be followers:
Leaders cannot accomplish what they do without followers. The librarian-leaders
would not have existed without students; nor could the at-risk teen followers exist
without leaders. Moreover, leaders and followers exchange roles over time and in
different settings. Many of the librarians were leaders and followers at the same
time. But the interaction between the leader and the follower is not symmetrical.
(p. 408)

According to Bartram and Casimir (2007), enacting leadership behaviors does not
guarantee that followers will be satisfied or that they will be motivated to perform.
Followers need to trust the leader to feel positively about the leader and to exert extra
effort to perform effectively.
According to Bass (2008), the leader and the follower depend on each other
because each stimulates and reinforces the other’s behavior. However, what happens if
the leader uses destructive tactics that adversely affect the follower’s performance?
Padilla, Hogan, and Kaiser (2007) pointed out that destructive leadership is seldom
absolutely or entirely destructive: Most leadership results in both desirable and
undesirable outcomes. The authors stated that “if destructive leadership is defined by
harmful outcomes, then it may be possible for good leaders to produce bad outcomes, and
bad leaders to produce desirable outcomes” (Padilla et al., 2007, p. 178). A leader is able
to destroy an organization by bringing misfortune to followers, which could damage the
workforce.
I must emphasize that, in this analysis, I do not intend to suggest that the efforts to
develop effective librarian leadership of teens should be abandoned or that we should not
study dissatisfying leader and organizational behavior; however, my distinction between
good and bad leadership tactics must not be taken to mean that the implications of a
theory stand in isolation of its positive merits. As long as there are leaders, there will be
followers. Leaders cannot accomplish what they do without followers. Leaders and
followers exchange roles over time and in different settings. Many are leaders and

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

167

followers at the same time. But the interaction between the leader and the follower is not
symmetrical (Bass et al., 2008, p. 409).
I realize that sometimes both leaders and followers confuse accountability with
responsibility. Accountability is when you take responsibility for the result, whether good
or bad, and responsibility is when you are the only person in charge of delivering the
result. When a leader accepts credit for a success that a team has provided, it can confuse
accountability with responsibility: “Followers play an equal role in co-producing good or
bad leadership” (Bass et al., 2008, p. 66). This makes me think of how both leaders and
followers are sensitive to the impact that their performance has on others. Just like
leaders, followers must take ownership of their responsibilities and be accountable for
effectively organizing and prioritizing tasks that incorporate initiative, commitment,
responsibility, accountability, critical thinking, and effective communication. Good or
bad leadership is determined by the way a follower supports the leader. Followers can
make or break a leader, and the reverse is true as well.

Authoritative Leadership Is the Leadership Style a Librarian-mentor Should Not
Possess
It was necessary to identify leadership roles, responsibility, authority, and
accountability to support the librarian-led mentoring program. I found that an
authoritative leadership style was ineffective when working with professional librarian
leaders in mentoring at-risk teens. An authoritarian leadership style emphasizes a
hierarchical relationships of power and is comparable to the strategic direction of an
organization. I was unable to perform all duties pertaining to the Weekly Readers
Mentoring program alone, so I partnered with other professional librarians to help fulfill
the program’s goals. To meet the program goals, I had to delegate responsibilities;

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

169

however, the delegation skills I used were not authoritative. To obtain full cooperation
from the librarians, I had to treat them as partners. In some instances, leaders use
authority in ways that create a barrier between the relationships between superior and
subordinates whereby the subordinates rely upon the superior for specific direction. This
approach is robotic because the leader clearly specifies his or her expectations of how and
when tasks should be completed. An authoritative leader makes all decisions with little
input from the people who work with them.
Authority must be accepted by subordinates, but responsibility remains that of the
superior. Responsibility influences subordinates, but authority has a stronger impact.
Responsibility is the obligation to achieve certain tasks. Accountability is being held to
the outcomes of a specific problem, project, or fulfillment of an assignment. There can be
many people who are “in charge” or who are authorized to make sure the process and
assigned duties are completed, which could result in no one knowing who does what.
This system would pose a problem in programs like the Weekly Readers Mentoring
Program. According to Bass et al. (2008, p. 362), delegation implies that a subordinate
has been empowered by his or her superior to take responsibility for certain activities.
The degree of delegation is associated with the trust the superior has for the subordinate
to whom responsibilities have been delegated. However, Aguilera (p. 433) defined the
construct of organizational corruption as a crime that is committed by the misuse of
authority within organizations for personal gain. Therefore, when individuals endorsing
the authority of their organizations use that authority for their own benefit, they have
committed organizational corruption.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

170

Accountability flows upward in an organization, and responsibility is assigned
downward. The relationship between the three concepts has to be balanced.
Responsibility and authority go hand in hand, and accountability cannot be expected and
cannot flow upward unless authority and responsibility have flowed downward first. Bass
et al. (2008) believes that leaders need to depend on their personal expertise, self-esteem,
and persuasiveness. Yet satisfaction and productivity are greater when delegation,
responsibility, and authority are matched (Bass et al., 2008, p. 363).
Bass et al. (2008) cautioned that delegating responsibilities should not be
confused with laissez-faire leadership or abdication of responsibility because a leader
who delegates still has to ensure that the task has been successfully followed through.
De La Billiere (2009) pointed out that people who cannot delegate deserve no
further promotion:
Delegation and risk-taking are close allies, for when you delegate you pass onto
others the right to make decisions on your behalf. Sometimes mistakes will be
made, and then the courage of the true leader is demonstrated when he or she
backs a subordinate. If you are unable to do this when they are genuine mistakes,
they will make sure they make no mistakes by failing to use the authority you
may wish to give them, and you will have failed as a delegating leader. (p. 227)
Authority, responsibility, and accountability are interrelated and need proper
consideration when superiors delegate authority. In the process of delegation, superiors
who transfer duties and responsibility to subordinates are also giving them the necessary

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

171

authority to perform the assigned responsibilities, while the superior is accountable for
the subordinates’ performance.
The State of the Librarian
Libraries and schools have always been first on the list for budget cuts and staff
reductions, making it difficult to develop long-lasting, deep leadership teams. The
revolving door within libraries and schools makes for inconsistent leadership
development. It is beneﬁcial for disadvantaged schools to understand both the strengths
and weaknesses of their underlying organizational culture to help librarians adapt their
action plans to address literacy issues. Hackman and Wageman (2010) pointed out that,
“each time leaders’ move in and out of an organization, the leadership team has to be
restructured” (p. 453).
Librarians today work in socially complicated organizations—whether schools or
public libraries—where they need assistance not only from subordinates but also from
their peers, superiors, and external partners to accomplish goals. Accomplishing goals
that positively impact the organization requires effective leadership associated with
strong power bases and effective influence strategies. Building strong power relations and
developing successful influence strategies to produce effective leadership is an important
challenge in the library field. Librarians have the potential to be active leaders of their
schools and communities. They serve on school committees and provide training in the
use of technology and library resources to teachers, parents, and the community. They
also look for opportunities to show teachers how they can support their teaching. Two
primary barriers for school librarians are that they often do not have a recognizable,

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

172

active role in school leadership and instruction and that school or public administrators
tend to lack understanding of the librarian’s role. All librarians must feel empowered and
motivated to make leadership decisions in any organization to be successful.
In support of my research, youth-service librarians, school media specialists,
public librarians, and library paraprofessionals who serve at-risk teens agree that at-risk
populations require more patience and attention than average teens but also that they are
extremely worth the extra effort. It is important that leaders who serve teens be
passionate about them. My observations about difficulties that leaders and library staff
encounter when working with at-risk teens include lack of adequate time with the teens,
resulting in little or no impact on how they perceive and utilize library services. Libraries
are constantly changing leadership, which causes inconsistent learning strategies for atrisk teens. There is a growing debate within leadership studies over whether leadership
should be regarded as an individual or a shared activity. Jackson and Parry (2011) noted
that when discussing whether “leadership is a shared or group-level activity, an
individual might step forward to lead or step back to follow depending on the moment
and the skills and knowledge required” (p. 99). Librarians are always willing to support
shared leadership but are often forced to lead individually because of the lack of support
of other leaders. They are often individualized when it comes to librarians’ program ideas
and research efforts or just simply partner with other organizations.
After evaluating the results of this action-research project, particularly focusing
on the qualitative results from the program observations, interviews, and activities, I
documented an increase in the postsurvey results. Although this is a victory for the

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

173

program, the numbers were too few and the difference too small to make conclusive
statements that this literacy-based intervention would be successful if implemented in
another environment with different youth. I submit that 1.5-hour sessions, once a week,
for 6 months is not enough time for struggling students to show strong progress in their
literacy and academic achievement. I realize that public and other school librarians often
have schedules that do not complement community outreach and that it would probably
be unlikely that they could participate in mentoring initiatives for longer periods of time.
Still, students need exposure to richer text, longer sessions, and more teacher
involvement. And certainly, more research is needed to make definitive assessments of
the success of the program model used in this research project.
Additionally, as the new wave of educational intervention methods for at-risk
students are focused on individualized needs, additional attention needs to be given to
students’ goals based on their attitudes toward school, technological skills, and reading
levels. Leaders must also distinguish between the benchmark for the grade level and time
period and the attainment of the student-centered goal. Given that this action-research
project did not individualize the results but took a snapshot of the entire group of
students, further deconstruction of the results is necessary to distinguish between students
who have potential to progress through levels and those who are focused on mastery of
basic skills within their level.
Whereas much of this analysis focused on low-performing students, it is
important not to forget about students who are reading on or above grade level. Often
students who perform well are not given enough attention due to the increasing number

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

174

of students who are labeled reading deficient or at risk who need the teacher’s attention to
maintain Adequate Yearly Progress. With that being said, I recognize that activities,
instruction, and modeling texts need to be adapted for extension and higher order
thinking applications for students who entered this study reading below grade level.
Modification of these small group instructional sessions can be made with multimedia to
target more literacy-based techniques and recognize that not all students are supported by
the same instruction as their peers.
This action research brings to light a very relevant question in education today:
Are standard reading tests really necessary? With the new Common Core Standards and
student performance being used as one of the deciding factors for teacher evaluations, I
question whether students are being asked to do too much. Reading is not a skill that
should progress quickly for the mere sake of moving up levels but a skill that needs to be
practiced and mastered before students can say that they read independently at a certain
level. It is a shame that students are leaving elementary school and progressing into
middle school and high school without proficient reading skills. I hope that this actionresearch project will be the ammunition to rethink the way we teach literacy, rather than
to pinpoint students who should be labeled as reading deficient.
My final recommendation for such a librarian-led literacy mentoring group is
simple: Librarians must provide a safe learning environment in which the main focus is
student success. Every resource and activity within the program must enable all students
to have a successful learning experience. Adaptability is a huge part of working with atrisk youth. My experience has shown me that, adults sometimes believe that their efforts

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

175

to address the needs of their youth are fruitless because, as soon as one issue is addressed,
they quickly find another one. Most at-risk youth seem to be afraid of success and will do
things that can sabotage their own achievement.
In heavily minority communities we must evaluate and proactively address the
high unemployment rates and the lack of afterschool and free or low-cost enrichment
programs. Too many youth are hanging around the streets with idle time and no one to
challenge their creativity. Society has not paid much attention to the at-risk populations in
these communities. This is a quickly growing population that is largely being ignored. It
is worth researching ways and methods to help these youth become academically
successful. Left unaddressed, the harmful behaviors and the negative influences of their
peers will become detrimental not only to them but to our society.
In closing, librarians face a dilemma in collaborating with teachers and ensuring
that they are seen as leaders within their organizations. Because every library’s culture is
different and sometimes uncertain, the librarian must always have an action plan. They
need to be ready and comfortable to passionately offer assistance when it appears that a
reading problem is present. I firmly believe that literacy programs at all levels of
education must exist. There are far too many occasions when a youth misses the
opportunity to learn to read. Teenagers who cannot read are a challenging group; they are
angry, deeply hurt, yet hopeful. Although I have learned much from my journey so far, I
now realize that my journey has just begun.
In heavily minority communities we must evaluate and proactively address the
high unemployment rates, lack of afterschool programs and free or low-cost enrichment

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

176

programs, low academic success rates, and high incidence of behavioral issues to ensure
that our youth are getting the attention they need. More programs are designed to help
and not humiliate at-risk youth are needed. Our society tends to make the teens who are
faced with bad circumstances feel that there is no hope for them. George and Sims (2007)
stated, “reframing our stories enables us to recognize that we are not victims at all but
people shaped by experiences that provide the impetus for us to become leaders” (p. 15).
This was essential to leadership development in the students and librarians who
participated in the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program. As we lead, we must realize that
we may not be able to help all people, but we should not pile more burdens on them,
either, by stereotyping them. Mentoring at-risk youth may not solve all problems, but at
least it is a beginning. Showing that we are trying to be a part of the solution and not
contribute to the problem demonstrates our authenticity to youth today.
Addendum
As this study indicated, I served as a young-adult librarian at the Charlotte
Mecklenburg Public library. During my time in this position, I gained insight through
community needs assessments. After seeking a population of at-risk teens to help and
conduct outreach, I was offered a media specialist librarian position at Middle School,
and for the past year, I have been the school’s library teacher, teaching library science
and information literacy. Over the last couple of months, I have participated in various
committees and community groups to help improve the community and school
environments. I am no longer employed at Middle School, but I continue to work to make
positive impacts within schools and communities. I currently work for Worcester Public

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

177

Library, where I head the Youth Services department and four community branches. I am
responsible for planning, developing, coordinating, and implementing services designed
to serve children from infancy through high school. I provide services that include
fostering literacy, encouraging reading for enrichment and pleasure, supplementing
school resources, and promoting the use of the public library as a lifelong resource. I
have been chosen to coordinate and evaluate staff services for the Children’s Room; the
Young Adult unit; and branch locations for a new initiative in Worcester, Massachusetts,
called One City, One Library. I serve as a member of the Management Team for overall
planning and coordination of library services and work units at Worcester Public Library
and as a consultant and advisor to management in youth areas of expertise and knowledge
in One City, One Library, whose mission coincides with this action research.
The One City, One Library initiative was created to build a collaborative
relationship between the Worcester Public Library and the Worcester Public Schools that
will
•

create children’s services branch libraries within school settings;

•

give students and teachers access to current library materials and library
services, such as literacy programming during the school year;

•

give the community access to neighborhood-based library services when
school is not in session and in the summer months;

•

provide access to new computers, including early literacy stations, iPads, ereaders, and other digital media, and connect these branch libraries to the

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

178

public library’s worldwide electronic inventory system of more than one
million items in all mediums and for all reading levels;
•

enhance school curriculums with supportive library’s offerings; and

•

serve as centers for family literacy activities.

The Weekly Readers Program at Middle School continues to cultivate the positive
energy and student enthusiasm for which it was initially developed. An indication of its
success is that the community and the school have opened their doors to this program.
Literacy means the difference between getting ahead and being left behind. I would like
to end with a relevant quote that profoundly influenced my life. The words are from Kofi
Annan, Ghanaian diplomat, seventh secretary general of the United Nations, and
corecipient of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize:
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope. It is a tool for daily life in modern
society. It is a bulwark against poverty and a building block of development, an
essential complement to investments in roads, dams, clinics and factories.
Literacy is a platform for democratization, and a vehicle for the promotion of
cultural and national identity. Especially for girls and women, it is an agent of
family health and nutrition. For everyone, everywhere, literacy is, along with
education in general, a basic human right. Literacy is, finally, the road to human
progress and the means through which every man, woman, and child can realize
his or her full potential.

APPENDIX A
ASSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH

Date:
Dear Parent or Guardian:
My name is Chantell L. McDowell. I am a doctoral degree student at Franklin Pierce University. I
request permission for your child to participate in a research study to be used for my doctoral
dissertation. I am conducting a research project on how well the Weekly Readers Mentoring
Program helps teenagers who struggle with reading, technology and literacy learn how to become
more proficient in these skills as they learn from professional librarians. The study will require
me to ask each student questions about how they feel about school, reading, technology and
information literacy and their experience with the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program. To
effectively address the purpose of this study, I wish to interview six, seventh and eighth school
students who attend Middle School and who have participated in the program. I will need your
permission on behalf of the school system and the permission of the parents of each of the
students. Participation is strictly optional and the following safeguards are being brought to your
attention.
I hope to use what I learn from the study to evaluate whether using professional librarians as
mentors for students who are struggling increases their reading levels and information literacy
skills. It will also allow me to make changes to the program so it will help teens with reading and
information literacy struggles even more as the program progresses.
The study consists of the following activities:
1. I am asking for permission for your child to take part in a mentoring initiative utilizing
professional librarians over the course of a total of about 6 weeks. Each mentoring session
will last about 1 hour to 1 ½ hours.
2. These activities may include: (1) answering questions about what your child has learned
while in the program, how your child feels about being in the program, and your child’s
behavior; and (3) taking short quizzes on things your child has learned in the program.
3. Sometimes the researchers will observe your child while he or she takes part in activities at
Middle School.
4. Some activities may be videotaped. The video recorder will be placed in the corner of the
room and will be operated by the researchers.
5. We will access your child’s school records.
The project will be explained in terms that your child can understand, and your child will
participate only if he or she is willing to do so.

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

188

Only I will have access to information from your child. At the conclusion of the study, children’s
responses will be reported as group results only. At the conclusion of the study a summary of
group results will be made available to all interested parents. Please indicate at the end of this
consent form whether you wish to have these results. If so, please provide your mailing address.
If you do not wish to provide your mailing address, you may obtain the results by emailing me at
mcdowellc11@franklinpierce.edu. Results should be available in approximately 12 months.
Participation in this study is voluntary. Your decision whether or not to allow your child to
participate will not affect the services normally provided to your child by Middle School and your
child will lose no benefits to which he or she is otherwise entitled. Even if you give your
permission for your child to participate, your child is free to refuse to participate. If your child
agrees to participate, he or she is free to end participation at any time. You and your child are not
waiving any legal claims, rights, or remedies because of your child’s participation in this research
study.
Please sign and return the consent portion of this form in the self-addressed stamped envelope to:
Chantell L. McDowell
As always, if you have questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at xxx-231-0305.
Keep this letter after completing and returning the signature page to me.
Most Respectfully,
Chantell L. McDowell
Procedures
If the appropriate permission is granted, and the student decides to participate in this study, they
will partake in a one-on-one interview with a Franklin Pierce doctoral student, Chantell L.
McDowell. To ensure confidentiality, the interview will be conducted in a conference room in the
school’s media center. Instructional time will not be adversely affected. The interview will take
approximately thirty to sixty minutes. Students can take breaks during the interview as needed.
During the interview, the student will be asked questions about their thoughts relating to their
participation in the The Weekly Readers Program. The interview will be audio recorded for later
transcription and analysis.
Risks and/or Discomforts
There are no known risks or discomforts to participants.
Benefits
Participants will not receive any direct benefit from this research. However, analysis of the results
from this study may provide valuable insights regarding librarian-led mentoring programs.
Specifically, it may determine if professional librarians helps increase students information
literacy and reading skills simultaneously. If students report having a better score on the End Of
Grade test after participating in the Weekly Readers Mentoring Program, the implications will be
truly significant to the institutions within our society. Schools, libraries and policymakers will
then be able to embrace the concept of utilizing librarians as leaders to assist teachers with the

LIBRARIAN-LED MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AT-RISK TEENS

189

reading curriculum which would not only build reading and information literacy skill within
youth, but help create a more positive culture and society for teens struggling.
Confidentiality
Any information about the students shall be kept strictly confidential. However, due to the small
sample size, I cannot guarantee that their identity will not become known. The following steps are
being taken to minimize this risk. To ensure confidentiality, the interview will be conducted in a
school conference meeting room. Names will appear only on this consent form and identification
numbers will be assigned for surveys and other related documents. The identification number will
be used to match the results to the student's interview. Results will be viewed only at school.
Subject confidentiality will be strictly observed. This will be stressed during the initial training as
well as reiterated in the consent letter. There will be no inducements for subject participation.
Participation will be voluntary and there is no consequence to the students for not participating.
Subject will be assigned an identification number and will be collected to align pre- and postsurvey responses. This information will remain confidential. No further personally identifiable
information will be collected about subjects, nor are any inducements introduced in this action
research study process.
The researcher will have direct contact with youth subjects as participation will be observed but
solely between the librarians, teachers and youth. Consent forms for participating in investigative
exercises are required as part of the youth’s participation in the Weekly Reader Mentoring
program. Additionally, participant names will not be associated with the audio recording made of
the interview. Audio recordings will be transcribed by the researcher, Chantell L. McDowell, and
then the recordings will be destroyed within a one year period after the transcription. In the event
participants choose to share any negative information, it will not have an adverse effect on any
school relationships. Names will not be used in any manuscripts or presentations resulting from
this research. Instead, participant will be assigned a participant number or a pseudonym. It is the
intent of the primary investigator to publish the results in dissertation format. Also, the
investigator(s) may write articles about the research or talk about it at professional meetings or
during college classes, but will not provide any identifying information about the participants.
The data will only be reported in aggregate form. All research materials will be kept in a locked
file cabinet, and will be destroyed within one year of completing the analysis procedures.
Compensation
The students will not be paid for participating in this project.
Contacting the Investigators: Opportunity to Ask Questions
The student’s participation in this study is voluntary. You may ask any questions concerning this
research and have those questions answered before agreeing to your child’s participation in or
during the study. Or you may call the investigator at any time.

will last about 6 weeks and observations and interviews will last approximately 30-60 minutes in
length.
1. I am asking that you to take part in a research study because I am trying to learn more about
how well librarians mentors can help you learn new reading and technology strategies to help
you score better on your EOG’s and other aspects of literacy to make reading and school
easier.
2. If you agree to be in this study, I will ask you to do a few things over the next few weeks.
I will ask you questions about what you have learned here.

study and believe that you have been hurt or upset in any way, you may stop being in the
study. I will not tell anyone else the things you tell me about the Weekly Readers Mentoring
Program or anything you tell me about yourself or any other person.
4. This study probably will help you, but if you participate in this study, it will teach me
important ways to help other teens like you in the future.
5. Please talk this over with your parents before you decide whether or not to participate. Your
parent gave permission for you to take part in this study. Even though your parent said “yes,”
you can still decide not to do this. If you don’t want to be in this study, you don’t have to
participate

What else, if anything, do you think will be important to focus on during the Weekly Readers Mentoring
program?

I think it’s important to focus on the student’s attitude toward school and reading in order
to get to the bottom of why they struggle with reading.
It is important that we focus on the phonics and making reading fun.
I think it is important to not focus on reiterating what is being taught in their English
classes.
I believe that we need to focus on teaching them how to use different technology and
make them aware of how important it is to read because when browsing online all they
are doing is reading.
It’s important that we teach them that a librarian is in both the school and in the
community and we can help with everything.
We must focus on getting them to love books, make it fun and find out what’s keeping
them from reading proficiently.

APPENDIX U
STUDENT INTERVIEWS
Question 1: What was your favorite project/activity that we did in this program?
6th Grade
Patria: My favorite activity was the resume writing workshop and career planning. This taught me
that the more I do in school and in the community the more information I will have when
applying for college and to put on my resume. It was fun to see what some of the other kids put
on their resume, like volunteer work they have done. I think I have to do more so I can add more
to my experience.
Keshawn: I liked talking to my librarian about the problems I was having with my friends and at
home. She helped me solve a lot of my problems in a nice way. I liked learning about new
technology. My other teachers wanted the class to do presentations and I was able to use
PowerPoint to do mine. It was fun and my class liked my design. I felt smart like I knew what I
was doing.
A. J.: I liked picking out books on my reading level and helping in the media center. My favorite
activity was learning more about how to pass the EOG test. I never do good on the EOG reading
so the things the librarians taught helped me a lot. I was not as scared to take the test.
7th Grade
Jayla: My favorite part of the program was being able to work with Ms. McDowell and Mrs.
Miles. They were fun and understood me. I learned how to be a better me in this program.
