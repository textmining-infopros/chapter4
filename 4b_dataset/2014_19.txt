Abstract

This research examines the presence of and reasons for local studies resources in the
libraries and learning centres of further and higher education institutions in the
United Kingdom. The study’s aims were to investigate the content and scope of local
collections in academic libraries, to examine the impact these collections have on
teaching, learning and research within the institutions, and to compile an inventory
of local resources in college and university libraries.
Using an approach combining basic- and applied research, the study represents the
most comprehensive investigation of local resources in academic libraries so far.
Both quantitative and qualitative data was collected by way of two survey
questionnaires, plus observational visits to a small number of libraries, learning
centres and Special Collections departments. In addition, interviews were conducted
with local studies’ experts, collection managers, educators, and students. Secondary
literature focusing principally on both local studies and academic libraries was also
consulted.
The study found that, while the literature, as well as ‘tradition’ tends to equate local
studies and its resources with the public library, local material could be found in a
majority of respondents’ collections. It is suggested that the relative neglect
afforded local collections outside of the public sector is unwarranted, particularly
when considering the potential for wider access to material that a more inclusive
approach to local resources might allow for.
The research also noted that the term ‘local’, as defined by the geographical scope of
the material held in different collections, is open to significantly diverse
interpretations, ranging from the college or university campus itself to one or more
constituent countries (for instance, England and Wales). While some authors have
addressed the complexity of defining ‘local’, the issue remains largely underexamined in the literature, where the term can frequently be based on little more
than a tacit understanding of what ‘local’ means in any given context.

Chapter One: Introduction

Chapter One
Introduction
1.1 Introduction

We have moved away from a world of small, intensely self-conscious local
units into the world of megalopolis or what the town-planner calls
conurbations. Hence we are in danger of forgetting something which has
played an immense part in the social experience of mankind [sic].1p.35

While Finberg and Skipp’s observation in 1967 expresses a concern arguably central
to the premise of local studies as a subject – the potential loss of local heritage – a
different logic has emerged that has been noted by experts in the field. Peter H.
Reid, for instance, observes:

Indeed local studies – and particularly local studies on the Internet – have
been described as attempting to overcome the diaspora away from local
communities. It seems somehow paradoxical that as our society becomes
more mobile then our need to find out and understand our roots and origins
becomes more pronounced.2p.37

The importance of local studies as an undertaking may indeed have been influenced
by this ‘move away’ from small units to communities that have grown larger and less
specific in the way suggested by Finberg and Skipp, but information on these
historical communities has also arguably become easier to access now more than
ever. While small communities may no longer be as easily identifiable as they once
were, advances in technology and communication – essential to an expanding world
where people can no longer rely on knowing the community simply by living there
and interacting with a familiar or familial population - has, in fact, allowed access
not only to additional means of encouraging this type of investigation, but also to a
wide range of localities across the globe. In 1967, it is not unkind to assume the

1

Chapter One: Introduction
authors could not have imagined the impact of a research tool whose widespread
use amongst amateurs and professionals alike thirty years later would permit instant
access to digitised indexes, memoirs, photographs, press clippings and records that
otherwise might not have been uncovered by or accessible to the researcher (at
least quite often not without many additional hours and expense spent on the
endeavour).3 So, while the ‘world’ around us has indeed shifted in scale and scope,
it may be suggested that so too has local studies itself, not only in terms of access,
but in terms of how it is used as well as the ways in which it is represented too: from
the archetypal real-life amateur consulting decades-old land deeds, seeking to trace
the history of his or her house, to representations in popular culture, where the likes
of the teenagers in television’s Buffy the Vampire Slayer can be found poring over
(albeit often less-than-legally acquired) municipal maps and plans in order to aid
their investigations, local studies can be found in various manifestations and
characterisations. Such is its scope, it might be fair, if somewhat self-consciously
ironic, to state that local studies can be found everywhere. This is true also of the
physical – as well as digital – collections that form the backbone of local studies
investigations. While a strong relationship exists between local collections and
public sector libraries, of which there is more further on in this chapter, libraries
within universities and colleges are responsible for housing books, newspapers,
maps, manuscripts and other materials employed in the study of local areas and
communities.

Such is the nature of local studies, it is an endeavour frequently practiced by
‘amateur’ researchers who wish to discover more about his or her community. In
addition to the impetus this ‘personal’ connection provides, the information
resources necessary for the research can typically be accessed locally too, thus
adding to the attractiveness of undertaking such a task. However, this is not to
suggest that local studies as an amateur pursuit is to be taken lightly. Instead, it
might be strongly suggested that local studies is a ‘hobby’ that can be closely related
to the notion of the ‘self-improver’, in this case, someone who wishes to challenge
him- or herself, not only acquiring knowledge of the geographical area under
investigation, but taking on new skills in order to do so. As Peter H. Reid notes:
2

Chapter One: Introduction

In most cases, local studies departments are used by a wide cross-section of
the population from schoolchildren to retired people; they have practised
lifelong learning long before the phrase became fashionable.4p.36

Reid has also anecdotally used the term ‘the gifted amateur’ to refer to the type of
researcher frequently engaged with local studies. When producing an original piece
of research based on a local investigation, it quickly becomes apparent that often at
the core of local research lies the task of having to piece together very disparate
sources of information in order to produce a cohesive picture of, for example, a
series of events that took place in a specific geographical location during a particular
period. Newspaper stories may have to be analysed in conjunction with municipal
documents; pictorial evidence cross-checked with first-hand accounts; material may
come in a number of different formats, whether hard copy, microform or digital.
While assistance is often readily available from library staff or experienced members
of historical or geographical societies, there is little doubt that the challenges
presented by local studies investigation frequently require and/or encourage the use
of higher cognitive skills in the researcher.

That such skills are a necessity was noted by local historian, W.G. Hoskins in 1967
when, with a touch of deprecation aimed not only at the amateur, but his own
attitude towards more professional, academic study – covered further in Chapter
Four – he bemoaned the position he found himself in, that ‘in trying to guide local
historians into the paths of righteousness and away from the amateurish imbecilities
that often marked much of their work in the past, I am in danger of taking all the
pleasure out of local history.’5p13 While some degree of (humorous) exaggeration is
undoubtedly in play, Hoskin’s point is nonetheless worth considering when
contemplating the shift from amateur to professional and academic investigation.
Hoskin’s argument is that local studies is pleasurable and the more skilful execution
of this type of research should not take away from the enjoyment of local
investigations. In other words, it might be suggested that the most effective type of
local study is that which combines the rigour and skill of the professional with the
3

Chapter One: Introduction
enthusiasm of the amateur – see Reid’s ‘gifted amateur’ above – a combination that
also, nevertheless, draws attention to the difference between the (not always gifted)
amateur and those whose approach is more academic in nature.

1.2 The Research

In 2003, an investigative study was begun that focused on local studies collections
within the realm of academic libraries. At this stage, it is worth defining the term
‘local studies collections’ as employed within the context of the study’s aims and the
resulting thesis. As explained in the notes to the respondents at the start of each
questionnaire (see: Appendix 1: Questionnaires), the term ‘refers to individual items,
materials that may be organised as a single collection, or more than one collection
dispersed throughout the library stock’ that relates to local studies. While this
definition is arguably quite broad, it was reckoned by the researcher that the term
‘collection’ – even to describe individual items – provided a sense of formality,
familiarity, and inclusiveness, while also suggesting a ‘bigger picture’ aspect to both
the study itself and the local material that may or may not be held within the
respondents’ libraries, learning centres or special collections.

The purpose of the study was threefold: to ascertain the content and scope of local
collections in higher and further education libraries; to identify and evaluate the
contribution local studies collections make to teaching, learning and research within
academia; and to compile an inventory of the collections.

The objectives that served the aims ranged from what might well be described as the
semantic scrutiny of the term ‘local studies’ itself in order to establish what this term
actually means to those who engage with this subject; to an examination of local
studies collection management within the academic library environment; and an
analysis of the relationship between local studies and the curriculum.

4

Chapter One: Introduction
To summarise, the aims and objectives were:

Aims:
1. To examine the content and scope of local studies collections within further
and higher education libraries in the United Kingdom.
2. To examine the purpose of local studies collections within these colleges and
universities.
3. To compile an inventory of local studies collections in academic libraries.

Objectives:
1. To identify and examine definitions of ‘local studies’ in order to ascertain the
different interpretations placed on this term, whether geographical, historical
or otherwise.
2. To investigate the acquisition, organisation and management of local studies
collections; this will include an examination of how information technology
has contributed to the collection and use of local studies material.
3. To examine external influences on local studies collections, including noninstitutional users with a view to ascertaining the impact such access might
have on this service.
4. To identify other influences that might mould priorities: financial constraints,
for instance, or a perceived obligation to improve access to material on
neighbouring regions or communities.
5. To analyse the relationship between academic institutions’ local studies
collections, their curricula and research activity.
6. To examine the roles of the collections within the institutions.

5

Chapter One: Introduction
In order to fulfil these objectives, a combination of primary and secondary research
was employed. In terms of secondary research, this mainly comprised an ongoing
review of literature that allowed for relevant background into local studies,
academic libraries and pedagogy, putting the study into context. Primary sources,
however, formed the chief means by which the investigation was carried out:
surveys were employed with the intention of providing both an overview of the
current situation regarding local studies in academic libraries and more specific
information pertaining to individual collections and their relationship with the
curriculum; while observational visits were made to five institutions, and interviews
conducted with survey respondents and others who engage with these collections in
order to gain further insight into the subject under discussion. Further interviews
took place with Michael Dewe, a significant and well-respected figure in the field of
local studies, many of whose numerous writings on the subject are focused on
collections in the library.

1.3 Rationale

As Bryant pointed out as early as 1971, local research can ‘actualize and
substantiate’ history’s ‘generalizations’. ‘If we want to know what did happen rather
than what was supposed to be done,’ she wrote, ‘we have to go into the field and
find out.’6p.62 Also, while local studies collections are most often associated with
history, they are no longer shackled rigidly to this particular discipline; local research
is finding its way into different areas of academic interest. Yet, despite this change
in status and popularity, its real worth within the academic world remains underinvestigated.

With this in mind, one of the principal reasons for investigating the subject of local
studies collections in academic establishments is the relative shortage of writing on
this subject. This may be due to the perception that local studies, by and large,
belongs in the realm of the public library sector. As Paul and Dewe noted in the
report based on their preliminary 1984 survey into local studies collections in
academic libraries: ‘Local studies collections in Great Britain have traditionally been
6

Chapter One: Introduction
the responsibility of public libraries […] and it is on these collections that the
professional literature of the subject has been based.’7p.52 In some respects, this bias
is understandable, since, as Paul put it in 1989, ‘until very recently it [local history]
has been predominantly a field for amateurs,’8p.34 and public libraries, with access for
all, would appear the ideal ground for this type of research, which frequently focuses
on family history or local places of interest rather than the renowned - but distant figures, battles and intrigues covered by national history studies. Indeed, this
difference in focus also reflects the way in which local history itself has developed.
Much earlier, local history study was primarily undertaken by members of the gentry
and clergy, educated antiquarians who were principally concerned with chronicling,
as Dewe observes, ‘the descent of the manor, pedigrees, ancient monuments and
the church and its fabric.’9p.3 The writings therefore, while nevertheless valuable,
tended to provide a rather skewed picture of local heritage. One of the most
significant developments in local history studies, then, has been the realisation that
‘local history’ does not simply have to mean accounts of the ‘higher’ classes, ‘stately’
buildings or ‘worthy’ institutions, however ‘local’ they might be. When the
Department of English Local History at Leicester University was opened in 1948, one
of its primary concerns was to have local history direct attention to the lives of
‘ordinary’ people, those whose existence and activities were not usually accounted
for in historical writings. As Dewe puts it, local history developed into ‘a people’s
history, rather than one limited to the powerful and privileged and their particular
concerns.’10p.4 Despite the academic roots of this development, the association
between local studies and public libraries, with their general remit to serve the
people, has remained strong.

However, Paul also noted in 1989 that, over the preceding ‘30 years or so, local
history has become more fully and more formally integrated into the curriculum in
higher and further education’, identifying ‘three separate strands’ comprising
teacher-training, adult and postgraduate study, and undergraduate courses.11p.36
Despite this rise in integration, by 1989 only two major studies had been conducted
on the subject of local studies and academia. Of these, only one focused on the role
of the academic library, the aforementioned 1984 study conducted by Paul and
7

Chapter One: Introduction
Dewe; the other, earlier, investigation, titled Local History in Undergraduate History
Courses,12 focused on the 1974-1975 academic year and was not concerned with the
academic library’s role in providing curriculum support. It is perhaps unfortunate
that by the time the report was published in 1978, a full thirty years after the
establishment of the Department of English Local History at Leicester University,
focus remained on the curriculum, largely ignoring the resources.

Based on questionnaire results attained from sixty-six universities, colleges and
polytechnics, Paul and Dewe’s survey sought to establish, amongst other things, the
development, scope, and, perhaps most significantly, use of local studies collections
in British academic institutions. Findings showed, for instance, that collections were,
perhaps unsurprisingly, used most frequently for historical study; that a number of
universities held local studies collections ‘primarily for the benefit of specialist
departments and regional centres’; and that universities were more likely to deploy
local collections in the field of adult education than were polytechnics and
colleges.13p.56 However, Paul and Dewe recognised the limitations of their study,
remarking that, in terms of research, ‘there is much more that could usefully be
done.’14p.65 No follow-up visits were made to any of the participating libraries, for
instance, with the researchers noting that ‘it would be particularly helpful to know
more about the practice of individual libraries and to have some discussion of the
total range of local and regional collections held in specific institutions both in
libraries and in academic departments.’15pp.65-66 In addition, colleges selected for
inclusion in the survey outside of the university sector were, for the most part, those
providing courses that led to degrees and professional qualifications in arts, social
sciences, education and librarianship; Paul and Dewe recognised that ‘it is quite
possible that there may be small, highly specialised collections in institutions which
concentrate on more technical subjects or on individual fields such as agriculture and
horticulture.’16p.52

Indeed, a 1990 report on Newcastle College Library’s local studies collection, while
by no means contradicting Paul and Dewe’s findings, suggests that there is much
more that might be done in establishing the range and purpose of such collections.
8

Chapter One: Introduction
Armsby and Morgan cite the ways in which students of engineering and science, as
well as business and the arts, are able to utilise both the area itself and the library’s
local collection, and not just in terms of historical study. Art students, for example,
‘may research local artists, craftsmen, and architects, or use the city and surrounding
areas as inspiration in their own right,’ while science students can examine
geological and ecological aspects of the region, as well as its natural history.17p.10

The Newcastle report also made clear its intentions with regard to the purpose of
starting up a local studies collection, stating that, ‘whilst we appreciated
Newcastle’s past, we were just as interested in the present,’18p.9 thus highlighting
probably the most significant development to have occurred in the subject. Only in
the 1970s did the term ‘local studies’ become widely used. Until then, as Dewe
points out, collections were known as ‘local collections’ or ‘local history
collections’.19p.1 While ‘local history’ focuses on a specific aspect of local
investigation and can be included in the practice of ‘local studies’, the two terms are
often, erroneously, considered synonymous. As Reid notes, there is frequently a
‘basic confusion’ regarding the two terms, and the equation of one with the other
‘misrepresents the purpose of a local studies collection which should cover all
aspects of the locality, both the physical and built environments, and all aspects of
human activity within that locality in the past, present and future.’20p.2 While ‘local
history’ remains a valid subject in its own right, the emergence of ‘local studies’
makes it clear that local investigation need not be confined to investigations of the
past. That said, two points are worth noting in terms of the proposed research:
while the research focus is on local studies collections, because local studies is
inclusive of local historical study, research conducted on the former will, naturally,
incorporate the latter, bearing in mind, for example, the results of Paul and Dewe’s
study which showed that local studies collections - in 1984 at least - were most
commonly used for historical study; in addition, local history was the predominant
discipline within the field of local investigation prior to the newer term’s
introduction, and so any discussion of local studies must acknowledge the debt to
local history writing and research. References to ‘local history’, therefore, will be
made when discussing the subject of local studies from the perspective of the
9

Chapter One: Introduction
period prior to the newer term coming into use, and in terms of its present
predominance in local studies, while not always explicitly acknowledging its
narrower focus.

Dixon proposes that ‘Local studies librarianship stands at the cutting edge of
modern library and information work.’21p.xii Paradoxically, as the ‘global village’
becomes increasingly accessible thanks to innovations and developments in
technology, business and the economy, people have been encouraged to examine
their own surroundings, their own roots, to apply local experiences to what they see
happening in the world around them. In universities and colleges, it is also
recognised that prompting students to investigate, observe and report on the local
area is a helpful way of providing practical research experience as well as a worthy
pursuit in its own right. Local studies collections provide the resources with which
much of this investigation is conducted, yet little is known about the scope or
content of these academic collections, their organisation, or how they affect the
ways in which studies are approached. The reason for the proposed research is to
investigate these issues and provide a comprehensive account of this subject. Not
only will the study go a significant way to correct the relative neglect afforded this
subject, but, most importantly, it will contribute to an understanding of how higher
and further education - arguably more important now than ever - makes use of
library resources to provide students with knowledge and skills they can carry
throughout and beyond their academic careers.

1.4 The Thesis Structure

The structure of any piece of writing is as vital as the content itself, with one
informed by the other in order to develop a clear, logical argument. During the
writing of this thesis, attention has been paid to constructing a piece of work that
takes the reader from an understanding of why this research counts, through an
examination of the subject under discussion, to an evaluation of how the research
has contributed to a greater understanding of the local studies collection’s place in
the academic library.
10

Chapter One: Introduction

Chapter two comprises the literature review, in which two main thematic strands of
secondary reading material are identified – local studies, academic libraries, and
teaching, learning and research – with a critical examination undertaken of each
publication that assesses its usefulness to the study.

Chapter three focuses on the methods and approaches adopted for the study, with
reference to pertinent established theories and methodologies. The chapter not
only describes in critical, reflective terms the approach taken towards primary
research collection, recording and analysis, but also looks at the secondary sources
used and explains the relevance of secondary sources to the study.

The fourth chapter seeks to provide an introduction to the subject of local studies
and academic libraries proper. It examines the development of local studies from
its roots as study undertaken by the local gentry, through its perceived status as an
‘amateur’ offshoot of wider historical research and its association with the public
library, to its integration into academia and, therefore, academic libraries. This
chapter, as suggested, will also focus on the development of the academic library. It
will explore the library’s remit to support the institution, its ‘duty of care’ to
students and educators, and its role as the ‘heart’ of the academic institution.
These two areas will also be brought together to look specifically at the ‘history’ of
local studies collections in college and university libraries, with particular reference
to a 1984 survey conducted by Michael Dewe and Derryan Paul.

In chapter five, findings from the study are introduced. Here, the focus is chiefly
aimed at examining and evaluating the present situation concerning the existence of
local studies collections in university and college libraries, with results drawn largely,
but not exclusively, from the first questionnaire, and from interviews conducted and
observations made during the fieldwork stage of the study.

Chapter six continues to assess the current state of local studies and academic
libraries. In this chapter, the purpose behind the collections is the focus, where the
11

Chapter One: Introduction
relationship between local studies collections and teaching, learning and research is
analysed with reference to the study’s findings as well as various relevant
pedagogical theories. As with the previous chapter, data from all stages of the study
is engaged, with particular attention paid to the second questionnaire and data
gathered from interviews and observational visits.

In chapter seven, a reflective account of the subject of local studies and academic
libraries is given. Incorporating not only what has been learned from the primary
research data, but also philosophies and theories drawn from secondary sources,
this chapter looks at the ‘big picture’ and considers, for instance, not only the
situation of local studies collections in university and college libraries in the present,
but also the future. In addition, conclusions are drawn and recommendations
made.

Furthermore, the research itself is reflected upon, with a critical evaluation made of
the methodology employed, and the study’s contribution to knowledge.

A comprehensive reference list is included, followed by appendices comprising the
questionnaires distributed to respondents; interview schedules; a set of reflective
questions; a list of the types of materials included in responding libraries’
collections; and an inventory of local collections at participating libraries and
learning centres;

In the next chapter, relevant literature is reviewed that provides theoretical and
contextual support for the findings and related issues that are explored in further
chapters.

Chapter Two
Literature Review
2.1 Introduction

In this chapter, literature from a range of fields relevant to the subject of local
studies collections in college and university libraries is reviewed. Principally, two
main strands of literature are discussed: that which relates to local studies as a
subject; and that which focuses on academic libraries, including their role in serving
the larger institution. Literature relating to teaching, learning and research as a
separate entity also formed part of the secondary research undertaken; however,
given the study’s focus on libraries and Learning Resource Centres as the means
through which teaching, learning and research is undertaken, much of the
information on this subject has been gleaned from books and articles on academic
libraries.

The nature of the present study is one in which the current state of local studies
resources in academia is explored principally by means of primary survey- and
interview-based research, with findings reported in the thesis over two chapters,
analysed further within the context of a concluding chapter, and preceded by an
introduction and historical overview that follows the development of local studies
from its status as an amateur pastime to its place as a subject ‘worthy’ of academic
study. Because many of the issues and theories found in the secondary material
cited below are referenced throughout the thesis within the contexts of the abovementioned chapters, this review principally serves to draw attention to how and why
particular articles, books, anthologies and authors were reckoned useful to the
study.

15

Chapter Two: Literature Review

2.2 Local Studies

In order to explore the context of local studies resources in academic libraries, it is
important to acknowledge both local studies’ roots in the narrower field of ‘local
history’ and its strong connection to the public library sector. While the study
focused on collections within further and higher education libraries, the relationship
local studies continues to have with the public library could not be ignored and,
indeed, was not only crucial in providing context for the investigation into local
studies resources, but arguably provided impetus for the study in the first place.

Because of the contemporary nature of the research, the majority of relevant
literature employed in the review was relatively fresh in terms of currency, with
most books and articles drawn from works published in the last ten or fifteen years.
One notable exception was the second edition of J.L. Hobbs’ Local History and the
Library.1 First published in 1962, the revised edition, partly rewritten by George A.
Carter, appeared in 1973. However, its inclusion in the study as a source of
background and context was essential. Hobbs is arguably the father of local studies
and this work was for many years the standard text on the subject of librarianship
and local studies. With chapters covering topics from the ‘value and use’ of local
history, to collections, archives and its place in the county library, the book
comprised the most comprehensive account of the precursor to local studies, and
remains a very useful starting point in any examination of local studies issues. This is
not to say that the work was consulted merely to provide historical context; rather,
Hobbs’ approach to, for instance, the matter of ‘duplication’ between different
collections was particularly useful in providing both clarification of and a counter
point-of-view to what remains an often contentious issue. Another exception was
Hoskin’s Fieldwork in Local History,2 from 1967. While not used as a contemporary
source of information, Hoskin’s work, in a manner similar to that of Hobbs, offered
some historical perspective in terms of the growth and expansion of local studies.

Bott’s ‘The World of Local History’3 provided an insightful overview of the ‘coming of
age’ of this subject, charting its rise in both status and popularity in the United
16

Chapter Two: Literature Review
Kingdom since the Second World War. Of particular note is the focus placed on the
crossover status between local history studies as an amateur pastime and a
professional interest, where a difference is observed between the amateur’s ‘love of
the place’ and the ‘parochialism’ that this can allow for, and the professional’s often
more ‘detached’ approach.4pp.8-9 In terms of the study, this was an important point
when considering how much the collection manager’s own interest in the subject
might influence local studies holdings in the library or if the collection existed solely
to serve the teaching, learning or research needs of the institution. In addition, Bott
addresses how the growth in local history studies has affected the way in which
history is taught ‘from university to primary school’.5p.13 Referring to higher
education, she notes that, whereas ‘real research’ was once confined to
postgraduate studies, it is no longer uncommon to find undergraduates employing
primary source material for use in their dissertations, although she concedes that
this is not restricted to local history studies.

Ansell’s ‘The Historical Development and Present Structure of Public Library Local
Studies Provision in the United Kingdom’6 also proved helpful, tracing local studies’
relationship with this sector from William IV’s edict to have an investigation carried
out of the condition of the national archives in 1830 to the more recent growth of
local studies centres. Although the article does not make explicit reference to the
way in which an almost ‘naturalised’ relationship between the public library and
local studies is assumed, the work perhaps implies that there was almost something
inevitable about the emergence of this ‘traditional’ connection. Ansell, for instance,
writes of the way in which, from the start, the provision of local history materials
was deemed to be ‘an indispensable feature’ of the public library, with politician
William Ewart making specific mention of such provision when introducing his Public
Libraries Bill to the House of Commons in 1850.7p.29

More emphatically, Dixon, also citing Ewart, comments on the ‘early history of local
collections in public libraries [as] inextricably linked to that of the public library
service’ in Local Studies Librarianship: a World Bibliography.8p.xiii This volume proved
an invaluable source for secondary data. The most comprehensive publication of its
17

Chapter Two: Literature Review
kind, its coverage includes local studies publications and theses from around the
world, as well as including museums and archives in addition to library material; and
while this coverage arguably extended far beyond the scope of the PhD, it also
helped draw attention, once again, to the diversity and depth of local studies
investigation and the literature that serves it. With sections on, amongst others,
collection management, materials and ICT (Information and Communications
Technology), Dixon’s work provided a thorough bibliographic resource from which to
draw on. Her introductory essay on the history and development of local studies
literature also touches on the emergence of local studies as an academic discipline,
from the appearance of professional literature on local studies librarianship issues
during the First World War and the recognition of local studies as a discipline ‘in its
own right in the 1960s,’9p.xvi to the more recent ‘substantial monographs’10pp.xvi-xvii
penned and edited by Michael Dewe. Along similar lines, Derryan Paul’s ‘The
Bibliography of Local History’11 also proved useful. However, as opposed to Dixon’s
comprehensive volume, this article, as the author herself observes, is ‘very limited in
scope’12p.102 and serves mainly as a guide for librarians on how to find local history
information with some bibliographic details referenced throughout.

One of the foremost authorities in the local studies field, Michael Dewe’s experience
and expertise is reflected in his works and his edited volumes on local studies
collections proved to be of immense value throughout the research. In ‘Local studies
and libraries’13 Dewe traces the evolution from ‘local history’ to ‘local studies’. The
article attempts to make clear that, while he notes ‘the continuing historical
emphasis in the public library local studies collection’14p.2 it should also be observed
that ‘For librarians, and possibly teachers too, ‘local studies’ is seen as inclusive of
local history and so the collection should support studies that look at the historical
past, both distant and recent, or at current concerns in the community … matters of
interest to a wide audience.’15pp.1-2 Interestingly, however, Dewe admits that this
continued focus on historical study may not be simply be down to ‘subject emphasis’
but also in the ‘attitude of librarians,’16p.2 even those who have adopted the newer,
more broadly inclusive term. While the focus is primarily on public libraries, the
article provides a concise overview of a range of issues associated with local studies,
18

Chapter Two: Literature Review
from the ‘development of local history writing’ and the increased popularity of
family history to the collection itself, local studies librarianship, and more practical
considerations such as users’ needs, access, and accommodation.

The development of local history and its marginalisation within broader historical
studies is explored by Beckett in Writing Local History.17 Tracing the subject from its
roots in sixteenth-century antiquarian county studies to its popularity as a pastime in
the present day, the ‘book sets out how local history has come to be where it is
today, and how through studying it we can better understand the nation, the region,
and the locality.’18p.6 Further reading was required in order to shine more light on
the historical context and, in this capacity, Tosh’s The Pursuit of History19 proved
beneficial in terms of providing an overview of historical writing, methods and
theory. Cited by Tosh as the beginning of the genre of ‘writing about the discipline
of history’, it was also reckoned by the researcher that Carr’s What Is History?,20
originally published in 1961, was worth consulting, as was one of many responses to
Carr’s study of historiography, Jenkins’ On ‘What Is History?’: From Carr and Elton to
Rorty and White.21 Within the context of local Heritage sites, DeSilvey looks at
historical narratives, questioning the ‘re-invention’ of places by way of ‘selected
story-lines.’22p.34

Two further articles by Michael Dewe ‘Resource Providers for Local Studies’23 and
the later ‘Resource Providers’24 broaden the scope when looking at the ways in
which local collections are housed, while also maintaining the traditional link in the
literature between local studies and the public sector. In ‘Resource Providers’ Dewe
notes the ‘diversity and complexity’ of institutions where local studies material can
be found, while at the same time identifying three broad types: libraries, museums
and archives. He provides an overview of different providers within these institution
types, including public and national libraries, local and family history societies,
national record offices and art galleries. Although the section on academic libraries
is brief and refers, in the main, to Dewe and Paul’s own 1984 study as well as specific
collections, both this article and its predecessor served as a useful way of putting
university and college libraries as local studies resource providers into a wider
19

Chapter Two: Literature Review
context, highlighting the sheer range of places where such material can be found in
a field where much of the literature is concerned with the public library alone.

In keeping with the element of diversity evident within the field of local studies, Jill
Barber’s ‘Materials’25 offered an outline of the many different types of items that
might be found in local studies collections, an overview that proved essential when
designing the study’s questionnaires. Both the traditional and somewhat outmoded
perceptions of libraries as merely ‘book’ repositories and local studies as a subject
confined to investigations of the past are thoroughly interrogated. Barber points out
that the local collection ‘is a contemporary resource, not purely a retrospective one’
and observes that ‘The scope of its materials reflects an evolving interdisciplinary
focus encompassing geography, economics, social science, planning, commerce,
politics and culture.’26p.69 While noting that ‘books and pamphlets are still at the
heart of the collection’ she examines other materials from maps, photographs and
indexes to CD-ROM and other technology-based media. Also, while observing the
difficulty in separating ‘local studies collection’ materials from items held by
archivists, Barber also provides the useful ‘unwritten rule’ that published works
might be classified as local studies material, while manuscript sources may be
considered ‘the province of archivists’, a distinction that, again, proved useful in
practical terms when considering both the focus of the study and appropriate
questions for the surveys. Another article by Barber, ‘Marketing,’27 takes the reader
through the process of developing and implementing a marketing plan for the local
studies collection. While this focus did have some bearing on the PhD’s interest in if
and how collections and materials were promoted within college and university
libraries, Barber’s identification of local studies provision being perceived as a
‘backroom “Cinderella” service’28p.140 proved a very worthwhile and thoughtprovoking suggestion. The term summarises one of the underlying issues that was
investigated in the study: the extent to which local studies resources were valued by
the institution and how much this might have relied on the collection manager’s own
good will and enthusiasm for the subject.

20

Chapter Two: Literature Review
As may be evident by this point, one of the most compelling features of local studies
is its complexity, and this is reflected in Diana Dixon’s ‘Collection Management.’29
The article outlines various issues that can affect the scale and scope of a collection
including selection policies, its remit to ‘represent’ a community, and the often
idiosyncratic decisions that sometimes have to be made when deciding what is or is
not relevant local material. One particular aspect of collection management and
selection that concerned the study related to the sometimes rather widely differing
interpretations of ‘local’ supplied by respondents to the survey. Dixon notes that
while ‘defining the area served may seem straightforward in terms of current
administrative boundaries, it may be less clear-cut for local historical societies, or
academic collections.’30p.88 This was a point that was followed up during the
research in terms of the distinctiveness of local collections in college and university
libraries and how collection policies may differ from those of public libraries.

Other texts provided more narrowly focused perspectives on local studies collection
management. These include articles by Barber,31 who examines issues affecting
training for local studies librarians, including budget constraints, and Hume and
Locke, whose ‘Information Access and Retrieval’32 looks at issues relating to
cataloguing and classification. While the article’s restricted scope meant that the
text was useful in only a limited way, with reference to recommendations set out in
the Library Association’s Guidelines for Local Studies Provision in Public Libraries, it
provided a helpful underpinning to the questionnaire findings relating to this area of
management. Similarly, albeit from a broader perspective, Bluck’s ‘Organizing
Libraries for Customers’33 highlights potential issues and problems in cataloguing and
classification, not only as they might relate to public libraries, but with reference to
academic libraries too. Workman’s ‘The Influence of the Library User on Collection
Management’34 also proved valuable in this area, examining issues pertaining to
cataloguing and organisation with, as the article’s title suggest, a strong focus on the
user.

Users – in particular, communities – and their relationships with archives and
heritage form the crux of articles by Flinn,35 Roberts,36 Gray,37 and Gorman.38 In
21

Chapter Two: Literature Review
Flinn’s ‘Community Histories, Community Archives: Some Opportunities and
Challenges.’ While not entirely relevant to the study – as the title suggests, the
article largely examines the influence of and interest in local studies within nonacademic populations, in particular from the perspective of often under-represented
groups – Flinn’s article nonetheless provided some context for present concerns
such as inclusion and access. Similarly, articles by Roberts and Gray examine the
impact of heritage on communities

As its name suggests, Peter H. Reid’s The Digital Age and Local Studies39 focuses
largely on more recent innovations – particularly issues concerning the internet –
and their impact on local investigation. While the book is mostly concerned with the
public library sector, acknowledging this bias as ‘inevitable’, other institutions are
not ignored, and this includes the academic library. The book provided some very
useful background relating to issues concerning local studies itself, including, for
instance, the erroneous, but commonly held, equation of ‘local studies’ with ‘local
history’; and the ‘myth of parochialism’. Like Dixon, Reid also addresses the
complexity of defining the ‘local’ in ‘local studies’. He acknowledges that while the
answer to the question ‘how local is local?’ is seldom as ‘self-evident’ as it may
appear, this is particularly true in the academic sector, where a ‘broader approach’ is
often more commonly found that might be inclined to represent ‘the traditionally
perceived catchment area or the aspects of teaching, learning and research
undertaken at the institution.’40p.3-4 Reid’s co-authored article with MacAfee, ‘The
Philosophy of Local Studies in the Interactive Age’ also proved useful, generating
thought in terms how the internet has impacted issues such as access, user
requirements, and social inclusion, noting a ‘need to disseminate and celebrate local
studies online, in order to show the users of electronic resources how much value
could be added to their research by local studies collections.’41p.137

Issues relating to electronic access and resources also feature strongly in Breivik and
Gee’s Higher Education in the Internet Age.42 While not specific to local studies or
libraries, despite the publication’s origins in and focus on universities in the United
States, the text was able to provide the study with facts and figures relating to the
22

Chapter Two: Literature Review
use of digital resources that proved particularly helpful when positing issues relating
to access and materials within a broader context. Articles by Anderson43 and Smith
and Rowley44 focus on digitisation within a local studies context, albeit outside of the
academic sector. While Smith and Rowley look at digitisation from a broad public
library perspective, Anderson provides a narrower viewpoint, focusing on an
evaluation of the Glasgow Story digitisation project. Access to local studies webbased services are also examined by Barry and Tedd45 and Litzer and Barnett,46 who
look at the practical benefits of being able to access local material remotely,
including the ability to ‘display’ sometimes rare or unique items that users might
otherwise have little or no access to at all.

Further thought is given to technologies and more recent developments and
challenges in local studies provision by Dewe,47 Dixon,48 Sharp,49 and Archdeacon, et
al.50 Dixon, for instance, looks at the influence and impact of digitisation and the rise
of social media against a backdrop of heightened demand and scarce financial
resources, while Sharp focuses on the delivery of local studies services in austere
times. Nashwalder51 also examines local studies services’ delivery in the public
library, using a case study approach with a focus on Wiltshire. While these articles
and dissertations are based on public library provision, they do offer context for
recent developments and concerns with regard to the ability to provide local studies
services.

The ways in which access to online resources is being expanded through web-based
sites and services based on Web 2.0 and Library 2.0 technology are explored by
Curren,52,53 Chowdhury, et al,54 Maness55 and Theimer.56 While only Theimer
provides a local studies perspective in Web 2.0 tools and strategies for archives and
local history collections, which serves largely as a practical guide to navigating the
changes to the World Wide Web that the likes of social networking sites and blogs
have wrought, the others offered valuable information on Library 2.0, the libraryfocused user-centred service based on Web 2.0, that was useful when considering
next-generation public access catalogues. Indeed, next generation catalogues are
the focus of Jai and Weng’s57 examination, and Yang and Hofmann’s58 comparative
23

Chapter Two: Literature Review
study of, OPAC services, both of which proved helpful when considering more recent
developments in access to collections.

One issue that emerged from the study was the almost innate different-ness of local
studies librarianship and provision, its uniqueness at least in part informed by its
crossover potential (or, in more negative terms, its lack of a solid identity as an
isolated subject in and of itself) and its perhaps frequent reliance on the enthusiasm
of the collection manager for the topic. This difference is explored by Joe Fisher,
Librarian for the Glasgow Room, in ‘Local Studies, What Art Thou?’,59 where the
author compares trying to define local studies, an area with which he is more than
familiar, with ‘the centipede who fell over when he thought about how he moved his
legs.’60p.3 Fisher observes, for instance, that all of the material held in the Glasgow
Room ‘rightly belongs somewhere else’ whether the library’s arts and recreation,
social sciences, or philosophy and religion sections. He also proposes that the local
studies librarian occupies a unique role within the broader librarianship profession,
suggesting that he [or she] is ‘regarded as something more than a librarian’61p.4 and
is expected to be something of an expert on the subject itself rather than merely its
resources. Differences such as these, Fisher concludes, ‘suggest that in some radical
way local studies does not conform to the idea of an ordinary subject
department.’62p.4 These are salient points that were considered vital to the study
when considering the practicalities of the local studies collection’s integration with
or separation from the main stock, its status as a resource within the curriculum, and
its value to the manager, user and the institution as a whole.

One of the most important secondary sources, and the only literature to focus solely
on local collections in colleges and universities, is ‘Local Studies Collections in
Academic Libraries’,63 in which Derryan Paul and Michael Dewe, both renowned
experts in the field of local studies, report on the results of a 1984 survey on the
subject of local studies collections in university and college libraries. This particular
text was especially relevant to the project, given that it concerns the only major
empirical study of this subject. Observing both the ‘traditional’ perception of local
studies being ‘the responsibility of public libraries’, and the bias toward the public
24

Chapter Two: Literature Review
library sector in the literature of local studies, the authors suggest that the report
‘constitutes a preliminary attempt to remedy this omission’. The article proved
crucial in two distinct, yet related, ways: As a preliminary report, the 1984 study
enabled the researcher to identify what was thus far known about the
underrepresented subject of local collections in the further and higher education
sector; furthermore, its very status as the sole example of such a study in itself
underlined the paucity of information on this issue. Paul and Dewe’s assertion that
the purpose of academic libraries’ local studies collections is not ‘to duplicate the
collections and services provided in public libraries and record offices or to supplant
them, but to supplement [researcher’s emphasis] them’64p.52 also provided the study
with an issue to be explored in the research in terms of not only the question of
responsibility for local studies services and resources, but, once again, local studies’
difference from other college- or university-based subjects.

Although he concedes that local studies provision is not ‘uniquely unfortunate’ in
the potential problems faced by the library service, in ‘Local Studies Collections’65
Crosby highlights two main concerns with regard to this particular issue in county
and borough libraries: namely staff and materials. The problems he focuses on
involved issues that bore relevance to the PhD study, despite the difference in
context. Crosby writes, for instance, about ‘specialist staff, who have proper
expertise in local history and related subjects ... [being] replaced by staff who ...
have no special knowledge or experience,’66p.2 an issue pursued in the PhD study
when identifying levels of local studies training and/or induction in academic library
staff. In addition, Crosby writes of service chiefs who may be ‘seduced by
technology’ at the expense of more traditional resources such as books or
pamphlets, a topic for further exploration during the study when examining the
different types of materials that make up local collections in university and college
libraries.

Usherwood examines the provision of materials and guidance in ‘The Social Impact
of Local Studies Services.’67 Based on research carried out at the University of
Sheffield to assess the social effect of public library services in Newcastle and
25

Chapter Two: Literature Review
Somerset, once again, the emphasis on the public library underlines the strength of
the ‘traditional’ relationship between this sector and local studies investigation, as
Usherwood points out the ‘significant’ role played by local studies in the impact
such services have on the population. However, while the article does not move
outside of its remit to focus on the public library in order to address the further
implications of the surveys’ findings, of particular interest to the PhD study was the
suggestion that local studies services are a means through which ‘individuals
develop new skills through supporting an interest in local history.’68p.2 While the
report refers to these individuals in terms of ‘the public’, that local studies
investigation, in particular, lends itself to hands-on research experience can
arguably be applied to further and higher education students and was one of the
concerns of the study.

In ‘The Expansion of Local History: Its Impact on Libraries’69 Derryan Paul takes a
more direct look at the relationship between local studies and education. Published
in 1989, the article follows the development over the previous thirty years of local
history as a subject of academic interest in further and higher education institutions,
observing that previously, although a topic of formal study since the sixteenth
century, prior to the 1960s it could be largely characterised as ‘a field for
amateurs.’70p.34 Examining its integration into academic study, Paul looks at the
emergence of a range of disciplines that take local history as their primary focus and
also how local history has been offered as an option within other subjects. While
Paul limits herself to the narrower subject of ‘local history’, as suggested earlier this
subject cannot and should not be ignored in terms of its importance to the more
recent, broader field of local studies. The article, therefore, proved beneficial in
supplying background information and in putting into context the issue of local
studies’ integration into the curriculum.

One of the study’s main concerns was to assess the degree to which local studies
collections had moved beyond the perception of being almost exclusively associated
with historical study and were being employed within different disciplines. An article
by A.F. Armsby and L. Morgan, ‘Newcastle College Local Studies Collection’ not only
26

Chapter Two: Literature Review
provided an overview of a specific collection, but its emphasis on the purpose of its
collection arguably increased its value to the study as an indication of how local
studies collections might be deployed elsewhere. Armsby and Morgan touch on the
importance of what might be often considered an issue of mere semantics, as Reid
does, when they assert that ‘whilst we appreciated Newcastle’s past, we were just as
interested in the present’, thus once again highlighting the potential relevance of
holding a local studies – as opposed to local history – collection. This relevance is
made clear as the authors provide an indication of how broadly local studies
resources can be used in terms of curriculum support by citing the ways in which art,
business, science, and tourism and leisure students may utilise the collection. In
terms of materials, the authors also highlight the diversity within the local studies
collection, comprising items from books and pamphlets to vinyl records and video.

Less concerned with how collections are used is Wood’s ‘The Local Collection at
Durham University Library’. Unlike Newcastle College’s more reflective article, this
account is primarily descriptive and mainly served the study by providing an
overview of the local history collection at Durham. However, as an example of how
local collections can be served by recent technology, promoted to ‘potential
customers’, and organised for maximum impact, it provided some useful ideas for
areas to look into and follow up during research.71

2.3 Academic Libraries

Because the study was as concerned with the purpose of local collections as it was
with the existence of such materials, examining the function of the college or
university library was reckoned essential.

Peter Brophy’s The Academic Library72 represents probably the most comprehensive
overview of the library within the higher education sector. Covering a wide range of
subjects, from the library building itself to performance measurement, the book
served as both a useful introduction and a more in-depth source of information
relating to various issues and concerns focused on during the research. Most useful
27

Chapter Two: Literature Review
to the study were the chapters relating to the library as part of the parent
institution, collection management, and users. In ‘The Higher Education Context’
Brophy provides a summary of the development of universities and higher education
colleges, and also looks at recent directions taken in teaching and learning methods.
He reminds the reader that, as a general rule, ‘the character of each library, and the
types of service it emphasizes, are based upon the needs of a particular, well-defined
group of users’, so that ‘the university library reflects its university,’73p.2 a seemingly
obvious, yet important, point when considering why certain collections are held and
how they are used. ‘The History of Higher Education Libraries’ traces libraries in this
sector from the pre-modern era to the present, and includes coverage of several
significant committee reports, such as the 1992 Follett Report on university library
provision. ‘Collection and Access Management and the Organization of Resources’
provided information and observations on stock selection processes, materials,
preservation and conservation and other aspects of the management and
organisation of resources that helped put some of the issues relating to the more
specific collection of local material into context. ‘Users of the Academic Library’
offered a valuable overview of types of potential users, including under- and
postgraduate students, research students and staff, academic staff and external
readers. One of the main areas of interest for the research, especially when
considering the types of material that might be found within an academic local
studies collection, is that of the tension between the preservation of sometimes very
old or unique items and access to materials. Brophy’s focus in this chapter is at least
partly informed by his belief that a library has little purpose without users, claiming
that, even when preservation might be a particular library’s primary mission, ‘unless
‘posterity’ includes users it has no real meaning.’74p.60

‘Posterity’ and the relationship between users and library collections forms the
central theme of Duckett’s article, ‘The need for Local Heroes – Using the
Knowledge.’75 As the article’s title suggests, Duckett takes local studies materials
and librarianship as his example and examines the argument of whether library
collections are ‘for future use and not just for the present.’76p.173 While the focus on
academic libraries is quite fleeting – attention is quite broadly placed on ‘local
28

Chapter Two: Literature Review
studies libraries’ – Duckett’s article was helpful in providing a context for examining
not only the immediate purpose behind local collections in college and university
libraries, but also for exploring the different expectations placed on public and
academic libraries when it comes to building collections.

The attention given to academic libraries is more limited in Brophy’s The Library in
the Twenty-first Century,77 which focuses on recent developments across a broader
landscape. However, some of the issues raised were useful to the study in terms of
providing additional context. For example, Brophy looks at how ‘The sense of the
academic library’s role as a centre for scholarly research’ is one that ‘has persisted to
the present’,78p.27 and examines the reality behind this perception. For instance, he
notes that ‘The massification (sic) of higher education has led in recent years to
much greater prominence being given to the academic library’s role in supporting
learning and teaching.’79p.31 Also looking at the future of academic libraries are Law
80

and Holley,81 with Holley particularly concerned with how technology has impacted

upon issue of space within university libraries. Feret and Marcineck82 and Reyes83
also consider the future of the academic library, but with primary focus placed on
the role of the academic librarian.

Although produced more than twelve years ago, the Joint Funding Councils’ Libraries
Review Group: Report84 (commonly known as the Follett Report) represents one of
the most significant major reviews of library provision in higher education
institutions in the United Kingdom. The report, prepared for the four major
university funding bodies, is largely focused on, not surprisingly, library issues within
the context of financial support, but some useful information was gained in terms of
how university libraries are expected to function, when considering the pressures
placed on libraries that have to cope with increased student numbers and decreased
funding, ultimately leading to stretched resources. Similarly, the 1994 Anderson
Report,85 which emerged from concerns raised by the Follett report, served to
provide information regarding how libraries are expected to support research
activity.

29

Chapter Two: Literature Review
The subject of users’ importance to the higher education library is focused on almost
exclusively in Jordan’s The Academic Library and Its Users.86 The philosophy extolled
in this book is perhaps best summed up by the author’s edict: ‘Never take your eyes
off the user!’87p.viii As this directive might suggest, the book possibly serves best as a
‘how to’ guide for professionals in the academic library who wish to improve the
service offered to its readers. However, in terms of its usefulness to the study,
Jordan’s book provided an overview of various subjects that impacted on the
project. This included discussions of recent developments in further and higher
education libraries, ‘quality’ issues, and, of course, the users themselves. Jordan
himself, however, notes the ‘heterogeneous’ nature of the student population88p.49
and, with this in mind, his account of student needs within the library is perhaps
rather broad and tends to cover more practical concerns, such as access to the
library itself, theft of stock and ‘library anxiety’ rather than the ways in which the
resources themselves might be being used within the context of learning. However,
this focus is in-keeping with the nature of the book. Most useful, perhaps, was the
chapter on ‘Researchers’, where provision of materials is discussed, with Jordan
noting, for instance that in one study, where academic researchers mentioned
libraries outside of their own institution in terms of ‘more suitable collections’ it was
more often researchers from new universities.89p.106

Baker’s ‘Academic Libraries’,90 while ostensibly a general introduction to the subject
of resource management in this area, actually served as a useful overview of some of
the more difficult issues related to academic librarianship. For instance, any idea
that libraries in the university have an easily identifiable role within the institution
that can be simply summed up in an ‘all-embracing’ mission statement is belied as
Baker puts forward a number of pertinent, albeit rhetorical, questions that proved
useful to the study in terms of establishing the purpose of the collections.
Suggesting that the ‘traditional university library’ might be described as ‘an amalgam
of single-subject special libraries catering for a series of special client groups’, he
proposes some conflicts that the library might face when endeavouring to serve
these different groups. He asks whether the library is, for instance, focused on
supporting ‘study and teaching or research’ and if it might be, primarily ‘an archive
30

Chapter Two: Literature Review
or an information centre’, questions that bear a great deal of relevance to the PhD
study’s aim of identifying both the existence and purpose of the local collections.
Further sections, such as ‘Research versus Teaching’, in which Baker identifies and
outlines some general trends in emphasis between ‘traditional’ and ‘new’
universities, provided a beneficial indication of the workings of higher education
institutions and their libraries over recent years.

In ‘Collections, Collectors and Collection Building’91 Ratcliffe focuses closely on this
aspect of academic librarianship, providing a view of the tension between
accumulating holdings that strictly serve the institution’s teaching and learning
needs, and building collections that may have value outside of the curriculum. While
noting, for example, the important collection of printed ephemera in the Bodleian
library that would be of ‘little scholarly purpose’ if duplicated,92p.60 he argues against
James Thompson’s view in Redirection in Academic Library Management that major
academic libraries have frequently been guilty of attempting to ‘collect for
collecting’s sake.’93p.2 While agreeing that this, indeed, is not what collectionbuilding is about, Ratcliffe also claims that ‘No British University in my experience
has pursued this policy’.94p.5 Ratcliffe’s work – published as part of a collection of
essays ‘in honour of Ian Rogerson’, the first Librarian of Manchester Polytechnic –
places a great deal of focus on the individual histories of specific collections, such as
the ancestry of particular benefactors and, while interesting nonetheless and inkeeping with the essay collection’s more ‘personal’ flavour, this meant the article
was of limited use to the study. However, Ratcliffe’s introductory argument against
the perception of academic libraries unrealistically hoping to ‘acquire all the books in
the inhabited world’ provided an intriguing insight into this feature of academic
librarianship.

From the same collection of essays is Feather’s ‘Special Collections in the University
Library’95. Feather’s article takes perhaps a more general tone than Ratcliffe’s, and
he provides both an interesting and useful overview of some of the issues associated
with this division of higher education librarianship. Feather examines the difficulty in
defining what a ‘Special Collections’ department actually is and highlights ‘four areas
31

Chapter Two: Literature Review
of concern’: preservation, access, the wider implications of ‘collections owned and
held by a single institution’, and the correlation of these holdings with the
institution’s ‘mission’, in particular with regard to research, all of which were focused
on to a smaller or larger degree in the research.

The issue of how resources are deployed to provide curriculum assistance is studied
in Josephine Webb’s ‘Collection Management to Support Learning’.96 As Webb
points out, this is an issue that has been relatively neglected in both the literature
and in e-mail discussion lists on ‘how libraries can support learning across the range
of their services and facilities,’97p.135 and the article was therefore valuable in terms
of providing context for the study’s aim in identifying and assessing how local studies
resources are used for curriculum support. With reference to the Dearing and Follet
reports on library services in universities, Webb looks at various areas of concern
within the academic library sector and how these affect teaching and learning within
the parent institutions. How curriculum support might be found within the library is
examined in a section focused upon the needs of undergraduate and postgraduate
students, where Webb suggests that ‘the collection should reflect back to students
the range of learning outcomes which have been specified in the courses they
study,’98p.136 an issue taken up in the research when identifying and analysing
whether local collections are influenced by or, conversely, impact on what students
are being taught. An interesting point is also made when considering the way in
which it is perhaps commonplace to perceive teaching and research as separate
functions within higher education institutions. With reference to the Follett Review
Group findings, Webb observes that ‘a substantial degree of common use of
bookstock for teaching and research’ was found.99p.138 Thebridge and Dalton are also
concerned with resources to support learning, but with a narrower focus on
progressing towards Outcomes Assessment within academic libraries.100

Carr’s The Academic Research Library in a Decade of Change101 focuses principally, as
the title suggests, on a particular sub-set of the academic library, while also making
use of case studies that centre on specific institutions, such as the chapter on
Oxford’s Bodleian Library. However, many of the issues Carr covers in this volume
32

Chapter Two: Literature Review
can be applied outwith the narrower confines of the research library and the book
provides a sound overview of the rapid changes that have occurred not only within
libraries themselves, but in the wider academic landscape over the ten years prior to
the book’s publication in 2007. Focal points include the possible future of the
hardcopy book, the (changing) needs of users, and digitisation for the purposes of
preservation.

In Colleges, Libraries and Access to Learning,102 various authors examine issues
salient to librarianship and further and higher education in both colleges and former
polytechnics. Articles focus on subjects such as the institutional contexts of further
and higher education, the role of the librarian in both learning and the immediate
context of the library itself, resources, and students. Published in 1994, the book
nonetheless offers an informative overview of the library within a context other than
that which tends to prioritise those, older, institutions more traditionally associated
with ‘academic libraries’.

Outside of the context of the academic library, in Rethinking University Teaching: A
Framework for the Effective Use of Educational Technology,103 Laurillard examines
how approaches to teaching have changed from a model based on merely ‘imparting
knowledge’ to one that focuses instead on facilitating student learning. Along with
other library-focused texts that include discussions of teaching/learning methods
and approaches, such as those mentioned above by Brophy and Webb, Laurillard’s
emphasis on learning as an increasingly independent activity undertaken by students
outside of the classroom, provides a connection between teaching and learning and
the resources employed to enable these activities.

2.4 Conclusion

In discussing the secondary sources employed in order to provide context to the
present study, as well as to position the thesis within a body of existing literature,
when it comes to the existence and purpose of local studies collections in further
and higher education libraries, the limitations of the existing literature are clear. The
33

Chapter Two: Literature Review
vast majority of material posits local studies within the realm of the public sector,
with only Dewe and Paul’s preliminary study addressing the specific topic of these
collections’ place in the academic library to any substantial degree. Likewise, the
question of how local studies material is used in higher and further education is one
that has largely been, if not outright neglected, then perhaps under-analysed.

As has been suggested when discussing the rationale for the present study, however,
these omissions in the literature are not entirely surprising, and, in fact, have served
to drive the study itself. It is with this in mind that literature cited seeks to inform
the aims and objectives of the thesis.

In the following chapter, the methods and approaches employed in the study are
described and reflected upon, with attention paid to techniques used for the
collection, recording and analysis of primary data, as well as reference to relevant
theories and methodologies. The importance of secondary sources to the thesis is
also discussed.

Chapter Three
Methods and Approaches
3.1 Introduction

Research is done to settle disputes about the nature and operation of
some aspect of the universe. The research process is a disciplined
way of coming to know something about our world and ourselves.1p.5

So states Bouma when summarising the reasons for research and the reasons for
research methodology. While this particular study cannot claim to be concerned
with settling a ‘dispute’ as such – although Bouma would appear to use this term less
literally than might be assumed – its aim is to discover something about the world of
local studies and academic libraries in a ‘disciplined way’.

In Librarianship: Its philosophy and History, Mukherjee cites a number of different
beliefs ascribed to the study of librarianship. Amongst others, Mukherjee references
Houle’s belief that ‘a philosophy of librarianship should be a practical philosophy’ as
opposed to ‘the philosophy of nature, which seeks to re-discover what nature is.’
Houle further proposed that such a philosophy achieves its ‘fullest meaning’ when it
is applied in order to ‘guide the actions of individual librarian [sic] or a group of
librarians, who are working together in a single institution.’2p.9

It is clear, then, that Houle sees any potential philosophy as one that should be
workable in the libraries themselves. In addition, Raymond Irwin’s view that ‘there is
no philosophy of librarianship … on which technical studies can be based’ is, as
Mukherjee puts it,

countermanded by the existence of its ruling principles, which we may
describe, as of any other branch of knowledge, as a statement of the
aims, object or end of this particular study.

42

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches

Indeed, according to Irwin, as Mukherjee describes it, the ‘philosophy of librarianship
has no meaning other than the study of theory or principles of this branch of
knowledge.’3p.9 In terms of conducting research within the field of librarianship,
support for such beliefs may, at first glance, appear to be founded on a rather
obvious notion. After all, what is the point of carrying out research if it is not to be
employed in a practical way?

However, Busha and Harter note the way in which research can, roughly speaking,
be divided into two broad types: basic research (sometimes referred to as pure,
theoretical or scientific research4p.2); and applied research. With reference to the
former, the authors observe how studies can be ‘undertaken primarily to acquire
knowledge for its own sake’, also pointing to the ‘original and theoretical’ nature of
basic research, drawn from ‘fundamental, intellectual problems’.5p.7-8 Basic research
is not concerned with making practical use of findings; or, as Powell and Connaway
put it, ‘[basic research] is primarily interested in deriving new knowledge and is, at
most, only indirectly involved with how that knowledge will be applied to specific,
practical, or real problems.’6p.2 On the other hand, applied research is chiefly
‘pragmatic’. Busha and Harter explain that:

its purposes are more specific and are generally aimed at solving
practical problems or at the discovery of new knowledge that can be
utilized immediately in actual “real world” situations.7p.8

They also point out, however, that, in some cases, ‘distinctions cannot easily be
made between basic and applied research, especially in cases pertaining to subject
areas that are in the process of theory building’.8p.8 Regarding this sometimes blurry
distinction, Mouly further suggests that ‘All research findings will be useful and
practical – sooner or later – no matter how disinterested in immediate utilitarian
goals the pure researcher might be.’9p.43

With this in mind, the research conducted into the presence and purpose of local
studies collections in academic libraries is perhaps best described as a combination
of basic and applied research, with the emphasis on the former since, while the
43

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
primary purpose of the research is not necessarily aimed towards cutting costs or
enhancing the performance of a specific given library, the knowledge acquired for
this study may end up being employed in a practical manner. Ultimately, university
and college libraries themselves serve a practical purpose: to provide students with
the tools necessary to achieve career advancement in ‘the real world’, as well as
carry with them the capacity for independent thought, undertaking research, and
further learning (whether academic or not). The more that is known about
resources within the institutions – the what, why and how of them – the better
equipped academic libraries and the departments they serve can be when it comes
to executing their duty as learning facilitators. Furthermore, the information
obtained has also enabled the researcher to provide recommendations that can
perhaps be more directly applied in a pragmatic fashion. However, because there is
no tradition of literature on this subject, and little is known about it, this study of
local studies collections in academic libraries is instead more concerned with
acquiring knowledge that may be used for ‘theory building’, as well as, in part, to fill
an intellectual gap for those whose interests lie in the direction of local studies
and/or academic library resources. Therefore, it is suggested that basic research –
the main purpose being to ‘acquire knowledge for its own sake’ – is the primary
research approach taken in the study.

3.2 Methods and Approaches: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods
Research

Teddlie and Tashakkori state that ‘Mixed methodologists present an alternative to
the QUAN [Quantitative Methods] and QUAL [Qualitative Methods] traditions by
advocating the use of whatever methodological tools are required to answer the
research questions under study.’10p.7 When designing the research for this study, it
was decided early on that a mixed methodology, combining qualitative and
quantitative approaches, would prove most useful. As noted further on in this
chapter, the intention of the research was not simply to present findings comprised
of quantifiable data relating to how many libraries hold local studies collections, or

44

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
the percentage of collections that date back to the 1900s. While quantitative
research certainly was deemed important in order to gather data of this ilk with a
view to gaining an immediate overview of the content, scope, and purpose of local
collections within academic libraries, it was also reckoned equally important to
gather data that is not quantifiable.

Glazier and Powell note that ‘qualitative research’ is known in the literature under a
number of different terms. These terms include: naturalistic inquiry, ethnographic
research, field work, observation, and grounded theory research. As the authors
suggest, ‘The concept [of qualitative research] seems to be confusing not only
because of the number of terms applied, but also because it carries different
connotations for different people.’11p.6 The complexity of defining qualitative
research is reflected by Glazier and Powell’s suggestion that, ‘Perhaps the best way
to understand what is meant by qualitative research is to determine what it is not’:

It is not procedures that predominantly rely on statistical analysis for
inferences. It is not a set of procedures that rely predominantly on
quantitative measures as a means of data gathering. It is not a set of
preliminary data-gathering procedures intended to be used as a device for
determining what nonqualitative methods should be employed for a
project.12p.6

In determining what qualitative research is, the authors cite Strauss and Corbin’s
assertion that ‘Qualitative research … can be understood in terms of the means of
collection and the type of data collected.’ These means include a fairly broad range
of data collection techniques, sometimes incorporating a similarly broad range of
types of data, such as, ‘observations, interviews, content analysis of documents,
articles, books, audio- and videotapes, even descriptive statistics such as census
data.’13p.6 Yet, given the range of techniques described, how useful such an
approach is to determining the nature or purpose of qualitative research, is
somewhat debatable. More informative, perhaps, is the authors’ claim that ‘The
strength of qualitative data is its rich description. Researchers strive to capture the
45

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
essence of a subject by using description that yields generalizations documented by
specific examples of data from the field. Qualitative data can be said to yield more
contextually detailed data – richer data.’ The authors go on to explain that ‘along
with the data collected, one also gets a description of what activities were going on
around the phenomenon in terms of time and social circumstances surrounding
it.’14p.6-7

Pickard expands further on this suggestion of qualitative research’s ability to provide
a deeper, fuller set of data, looking at quantitative and qualitative research in terms
of ‘two separate belief systems, two conflicting paradigms’15p.14 that can contribute
very different kinds of data to the study. Citing Gorman and Clayton,16pp.24-28 she
notes the ‘basic assumptions’ of qualitative versus quantitative research:

quantitative methodology assumes the objective reality of social facts;
qualitative methodology assumes social constructions of reality.17p.13

As suggested throughout the thesis – and in particular, in the introduction to
Chapter Five – one of the issues that emerged most strongly during both the
preliminary investigation and the research itself, is how large a part perception plays
when considering attitudes towards local studies and its resources. While the
researcher is reluctant to make a claim that the research undertaken was an
unambiguous study in ‘social constructions of reality’, a good part of this reluctance
would be due to the association of social constructionism with sociology and
communication theories, an association that would risk misrepresenting the study’s
primary focus or, indeed, take the study into an entirely different realm. Within the
context of the study, however, the distinction between ‘facts’ and (not necessarily
factual) perception is an important one.

Cresswell, citing Bogdan and Biklen, Eisner, and Merriam, provides a concise
summary of characteristics of qualitative research: Natural setting (field focused) as
source of data; Researcher as key instrument of data collection; Data collected as
words or pictures; Outcome as process rather than product; Analysis of data
46

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
inductively, attention to particulars; Focus on participants’ perspectives, their
meaning; Use of expressive language; Persuasion by reason.18p.16

Addressing the question of why a person engages ‘in such a rigorous design’,
Cresswell posits that ‘To undertake qualitative research requires a strong
commitment to study a problem and demands time and resources. Qualitative
research shares good company with the most rigorous quantitative research, and it
should not be viewed as an easy substitute for a “statistical” or quantitative
study.’19p.16 The author elaborates on the commitment and rigour necessary to
undertake this type of research, highlighting that the researcher must be ‘willing’ to
do the following:

•

Commit to extensive time in the field. This includes collecting ‘extensive
data’ and laboring ‘over field issues of trying to gain access, rapport, and
an “insider” perspective.’

•

Engage in the complex, time-consuming process of data analysis – the
ambitious task of sorting through large amounts of data and reducing
them to a few themes or categories.’ Cresswell suggests that ‘the task is
challenging’ in particular because of the ‘complex texts and images’ that
comprise the database.

•

Write long passages, because the evidence must substantiate claims and
the writer needs to show multiple perspectives. The author adds that ‘the
incorporation of quotes to provide participants’ perspectives’ will also
have a bearing on the length of the study.

•

Participate in a form of social and human science research that does not
have firm guidelines or specific procedures and is evolving and changing
constantly. This particular task, according to Cresswell, ‘complicates’ the
difference between ‘telling others how one plans to conduct a study and
how others might judge it’ once the study is completed.20p.16-17

47

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
While not every area of engagement with qualitative research made here by
Cresswell can be neatly checked off when it comes to the present study, the points
are reflected to varying degrees in the research undertaken by the researcher. By
undertaking ‘field’ visits to academic libraries and relevant departments, studying
the collections within their ‘natural’ environment, and conducting interviews and
discussing relevant issues with collection managers, the researcher attempted to
gain an ‘insider’ perspective with the intention of providing both further context and
depth to the study. Similarly, the analysis carried out comprised a great deal more
than simply adding figures obtained during the survey stages of the study; rather,
the study required engagement with ‘complex’ texts (and images), with the aim of
exploring local studies and academia in ways that had not been done prior. When it
came to presenting the study’s findings, the researcher was particularly concerned
with building a narrative that incorporated multiple perspectives in order to
interrogate the subject matter to its fullest extent. As suggested earlier, the point of
the study was never simply to present ‘facts and figures’ about local studies
resources within colleges and universities, but to alter the framework itself of local
studies and its place in academic libraries – to shine a light on local studies resources
that would ultimately uncover aspects of the subject that have, heretofore, been
neglected. In order to do this, it was essential to look at not only the ‘what’, but the
‘why’ and ‘how’, all of which necessitated examining – often contradictory – opinions
and perspectives from a variety of sources, including different authors and ‘experts’,
collection managers, educators, and users; through a number of different methods
and resources, including books, articles, interviews and observation, in addition to
the opinions and perspectives offered by librarians and collection managers during
the survey stage.

The methods employed in order to acquire knowledge in the case of the present
survey were informed by the aims and objectives, as set out in the introduction. As
Burton notes:

The researcher must have a clear definition of the objectives of the research
before being able to ask the appropriate questions. Stating the objective as,
48

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
for example, ‘to study library users’ is too vague: it begs the question ‘who is
a library user?’, what constitutes library use, and so on.”21p.63

The methodologies used to achieve these objectives, however, cannot necessarily be
broken down to match each objective in turn. Rather, the methods and techniques
reflected either the depth of coverage or the angle from which a particular issue was
approached. In this way, a more integrated and comprehensive approach to the
subject was permitted.

Given the study’s aims and objectives, the research methodology was also
considered with a view to collecting data both qualitative and quantitative in nature.
For instance, in order to ascertain the content, scope and purpose of collections the
question of ‘how many?’ was necessary; for example, how many libraries or LRCs
hold local studies collections, or how many collections are employed for use in
specific courses? Moreover, enquiries were frequently worded in order to elicit an,
albeit limited qualitative response to which a quantitative response could also be
applied, for instance, which courses does the library’s local collection support? This
not only indicated how local studies collections are being used, but also the overall
scope of the collections’ use in academic libraries. However, the primary purpose of
the research is not simply to be a statistical survey on the current situation. Rather,
the study seeks to posit its data within the context of relevant issues concerning the
areas of local studies, academic libraries and pedagogy, as well as theories and
philosophies related to each.

The methods used comprised the following: secondary source research; and primary
research incorporating questionnaire surveys, observational visits, and interviews. A
detailed overview of the research methods employed follows, but can be
summarised here:

1. Secondary Sources

A review and examination of the literature was carried out in order to
give context to the study.

3.2.1 Secondary Sources

3.2.1.1 Literature Search

Busha and Harter describe a literature search as follows:

A literature search (or literature review) is an attempt to identify,
locate, and synthesize completed research reports, articles, books,
and other materials about the specific problems of a research
topic.22p.19

When conducting any piece of contemporary research, secondary sources are
frequently important for establishing background information and context. When
researching an area of study hitherto neglected in the literature, it is perhaps
judicious to clarify Busha and Harter’s statement by suggesting that the secondary

50

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
literature can be drawn upon and applied to ‘the specific problems of a research
topic’. The majority of material drawn upon for this particular research, for instance,
was commonly written from a broader and/or different perspective; only one piece
of writing was about what might be described as the ‘specific problem of local
studies collections in academic libraries’.

The literature search was, therefore, begun by identifying the parameters for this
secondary study. Having identified, through a preliminary study of the literature, the
problem to be researched as well as the aims and objectives that would best serve
the investigation, it was decided that the majority of material employed would focus
on the following areas: local studies; academic libraries; and further and higher
education teaching and learning. The absence of literature pertaining to all three
was, by the time of the study’s original proposal, a given; as was the near-absence of
material on local studies and academic libraries. Texts based on the academic library
and its relationship to teaching and learning was more commonplace; but, given the
study’s focus, the researcher was prepared to have to select the material carefully in
order to keep it relevant to the research.

Three primary methods for identifying appropriate texts were employed:

1. Use of prior knowledge, such as authors’ names or relevant journals.

2. Knowledge of Michael Dewe as probably the foremost authority in the field
of local studies in the United Kingdom, for instance, provided the literature
search with a useful starting-point. His two volumes, Local Studies
Collections: A Manual are invaluable resources, compiling articles from wellregarded figures in the field such as Dewe himself, Derryan Paul, Ian
Jamieson, Valerie Bott, Bernard Nurse and others. Similarly, journals already
known to the researcher were consulted, such as Local Studies Librarian and
Local History. In addition, citations and references were followed up when
appropriate.

51

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
3. Identifying appropriate terms.

Common terms such as ‘local studies’, ‘local history’ and ‘academic libraries’ were
employed in order to identify texts that may be relevant to the study. Library
catalogues and journals were consulted and, with reference to these terms,
potentially useful items found.

4. Formulating appropriate terms for use in electronic searching, involving
Boolean logic, truncation and proximity indicators.

Two primary library, information and education science abstracting services were
used: ERIC (Education Resources Information Center) and LISA (Library and
Information Science Abstracts). Phrases employed at the initial stage were
deliberately quite broad in order to provide a relatively wide overview of the
situation regarding available material. This would enable items to be identified that
not only related directly to the subject of the PhD, but would guide the researcher to
more general articles that may aid in supplying background information on the issue
of local studies and its relationship with academia.

Phrases included terms (and appropriate grammatical variations or ‘wildcards’ when
permitted) such as ‘library’, ‘local studies’ or ‘local history’, ‘academia’, and so on. A
typical search thread, for instance, would be: Local studies OR local history (AND
Educat*).

The results obtained from this particular method were, not surprisingly, quite varied.
While subject indexing has arguably come a long way when it comes to electronic
searching, limitations that are difficult to surmount or bypass remain evident, thus
leaving room for much material that ultimately proved irrelevant. Narrowing terms,
therefore, often became necessary in order to produce a manageable number of
returns, such as adding the terms ‘higher’ or ‘further’ to the term ‘educat*’ .

52

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
When assessing the results gained from the searches, perhaps the most difficult task
– and one that cropped up with regard to all three primary methods – was judging
the value of material in terms of the study’s focus; that is, the ‘where to stop?’
question. It became apparent early on in the study that, while background and
context is, as mentioned, crucial to any piece of research where a ‘problem’ has
been identified, there is also the potential to ‘cast the net too wide’ thereby both
wasting valuable time in following roads of enquiry that ultimately lead to
irrelevancy, and risking putting the research itself off course. Frequent referral to
the aims and objectives of the study was, therefore, crucial in order that the study
remain focused when it came to identifying and employing secondary sources of
information.

A critical overview of the literature gathered and employed in the study is contained
within the thesis’ literature review.

3.2.2 Primary Sources
As Busha and Harter point out:

Seasoned investigators are generally wary of placing too much faith in
any one instrument or other technique; they tend to rely upon
multiple data-gathering methods.23p.54

While this may appear self-evident common sense, taking into account factors such
as time limitations, budget concerns, the availability of materials or persons who
might contribute to the research and so on, means the question of which
methodological techniques to employ has to be considered very carefully. Busha
and Harter have also noted that, in many cases, ‘the choice of a problem or topic
may depend upon the interests and capabilities of research workers, as well as the
time available to conduct the research.’24p.24 In this particular case, with the
‘problem’ already identified as the existence and purpose of local studies collections
within higher and further education libraries, it was decided that the best techniques

53

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
to employ in order to gain the most information in the proposed time would be
those that could contribute to an overview of the scale and scope of collections
across the country and could also aid in a deeper understanding of the issues
involved.

Two primary methods of investigation were therefore employed: a two-tiered
questionnaire survey, followed by the selection of a small number of institutions to
which observational visits could be made and interviews conducted.

3.2.2.1 The Questionnaire Survey

As noted above, both quantitative and qualitative data was required in order to
more fully inform the content, scope and purpose of local studies collections in
academic libraries. Indeed, employing both in the services of the study overall was
deemed not only crucial, but, in some instances, largely inescapable. When
discussing methodologies, for instance, Slater points to what might be termed as a
false dichotomy frequently characterised as ‘qualitative versus quantitative’
research. Although she acknowledges that, ‘within social research [...] there are two
schools of thought, methodology and practice, called quantitative research and
qualitative research,’ she also notes that, ‘all social research, and indeed other kinds
of research, involuntarily and unavoidably embrace some qualitative elements.’25p.108
As has hopefully been made clear so far, in the case of this particular study,
qualitative research and results were not simply regarded as secondary to, or a byproduct of, quantitative data; it was, however, recognised that there would
undoubtedly be occasions when, in addition to the qualitative information that was
deliberately sought, some qualitative data would emerge from other data that, on
the surface at least, seemed largely quantitative in nature. It should be noted,
however, that the term ‘qualitative data’ used here is referred to as such only in the
most limited way. Responses to open-ended questions in a survey may produce data
that offers insight or knowledge beyond that provided by, say, a ticked box or a circle
on a Likert Scale, but, as Pickard notes, ‘In my opinion [rich, detailed, qualitative

54

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
data] does not include answers to open-ended questions in a questionnaire; this is
rarely, if ever, qualitative data.’26p.267

The first stage of data collection was the initial questionnaire survey. One of the
characteristics of survey research is that it enables the researcher to target a sample
population in order to allow, as Busha and Harter put it, ‘generalizations to be made
about characteristics, opinions, beliefs, attitudes and so on, of the entire population
being studied.’;27p.54 and it was primarily for this reason – the ability to target a
population that may allow for generalisations – that questionnaire research was
adopted as one technique. Potential downsides to such an approach were
considered, but reckoned unavoidable. For instance, as noted by Paul Burton,
‘Response rates tend to be low [...] the questionnaire is put aside for answering in
the near future, and is then forgotten or completed too late. There is, after all, little
apparent incentive to complete a questionnaire.’28p.62 In this case, while indeed no
immediate ‘incentive’ was offered, it was perceived that targeting libraries with a
questionnaire, the purpose of which was, ultimately, to aid in research that may
benefit libraries in the future, might be presumed to be an incentive in itself.
However, the response rate was not high. Burton proposes that ‘60% or more is very
acceptable [...] anything less than 50% represents a minority, and in some cases this
will effectively render the results of little or no practical value.’29pp.62-63

Of 802 libraries or Learning Resource Centres targeted initially with the first
questionnaire, 223 useable responses were received, providing a response rate of
27.81%; well under 50%, but over a quarter. However, Burton further suggests that
‘it can be argued that even a response rate of less than 50% tells the researcher
something about the problem under study: a slight trend may be detectable, a
grouping of attitudes may be evident, etc.’30p.63 In this case, since the population
was targeted quite specifically (university and college libraries and learning resource
centres), with the area of enquiry focused narrowly on a particular subject-matter
(local studies collections), a 28% response rate was reckoned a reasonable if not
outstanding result; indeed, as will be discussed later, the response rate and the

55

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
concept of ‘self-selection’ arguably provides a further ‘finding’ as to attitudes
towards the subject under question itself.

3.2.2.1.1 Institutions: Selection

In order to maximise the present survey’s potential as a tool for better
understanding the situation across the nation, it was decided to target - as far as
possible - every further and higher institution in Scotland, England, Wales and
Northern Ireland, thereby expanding both the scale and scope of the 1984 survey.
Institutions and departments were also targeted regardless of the subjects taught,
meaning that libraries chiefly concerned with scientific resources were just as likely
to be targeted as those whose holdings primarily comprise materials supporting arts,
social sciences, education and librarianship itself. It was, however, deemed
appropriate to exclude those further education establishments identified as ‘sixth
form colleges’. This system is exclusive to England and Wales and is largely
undertaken as part of the student’s secondary education (the Scottish equivalent is
‘sixth year studies’). Therefore, they did not properly cover the researcher’s
intended focus of study.

Of the targeted colleges and universities, the following categories can be identified:
further and higher education colleges (both separate and combined); universities;
and Oxford and Cambridge University colleges and departments. With reference to
the last-mentioned institutions, the sheer size and range of different college and
departmental libraries meant that a single questionnaire sent to the main library
would most likely not suffice in terms of representing either the institution as a
whole or individual sectors where local studies might be an issue. Each college and
department was, therefore, treated as a separate entity for the purposes of the
study.

56

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches

3.2.2.1.2 Distribution Lists: Compilation
The questionnaire was distributed to 802 libraries and Learning Resource Centres
(LRCs), including a few to whom paper questionnaires were posted, with the
researcher unable to contact a small number of institutions that had been identified.
Given that the questionnaire was being sent to libraries and LRCs, it was decided that
adopting a Web-based format for the questionnaire, with a link sent via e-mail to
potential respondents, was a reasonable and appropriate means of distribution; and
the response rate of just over a quarter (223) was, as mentioned earlier, as expected.
A significant majority of institutions contacted were identified as further education
colleges. Worth noting, however, is that almost the same number of these colleges
as those who identified themselves as universities responded. It may be speculated
that further education colleges, with both less traditional ‘standing’ in communities
and less history to draw on, are therefore less likely to hold local studies collections
than are university libraries. Furthermore, with regard to the survey responses
overall, it might be suggested that an element of ‘self-selection’ was involved when
it came to those who did, in fact, respond; that is, those institutions that lack such a
collection were less likely to respond than those who do. Although the
questionnaire e-mail pointed out that the researcher was just as interested in finding
out about institutions where local collections were absent, it is arguable that those
libraries that do hold these materials are, to some extent, pre-disposed to having an
interest in a survey on local studies collections, whereas such an interest - and thus
inclination to be involved in such a survey - is less likely in libraries or LRCs that do
not hold local studies material.

It was not, however, unexpected that some colleges or universities would be
excluded. Time constraints meant that not every single possible source of
information relating to such institutions could be checked, but the sources used
were considered suitable for compiling a comprehensive list. These sources
primarily comprised the online Bubl directory; and the 2003/2004 World of Learning
directory. The World of Learning listings that were consulted consisted of ‘Libraries
and Archives’; ‘Universities’; and ‘Colleges’. Bubl, however, was considered a more

57

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
comprehensive source, covering a much wider range and number of institutions.
This online directory was used initially, with World of Learning later employed for,
primarily, cross-checking purposes. As an additional check, the online listings ‘UK
Universities and Colleges’ and ‘UK Higher Education and Research Libraries’ were
employed, but neither site was able to provide additional information. Bubl contains
a number of sub-directories under different headings, with many institutions
featured on more than one of these separate listings. By carefully checking each
different list, the likelihood of a particular institution escaping the process of
identifying potential respondents was reduced. The Bubl sub-directories checked
consisted of the following: Further Education Colleges; University and College
Libraries; Academic Libraries; UK Higher Education College Home Pages; Universities
and Colleges in ... [organised by country, with London as a further, separate subdirectory]; and UK University Home Pages.
Where possible, the institution’s Chief Librarian or Head of Learning Resource
Centres was targeted. This was in order to avoid the questionnaire e-mail becoming
‘lost’ and therefore overlooked within a more general library e-mail system. College
and university websites were consulted in order to obtain names and e-mail
addresses. In the majority of cases, however, particularly with regard to college
websites, individuals’ names were not included on library or learning resource centre
web pages and so telephone calls were made to the institutions in order to obtain
the required information, although in a minority of instances, general library e-mail
addresses were eventually used.
Furthermore, an e-mail was distributed through Jiscmail, a discussion list service
focusing primarily on education and information science.
Hard-copy versions of both questionnaires can be found in Appendix 1:
Questionnaires.

58

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches

3.2.2.1.3 The First Questionnaire

Since the number of institutions to be targeted was so large, it was decided that
more than one questionnaire would be required in order to a) prevent the receipt of
an unmanageable amount of data to be analysed at a later date; and b) avoid the
possibility of deterring potential respondents by presenting a large questionnaire in
the first instance. Questions were put together with the study’s aims and objectives
the main focus. The ‘first stage’ questionnaire was relatively short and
straightforward, with questions largely concerned with the existence of local studies
items in college and university libraries. One of the primary questions, for instance,
was whether or not the targeted library or learning resource centre actually housed
a local studies collection. Respondents who replied ‘no’ were requested to supply
reasons as to why this was the case, if such a collection might be considered for the
future, and where users with local studies enquiries were directed. These questions
were considered essential to the study, since it was reckoned the absence of a
collection might well be related to wider issues of library resources, or suggest ways
in which the academic library perceives its role in the information sector, for
instance, as a limited service, where the public library is relied upon to take
responsibility for certain fields of knowledge.

Respondents who answered ‘yes’ were asked a series of questions relating to the
location, the size and the age of the collection, and were asked whether or not he or
she would be willing to take further part in the study. These questions were not only
reckoned fundamental in providing a foundation for the second stage of the study,
but individual questions regarding, for instance, the size and organisation of the
collection would provide useful information on the value placed on local studies
resources in university and college libraries and LRCs. In addition, in terms of the
study’s third aim, a more practical goal was achieved in establishing which
institutions do or do not have a local studies collection, thus providing information
that can be used when compiling the local studies material inventory.

59

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
By adopting the technique of distributing a more general questionnaire to begin
with, an overview of the national situation could be gauged; libraries with no local
studies collection could be immediately discounted from further involvement; and
those libraries with a collection, whose interest in the study was evident, could be
marked for more detailed involvement at later stages.

3.2.2.1.4 The Second Questionnaire

For this stage of the survey, respondents who had expressed an interest in
contributing further to the study were targeted. The questions posed focused on a
more thorough investigation of collection management practices, such as indexing,
classification and access; the types of materials held, including formats; future plans
– if any – for the collection; and also how the resources relate to subjects covered in
the curriculum and are used for staff and student research. This last-mentioned, in
keeping with the study’s aims, was intended to draw out responses that related to
the purpose of the collections – that is, how the collections are used – and was
considered one of the foremost lines of enquiry for the study.

In terms of administrative details, this time the respondent’s name was required so
that a more ‘personalised’ introduction could be made for when the third stage of
the study was being organised.

3.2.2.1.5 Questionnaire Pilot

In order to maintain the integrity of the survey sample, it was decided that the pilot
would be limited to the Georgina Scott Library at the Robert Gordon University. This
ensured that a) all other libraries and LRCs identified could be targeted in order to
provide as broad a sample as possible for the survey proper; and b) there would be
no ‘conflict of interest’ in terms of the study including the researcher’s host
institution. Since, however, it was also recognised that limiting the pilot in this way
may risk ‘errors’ or ‘flaws’ passing undetected, the questionnaires were also sent to

60

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
Michael Dewe for critical comment. Not only was Dewe one of the co-authors of the
earlier preliminary research and article that had helped inspire the present project
and influenced the types of questions asked in the questionnaires, but Dewe, as
noted in the literature review that follows, was the pre-eminent voice in local studies
in the United Kingdom at this time, and had both expressed enthusiasm and offered
support for the project at the earliest stage.

3.2.2.1.6 Questionnaire Analysis

Data from both questionnaires was recorded using the SPSS (Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences) research program. Retrospectively, it could be that a more
appropriate program designed specifically for qualitative research might have been
used. SPSS is a very powerful tool for statistical research, but requires the
researcher to assign codes to each potential entry. Whilst this was not a problem
when dealing with closed questions that required a limited response, i.e. those that
allowed the respondent to select one option from a list of possible responses; it
became more difficult when either more than one response was permitted or when
the question allowed for an open answer. With the open-question responses, it was
therefore decided initially to code by type of response – that is, to group responses
in terms of their similarity to each other – and to assign a code to each type. The
‘more than one possible option’ responses were dealt with in a more pragmatic way
that assigned a code to each permutation based on a breakdown of each individual
element. SPSS did allow for a useful overview of the current situation, with the
statistical information gathered providing a good indication of some of the basic
‘facts’ from which findings and conclusions could be drawn. Given the nature of
many of the questions and responses, however, what SPSS could not do was
effectively capture replies where the ‘real’ story lay in the intimated complexity of
potentially ambiguous statements, typified by phrases such as: ‘Yes, but...’ These
types of responses were, therefore, dealt with in a more qualitative fashion,
providing not only data that exemplified the often unique flavour of local studies
within an academic setting, but valuable context for the research problem.

61

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
Excel was used as a second quantitative analysis tool that allowed for a little more
‘flexibility’ in terms of having an arguably more user-friendly interface that enabled
information to be accessed and referenced more readily, and that also permitted a
degree of qualitative input that, again, could be accessed quite easily.

3.2.2.2 Observational Visits

Visits to the libraries, for the most part, comprised two main elements: an interview
with the questionnaire respondent; and a guided ‘tour’ of the collections. Of
observation as a research method, Pickard notes that ‘the extent to which you [the
researcher] enter the lives of others depends on your own situation, the purpose of
the research, and the duration of the research and accessibility of the research
site’.31p.203 However, while the observational research described here commonly
involves approaches such as participant observation, semi-participant observation
and non-participant observation, in the context of the present study, ‘observation’
refers to the researcher gaining a first-hand impression of the actual collections,
rather than surveying, or taking part in, the processes involved in the running of the
libraries or special collections departments.

The primary intention of the interviews was to follow-up on the responses provided
in the questionnaires; the exception to the questionnaire ‘follow-up’ aspect from the
off-set, however, was the University of Leicester. Professor Harold Fox had not
responded to the questionnaire, but was contacted separately since the Department
of English Local History’s involvement was considered crucial to the study.

In addition, while an early suggestion had been made by the researcher as to the
possibility of focus group interviews, which would necessitate the questionnaire
respondent’s involvement in aiding with arrangements for this, responses to this
enquiry suggested that the respondents would find it difficult to help in the
organisation of such a group. A further request was therefore made that, if possible,
the researcher’s details might be passed on to teaching staff or students with an
interest in local studies so that he or she could be interviewed at some point either
62

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
during the visit or at a later stage. While this suggestion produced varying results, it
was, however, also borne in mind that, during the visits themselves, it might be
possible to approach staff or students for on-the-spot ‘interviews’ and this turned
out to be the case in Leicester, Keele, and North Lindsay College, where
undergraduate students, a researcher, and an adult-education tutor were
interviewed. North Lindsey College was, in addition, the only institution where a
formal meeting had been arranged between the respondent and members of staff.

The interviews with the questionnaire respondents took the form of semi-structured
interviews, with pre-prepared questions serving as both definite enquiries and
starting points for more open discussion. The pre-planned questions were drawn
from a number of sources: some questions specifically followed up on responses
originally given at the questionnaire stage of the research; others were prompted by
more general issues raised through secondary reading or preliminary findings; while
further questions were encouraged after additional research was undertaken of the
institution itself before and after visits were arranged. Additional questions, as per
the semi-structured format, grew from the resulting discussion.

Pickard succinctly sums up the purpose of interviews as a research method when she
states that ‘We interview when that is the most appropriate way to access the data
we need.’32p.172 Interviews, as Busha and Harter suggest, can be a useful survey tool,
providing a means of gathering information that often relies on ‘the experience and
opinions of people’.33p.78 While the interviews conducted for this study were not
intended to cover the same geographic scope and scale as the questionnaire, their
use in a few cases (as detailed below) allowed information to be drawn that arguably
could not have been captured by a questionnaire. Pickard, for example, notes that
‘Interviews are usually used when we are seeking qualitative, descriptive, in-depth
data that is specific to the individual and when the nature of the data is too
complicated to be asked and answered easily.’34p.172 Furthermore, as Busha and
Harter point out, ‘Verbal responses of the interviewee are often valuable, original
evidence or research data’ and can often provide ‘useful insights [...] both from what
is said and from what is not said.’35p.78 In addition, it may be suggested that
63

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
interviewees are more likely to offer honest opinions in a face-to-face setting than
they are when faced with a formal-looking document that may only be able to
provide limited space with which to express their own views. It should, of course, be
borne in mind that, as suggested by the descriptions of the types of data that can be
usefully gathered through an interview, responses are likely to contain a significant
degree of subjectivity and possible bias. As Pickard notes:

You are discovering individual opinions; the information you get from
interviews is different from pure factual data. If you want precise dates,
times or measurements […] interviews are not really the most appropriate
tool to use […] you talk to people to discover what they think, feel and
remember about events.36p.172

As mentioned earlier in the thesis, how collections and issues relating to local studies
and academia are perceived formed a common thread throughout the research. In
other words, the information sought by the researcher was not limited to hard facts
and figures. That said, certain types of data raised during the interview process, such
as dates or the involvement of specific named actors in the development of local
studies within academia, were double-checked through other means to ensure that
the information offered by the interviewee was accurate.

In terms of the ‘impromptu’ interviews with students, researchers and tutors, since
prior knowledge was not a factor, enquiries tended to be drawn instead from a
broader, less specific, set of basic ‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘how’ questions. In addition, the
researcher was not forewarned that the formal meeting with two members of staff
at North Lindsey College had been organised. Questions, again, were drawn from a
broader, less specific base, but also from issues raised during the semi-structured
interview with the college Librarian. Additionally, the researcher was made aware of
a short series of presentations taking place that evening concerning local history
research undertaken by former college students now at University. The presentation
was attended and notes taken afterwards during a short discussion with two of the
presenters (because of the short notice given, no time was allowed for recording
64

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
equipment to be re-charged and the nature of the venue did not allow for mainssupplied back-up).

In terms of the difference between planning and carrying out research, a further
example was provided during the visit to the University of Leicester. While the
meeting with Professor Fox had been arranged and was conducted as expected, an
additional visit to the main library was organised by Professor Fox during the
interview. A questionnaire had been sent to the main library, but a non-response
and a follow-up enquiry had led the researcher to conclude that her efforts were
better-spent on the Library of the Department of English Local History. However,
during the interview, it transpired that – following a request for help by the
researcher – Professor Fox had intended to arrange a visit to the main library and
pass this information on to the researcher, but had not done so. A visit was thus
quickly arranged for the following morning during which a tour of the local studies
main stock was given, although the short-notice meant that a formal interview could
not be conducted with the librarian at this time. In addition, however, it was
discovered that a questionnaire had, to the librarian’s knowledge, been completed
but had been lost in the delegation process. Another questionnaire was left with the
library and received the following week, thereby rounding out the University of
Leicester’s valuable involvement in the PhD project.
Local public libraries were also visited in Reading, Scunthorpe, and St Andrews for
comparative purposes when the public library’s local studies collection was an
obvious issue. This was not a pre-planned element of the fieldwork, but in the cases
mentioned above, there was both the impetus and opportunity to conduct these
observational visits.
The timetable for visits and interviews was as follows:
•

28 September 2005: Bridget Andrews, MERL Library Project Manager,
The Museum of English Rural Life, University of Reading.

•

10 October 2005: Norman Reid, Head of Special Collections (Keeper of
Manuscripts), University of St Andrews.
65

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
•

18 October 2005: Professor Harold Fox, Department of English Local
History, University of Leicester.
- 19 October 2005 comprised a visit to the main University Library,
arranged by Professor Fox as described above.

•

20 October 2005: Helen Burton, Special Collections and Archives
Assistant, Keele University.

•

24-25 October 2005: Belinda Allen, Learning Resources Manager, North
Lindsay College.
- An interview was arranged by Ms Allen, for 25 October 2005, with
Degree Course Leader, Pat Henderson and English and History tutor,
Stephanie Codd.

•

3 March 2006: Michael Dewe, telephone interview.

•

19 December 2006: Michael Dewe, reflective questions sent.

Schedules for pre-organised interviews are found in Appendix 2: Interview Schedules
for Semi-Structured Interviews. Given that the interviews were deliberately semistructured, so as to allow for freer conversation, and the researcher was prepared
for the possibility that some responses may render subsequent questions irrelevant,
the schedules themselves cover only a sample of questions actually asked.

3.2.2.2.1 Observational Visits: Selection

The libraries selected for inclusion in the third stage of data collection were not
intended to be a representative sample insofar as choosing the widest possible
sample in terms of attitudes towards the collecting of local studies material. There
would have been little point, for instance, in visiting a library with no local studies
collection to speak of. Also, much as it would have been desirable to undertake
visits that would represent a broad geographical sweep as well as libraries of every
academic strata, practical concerns, such as time and resources did have to be taken
into consideration. Instead, purposive sampling was employed that resulted in a
small number of libraries being selected.

66

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches

As its name suggests, the aim of purposive sampling is, according to Maxwell,
sampling where ‘particular settings, persons, or events are deliberately selected for
the important information they can provide that cannot be gotten as well from other
choices’;37p.87 sampling that is, as Tashakkori and Teddlie put it, ‘based on a specific
purpose rather than randomly.’38p.713 The authors provide an overview of this type
of sampling method, noting that purposive sampling:

addresses specific purposes related to research questions; therefore, the
researcher selects cases that are information rich in regard to those
questions … [that] samples are often selected using the expert judgment of
researchers and informants … [that] sampling procedures focus on the
‘depth’ of information that can be generated by individual cases … [and] are
typically small … but the specific sample size depends on the type of QUAL
research being conducted and the research questions.39pp.173-174

Comprising a number of different techniques, three types of purposive sampling can
be identified as having informed the present study: homogenous sampling; extreme
(or deviant) sampling; and expert sampling.

With regard to the first-mentioned technique, the homogeny primarily lies in the
common characteristic of the institutions holding – and by implication, sharing an
interest in – local studies. In this way, the researcher was able to include the
seemingly disparate institutions of, for example, the ancient university of St Andrews
and Scunthorpe’s North Lindsey College, which also offers some higher education
courses. Further ‘shared characteristics’ could also be found when considering the
relatively limited geographic scope of three of the institutions, whereby North
Lincolnshire’s Keele University and the aforementioned North Lindsey College in
Staffordshire, combined with the location of the University of Leicester, was thought
to provide a potentially useful survey of this middle segment of England.

67

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
One of the most relevant types of purposive sampling with regard to the research is
extreme or deviant sampling. As Teddlie and Tashakkori note, this type of sampling
– also known as outlier sampling – ‘involves selecting cases near the ends of the
distribution of cases of interest,’ and ‘involves selecting those cases that are the
most outstanding successes or failures related to some topic of interest’.40p.176 The
authors further suggest that these ‘successes or failures are expected to yield
especially valuable information about the topic of interest.’41p.176 As suggested
earlier, the University of Leicester’s English Local History department was reckoned a
potentially very valuable source of information. This is where formal academic
interest in local studies began and the university has maintained its reputation as the
foremost institution for local studies within an academic setting. A similar criteria
was employed for the Library of the Museum of English Rural Life (MERL), an
institution affiliated with the University of Reading. While it would be fair to
characterise this library as something of an anomaly if one were following a criteria
strictly based on ‘typical’ academic libraries with an interest in local studies, it was
considered a worthwhile pursuit to take a closer look at this well-respected
institution. It is important to bear in mind that one of the reasons that local studies
in academic libraries has been so neglected as a subject is because, in itself, it is
considered something of an anomaly; local studies is not a ‘typical’ academic subject
and the very nature of it (the ‘local’ factor often being related to a particular
geographical space) means that collections are unlikely to be standardised to any
real degree. Furthermore, the atypical nature of an institution should not
necessarily automatically discount it from inclusion within a survey – and certainly
not when it has a considerable reputation within the field of study. St Andrews
University Special Collections within the main library was chiefly selected because of
its status as a special collections department. Another characteristic of the broad
scope of local collections holdings is the range of material and the ways in which it
can be organised and managed. This means that it is not uncommon for a ‘local
studies collection’ to be categorised under the broader term of a ‘special collection’
and St Andrews was reckoned to provide a good example of this. These selections
also point to the third type of purposive sampling employed during the study: expert
sampling. What these particular institutions’ collection managers were able to
68

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
provide was a sound degree of knowledge regarding local studies, especially within
an academic setting; a degree of knowledge and insight that was unavailable
elsewhere, given the dearth of information on this specific subject. Whilst not
strictly a further example of ‘expert sampling’, a deliberate decision was also made
to interview Michael Dewe, as detailed below, who at that time, was the foremost
authority on local studies in the United Kingdom.

3.2.2.2.2 Data Recording

In order to capture as much information as possible within a relatively short period
of time, it was decided to record interviews with respondents; take written notes
when appropriate; and to take photographs of the collections, libraries, and
institutions when possible. While a picture may not, in the strictest sense, be worth
a thousand words, pictorial data can be employed as a useful supplement to
descriptions of the environment in which a collection exists and is used.

3.2.2.2.3 Further Interview

As the foremost expert in the field of local studies in the United Kingdom, it was
reckoned important to the study to have some significant input from Michael Dewe.
Dewe had expressed an interest in the project from the beginning and had provided
support and encouragement throughout and was willing to be involved in a more
formal capacity. A telephone interview was conducted with Dewe in which a series
of questions, again allowing for a semi-structured format, had been sent to the
interviewee in advance. Once again, the emphasis was on prompting a discussion
with the questions being drawn from questionnaire responses and issues raised
during visits to libraries. In addition to this, a set of ‘reflective questions’ (see:
Appendix 3: Reflective Questions) that had emerged during the data analysis stage of
the project was advanced to Michael Dewe later in the year. In this case, Dewe was
invited to take his time and reply in writing in order to allow a more considered

69

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches
response from him this time, while also adding a further dimension to the study in
terms of methodological approaches.

3.2.2.2.4 Qualitative Data and Interview Analysis

The analysis of qualitative data falls under four main strategies: phenomenological
strategies, ‘concerned with discovering the underlying structure of experiences’;
ethnographic methods, focusing on ‘the human experience as a whole – beliefs,
ways of living and relationships’; narrative or discourse analysis, which ‘relies on the
assumption that human experience is shaped, transformed and understood through
linguistic representation’; and constant comparative analysis, developed for use in
grounded theory, which ‘involves taking one piece of data and comparing it with all
others that may be similar or different in order to develop conceptualizations of the
possible relations between various pieces of data.’42pp.268-269.

It is the last-mentioned of these that has most relevance to the present study.
Elements of grounded theory are found in the research – no hypothesis was made
and the data was not approached with theories in mind; instead, any theories that
have emerged have been ‘grounded’ in the data. In addition, analysis has been
ongoing, taking place from the first stage of data collection on. By using constant
comparative analysis, the researcher was able to ask questions of the data
throughout (in terms of where similarities or differences might be found in relation
to other data) and form concepts that might encourage emerging theories. For
example, identifying categories relating to the term ‘local’ itself in interview data,
and comparing the content to similar categories located in other interviews, allowed
patterns and relationships to be identified (for example, acknowledgements of the
instability of the term), and contributed to the emergence of the term ‘local’ itself as
a theoretical concept (see, in particular, Chapters Five and Seven for analysis of this
term and its importance to local studies).

70

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches

3.2.2.2.4.1 Transcriptions

One of the problems with interview transcriptions is often that verbal responses –
frequently looser and less formulated than written responses – can contain as much
irrelevant ‘information’ as that which can be usefully integrated into the research.
Transcribing verbatim can also lead to the time-consuming and even more irrelevant
inclusion of every ‘um’, ‘ah’ and pause in the discussion – whether from the
interviewer or interviewee. Therefore, transcribing the interviews was approached
in an active way, where those parts of the interview that related to the research
were noted and any ‘extra’ information left out, with brief notes taken should the
need arise to revisit these segments of the interview.

3.2.2.2.4.2 Interview Analysis: Content

Because most of the interviews were conducted within the context of observational
visits to selected libraries, rather than attempt to quantify the responses given to
sometimes quite specific questions, the information gleaned from these sources
tended to be employed in an illustrative capacity. That is, the interviews often
provided a deeper understanding of issues raised in the questionnaires that provided
possible ‘explanations’ or ‘reasons’ behind certain responses that might be applied,
at least speculatively, to other institutions, albeit not explicitly. In other cases, such
as the Department of English Local History, the interview conducted with Professor
Harold Fox not only afforded the researcher valuable insight into issues concerned
with the nature of local history and its place in academia, but also offered a close
examination of the institution itself and its specific role in the development and
continuation of local studies as an academic pursuit.

71

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches

3.3 Conclusion

Busha and Harter have taken note of a particular tendency in library research,
observing that contributions have often ‘been concerned more with the collection of
information that allows library phenomena to be identified and described, rather
than for the purpose of explaining why and how library circumstances occur’. The
authors attribute this to an ‘apparent distrust of theory’, also suggesting that the
‘neglect of basic research in the field’ may be down to the ‘inadequate attention that
library schools have given to the need for instruction about research methods and
theory.’43p.8 Earlier, it was noted that the primary methodological approach taken in
this study is that of basic research – the acquisition of knowledge – with the
application of this knowledge a secondary, but not unwanted, goal. The methods
employed, a combination of survey research, observational visits, and interviews
aimed to fulfil these criteria.

In retrospect, one of the most important issues that arose in terms of reflecting on
the methodology employed for this study is that planning research and carrying out
research can frequently emerge as two very different experiences. While the
intention to keep the methods and approaches tied closely to the PhD’s aims and
objectives was largely adhered to, the planned execution of these methods was
chiefly where differences occurred. The cliché that ‘life is what happens when
you’re busy making other plans’ is one that could arguably be applied to the
experience of conducting a piece of research. In this case, fortunate timing, the
good will of others and unexpected contributions formed as much a part of the data
collection as did those elements that had been carefully mapped out; and often
helped provide a richer illustration of the issues involved than might have been the
case otherwise. The visit to Keele University, for example, enabled the researcher to
conduct interviews and observe the detail of the local collection within a location
that, due to elements such as the physical landscape in which the campus is located,
including historical buildings like Keele Hall, provided an excellent illustration of why
local studies is a draw for so many people, both amateur and professional.

72

Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches

Figure 1: Old Library, Keele Hall

Ultimately, however, throughout the undertaking of the research, an effort has been
made to utilise both planned and unplanned elements in such as way as to
effectively serve the study’s chief aims: to provide not only an overview of the
situation regarding the presence of local studies collections in academic libraries, but
to explore the reasons behind the existence of these collections. This means that
some aspects of the research that might have appeared essential at the planning
stage – or potentially ‘interesting’ when unexpected – may have, latterly, turned out
to be less relevant than originally thought as data was collected, collated, analysed
and organised; with the research then adjusted accordingly.

In the chapter that follows, an overview is given of the development of local studies
from an amateur pastime to academic pursuit, with particular attention paid to the
historical relationship between local collections and the public library.

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History

Chapter Four
The Evolution of Local History
4.1 Introduction

As suggested in the rationale for this thesis, part of the reason for the dearth of
material on local studies collections and their place in the academic library is the
‘natural’ tie local studies is perceived to have with the public sector. In a study
seeking to investigate the relationship between local studies collections and
academic libraries, it is therefore perhaps useful to take a look at attitudes toward
local studies as a pursuit and how perceptions and approaches may or may not have
altered in order to get to a place where the fact of local studies collections in
university and college libraries can be examined and the ‘how and why’ explored in a
more pragmatic sense. In this chapter, the history of local studies itself will be
examined in terms of its status within broader historical studies, and as both an
amateur and professional pursuit; its position within academia; and its place within
academic libraries, while also looking at how the role of the academic library itself
has been understood. It is also worth noting at this point that here, and in
subsequent chapters, it may appear at times that undue attention is being paid to
linguistic or semantic concerns. However, one of the most interesting aspects to
have evolved from this study has been the importance of semantics to the
understanding of how the subject of local studies and local history is perceived and
approached both by the public at large and by those who undertake these studies
themselves; and it is therefore deemed not only relevant, but vital to the project
itself to give this facet careful consideration.

4.2 Amateur, Professional, and Historical Studies

Professor Harold Fox of the Department of English Local History at the University of
Leicester offers an anecdote that, amusingly, implies the basic dichotomy that
arguably lies at the core of how local studies are perceived when studies of, as Bott

77

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
memorably puts it, ‘the lives of those whose anonymity is broken only by marriage,
apprenticeship or taxation’1p.9 are viewed in relation to research that focuses on
grander studies of (in)famous historical figures. Fox observes the tendency for
undergraduates studying history to choose figures such as Adolf Hitler as subjects of
investigation, figures who are overwhelmingly ingrained in the public consciousness
in terms of, not only their historical significance politically and in terms of broader
social and cultural impact, but also whose lives and deeds are perhaps able to draw
the researcher’s interest in a more visceral, almost prurient, way. The job of the
Department of English Local History is, Fox states, ‘to turn it around’ and encourage,
for instance, the study of ‘ordinary’ people or the places that students come from:
‘You’ll find death, sex and violence ... [but, of course] it’ll be ordinary sex, death and
violence ...’2
The tension between the ordinary and extra-ordinary within historical studies is one
not limited to observations about mainstream ‘versus’ local history. However, even
when looked at within a broader historical context, it does speak to the different
ways in which approaches to history have been perceived. Writing about Carr’s
seminal 1961 historiography study, What Is History?,3 Tosh observes that:

In Carr’s view history is the property of literate and powerful elites. There is
no sense that history might be claimed by the dispossessed or marginal, and
hence no intimation of what later came to be known as ‘history from below’
… For all his scepticism, Carr did not dispute the historicity of textual
evidence, and his conception of history was founded on the ‘grand narratives’
of progress and power.’4p.xi

Carr’s inability to, at that time, ‘intimate’ history as ‘belonging’ to those outside of
the elite or to recognise his own biases – even while taking more traditional
approaches to historiography to task – is perhaps understandable, given the ‘lofty’
reputation of much historical writing, a great deal of which may or may not be
influenced by the bias of historians that Carr had identified in his work. The myth of

78

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
‘objectivity’ and how it relates to the ‘status’ of historical knowledge is discussed by
Tosh:

Historical knowledge is not, and cannot be, ‘objective’ (that is, empirically
derived in its entirety from the object of the enquiry). This does not mean, as
sceptics might suppose, that it is therefore arbitrary or illusory. But, it does
follow that the assumptions and attitudes of historians themselves have to
be carefully assessed before we can come to any conclusion about the real
status of historical knowledge.5p.187

Indeed, even within recent activity undertaken in the field of local history itself (as
opposed to the early gentry-based studies of the sixteenth century discussed below),
the ‘history’ presented can be subject to a particular slant, often based, as DeSilvey
puts it, ‘on whose interests are served by the telling of particular kinds of stories in
particular contexts’. Of the narratives employed in the service of heritage sites,
DeSilvey writes:

Research … has considered how the re-inscription and re-invention of place is
accomplished through the promotion of selected ‘story-lines’, and the
attempted erasure of conflicting memories. At many protected heritage
properties a more benign narrative approach prevails, the history of place
presented as a linear chronological progression – punctuated with formative
events and changes of ownership – which lands us up gently in the present
moment of enlightened stewardship. Though perhaps lacking the overt
politics of the narrative strategies applied to contested sites, such narratives
still have a normative orientation, and work ‘in more-or-less formulaic ways
to make certain outcomes more logical and palatable than others’.6p.34

While DeSilvey’s ‘normative orientation’ does not necessarily refer to the types of
stories ‘owned’ by the grand elitists cited by Carr, there is little doubt that, until
relatively recently, a gulf has been perceived between ‘worthy’ historical studies and
‘less worthy’ local history. While the ways in which local history has ‘suffered’ under
79

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
the weight of an intellectually ‘amateur’ reputation, as mentioned in the
introduction to this thesis, and explored further on in this chapter, it is worth raising
at this point that this reputation is a long-standing one. As Beckett notes, even after
the publication of Gibbon’s The History of the Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire,
completed in 1788, where the ‘convergence of historical narrative and antiquarian
discourse [had] reached a notable milestone’

The true historian continued to preserve a lofty distance from the antiquary,
because history was perceived to be superior to the mere study of
antiquities. While the antiquary was busy discovering the past, the historian
was using that past as a vehicle to improve the present. The historian sought
to understand the grand panorama, while the antiquary seemed obsessed
with minutiae, which could have no bearing on the historical narrative.7p.90-91

As will be seen later on in this chapter, the ‘inferiority’ of local history would
eventually be challenged and recognition given to its complexity. Yet, within Fox’s
anecdotal observation cited earlier in this chapter perhaps lies a paradox – one of
many to be explored throughout this study – wherein it draws attention to what
might well be argued is both local studies’ greatest strength and weakness in terms
of how the subject is perceived: that is, the inherently parochial nature of a study
that focuses on a particular locale. The term ‘parochial’ does, of course, have two
fairly distinct, but related meanings, both of which might be applied to local studies
research and both in a relatively literal way: first, the term can be used to refer to a
parish – that is, a particular district with its own church or a small unit of government
found in rural areas – not infrequently the subject of ‘local history’; and ‘parochial’
can also be used to describe an approach to something that is rather narrow in
outlook or range. While the latter in particular is not synonymous with an approach
that is derogatively ‘amateurish’ in the commonly-used sense of the word, it is
perhaps the case that there has nevertheless existed a connotative aspect towards
the ‘parochial’ that sees studies that focus on the ‘smaller picture’ – that is, Fox’s
‘ordinary’ – as more inclined to attract, and perhaps more suited to, amateur

80

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
researchers. In turn, again speaking semantically, there has also perhaps been a
tendency for ‘amateur’ to be equated with ‘not to be taken too seriously’.

However, when studying the history of local studies or history research and writing,
what quickly becomes clear is that local studies has rarely existed in a convenient
box that can be labelled as either strictly amateur or professional. While the
common view has been that local studies exists largely as an amateur pursuit, both
the nature of the work undertaken and the issue of who wrote or continues to write
these histories, defies easy definition. As Derryan Paul observed in 1989, although
‘until very recently’ local history has been ‘predominantly a field for amateurs’, she
also points out that it ‘has been a subject of formal study since the sixteenth
century.8p.34

Indeed, as noted in chapter one, in its infancy, local studies – or, local history –
research was a pursuit chiefly undertaken by those in the ‘upper’ classes. Such
studies included, as Dewe notes, a ‘generalist approach’ by topographers and
cartographers such as John Leland and Christopher Saxon; but also the ‘individual
county history’ as well as ‘urban, parish and village histories’.9p.2 As Dewe
comments, this early local history research was oftentimes chiefly ‘concerned with
the description of places and the collection of facts’ and, while the writings that
were produced from this research remain valuable for this reason, ‘they do not
constitute local history as viewed today.’ He goes on to point out that because the
topics covered tended to concern matters related to the gentry – that is, ‘the
descent of the manor, pedigrees, ancient monuments and the church and its
fabric’10p.3 – the writings may well have presented a somewhat imbalanced view of
local affairs, although he does note that the kinds of resources ‘local historians take
for granted’ these days, were harder to come by, if at all, for those practicing the
antecedent of what we now know as local studies research. This does not mean,
however, that these early studies lacked rigour. In the case of John Leland, for
example, Beckett observes that he ‘set the pace,’ for more detailed studies, showing
‘why the topographer could not rely on previous chronicles, but needed to use
personal observation and first-hand research.’11p.22 Commissioned by Henry VIII,
81

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
Leland spent ten years travelling extensively to different parts of England, ‘making
maps, measuring distances, talking to local people and examining books and
charters.’12p.21 The meticulousness of Leland’s work, ‘trusted as an accurate record
of the destruction of monastic civilisation, the demolition of monastic buildings, and
the dispersal and destruction of monastic libraries’ led to others undertaking more
detailed investigations in order to reveal the origins of England ‘and to strip away
centuries of accumulated myth and legend that passed for history.’ It is interesting
to note that, even at the earliest stages of the roots of local history, these
antiquarian studies were rooted in a dissatisfaction with broader historical
‘knowledge’. As Beckett describes, the myths that ‘passed for history’ included ‘the
belief in a long line of English kings including Lear and Cymbeline, and the idea that
Joseph of Arimathea brought Christianity to Britain shortly after Christ’s life on
earth.’ In order to counter these claims, these antiquarians ‘worked with source
materials, many of them documents saved when monastic foundations were
dissolved.’13p.22

Yet, the reputation of local studies as an amateur pursuit is one that prevailed up
until, as Paul suggests, ‘very recently’. Part of the ‘problem’ might well be, as
pointed out earlier when discussing the study’s rationale, the ‘natural’ relationship
taken to exist between local history and the public library, the root of which can be
found at the very beginning of the public library sector itself. As Dixon notes, for
example, when citing the Public Libraries Bill of 1850, ‘from the start, it was
recognized that libraries should be repositories for material of a local nature’, having
already noted that ‘the early history of local collections in public libraries is
inextricably linked [researcher’s emphasis] to that of the public library service.’14pxiii

Indeed, the explicit nature of the ‘recognition’ by parliament suggests the
importance with which local history was regarded in terms of the duty of the public
library – that is, its remit to provide a service to the public – to make such materials
available. Ansell writes of this influence on local history collections within the public
library of the 1849 Select Committee on Public Libraries and the Public Libraries Act
1850. He notes that the former report ‘did briefly touch upon the importance of
82

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
including local history – or as they were then known ‘topographical’ –
collections’15p.28 and also cites the report’s recommendation that ‘Topographical
Libraries’ should be present in ‘all our chief provincial towns [...] where history may
find a faithful portraiture of local events, local literature, and local manners; and art
and science a collection of all objects illustrative of the climate, soil, and resources of
the surrounding country.’16p.29 When, in the following year, the Committee
Chairman, William Ewart, introduced the Public Libraries Bill to the House of
Commons, he once again, as Ansell puts it, referred ‘to the claims of local history as
an indispensable feature of the public library.’17p29

It becomes clear, then, that local history as a subject for study was posited within the
public sector from the get-go, thus possibly, at the very least, planting the seeds of
its amateur reputation. Yet, as can be seen, it is also evident that this reputation has
not entirely been deserved and, instead, as proposed earlier, two threads composed
of amateur and professional local studies research have existed throughout – and
continue to inform the types of research carried out in the name of local history.
Bott makes this suggestion explicit when she identifies a difference between the
amateur and professional local historian. While she observes that the work
produced by amateurs is often of a ‘very high’ standard, she suggests that these
amateurs, who, by and large, tend to focus on a locality that they are already familiar
with, are oftentimes ‘working for love of the place and their subject [and] may allow
themselves a little parochialism’. On the other hand, professional local historians are
frequently ‘more detached’ in their approach, ‘seeking to identify both the typical
and exceptional through a comparison of different communities.’18pp.8-9 It is perhaps
in this difference, therefore, that the common reputation attributed to the local
historian can be found, where, as mentioned earlier, the connotative implications of
‘parochialism’ has led to an equation being made with ‘amateurism’, while the more
‘detached, comparative’ approach is not one more easily associated with the popular
idea of ‘local studies’ implying the study of a small community.

What appears to be the case, however, is that these different approaches have
proved beneficial to the study of local history on the whole, and perhaps not in the
83

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
way the casual observer might expect. While there is little doubt that the amateur
benefits from the work done by skilled archivists whose job it may be, for example,
to compile maps and keep records of the locality, when it comes to local history
research and writing itself, Bott puts forward an interesting and valuable point when
she observes that the research performed by the amateur ‘often provides the
groundwork which the professional has neither the time to trace nor the local
knowledge to relate to the place in the same way.’19p.9 Thus, the ‘parochial’ can be
used to supply detail garnered from an oftentimes very individual perspective into
the more impassive ‘professional’ approach.

Local studies, then, begins to take on a more complex shape, with the division
between the amateur and the professional becoming somewhat more blurred, but
remaining divided nonetheless. However, in terms of the value of ‘opening up’ local
history, Bott describes how the ‘intrinsically parochial nature of local history made it
all too easy for amateur historians to work in isolation’ and suggests that the
Standing Conference for Local History, established in 1948, enabled a ‘shared
experience’ that allowed for both ‘intellectual as well as social benefits’ when it
came to the historical study of the locale.20pp.7-8

This intellectual aspect, in particular, is arguably where local history’s reputation as
‘amateur’ has suffered most, since, as hinted at earlier, an assumption may be
suggested that an amateur pursuit is one that may not be considered suitable for
‘serious’ study. However, the mid-twentieth century saw this reputation carried by
local history start to change, and while the 1948 Standing Conference was an
important part of that change, more significant perhaps was another event that took
place the same year – the founding of the then-named Department of English Local
History at the University College of Leicester. In 1952, when he took over from W.G.
Hoskins in leading the department, in his introductory lecture, Finberg outlined the
unit’s belief that local history did not only allow for intellectual study, but frequently
demanded it:

84

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
Local history is not an elementary study. It is one to which the amateur or
the young student can, and often does, make a valuable contribution; but in
its higher reaches it demands mature scholarship and a wide background of
general culture.”21p.11

This is not to say that local studies had been completely absent from academia.
Indeed, as Finberg noted in 1952, institutions such as Reading; University College,
London; and the University College of Hull had already promoted local history as a
subject worth pursuing academically in the early half of the twentieth century,
instituting the likes of fellowships, certificates and research.22p.3 While observing the
subject’s reputation in terms of personifying it – as his choice of term suggests – as
something of a downtrodden, largely invisible relation, he also took note of the
growing interest within academia of rescuing the ‘poor creature’ and helping it
achieve its potential:

Local history is the Cinderella among historical studies. Nevertheless, in
recent years the universities have shown themselves disposed to take
Cinderella under their protection. This may be just a counsel of despair; but I
would rather construe it as an act of faith in the poor creature’s
possibilities.”23p.3

However, Leicester’s seminal importance to the study of local history was not
overlooked, as Finberg also noted that Leicester was the only university to accord
the subject ‘a department of its own.’24p.4 and, as local studies’ practitioners such as
Dewe point out, ‘local history as an accepted field of academic study’ is generally
considered to have dated from the department’s founding.25p.3

Yet, Leicester was not only interested in promoting local history in terms of the
scholarship required. When his seminal work, Local History and the Library was
originally published in 1962, Hobbs noted that there remained a tendency within
local research to ‘place excessive emphasis upon the manor and its history and
pedigrees of landed families’ instead of on the village itself as exemplified in its
85

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
surviving fields, houses and landmarks, and the manner in which its development
has been governed by local conditions of soil, climate and water supply.’ 26p.16

Hobbs suggested that this tendency was one that ‘modern local historians are
seeking to counter by emphasising that the really important things in history are
those which had a direct impact on the village or which affected and changed the
lives of ordinary people.27p.16 While the fourteen years between the founding of the
Department of English Local History and Hobb’s work may not have allowed for a
complete revolution in the emphasis of local history studies, Leicester was almost
certainly responsible for championing this more modern attitude since, while the
department sought to promote local history as an academic endeavour, a further
aim was to change the way in which the content of local history itself was
approached. As Dewe puts it:

The pioneering work of Hoskins and Finberg encouraged the use of the
landscape as historical evidence, and evangelized the need for local history to
explain as well as describe, to have a developing narrative rather than be a
collection of interesting information, and to treat subjects that involved the
common people and their day-to-day lives and communal endeavours: a
people’s history, rather than one limited to the powerful and privileged and
their particular concerns.”28pp.3-4

The move towards ‘explanation’ in addition to ‘description’ is a crucial one that
emphasised the difference between local studies as an amateur pastime and as a
professional and/or academic pursuit. While it would be unwise to characterise
every individual amateur investigator’s undertaking as one in which findings are
presented primarily as they stand, it is clear that nudging the study of localities
towards an approach that encouraged analysis and interrogation pushed the subject
nearer to being embraced as a more academically ‘worthy’ endeavour. Yet, even
with this new approach, differences of attitude towards the purpose of local history
as a subject could be found within the ranks of both amateur and academic research
– that is, the usefulness of local history. For instance, as Bott writes: ‘Where
86

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
previously the subject might have been dismissed as parochial antiquarianism, the
value of studying local history, not only for its purely local interest but also for the
light it sheds on other aspects of historical research, has now been recognised.’29p.8
However, with regard to those who might place too much emphasis on this aspect of
the subject, Hobbs saw such a ‘view which regards local history merely as the lantern
slide with illuminates national affairs’ as ‘a short-sighted one’. He wrote:

It [local history] can, indeed, claim to be the most advanced form of historical
study. It antedates national history, for national states were comparatively
latecomers on the stage of history, while local communities can be traced
back to the earliest communal settlement, and its study can give a sense of
‘belonging’ and continuity which can serve as an antidote to the rootlessness
of our twentieth-century society.”30p.18

Finberg too disputes the notion of local studies as a mere ‘lantern slide’, albeit by
suggesting that not only might local history be a way into national history, but, more
so, the opposite: that studying national history may be a means of getting to local
history; and, of course, both authors also highlight the value to be found in local
history studies, where Hobbs calls it ‘the most advanced form of historical study’,
with Finberg too drawing attention to the expertise demanded, thus positing it in a
broader context that focuses on the academic skills required. In addition, while
Hobbs’ statement regarding the ‘lantern slide’ is unarguably valid, his point about
local history’s antidotal value might suggest that local studies cannot help but be
linked with or to, not necessarily wider, but other issues nonetheless. In other
words, while there may be an argument that local history or studies research has an
intrinsic value in itself, it would perhaps be a mistake to assume that its value is
primarily to be found as ‘history for history’s sake’, isolated from other concerns.
For instance, while Dewe notes the ‘realization of the contribution that it can make
towards an understanding and interpretation of regional and national history’ he
also observes the more immediate impact local history can have on a community:

87

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
Local history has also come to be seen as having social values for individuals
and groups in that it gives people a pride in their locality, a sense of
belonging, an understanding of their personal origins and a stake in the
future. A shared sense of local history, and an involvement with it, can also
be seen as a way of strengthening communities and helping towards the goal
of social inclusion.”31p.4

Again, the notion of local history’s intrinsic value is not complete, but rather tied to
the idea of social concerns within a locality. This is not to say, however, that there is
no value whatsoever to be found in simply studying local history for its own sake, but
it would appear to be the case that local history or local studies cannot help but have
value in a broader context; and the move into academia – into taking local history
research ‘seriously’ – arguably reinforced this idea. Bott comments, for example, on
the impact that the ‘flourishing interest in and re-evaluation of local history’ has had
on ‘Every aspect of the teaching of history, from university to primary school’. In
terms of the materials used to inform this flourishing interest, she goes on to note
that:

Undergraduate courses in history had long included the use of some original
source material, usually in the form of photographs or photocopies, as a
means of introducing primary evidence into their syllabuses. Real research,
using a quantity of original material, used to be something only
postgraduates did. Today it is common to find undergraduates preparing a
dissertation from primary sources as part of their course of study.”32p.13

In terms of how libraries themselves have been impacted, so far, focus has been
primarily on local history and studies research itself, the purpose of which has been
to illustrate the subject’s growth and transformation; but, while the approach taken
to the local history research and writing itself changed, so too did the role of the
librarian. Hobbs, for example, notes the difference between the collections ‘of the
past’ and of the types of material produced by earlier historians; and the work
carried out by the collection managers of the 1960s:
88

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History

The local collection of the past, catering for a select band of clerics and
schoolmasters and based on the county antiquarian society, consisted chiefly
of the rag-bag publications of the antiquaries, plus the county and local
histories. The local librarian today needs to be something of a
palaeographer, map expert, medievalist, archaeologist and economic
historian, but above all he must develop a keen interest in the current events
of his own locality and be equipped to ensure that a record of these events is
properly maintained as they occur.33p.16

Paul also points to the role of the local studies librarian in more recent times, whilst
also calling to mind, again, the not always easy distinction between amateur and
professional research: ‘[I]n the no-man’s-land between complete amateurs and
professional academics, a considerable number of librarians, archivists and museum
curators have found themselves helping professionals and amateurs alike.’34p.34 It is
perhaps also worth noting at this point Hobbs’ emphasis on ‘current events’, thus
opening up the definition of ‘local history’ into something that begins to closely
resemble the more inclusive ‘local studies’. As mentioned earlier in this chapter,
semantic interrogation will be employed in this study, and the difference between
‘local history’ and ‘local studies’ is one such case in point. Further chapters will
explore this difference – and the attitudes that inform the terminologies – more
thoroughly, but it is perhaps worth repeating a point made within the rationale that
‘local studies’ is a term that only really began to make an impression in the 1970s.

4.3 Local Studies and Academic Libraries

In Local History and the Library, Hobbs points to the significant contributions made
to local studies under the aegis of academic endeavour: ‘Public awareness of the
importance of thesis literature has increased during recent years: many important
local studies submitted for degrees or teaching diplomas are never published and
have a very limited availability in university and college libraries. Yet in these can be
found some of the most valuable original research work done upon the area ...’35p.66
89

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History

As has been noted earlier, the ‘natural’ link between local studies and the public
library sector means that a strong bond remains between this field of study and the
public sector. However, the introduction of local studies into academia has also seen
a change in the collections held by the libraries within these higher and further
education institutions. The role of the academic library is one that is much debated
and discussed in terms of duty and responsibility. Although it is commonly held that
the college or university library is there to support teaching, learning and research,
Dunlap, for instance, posits a number of interrogative questions that suggest a role
that goes beyond this definition:

Where, exactly, does the library fit in the university community? Should the
library simply stay the course and muddle its way through or should it be a
proactive force on campus? Should the library simply support the curriculum
or should it provide a new vision for the university? Can the library reclaim
its symbolic central position in the university and provide true educational
leadership? Can the library make a difference in the life of college students?
Finally, can the academic library resuscitate itself and become an
indispensable organ which exudes energy and vitality while providing a
unifying force for the university community?”36

The use of the term ‘indispensable organ’ has, of course, been alluded to more than
once when considering the role of the library within the institution. As Brophy
points out: ‘The academic library has not infrequently been described as ‘the heart
of a university,’’37p.1 a metaphor that will be explored further in chapter seven. It
may not be too far-fetched to suggest that the library could also be described as the
‘heart of local studies’ or, indeed, the converse – that local studies lies at the heart of
the library. Certainly, in the former instance, the public library is oftentimes the first
port of call for people wishing to investigate their locality; it can be home to a
multitude of printed materials relating to the surrounding area, without which any
reasonable investigation would come to a quick standstill. In the latter case, the

90

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
central role afforded local material from the beginning cannot be overlooked when
considering the development of the public library sector.

In terms of the academic library and the place local studies has found there in
relatively recent years, however, there is a case to be made that the development of
local collections in this sector is not simply down to the influence of local studies as
an academic subject itself. As Paul and Dewe suggested in their preliminary 1984
investigation into local studies collections in college and university libraries:

The chronological development of the local collections [in academic libraries]
appears to be at least as closely linked with the expansion of higher and
further education as it is with the growth of local studies as an element in
academic and professional training courses. It is perhaps worth recalling that
before 1798 there were precisely six universities in England, Wales and
Scotland – four in Scotland and two in England. Between 1798 and 1960
there was a steady, if modest, growth in higher and further education,
followed by more intensive development in the 1960s and early 1970s. This
is reflected in the development of local collections to the extent that half of
those covered here have been formed since 1960.”38p.53

In addition to the increased interest in the subject itself, this suggests a broader,
more pragmatic, reason for the growth in collections; but rather than an entirely
separate issue, it is one that appears to be very difficult to separate from changes in
attitudes towards local history; that is, had local studies not been integrated into
academia when it did, there is no guarantee ‘expansion and growth’ would have
included local studies.

4.4 Conclusion

This chapter has traced the journey of local studies from pastime to a subject worthy
of academic study. In doing so, it has highlighted the often complex nature of local
investigation as a field of enquiry, frequently informed by language used to
91

Chapter Four: The Evolution of Local History
communicate (mis)understandings of a subject where the term ‘local studies’ is
often automatically equated with historical investigation; a subject that is ‘ordinary’
yet focuses on the unique; that is at once amateur and professional; parochial and
scholarly; a ‘Cinderella’ no longer confined to the darkest corners of the halls of
academia, where she has finally been proven worthy of recognition.

The complexity of local studies and the paradoxes that frequently inform its
intricacies, however, are not limited to the subject itself, but to the collections that
lie at the core of local investigation. Addressed in the chapters that follow, for
example, are issues such as the strong link between local studies resources and the
public library and how this affects perceptions of the academic library’s role as a
provider of local studies material; the conflation of local studies with local history
and its impact on how collections are used; the evocation of ‘Cinderella’ not only as a
characterisation of local studies as a subject, but as a service too; and other issues
and paradoxes that, while not necessarily exclusive to local resources, have
particular bearing on the materials used to undertake local investigation.

Local studies resources and the public library is an established fact as well as a
perception; local studies resources and the academic library less so, at least partly
due to, as mentioned, the lack of writing on this particular subject. The present
study aims to go some way to correcting this oversight by examining these facts and
perceptions, and exploring the present attitudes towards local studies collections
within the realm of academic libraries, including their role within the curriculum.

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections

Chapter Five
The Current Situation: The Content and Scope of Local Studies
Collections in College and University Libraries

5.1 Introduction

It is proposed in the introduction to the thesis that this chapter’s primary focus is
examining and assessing the present situation concerning the existence of local
studies collections in university and college libraries. That is, what exists within
academic libraries in terms of local studies collections. This means that the results
discussed are based largely on those gathered during the first questionnaire stage of
the investigation, with observations and opinions also drawn from interviews and
visits conducted during the fieldwork stage of the study. This also means that,
frequently, issues raised in terms of how and why the collections are used, to be
covered in chapter six, will be introduced in this section.

As discussed in the methodology chapter, survey-based research is not infallible.
Limited questions will provide limited answers, while open questions will frequently
result in answers that do not immediately appear to relate to the specific topic under
interrogation. With this in mind, the respondents’ perceptions become an important
aspect of the investigation, rather than the search for absolute truths that may not
exist; how one institution interprets a question may not be same as another’s
understanding of an enquiry when, for instance, even the interpretation of what
constitutes a ‘collection’ in the first place can vary between respondents.

Indeed, in the case of this particular study, respondents’ perceptions are paramount
to the search for meaning within the remit of the investigation’s aims and objectives.
As suggested earlier, local studies and its place within collections held in academic
libraries is a subject significantly underrepresented in the literature of both
university and college libraries and local studies itself; and one of the possible

96

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
reasons for this, covered throughout the thesis, is that the combined subject itself is
open to ‘interpretation’ on so many levels, for example, whether or not local studies
material is ‘appropriate’ academic material or indeed what comprises ‘local’ material
in the first place.

With this in mind, in presenting the findings, an emphasis is often placed on issues
such as semantics. This is not an idle endeavour; language, both denotatively and –
particularly – connotatively, serves our understanding of objects and concepts,
shaping and informing attitudes and perceptions; and its role in local studies is an
important one and worth considering at some length. Not only is the semantic
element of the subject an issue originally anticipated in the objectives laid out at the
start of the research in terms of the ‘meaning’ of the term ‘local’ itself, but, as the
investigation progressed, it became more apparent that this was arguably a more
complex consideration than was first thought, not only in terms of how respondents
interpreted the term, but in existing literature, where, as discussed further in this
chapter, the ‘problem’ has been identified and wrestled with.

In keeping with this issue of perception, it is also worth noting that other questions –
even those intended to address basic information on, for example, the types of
institutions responding – were prone to answers that relied more on interpretation
than hard and fast objective ‘facts’. Given the sheer number of responses and the
desire not to override or second-guess any answers, certain inconsistencies were
noted, but left as was, for instance, institutions that identified as ‘other’, where
similar institutions identified as a more specific type of further or higher education
college; or, as discussed in some depth further in this chapter, respondents who
identify as having no local collection when, in fact, some local material is held in the
library or LRC. In the case of this latter response, while it may have been useful to
include these respondents in the ‘yes’ category, it was felt that since a) little further
information was forthcoming regarding the material, i.e., the type of information
provided in the answers to follow-up questions for those who answered ‘yes’; and b)
the number of these respondents was small enough so as not to have too much

97

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
impact on the overall picture, these responses would be dealt with separately from
the respondents who identified as holding a local collection.

It is perhaps also worth raising at this point that the survey was not immediately
concerned with the existence of formal collection policies as such – that is, gathering
information as to the presence of a written policy on collection selection,
management and development that reflects the aims and objectives of the library;
since local collections in most cases form only part of the larger collection, such a
policy would normally not be specific enough. For example, a policy that would
underline, say, meeting the users’ needs, would not necessarily address the more
explicit issues relating to what users may or may not require from materials that
focus on ‘local’ interests. However, it is considered important to look at the issue of
collection management in a broader sense at least in order to establish some degree
of understanding in this area. In the chapter that follows, for example, the – often
contentious – matter of how and why academic library collections are acquired in
the first place is discussed, with the proposal that ‘collecting for collecting’s sake’
versus ‘collecting for use’ is an issue of particular relevance to local collections in
further and higher education libraries.

In this chapter, however, the findings to be discussed largely involve the number and
types of responding institutions, the presence and absence of local collections, the
geographic scope of the material, and the age of the collections.

5.2 Institutions

Two hundred and twenty-three university and college resource providers responded
to the first questionnaire stage of the study. The types of institutions are broken

In all three initial categories represented by the above table and the two that follow
– overall responding institutions, respondents who do not hold local collections, and
those who do – perhaps fortunately, a similar number of respondents were found in
the two most common types of institution, universities and further education
colleges, which should make comparisons and contrasts more representative when
looking at the ways in which different types of institutions present and make use of
their local material. In the remaining cases, the types of responding institutions
(FHEC, HEC and Other) produced a lower rate of response – reflecting what appears
to be a lower rate of existence in the wider academic population in the first place;i

i

Definitive figures indicating the actual number of higher education and further and higher
education colleges are difficult to come by. For example, the Association of Colleges’ lists 222
‘General Further Education Colleges’ for England. Of these, five include ‘Further and Higher
Education College’ in their name. No further indication is given as to how many other colleges
may offer HE courses. (Association of Colleges. About colleges. [homepage on the internet;
cited 2011 Dec 8] Available from: http://www.aoc.co.uk/en/about_colleges/index.cfm). In a
similar vein, Universities UK cite, for example, 14 universities in Scotland and 19 Higher
Education Institutions, explaining that ‘The term higher education institutions includes
universities, university colleges, specialist higher education institutions and other higher
education colleges’, with no further breakdown available. (Universities UK. An overview of

99

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
however, these lower figures should not preclude necessarily artificial or skewed
information in terms of comparisons/contrasts, but rather should contribute to the
overall picture of how colleges and universities engage with local studies collections,
even if any possible differences between every type of institution cannot always be
easily discerned.

In terms of how the resource providers within the institutions are named, a sharp
division was noted between further education colleges and universities. Thirtyseven out of 72 Further Education respondents used the name Learning Resource
Centre, Learner Resource Centre or Learning Centre independent of other generic
terms; while a further 13 incorporated LRC or LC into its name (e.g., the Ware Library
and Learning Centre at Hertford Regional College, or Bolton Community College’s
Library and Learning Resource Centre, Manchester). Conversely, a mere six out of 76
respondents from universities used LRC or LC free from other designations, while a
further two used these terms as part of a larger title. Meanwhile, 51 universities
used the name ‘Library’ or ‘Library Services’ alone; while a further 12 used one of
these terms as part of a broader title (e.g. Glasgow Caledonian University’s Central
Library and Information Centre; Durham University’s Library, Archives and Special
Collections Department). In contrast, only 12 Further Education Colleges employed
the name ‘Library’ alone; with an additional 17 using the term as part of the resource
provider’s name (e.g. the Information and Library Service at St. Helen’s College).
Further, a small number of university or ‘other’ responses came from special
collections and/or archives. Eight respondents identified their resource provider as
Special Collections either in whole or in part (e.g. University of St Andrews Special
Collections Department); while six used the term ‘Archives’ (e.g. University of
Huddersfield - University Archives and Special Collections). Possible implications
regarding whether a resource provider uses the title ‘library’ or ‘learning resource
centre’ – namely, how the name may affect perceptions of the services provided –
will be addressed in chapter six.

be assumed that, given the dearth of explicit information regarding these institutions, the
response rates are approximately representative.

5.3 The Presence of Local Studies Collections

Of 223 responses to the first stage of the survey, 62.78% (140) reported holding local
material, while 37.22% (83) reported having no local studies collection in their library
or LRC. In the sections that follow, both the absence and presence of these
collections are described and issues relating to the immediate findings examined,
with the intention of capturing a broad overview of the current situation regarding
local collections in university and college libraries and learning resource centres.

5.3.1 No Local Studies Collection

The question of the existence of local studies holdings in college and university
libraries is one that cannot be explored to its fullest and most useful extent without
also looking at the other extreme: that is, the non-existence of these collections, and
the reason for (or perhaps the ‘purpose’ behind) this lack.

As mentioned earlier, of the 223 questionnaires returned in the first part of the
survey, 83 respondents, including 25 further education colleges and 26 universities,
claim to have no local studies collections in their libraries. However, despite the

101

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
reasonably broad definition granted the term ‘collection’,ii 23 of these libraries or
learning resource centres are, in fact, in possession of some local studies material,
but chose not to identify as holders of a local collection. With a reference to the
‘historical’ nature of the material that will be discussed later in this chapter, South
Devon College, for instance, offered this explanation for choosing not to reply in the
affirmative as to whether its library holds a local collection:

We are not a historical collection. Our stock is more closely related to the
courses taught here. We do have some material relating to Torbay,
particularly tourism and planning.

The range of these (non-)collections vary. A number of institutions pointed out that
the only material of local interest held was material or archives that related to the
college or university itself.iii While the issue regarding the often precarious
definitions that can occur when it comes to identifying suitable areas of local study
and/or material is addressed in more detail below, for now it is worth considering
the somewhat curious nature of this response: Not only might it be reasonable to
suggest that the college or university itself is probably the most immediate ‘local’
area that an academic institution can lay claim to, but, of course, as will be seen
further in this chapter, other libraries and LRCs whose collections are limited to this
particular geographical scope and who answered ‘yes’ to the original question have
little difficulty viewing this material as ‘local’ in nature.

ii

The term ‘collection’ was defined in both questionnaires as: individual items, materials that
may be organised as a single collection, or more than one collection dispersed throughout
the library stock.
iii
These included Stanmore College; Lauder College; Oxford University’s Museum of Natural
History; the University of the Arts, London; the Department Materials Science and
Metallurgy, University of Cambridge; and Jesus College at Oxford.

Does hold some local
material

Reasons for why an institution’s resource centre does not hold local studies material
varies, with some respondents citing practical concerns such as financial constraints
or a lack of room in the library or learning centre for such items. This latter concern,
albeit one cited by only six percent of respondents, is perhaps especially interesting,
since it alludes quite explicitly to (the absence of) a physical collection. Different
types of local material and formats are discussed in chapters six and seven, with the
latter chapter addressing, in particular, the advent of digital material and the
potential opportunities it affords in terms of access; in the immediate context of the
above results, however, it is worth noting that a lack of physical space in order to
house items that might otherwise be considered worth holding is a concern.

However, the most common response received in terms of reasons why an
institution does not hold local studies material – 31 responses (37.35%) – is that, as
alluded to in the example of South Devon above, it is irrelevant to the institution’s

103

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
curriculum requirements.iv This aspect of local collections – their relationship with
set programmes of study – will be discussed further in the next two chapters;
however, in the immediate context of the current focus on what is and is not
stocked, it is still worth noting at this point that the most popular reason for not
holding local material is its relationship – or lack of, in this instance – to what is being
taught and learned within the institution. Two separate-but-related issues that form
primary threads throughout this study immediately jump forth from this finding: The
relationship between local studies and the public library is not the same as that
between local studies and the academic library; and the ideal notion of the academic
library existing to serve the institution’s curricular needs is strongly suggested. There
is no ‘obligation’ to carry local studies material in the same way that public libraries
have a duty to hold such material; as far as these respondents are concerned, the
principal obligation that the academic library has is to its parent institution.

Following this, the second most common response is one that relates to local studies
collections in a broader sense – that is, one that is tied to the history and overall
perception of local studies in terms of resources – where 18 (21.69%) respondents
cited the public library’s provision of local studies material as a reason for the
absence of a collection in their institution’s library or learning centre. It is not
altogether surprising to note that, while over two thirds reported the ‘occasional’
local studies enquiry, almost seventy percent reported referring these users to the
public library. Also, while almost a third cited ‘irrelevance’ to the curriculum as their
first reason for the absence of a local studies collection, approximately fifteen
percent gave as their first answer the presence of a collection at the public library.
Indeed, one respondent from the Learning Centre in South Kent College offered the
emphatic opinion that ‘local studies collections are best left to the public library,’
adding that this sector is able to provide the ‘expertise and the resources’, while
students could benefit from being referred to ‘other resource collections.’ Similar
assertions were noted in other responses. Edinburgh University’s Special Collections
iv

While the separate response above of ‘No demand’ may be considered similar to that
which cites irrelevance to the curriculum, the respondents did not specify a lack of
relationship to set programmes of study, suggesting a broader lack of demand (say, no
interest shown from external as well as internal users).

104

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
Division, while citing financial constraints as ‘probably the most significant reason’
for the absence of a local collection in that particular library, also echoed the
sentiment regarding the public sector, albeit this time suggesting that ‘in the
academic library sector there is probably (arguably) an understanding that local
history is a public library domain,’ thereby introducing a ‘common knowledge’
element to how local studies is perceived in terms of its ‘rightful’ place.

While the respondents’ assertions are largely unarguable in theory, given the longstanding relationship between local studies and the public library sector and the
dedication that many public library professionals show for the subject, there is a
degree of presumption in the claims that perhaps bears closer scrutiny. Students
may well benefit from visiting sources outside of their institution’s immediate
environment, but while local studies is no longer principally viewed as the poor
relation of broader historical or geographical investigation, it can be noted that, in
Barber’s words – echoing those of H.P.R. Finberg in his introductory lecture at the
University of Leicester in 1952 cited in the previous chapter – there may still be a
degree to which local studies, even in the public library sector, ‘is seen as a backroom “Cinderella” service.’1p.140 This suggests a service whose full potential is yet to
be realised, whereby it is often only because of the dedication of a particular public
librarian that expertise is provided and resources are accessible at all. Duckett, for
example, refers to ‘local heroes’ in his article about the ‘acquisitive and custodial
role of libraries’ when it comes to building and using collections. Local studies
librarians, according to Duckett, ‘being experts in their subject and having the
responsibility of coping with enquiries, will normally receive the brunt of the more
teasing enquiries anyway, but their knowledge of sources and the contents of the
stacks is of value, too.’ However, he also notes that:

[They] rarely escape to other posts. So hard won is their knowledge, and so
untransferable, that once a local studies librarian, always a local studies
librarian. As their knowledge lives on after retirement, so they are
continually badgered. Truly, there is no escape.2p.173

105

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
This characterisation of the specialist local studies librarian – a description at once
both admiring (their expertise and knowledge) and somewhat tragic (note the uses
of the word ‘escape’ which seldom, if ever, indicates that the circumstances being
described are desirable) – compounds the ‘Cinderella’ analogy, albeit in a slightly
different way, ‘personifying’ the librarian him- or herself, rather than the abstract
service; and also not permitting the fairy tale heroine the opportunity to escape her
present condition. Returning to the ‘Cinderella as service’ metaphor, however, it
may, in fact, be the case that the academic student is referred to a public library
where the ‘Cinderella’ factor works to prevent him or her from accessing anything
useful, be it material directly or guidance on how to access material elsewhere; after
all, if the quality of local studies services depends principally on a particular
librarian’s enthusiasm or expertise, it stands to reason that at least a number of
services will exist that are not fortunate enough to benefit from the presence of such
an individual.

However, even assuming that the public library is more than able to provide the
student with useful material, while the potential impact of accessing external
collections on students’ learning is explored in chapters six and seven, here it might
also be proposed that the question of the institution’s more direct responsibility to
cater to its students’ needs is raised. It could be argued, after all, that having to refer
students to the public sector indicates a failing on the university’s part regarding its
‘duty of care’ to its library’s principal users. This question of responsibility is
addressed by Paul and Dewe, when they assert that the purpose of academic
libraries’ local studies collections is not ‘to duplicate the collections and services
provided in public libraries and record offices or to supplant them, but to
supplement them [researcher’s emphasis].’3p.52 At first glance, this may appear a
very reasonable assertion; after all, ‘duplication’ cannot help but suggest
redundancy, that an effort has been made that provides little in return. However,
Paul and Dewe’s contention again suggests that local studies collections – and by
association, local studies itself – are in some way different to resources that relate to
other subjects. In many areas, after all, public and academic libraries do overlap in
terms of collection holdings with little or no controversy or questioning over
106

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
whether or not it is appropriate for them to do so; and indeed, in cases where the
opposite – that, is no duplication at all – seems unthinkable. It would, for example,
be a poor academic library that did not stock the works of, say, Austen or Twain
simply because the nearby public library holds these texts. Nor is it likely that
concerns about ‘duplication’ are raised over, for example, more general history
materials or science textbooks. Dewe, however, clarified the point, referring to the
issue of duplication as ‘a question of cooperation and understanding between the
institutions and their respective libraries and making policy decisions through
consultation with the public library’:4

I think what we were saying at that time [in the report was] that the
academic library shouldn’t be in competition with the public library. Because
the public library was doing this anyway. What the academic library
should do, should be to build up a collection which reflected their particular
needs. […] They shouldn’t compete – in the same way that the archives and
the museums shouldn’t compete with the public library – theoretically; they
do, of course. In theory, they shouldn’t compete, and similarly, the academic
library shouldn’t compete with the public library. That’s not to say that it
won’t have some local studies material.

While Dewe is clear that the academic collection should ‘[reflect] their [the library’s
and thus the institution’s] particular needs,’ such an approach arguably cannot help
but bring to mind something of a perpetual juggling act, where the academic
collection – one that was once both reflective of the institution’s requirements and
compatible with the public sector’s holdings – is constantly and exhaustively having
to be revised, with items added and removed and reshuffled so that the manager
can avoid holding a narrowly focused local collection that is not relevant enough
and/or committing the grievous harm of ‘redundant’ duplication. Needs, after all,
can change, as can public library holdings; and while collaboration is an admirable
endeavour, it might also be suggested that building a collection that relies too
heavily on what the other library is doing may create as many – if not more –
problems as duplication itself.
107

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections

Hobbs also addresses the issue of duplication – albeit in the public library sector –
not just from an ideological position, but also by reflecting on the impact that library
history itself may have had on this issue, along with the notion that, in some cases,
the simple situation of supply-and-demand may play a part:

It is abundantly clear that, because all the existing library authorities of the
country did not come into being at the same time, and because their
respective local history collections were not initiated simultaneously, that
there exists in many areas a duplication of coverage and use of resources that
may appear to some to be unnecessary. When two or three adjacent or
neighbouring library authorities compete for the same scarce material the
problem is highlighted, and the objectives of each completing authority are
likely to be called into question. Often, however, a matter that is overlooked
on such occasions is that although a duplication of effort and resources may
exist, there may also be sufficient demand to justify both the duplication of
effort and the competition.5p.211

Hobbs’ view might be considered somewhat less emphatic and perhaps more
pragmatic than Dewe’s, whose approach might be argued is perhaps too rigid in this
respect. Yet, taken together, Hobbs’ and Dewe’s attitudes towards duplication,
while differing in emphasis, might actually be suggested to complement one
another. One of Dewe’s main considerations is that academic and public libraries
are not in competition with one another and, while Hobbs acknowledges that
duplication may be problematic, he also notes that, in some – but far from all –
cases, it may be justified, provided that resources, and the demand for them, allow
for this. While, as mentioned, Hobbs’ concern is with the public sector, the
justifications for duplication that he presents are not so narrowly defined that such
an approach might well reasonably be applied to the academic sector too.

In addition, when considering even just the existence – or lack – of a local collection
within an academic library, what might also be considered is the interest of the
108

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
institution’s librarian or head of information services or learning resources in the
subject. Local studies is not a staple of higher learning and relatively few
institutions, such as Leicester and Reading – who have integrated local studies ‘more
formally’ into the curriculum – are known for their work in this field. In addition,
given the long-held association of local studies with the public library, it may well be
the case, then, that local studies relies on an active interest by academics or
education-based librarians. For instance, where the public library is expected to
collect material relating to the locality, there is no such expectation on the academic
library. Dewe, however, offers a slightly different perspective on whether a more
‘active’ role is required of academic or of public librarians in the field of local studies:

I guess to some extent, it depends upon the extent of the subject collection in
that particular academic library. I mean, if you’ve got somewhere like
Leicestershire – the University library there, where you’ve got the
Department of English Local History, then you’re going to have a
departmental collection of some significance. And, I would expect that
whoever’s involved with that, that yes, they would promote it. But, to a
certain extent, their promotion perhaps needs to be a bit different than in
the public library sector because, to some extent, they’ve got a captive
audience. Although, that’s not to say that that captive audience doesn’t need
encouraging and so on. But, the public library has got a much sort of bigger
job, as it were to reach out to a greater range of potential users.6

That is, there is no ‘pressure’ on a potential user to visit the public library in order to
access the local studies collection, unless he or she has a specific enquiry. While, as
mentioned, the immediate purpose behind the collecting of material in college and
university libraries is discussed in more detail in chapter seven, Dewe also suggests
that another difference between the public and academic sectors is that the public
library ‘is in the local studies business for the long haul.’

109

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
They’re creating a collection in perpetuity that will be used in a hundred
years time. The academic library may not be doing that. It’s essentially
responding to the teaching and research demands of that particular time.

Dewe is, of course, quick to point out that this does not mean that some university
libraries do not have a long-term investment in local studies material (and, as the
findings in the following chapter indicate, not all collections are necessarily
responding to particular pedagogical demands), only that they do not tend to be as
necessarily invested in building a local studies collection intended to exist for the
duration the way the public library is.

Some reasons given for the absence of local collections in a significant minority of
responding academic resource centres – 37.22% – already hint at reasons for the
existence of such material in other university and college libraries, albeit up to a
point only. While it may be a logical fallacy to assert that a cited lack of ‘need’
dictated by the curriculum or other in-house academic interests suggests that those
who do hold local studies items are serving the interests of their institutions’ set
programmes of study or academic research, it is arguably not unreasonable to
assume at this point that, given the frequency of this response, this may be true for
at least some holders of local collections, an issue examined more closely in the
following two chapters. However, even citing a lack of relevance to current
curriculum requirements arguably does not provide an entirely satisfactory response
as to why an institution’s resource provider does not hold local material. As
mentioned, local studies is not a standard subject in further or higher education; yet,
as reported in chapters six and seven, it is a subject that can – to varying degrees –
be integrated or combined with other subjects, thus possibly placing a question mark
over the very issue of what can and cannot be considered ‘relevant’ when it comes
to potentially useful resources. However, what is clear, is that the issue of why a
library or LRC does not hold local material cannot solely be attributed to what
students or researchers require in order to fulfil their resource needs; as indicated by
the respondents’ answers, as well as the literature, the tension that exists between
the perceived roles of the academic library and the public library when it comes to
110

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
local collections appears to have significant bearing on the academic library’s
decision to house local studies material even when such material may benefit its
principal users.

5.3.2 Local Studies Collections

Of 223 responding institutions, just under two-thirds – 140 or 62.78% – do hold, and
identify as holding, local studies material. Those who do hold these collections are

5.3.2.1 ‘Local Studies’ and ‘Local History’

A deceptively simple question asked at this stage of the investigation relates to the
name given to the library or LRC’s collection. While this may, technically, be thought
of as an issue of mere semantics, like most – if not all – issues concerned with
perception and identity, it is inseparable from more pragmatic considerations: How
local collections are approached and utilised may well be impacted by the
descriptive label attached to the collection; and the emphasis placed within such a
label may be key to any potential users’ relationship with the material, whether
student, educator, external user or, indeed, the collection manager him- or herself.

Dewe points out that, until relatively recently, ‘local studies’ was commonly known
as ‘local history’, the broader term coming into wider use only in the 1970s,7p.1 while

111

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
Reid, as noted in the Introduction to the thesis, observes the erroneous way in which
the two terms are often reckoned synonymous, where confusing one with the other
‘misrepresents’ the point of a local studies collection which should concern itself
with aspects of the locality in question in broader ways than simply that which
focuses on its historical past.8p.2 In an interview conducted with Michael Dewe in
2006, the common synonymy of the terms ‘studies’ and ‘history’ within the context
of local resources, and the meaning of what might arguably be considered a minor
semantic issue in terms of perceptions of local investigation and collections, was
discussed.9 Dewe believes that the intention within the public library field is that, in
theory, the terms should not be considered one and the same ‘but, I think in reality
they are.’ Dewe’s experience is that public librarians, certainly in the 1970s, tried to
‘re-orientate local history to give it a broader subject base. But, in fact, when you
come to look at what most local studies collections are concerned with, and who
their users are, and the subject coverage and so on, it still is largely historical,’
further suggesting that, certainly in the public library field, ‘local studies’ ‘doesn’t
really live up to its description.’10 This is a development that Dewe argues needs to
be taken up, that the challenge of dealing with ‘modern issues’ – the environment,
geology, flora and fauna and so on – tend to be ignored while the ‘historical
dimension’ predominates, ‘particularly given the amount of family and geological
history that people are concerned with these days.’ Dewe points out that, despite
this bias towards resources that focus on the historical, most public libraries tend to
use the term ‘local studies’ collections: ‘It’s an attempt to broaden the approach,
but I don’t think, in reality, it’s happened.’

In terms of the survey and its focus on academic resources, it is interesting to note
that despite the emergence, and growing popularity, of the broader term in the field
itself – one that suggests within the context of the study that local investigation
might be incorporated into a number of different academic subjects – an emphasis
on historical study in terms of the names given to such collections appears to prevail.
Indeed, even though the practitioner does not identify as holding a local collection,
the response of South Devon College above provides a sound example of the
conflation of local studies with studies of the past. Not only does the college hold
112

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
material that does, in fact, relate to the ‘local’ area – South Devon College is located
in Paignton, one of three towns that comprise Torbay’s ‘English Riviera’v – it is also
interesting to note that the college’s initial disclaimer makes a specific point of
referring to the fact that their collection is not ‘historical’ in nature, the assumption
being put forward that, as far as the respondent is concerned, local studies is local
history.

Of 139 respondents,vi including those whose local collections are either integrated
with the main stock, separated, or both, the most common names given to these
collections are as follows:

Other names given include the following:

•

Collections named after the institution itself (5 or 3.60%), for instance, the
Queen’s College Collection Institutional Archive at Glasgow Caledonian
University and CUCAP (the Cambridge University Collection of Air
Photographs) at the Aerial Photograph Library at the University of
Cambridge;

•

Named after a person (3 or 2.16%), as in the George Shiels Collectionviii in the
Coleraine Library at the University of Ulster and the Henry Collectionix at the
Queen’s University Library in Belfast;

•

Collections known as ‘special collections’ or ‘archives’ (2 or 1.44%);

The most common answer as to how a local collection is named, however, is that the
collection is not named at all, with 34 respondents noting that the collection is
unnamed due to its integration with the main stock. This response would perhaps
appear to be somewhat self-evident, were it not for the fact that of 45 respondents
whose local collections are wholly integrated, 13 responded otherwise to the
question of naming. Why these integrated collections are given names is not clear; it
may simply be a case of a colloquial designation given to material of a particular
‘type’ as opposed to a formal title for a group of resources. However, even if all
those respondents who house wholly integrated collections are subtracted from the
results above – in other words, leaving only those 94 libraries or LRCs whose local
resources are either separate from the main collection, or partly separated/
integrated, and who responded to the question of naming collections – the pattern
that emerges regarding the most common names given local collections is similar:

The results of this part of the investigation strongly suggest that a significant
connection still exists between local studies and historical research. What is perhaps
curious is that the title ‘Local History’ appears to be adopted more commonly by
Further Education libraries or LRCs than other institutions, when universities – due to
the often historic nature of the institutions themselves – might have been expected
to employ this ‘more traditional’ description to their local collections more readily.
Further Education libraries were, however, also more likely than other institutions to
name their collections ‘Local Studies’.

The most frequent name given to local collections in universities is not, in fact, one
generic title, but rather a type of name, in this case, one based on the surrounding
geographical area, for instance the East Midlands Collection at the University of
Nottingham, and the Cope Collection on Hampshire and the Isle of Wight at the
University of Southamptonx (universities also provided the highest response for this
type of name). Eleven university libraries/LRCs report having a local collection
named after a particular area (including one with an integrated collection), although
more than one of these libraries situated within the University of Cambridge refer to
x

Although named after Sir William Cope (1811-1892), it was decided to categorise this
particular collection as ‘named after area’, since the part of the larger Cope Collection
specified by the respondent is the above-mentioned ‘Hampshire and the Isle of Wight’,
found under ‘Local History Resources’ on the university’s library website. See: Cope
Collection (special collections). [Internet; cited 2011 Dec 9] Available from:

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
the material as the Cambridge Collection, thereby possibly suggesting something of a
generic approach to naming within the parent institution. Nonetheless, what is
perhaps curious about this type of name being given to academic collections is that a
title of this ilk arguably evokes the kind of community-focused remit normally
associated with the public library sector, where one would not be surprised to find
the local collection named after the actual town or county the library is bound (and
indeed exists) to serve. However, it could equally be argued that, because these
academic collections exist within the ‘confines’ of (mostly) university libraries, any
suggestion of ‘community’ that might be brought to mind becomes almost innately
limited – the books, clippings, and other material for the most part both available to
and intended for a more ‘exclusive’ readership than the ‘local community’ at large.
It might also be proposed, of course, that naming a local collection after the locality
itself is simply a useful way of describing material related to a specific locality. If, as
is discussed later, ‘local studies’ or ‘local history’ can refer to more than one locality
– or perhaps even a locality apart from the one which is home to the collection –
then naming collections after a particular place is probably the least ambiguous way
of indicating that a single collection is devoted exclusively to – in most cases – the
immediate surrounding area. Indeed, in terms of geographic scope, of these eleven
institutions, the largest figure represented was just over a quarter (three in total)
which covered the town/city only (of the remaining eight, two were described in
terms of ‘other’, while the rest were represented by six different geographies,
including ‘counties (more than one’) and ‘country’.

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
One of the main considerations concerning the naming of the collections is that, of
the 140 first-questionnaire respondents who hold local material, just over half of
these collections are housed separately from the main collection, leaving the other
half either wholly integrated or integrated in part. As mentioned, the most popular
response given as to the name of the collection overall was that of ‘no name’ due to
the integration of the material with the main library or LRC’s collection. Perhaps
curiously, two libraries that claimed to have a collection both integrated and
separate also chose not to name the part of the collection that was separated from
other stock. However, when it comes to material organised and wholly separated
from the rest of the library stock, collections were named, with ‘Local History’ and
‘Named After Area’ once again proving the most popular choices.xi

Again, it is perhaps not too surprising that the size of the collection also seemed to
have some correspondence with whether or not a local collection was separated
from the rest of the library’s material. Twenty-two collections of between 101-500
items were separated, while 28 were either separated or partly integrated; fourteen
collections of between 501-1000 items were separated, while 19 were either
separated or partly integrated; and 23 collections of over 1000 items were
separated, while 32 were either separated or partly integrated.

This can be contrasted with the number of libraries or LRCs whose material is wholly
integrated: 14 of between 101-500; three of between 501-1000; and five of over
1000 items. The correlation suggests that those libraries that hold sizeable
collections may also be more likely to take local material ‘seriously’ enough to
segregate them from the main collection and give the grouped-together material a
specific name; of course, it may also suggest that those collections that are
separated from the main collection (either entirely or in part) are given more of an
opportunity to grow, with their separate status affording the material a ‘special’
identity that may encourage more attention in terms of acquisitions and building a
collection, more so than if the items are rendered somewhat less visible by virtue of
being appended to other material. Regardless of which came first, however – the
size of the collection or its separate status – it could be stated that, in other words,
these libraries are those with an interest in not just collecting but, within the library
itself at least, promoting or marketing – however passively – this material as a
distinct collection.

Again, not surprisingly, the majority of collections of over 1000 items, were found in
universities (only one further education college, for instance, identified its collection
as holding this many items). Without specific data, it is impossible to provide a
verifiable reason as to this, but it can most likely be assumed that since many
universities tend to hold collections acquired over a longer period of time, and often
have more space with which to stock these items, collections are, in general, likely to
be larger than those of newer colleges, where material has been collected over a
shorter period.

5.3.2.3 The Geographical Scope of the Collections and the Term ‘Local’

Dewe provides a description of ‘local studies’ in education in terms of what ‘pupils’
do. However, what he writes might well be applied to students and researchers also,
and his choice of words are perhaps telling when he describes it as ‘pupils acquiring
and processing information about aspects of their area.’11p.1 Definitions of ‘local’
itself, whilst not necessarily problematic, remain arguably idiosyncratic, and there is
no clear-cut definition of what may or may not constitute a local study; ‘their area’
does not quite provide a precise explanation.

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
Having asked respondents to describe the geographical scope of their collections,
the most common single response indicated an interest in issues relating to the
college or university’s home county (or Scottish former-‘region’), with region-wide
studies following closely behind. Over a quarter of respondents cited material
whose scope reached county-wide, including those whose collections also covered
material relating to the institution and parts of other counties, with a further 8.63%
covering more than one county; while almost a fifth of collections were based
around material concerned with the immediate region. Other responses included
those libraries whose material relates to the parent institution only, those whose
collections covered the institution’s home town and some surrounding towns and
villages, and some libraries whose ‘local’ collections include material on places
located in vastly different areas around the country. These quite widely differing
definitions suggest that there is perhaps something quite arbitrary in the way that
local studies can be approached, in which, indeed, a paradox exists whereby ‘local’
might not actually mean ‘local’ - as it would be commonly recognised - at all. Dewe
agrees, suggesting that, when provided with the definitions given by respondents, it
is clear that ‘local’ has a ‘variety of interpretations and I think all of those are valid.’12

Dewe himself draws attention to what might be described as a shifting
interpretation of ‘local’. He cites the example of studying ‘the importance of a river,’
that travels through a number of different places; or a road – ‘the importance of the
M4, for example.’ As he points out, the study of a river or major road ‘could be seen
as local or regional history. At its various points, it will be local, but overall, it will be
[a] regional kind of history.’ 13

It is also interesting to note the distinction made here between ‘local’ and ‘regional’
studies, where the former is used to indicate a more immediate locale even while
respondents were happy to view ‘regional studies’ as part of the broader term, ‘local
studies,’ providing, this time, a more semantic shift in meaning. Examples such as
Dewe’s also draw attention to the issue of boundaries by highlighting the – literal –
crossing of administrative areas that might otherwise be used as a guide for the term

120

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
‘local’. Dewe sums up the question ‘what does ‘local’ actually mean?’ by offering the
suggestion that

what makes it ‘local’ is the individual community, but it doesn’t necessarily
have to fit into an administrative area, although it often does for convenience
– because that’s how the records usually are maintained. But, of course it
can cross boundaries. 14

This may be especially true of local studies in academic libraries. In the public library
sector, it is arguable that local studies resources are more prone to ‘rules’ about
what can and cannot be held, since these resources rely on taxpayers’ contributions
from within government-drawn boundaries that prescribe what is or is not ‘local’.
When it comes to educational institutions, these boundaries are far less likely to be
taken notice of and other factors may contribute to the geographical scope of a local
collection. The institution’s history, for example, may be taken into account, or a
long-standing interest in a no-longer-present historical area, as might be the
university or college’s relationships with other institutions or its student catchment
area.

As Dixon notes, while ‘defining the area served may seem straightforward in terms
of current administrative boundaries, it may be less clear-cut for local historical
societies, or academic collections, and there are a number of points to consider as,
for example, administrative boundaries may change.’ Indeed, Dixon points out that
‘in the past 25 years’ local government in the UK has gone through two
reorganisations, leading to the reality that a number of library authorities ‘now cover
very different areas’.15p.88 As she suggests, for collections that do not depend on
such regulated boundaries to define them, this can be problematic.

Belinda Allen, Learning Resources Manager at North Lindsay College in Scunthorpe,
offers a prime example of where an area covered by the local studies collection
crosses many boundaries thanks to a historically ‘shifting’ definition suggested by
government-drawn areas that have been consistently subjected to administrative
121

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
changes that have affected the broader geography of the area. Allen describes the
college’s collection as ‘regional’, which she reckons as geographically ‘up to Lincoln,
really’ with York and Yorkshire also featuring in the collection. The imprecision of
this geographic description is understandable. As Allen puts it:

[O]ur area has moved into certain counties so many different times over the
years. We’ve been Lincolnshire, East Riding, South Yorkshire, South
Humberside and now we’re back to the old North Lincolnshire. So, we’ve
moved in and out of these county regional areas over the years – I don’t think
they quite know where to put us sometimes; but I would say the local
collection probably represents that as well, because it moves around Lincoln
and York and Humberside and Lincolnshire. And so that’s basically what I
mean by regional. 16

In other words, the constantly shifting definition of ‘local’ by the government has
enabled North Lindsay College’s ‘local collection’ to expand beyond what might
traditionally be considered ‘local’ in terms of Scunthorpe and its immediate
surrounding area. As Allen notes, the area has been ‘here, there and everywhere’
with ‘little pocket areas [that have] been in and out of the boundaries and the
collection represents that. Subtly, but it’s there.’

While regulated boundaries, therefore, may be said to restrict or ‘force’ a locality
into being, it is also true that academic collections of the kind described above offer
a way to not only blur the lines themselves, but, simultaneously bear witness to the
changes that have taken place: if the local government authority no longer
recognises the area as ‘local’, by embracing both the past and the present locality in
the material held, as Allen points out, the collection represents this historical shift in
perception and subsequent regulation.

The term ‘local’ gains an even broader definition, if a more stable one, when
observing the ten respondents whose ‘local’ collection covers an entire country.
Bluntly stated as ‘local = country’, a local collection that covers this broad a
122

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
geographical scope would appear to be something of a contradiction in terms;
however, when considering that the United Kingdom is itself split into four separate
constituent countries, a ‘local collection’ with the name ‘Welsh Life and History’ that
comprises material ‘Wales-wide with [an] emphasis on Glamorgan’ (Bridgend College
Library and Learning Resource Centre), or the ‘general Scottishery [sic]’ transforming
a Renfrewshire-focused collection into a broader geographical selection of material
(Reid Kerr College, Abercon Library), does not actually appear to come across as the
incongruity that, at first, the idea of a ‘national/local’ collection may suggest. This,
however, may arguably suggest a situation that the relatively unusual position of the
United Kingdom and its four countries in particular allows for, a situation where both
the size of the smaller component countries and the perceptions of a distinct
national identity – often based on common or shared traditions and customs –
comes into play. ‘Welsh life’, for example, could not be mistaken for ‘Scottish life’ or
‘Northern Irish life’ and so a sense of ‘local’ is achieved, even though, technically, it
might appear something of an oddity for a person to describe an entire country in
terms of an area that is ‘local’ to him or her.

This idea of ‘local’ as related to identity is also found in a less obvious geographically
defined way. Dr Norman Reid of St Andrews University Special Collections offers yet
another possible perspective on the geographical definition of ‘local’, where he
observes that the department tends to view its ‘remit of interest’ as St Andrews and
North-East Fife (this does not mean that material from further away is not acquired
and indeed the department does hold material drawn from a wider geographical
scope). However, North-East Fife is, according to Reid, the ‘core area’ covered by
the collection’s local holdings. The perspectives offered here suggest not only
historical geographical issues, but ‘local’ in terms of what might be described as
‘commonsense’ knowledge of what constitutes the ‘local’ area with the perception
of a ‘local identity’ forming a large part of that knowledge. As Dr Reid observes:

Fife is a place that tends to divide itself up into localities [...] and East Fife
tends to have a fairly distinctive local identity. And there are even more

123

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
local identities within that, of course [...] But, generally speaking, I think most
people would agree that there is a sort of East Fife identity. 17

It is this ‘identity’ – drawn from common perceptions of what characterises ‘East Fife’
– that forms the core of the ‘geographical’ collection at St Andrews Special
Collections, one that Norman Reid concedes, is ‘not clearly defined.’

Indeed, the question of a ‘local identity’ was raised in mid-2010 from what, on the
surface, may have appeared merely to be an administrative shift that has no real
bearing on actual localities, but, nonetheless, as the BBC put it, is a shift that, for
some, ‘strikes at the heart of who they are.’18 In July of that year, the Royal Mail
announced that the names of counties were to be deleted from its postal database,
following, according to an earlier article, ‘complaints by customers to postal
watchdog Postcomm about the use of out-of-date county names, such as North
Humberside and Dyfed.’19 In the later article, somewhat provocatively titled ‘What’s
the Point of Counties?’, it was noted that, according to the Royal Mail, while people
were welcome to continue including county names on envelopes and package labels,
to do so was no longer necessary, since a ‘house number, street and postcode are all
that is needed.’ However, the move towards the paring down of postal addresses
was not welcomed by those who viewed the proposed deletions of counties as
something akin to tampering with history. Negative responses to the adjustment
quoted in the article ranged from considerably irate (‘It is not up to Royal Mail to
decide whether or not to delete our heritage … As far as I recall, we didn't elect
them.’) to somewhat more measured, with astrologer, television personality, and
author,xii Russell Grant suggesting that ‘It's not just about [the particular county
name] but wherever you grew up and realised from a young age the things that are
part of your history and heritage,’ proposing later in the article that ‘People need
their counties for their history and their sense of identity.’ In this case, it appears
that, for some people, one’s own identity is very much tied to the idea of
geographical boundaries, where the indicators used to form a postal address

xii

124

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
contribute significantly to a ‘local identity’. Indeed, the very fact that complaints
were received in the first place over ‘out-of-date’ county names suggests that there
is an importance attached to localities that can frequently go beyond any ‘practical’
consideration.

The issue of defining localities was raised once again in the news later the same year,
this time focusing on regions, and highlighting once more the seemingly arbitrary
ways in which the identification of localities can be approached, often in such a way
as to defy government boundaries. As the article’s title indicates, in this instance,
the definition relies less on the forging and maintenance of a sense of identity, than
on the equally ‘human’ activity of social communication. In ‘Phone Calls Used to
Redefine UK Regions’, the BBC reported on a ‘social map of Great Britain’ created
through the use of ‘12 billion landline calls to create a map of Britons’ connections.’20
According to Carlo Ratti from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who led the
international team responsible for creating the map, ‘Regional boundaries are useful
for governments … “But they don’t say anything about how people in those regions
interact.”’ Noting that, according to Ratti, telephone users ‘tended to communicate
most with people that were geographically close to them’ the article revealed that,
while the map identified commonly recognised regions, it ‘also produced surprise
results, including the creation of a region that encompassed parts of Wales and the
West Midlands.’ Although the article’s title and an introduction that explicitly uses
the phrase ‘redrawing the regional map of Britain’, arguably contains more than a
hint of hyperbole – the researchers suggest that the analysis of social networks could
be useful to governments, but there is no indication that any regions are to be
officially redefined based on findings – the project does point, as suggested earlier,
to a more flexible way of determining ‘localities’, where, in this instance regions are
characterised as ‘areas with strong social cohesion.’

Yet, as Dewe’s earlier comment suggests, all of these definitions may well be
considered valid. If government boundaries are no hard and fast indicator – witness
North Lindsay College’s ever-changing administrative landscape – then what is left
may frequently be down to historically recognisable ‘local’ areas which may involve
125

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
original or older ‘official’ definitions of a locality; or – when even the Royal Mail
cannot be counted on to define where people’s sense of local heritage might begin
and end – less tangible perceptions of identity or, in the case of identifying regions
by patterns of communication, new ways of creating ‘localities.’

The Centre for English Local History at Leicester University, the oldest department of
its kind in the United Kingdom, is dedicated to the study of localities – as the centre’s
name implies, the focus is not limited to Leicestershire, although the immediate
locale is included. In Professor Harold Fox’s own case, as he suggested in an
interview conducted in 2005,21 the advantage of studying ‘Leicester here and Devon
down there [Devon is one of Professor Fox’s particular study focuses] is a
comparative advantage. You can compare the two and that gives you insights into
each one.’ For Fox, ‘To study the two illuminates the differences,’ in, for example,
the study of the very different landscapes found in the areas. Yet, when asked to
clarify how far the geographic scope of the centre’s concerns reach, it becomes clear
that even somewhere with an ostensibly unambiguous focus of study as a centre for
‘English Local History’ [researcher’s emphasis] is not immune to the grey areas that
local studies seem to attract. Professor Fox offered up examples of Cornwall, Kent,
Cumberland and Yorkshire – ‘The four corners’ – in order to illustrate his initial
response of ‘everywhere,’ obviously taken to mean ‘anywhere in England’.
However, Fox also observed that even the boundaries set up by the department
itself had proven to be somewhat problematic, admitting that, ‘We’re regretting the
study of the word ‘English’ at the moment – ‘English’ local history.’ He uses the
example of a PhD student who had chosen to study South Wales, a choice that,
perhaps understandably, drew some comment, with the department possibly
reaching somewhat to justify the research by noting that South Wales had been
colonized by England in the 10th Century.xiii While such self-imposed limitations can
provide amusing anecdotes – ‘We haven’t been brave enough to study Scotland yet,’
was another observation – the story also provides another illustration of the
difficulties in defining the ‘local’ in ‘local studies’. In this case, however, it is not

xiii

More accurately, the 11th Century, by the Normans.

126

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
necessarily the term itself that is prone to the geographical ambiguity of what
constitutes a local area – the centre, as mentioned, is in the business of studying
localities – but, rather, which localities may be studied. As far as the research
student is concerned – and with the department’s backing – the Centre for English
Local History is a perfectly valid place from which to conduct a study of South Wales;
to the outside observer, it seemed incongruous – hence the ‘justification’.

Overall, this elusive definition of ‘local’ – where it can be marked by boundaries both
within and without government authorisation; historical perspective; a sense of
identity; or even, as in the case of the Centre for English Local History, where the
term ‘English’, if not quite redefined, is expanded and made more inclusive – is
arguably one of the most fascinating, yet potentially frustrating, aspects of local
studies. After all, if one cannot even define the ‘local’ in local studies with any
degree of real consistency, there is a danger that the discipline itself (both academic
and amateur) becomes meaningless when the phrase ‘to conduct a local study’ can,
apparently, mean almost anything the researcher wishes it to mean.

However, there is one fairly consistent point of definition – the idea that local
studies concerns itself with the study of localities (as opposed to the notion that it is
chiefly interested in the immediate locality, however much that may be the concern
in many instances) – although even this can be problematic when one takes into
account some of the potential problems mentioned above when trying to pin down a
particular locality, wherever its broader geographic setting. However, as suggested
earlier with regard to the notion of perception as an almost constant feature of local
studies, there does appear to be an almost implicit understanding attached to the
subject which overrides the arguably quite shaky definition which, on paper,
threatens to render the term, if not quite meaningless, then certainly prone to an
interpretation that may reasonably be considered too open. What this
understanding is, however, remains somewhat elusive. It may, for instance, be
based on a notion of what local studies is not. A critical examination of, for example,
theories of quantum mechanics is clearly not a local study; nor is, to take a less
scientific example, the study of the work of female novelists in the 19th Century.
127

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
However, were the researcher to investigate, say, the development of wave
mechanics, he or she might find him- or herself peering into Erwin Schrödinger’s
background – domestic circumstances, education – which may result in a study that
takes on elements of local studies. Similarly, the literary researcher might find it
useful to compare authors’ experiences in different countries and how this might
have affected the works produced, in which case, localities become quite important
to the study. Perhaps, then, the difference lies in emphasis: a local study is not a
local study when it is not a local study. While this may not be the most emphatic or
clear-cut definition – and still leaves the term ‘local’ itself open to quite a broad
range of interpretations, however valid each may be – it is nonetheless a definition
that is consistent.

5.3.2.4 Age of the Collections

One of the most important eras in the development of post-secondary education is
the decades of the 1960s and 1970s. Ansell also draws attention to these decades as
significant in the ‘present structure of local studies provision’ noting that it ‘dates
essentially from the last reorganisation of local government’22p.42 in which the
following library authorities were put in place:

•

London’s boroughs in 1965

•

Northern Ireland’s education and library boards in 1973

•

England and Wales’ metropolitan districts and non-metropolitan counties in
1974; plus a few non-metropolitan districts in Wales.

•

Scotland’s districts, regions and islands in 1975

Ansell notes that the ‘structures now in existence bear a marked resemblance to
those recommended in the 1973 Department of Education and Science report, Public
Library service: reorganisation and after in which, as well as recommending ‘a strong
central collection relating to the area as a whole’ the report also specified that

128

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
Outside this central collection, each identifiable community within the new
authorities will have a need for material relating to its own history to
stimulate and to satisfy the interest of local residents, who may subsequently
turn to the central collection to pursue their further studies.23p.11

Circumstances, as suggested above, were also changing in academia at this time. As
Brophy notes, by the early 1960s, university education ‘remained the preserve of an
elite, drawing almost exclusively from public and grammar schools’, a situation that
the Robbins Committee addressed by recommending ‘massive expansion: the
beginning of the end of higher education for the elite and the start of “mass higher
education,” including in the late 1960s and early 1970s, for example, the founding of
the Open University and the creation of polytechnics.24pp.6-7 The development in
local studies and its resources during this era was also reflected where, as Dixon puts
it, ‘local studies gradually became recognized as an academic discipline in its own
right in the 1960s.’25p.xvi The significance of this period to local collections in
academic libraries is also noted in Paul and Dewe’s earlier preliminary study, where
they draw attention to the ‘intensive development’ of higher and further education
in the 1960s and 1970s that ‘is reflected in the development of local collections to
the extent that half of those [collections covered in their survey] have been formed
since 1960.’26p.53

This era’s importance is similarly highlighted in the present study, where collections
begun in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s together represent just under half of the total,
with the 1970s providing the largest proportion in a single decade.

Of those libraries with local studies material, approximately a fifth of the responding
institution’s local collections were started in the 1970s, followed by almost 16% in
the 1960s then just under 13% in the 1980s. Perhaps not surprisingly, most further
education colleges began their collections during these decades – six in the 1960s, 13
in the 1970s, and nine in the 1980s – a possible indication of the growing importance
of these institutions at this time. On the other hand, responses from 47 universities
reveal that a significant number of these institutions – 23 or 48.94% – began their
collections prior to 1960, with a further eight university libraries (17.02%) starting a
local collection in the 1960s itself.xiv

When considering the age of collections and how this aspect may affect other
attributes, it is perhaps not surprising to note that that, when it comes to larger
collections, of those that comprise over a thousand items, the 19th Century and the
1960s are the most common starting-points. In the former case, of course, the age
of the collections is likely to have some bearing on the number of items collected
over a considerably lengthy period of time; in the case of the latter era, the
aforementioned expansion of both education and local studies itself in the 1960s
may well have contributed to the building of more substantial collections.

5.4 Conclusion

The geographical paradox of the local studies collection that can include, for
instance, in the case of Swansea University, ‘Wales and (to a lesser extent) other
Celtic countries’ or, as the respondent from New College, Oxford described materials
that cover, ‘any area of the country which has a connection with [the institution]’ is
an issue that has arisen in the findings reported in this chapter; and although this
paradox is arguably not the insurmountable ‘problem’ it might at first appear to be
when looking at local studies from a purely semantic perspective (the ‘local’ in ‘local
studies’), it is difficult to imagine the public library engaging – or wishing to engage –
in the same broad definition. Similarly, the almost innate difference with which local
studies materials are regarded in the literature, and implications from the survey
that a strong association remains between local studies and the public library’s
‘responsibility’ towards this subject, suggest that there may be a very specific

131

Chapter Five: The Existence of Local Studies Collections
purpose behind individual collections held within academic libraries or LRCs, unlike
material in the public library sector, where libraries are bound not only by
geography, but by a government-sanctioned ‘duty’ to collect material relevant to the
‘local area’. In the case of the academic library, suggestions have been made in the
literature and by other sources cited in this chapter that collections may well be
primarily influenced by either a librarian’s own interests, or as a reflection of the
institution’s objectives or goals (in terms of what the institution wishes to teach its
students), its background (the history of the institution, its legacies) or otherwise.

With just under two-thirds of first-questionnaire respondents’ libraries or LRCs
holding local studies material, it would appear that local studies resources do have
some degree of significance within the further and higher education fields. Whether
or not this is supportive of Paul’s observation in 1989 that an effort has been made
to integrate this subject ‘more formally’ into the curriculum will be explored further
in the chapters that follow.27p.34-36 However, at this stage, what is broadly suggested
is that while local investigation has long been recognised as a pursuit largely
undertaken by amateurs with, as pointed out, its resources commonly perceived as
the domain of the public library, a significant proportion of the academic sector has,
at the very least, made room for these resources despite this perception; further, a
number of collections, based on statuses such as age, size, and whether or not items
are held and recognised as a separate collection, provide an indication that, for some
resource centres, local studies items have some degree of importance within the
academic library’s holdings.

In order to build on the results presented in this chapter, in the chapter that follows
findings are presented that relate to the purpose behind local studies collections
held in university and college libraries, while, in chapter seven, this purpose will be
more fully explored.

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections

Chapter Six
The Current Situation: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections in
College and University Libraries
6.1 Introduction

Examining the purpose of local collections in an academic environment – the how
and why of the study’s aims – requires touching on a number of matters concerned
with the way in which libraries support the parent institution and, thus, its students.
According to Webb, the issue of academic library support is one that has largely
been neglected:

Students judge the quality of a library by the extent to which it supports their
learning resource requirements during the course of their studies [...] And
yet the way in which the collection should be managed to support the
learning experience is rarely considered as a separate issue. It seems curious
that there has been little emphasis in the literature and in discussions […] on
how libraries can support learning across the range of their services and
facilities.1p.135

While Webb is concerned with support on a broader scale, it is arguable that this
accusation holds a particular relevance for local studies collections when one
considers the somewhat precarious position of local materials within the academic
sphere in the first place. As has been proposed earlier in the thesis, the history of
local studies resources and their strong association with the public library sector
almost automatically positions local studies materials in academic libraries as
something of an anomaly – that is, the collections are in a place where one would
not typically expect to find such materials. This arguably gives the purpose behind
local collections in academic libraries a certain urgency that is missing from their
presence in public libraries. Public libraries are, after all, meant to hold local
material; making available local material is, indeed, frequently part of the public

135

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
library’s remit. As Dewe puts it, the public library has ‘a mission, and aims and
objectives – not just for the service as a whole, but for individual components, such
as the local studies collection.’2 There is, however, no such similar governmentsteered expectation or community-directed duty for college or university libraries to
hold local collections. Therefore, the reasons for stocking local material are required
to be more compelling than simply a mandatory requirement to do so. In the
previous chapter, the presence of local collections within libraries in further and
higher education institutions was examined, with primary focus placed on the scope,
scale and organisation of the collections; in this chapter, the reasons for the
existence of these collections within an academic setting begin to be explored.

Because this chapter’s focus is on the purpose of local collections in academic
libraries, findings are drawn principally from responses generated during the second
questionnaire stage of the project, as well as from interviews and visits to
institutions that followed this particular part of the survey. Questions are addressed
largely concerning issues such as support for courses and types of research
conducted, with related concerns such as how material is made available to users
also taken into account.

Additionally, while a degree of analysis will be applied to findings in this chapter,
further examination of the questions answered – and indeed, raised – by these
results, and those from chapter five, is conducted in the chapter that follows, where
a more reflective approach is taken to results, and consideration is given to issues
regarding teaching, learning and research, as well as matters concerning the building
of collections, and how these issues may or may not affect the library or learning
centre’s approach to providing support. Conclusions are also drawn and
recommendations made.

A total of 70 respondents replied to the second-stage questionnaire, comprising
almost 50% of those institutions holding local collections who had responded to the
first-stage survey, plus one respondent who had not participated in the first

6.2 Collection Management for Learning

The boundary between the existence and purpose of a collection within the library
or LRC can be a somewhat blurry one, particularly when it comes to the issue of
collection management. As will be discussed further in the following chapter, the
academic library itself exists within a specific context where its materials and
management arguably have a duty to reflect the purpose – that is, the aims and/or
mission – of the larger institution. Thus, the existence and purpose of the collections
held within the library become often difficult to separate. However, some degree of
distinction is possible. The previous chapter, for instance, was largely focused upon
the ‘basic facts’ concerning local collections in academic environments that emerged
from the first-stage questionnaire: whether or not a local collection exists in the first
place; the age of the collection; the geographical scope of the collection; and its
physical relationship to the library’s main stock. Here, the management issues
covered go slightly further, where the collection’s impact on students, teachers and
researchers – and how collection managers and assistants facilitate that impact – is
more immediate, covering access to local collections, ‘resource management’, and
the types of materials held.

137

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections

6.2.1 Collection Access: Subject Areas, Classification Schemes, Access,
OPAC, and Materials

6.2.1.1 Subject Areas

In addressing subject areas regarding collections wholly or partly integrated into the
main collection, analysing results became somewhat more complicated. In the first
questionnaire, respondents were asked if the local collection held was either
‘separate’, ‘integrated’ or ‘both’ when it came to its relationship with the main stock.
As mentioned in the previous chapter, of 140 first-questionnaire respondents 71
(50.71%) claimed that the collection was held separately, with 45 (32.14%) claiming
that the collection was wholly integrated, and 24 (17.14%) stating that the local
material was held both separately from and also throughout the main collection.
Although the second-questionnaire respondents were not asked to repeat the
original question of whether or not the collection was held separately, responses
were gathered and categorised based on the following: a) responses regarding
specific subject sections, b) responses regarding whether or not, if some or all of the
collection was housed separately, where it was housed, and c) where neither of the
previous sections were completed, the question of how collections were housed was
drawn from the first questionnaire.xv Inconsistencies between the first and second
questionnaires were noted. For instance, a number of those whose local collections
had, in the first questionnaire, been cited as ‘separate’ from the main collection,
now – based on answers given to the current relevant questions – appeared to have
collections that were, in fact, at least partly integrated. In some instances, no
explanation was suggested for the inconsistency other than the respondent having
previously identified the collection as ‘separate’, but now including subject sections
as areas where local material could be found. In other instances, the ‘confusion’ was
less ambiguous, but not to the point that the earlier response could be retroactively
revised under the assumption that a simple error had occurred. One respondent, for
example, noted that the earlier identified-as-separate collection was housed ‘within
xv

Only six responses were drawn using this method, all universities whose first questionnaire
responses had indicated a separate collection.

138

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
the main library, shelved separately as Local Collection.’xvi However, the respondent
also included ‘Education’ as an ‘Other’ subject section in which local material could
be found; thus the original first-questionnaire designation was changed in the
second questionnaire to ‘both separate and integrated’, leaving an inconsistency
between the two sets of answers.

Using similar cross-checking techniques with reference to the above-mentioned
responses in order to provide a summary of second-questionnaire responses, the
following results were possible:

As opposed to the first questionnaire, where a clear majority of just over half of
respondents identify their libraries or LRCs as holding local material fully separate
from the main collection, here the margin between wholly separate and integrated
collections is somewhat narrower, although it appears that separate collections are
still more common than fully integrated material.

While the results of this part of the questionnaire are unsatisfactory in respect of
consistency with the first stage of the survey, information regarding subject sections
can still be drawn out. Of 41 respondents whose collections are identified as fully or
partly integrated, local material could be found in the following subject sections,
listed in order of inclusion on the original form:

As is clear, when it comes to associating integrated local studies material with
specific subject areas, once again history dominates, with almost two-thirds of the
total respondents holding local studies items within historical sections in the library
or LRC. Geography’s second place ranking might also be considered unsurprising,
although its relatively substantial lower rate of inclusion could provide pause for
thought. Indeed, the fact that sections within the library covering studies relating to
when are almost twice as likely to include material relating to identifiable localities
as those areas of the library devoted to studies relating to where may appear, at
first glance, to be somewhat confounding, when one considers that the most
immediate concern of the term ‘local’ itself tends to be geographical in nature, even
when, as discussed in the last chapter, ‘local’ need not necessarily refer to one’s
immediate surroundings or ‘own’ locality (however either definition may be
determined). However, if one considers the actual content of material that might
typically be found in the ‘History’ and ‘Geography’ sections of a library, the division
between studies of ‘when’ and ‘where’ becomes more open to nuance. A section
headed ‘Geography’, for example, may well include material relating to, for

140

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
example, physical geography, which itself may comprise subjects such as
environmental resource management, climatology, landscape ecology and so on.
Even related fields such as urban planning may be found under the broader
‘geography’ category. However, while these subjects might include discussion of
specific localities, unless this aspect is explicitly highlighted as a feature of the given
material – say, a book concerned with the coastal geography of Cornwall – it is
unlikely to be thought of as material that can be labelled ‘local studies’. Similarly,
some geographical material may contain elements of historical study – in the
hypothetical example of Cornwall’s coastal geography, this may include content that
examines a change in the landscape over several years – but the main focus of the
material remains principally geographical in nature. Therefore, the book becomes a
‘local studies’ item held in the geography section of the library. Conversely, a book
concerned with the same geographical area that, on the face of it, might appear to
have a less specific focus, is more likely to contain content that can easily be
accommodated under the banner of ‘history’ than otherwise.

It is likely, for

example, that the relevance of any book entitled Cornwall in the Present Day would
be, by definition, very short-lived. However, a book simply focused on Cornwall in a
more general way might almost be expected to contain a history of the area and its
people and so is more easily found in sections of the library designated as ‘historical’
in nature.

While not cited as frequently as ‘History’, or even ‘Geography’, other subject areas
are represented, with the Archaeology section providing a home for local material
by just over a fifth of respondents, while Geology, Art and Local Government follow
at almost 15%. Amongst the ‘Other’xvii category are subjects such as Architecture,
Churches and Planning (all to be found in North Devon College); Conservation;
Environmental Science; Hospitality and Tourism; Statistics and Reports; Non-Subject
General Manuscript Holdings; and other non-specified subject areas.

Fifteen respondents checked the ‘Other’ category. However, when specified, three of
these ‘Other’ categories, supplied by universities, were, in fact, ‘local’ by nature. Since the
question was concerned with subject sections that incorporated local studies items, these
were discounted.

In terms of which classification scheme is employed by libraries and LRCs for local
studies collections, the Dewey Decimal System is favoured by a majority of second
questionnaire respondents. Of these, five also use a second scheme, three of which
comprise the library/LRC’s own scheme and one where the UDC is employed (the
only instance of the UDC cited). The Library of Congress is utilised by five
organisations, two of which also use a second ‘other’ scheme; while 19 libraries/LRCs
rely on a different scheme alone. Of these 19, seven are composed of the
library/LRC’s own scheme, five are based on a variation of an established scheme,
two employ more than one unspecified scheme, and four make use of other,
different schemes. Coleg Sir Gar’s Ammanford Campus’ Learning Centre employs no
scheme at all, explaining that ‘items haven’t even been accessioned or indexed.’ The
University of Aberdeen, meanwhile, makes use of what is described as a ‘local
scheme’, one that is ‘also used for Local Collections at Aberdeen, Rosemount
Viaduct,xix and ALIS [Aberdeen Library and Information Service], Old Meldrum.’
Interestingly, this provides an example where the classification system itself takes on
a ‘local’ flavour, covering both the academic and public library in a specific
geographic location.

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections

A preference for using the Dewey Decimal System is perhaps unsurprising, given its
ubiquity as a method of classification in general. As Hume and Lock state, its
recommended status in the Guidelines for local studies as the preferred scheme that
‘should be seriously considered for any open access collection of classified subject
catalogue [is] simply because it is the most familiar to users and standardized
electronic catalogues can use it.’3p.111 While it is not entirely clear which edition of
the Library Association’s Local Studies Libraries: Library Association guidelines for
local studies provision in public libraries – presumably the text referred to – is being
cited,xx the 2002 edition does not quite advocate Dewey in as wholehearted a
manner as that suggested. According to the 2002 guidelines:

A number of local studies classification schemes and many adaptations of
other more general schemes have been devised, but few have found
widespread use. Any scheme employed for open access collections or in a
classified subject catalogue should be devised with ease of use by readers in
mind. On this basis, a modification of a widely used classification scheme,
especially Dewey, should be seriously considered.4p.40

The key term omitted by Hume and Lock is, of course, modification, which the
guidelines strongly suggest is a requirement for the classification of local studies
material. Additionally, although the guidelines are aimed at public libraries, Bluck
also draws attention to potential imperfections when it comes to providing access in
academic libraries:

[L]ibrarians have excellent powers of organization, but they tend to organize
things from their own viewpoint, so that ordinary human beings find it
difficult to work out how the information is organized. A classic example is
the ‘straight through’ Dewey sequence, which may look neat and logical to a
librarian, but will infuriate students and academic staff. They will expect

143

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
obviously cognate subjects – computing and electronic engineering, literature
and language, politics and history – to be close to one another, and not on
different floors.5p101

While the examples of ‘illogically’ separated subjects on library shelves (as far as the
non-librarian is concerned) that Bluck provides are more extreme than is likely to be
the case when dealing with a relatively specific subject like ‘local studies’, cases that
do suggest Dewey’s limitations in this area can be found. For instance, at the
Department for Continuing Education at the University of Oxford the ‘general section
of local history is divided up as follows’:

941 English History; 941.006 History of the Landscape; 941.0061 Rural
History; 941.0062 Villages; 941.0063 Towns; 941.0072 English Local History;
941.00721-9 Various types of records; 941.0073 Handwriting, manuscripts;
941.0074 Latin for Local Historians; 941.01 - 941.085 General British History;
941.1 Scottish History; 941.5 Irish History; 942.1 English Counties.6

While there is nothing described that seems out of place as far as the collection of
materials goes – and one can easily imagine this group of items collected together in
one particular area of the library – the sequence is arguably problematic in places.
This is particularly noticeable at the end of the sequence, where, following Scottish
and Irish History, the reader now finds him- or herself looking at material that might
reasonably have been expected to be found amongst the items that follow from the
earlier sequenced English History.

However, since questionnaire respondents were not asked to elaborate on the
choice of classification schemes employed in the library or LRC, further information,
including discussion of any problems faced by participants, is not available for
analysis.

144

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections

6.2.1.3 OPAC and Indexing

Two studies in 1995 and 1997 focused on ‘the task of converting [into machinereadable form] the catalogue records still outstanding’. In terms of higher education
libraries, it was discovered that 28 million records awaited conversion, representing
‘some six million individual titles’. Four million of the 28 million records were ‘titles
to be found in special collections’, the majority of which were in humanities and
social sciences.7p556

When it comes to issues of access, the ability to search for items within a library
without having to physically browse through shelves is arguably paramount. As
Workman notes, ‘The catalogue is the main tool enabling the user to ascertain
whether a required item is held in the library and if so where, and, increasingly,
whether it is available for use or not. Its other function is to enable the user to
determine what material the library holds on a particular subject.’ 8p.152 In the case
of local studies, the ability to determine which items are held where is perhaps
especially important when no separate local studies section exists and the user may
be uncertain as to where local material may be found. Here, respondents were
asked about the number of local studies items that could be found listed on the
library or LRC’s Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC), a database of materials
employed to enable users to search for specific items or groups of similar items. In
1991, Workman discussed the impact of this type of electronic catalogue and its
influence on access:

The introduction of OPACs in [then-] recent years has offered users a more
effective and sophisticated means of searching the catalogue than was
possible with earlier catalogues on cards or microfiche. Subject access is
much easier, with many systems providing options to search by subject
keywords or using Boolean logic.9p.152

At the time Workman made this statement, OPAC was a new, and arguably muchimproved, way of searching the library catalogue; an alternative to leafing through
145

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
worn, easily-misplaced card catalogues. As time has gone on, however, other
information-searching tools have emerged, that may not be able to tell the user
where a particular book is shelved in a library, but can provide vast amounts of
information in just a few short strokes. Yet, despite internet search engines’ rising
popularity as the search-tools of choice,10p.5 OPAC continues to be used within both
public and academic libraries, albeit in a much different form, with the development
of next-generation catalogues that allow for a higher level of functionality – including
relevance ranking and more user-friendly interfaces – and, if built into an Integrated
Library System (ILS), can allow more direct access to online content.11pp.8-10 OPAC,
then, remains an important tool when accessing local studies resources.

Minus those whose collections are not listed on an OPAC, as per the responses of ‘Other’
to the previous question; and one other respondent who left the field undefined.

146

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
Overall, almost 50% of all seventy second questionnaire respondents claimed to
have all local material listed on the OPAC; while over a quarter responded that
‘most’ local studies items were held in the database. Although the number of those
whose local items are not available to any degree on an OPAC system is small, details
emerged that shed a little more light on both the often idiosyncratic nature of how
local studies collections are approached by collection managers and the ‘backroom’
issue which can render these collections invisible. As mentioned above, for instance,
according to the respondent at the Cole Sir Gar Ammanford Campus Learning
Centre, where the campus is ‘housed in what was once a college of mining [...] We
have never had/made the time to catalogue the material and publicise its presence
with potential users’. While the collection, as suggested in chapter seven, may not
quite be a ‘lost cause’, it is not unlikely that the lack of a catalogued presence
contributes to the current non-use of this potentially valuable material.

OPAC was also cited by several respondents when participants were asked an open
question regarding if and how local materials were indexed. Of 48 institutions who
provided information on this subject, 41 described indexing local collections to one
degree or another. Indexing techniques took different forms. For instance, in
addition to OPAC, card-based catalogues, subject-headings employed in in-house
library systems, Heritage, printed book-based catalogues, web sites, and even paperbased lists were cited. Some libraries used a number of different methods,
depending on the types of local material being indexed. At the University of Paisley,
for example, the book collection only is indexed using OPAC, while ‘One archival
collection (Norman Buchan Parliamentary Papers) [is] separately catalogued on the
web site.’ Similarly, Keble College Library in Oxford University relies on both OLIS – a
catalogue of the University of Oxford’s Bodleian Libraries – and ‘Handlists for
material in the Archives’, additionally explaining that the library has ‘recently
appointed an archivist who will catalogue the archives to professional standards.’

As noted above, being able to search for items is crucial to the user’s ability to access
material. Not only as an alternative to the searching limitations that merely
browsing can effect, but, as information becomes increasingly available
147

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
electronically, the effective indexing of items can frequently provide a type of
organised guidance to material that might otherwise be overlooked or difficult to
find. As Brophy suggest, ‘It is arguable that one of the major reasons that we still
need libraries is that they can bring order to what is otherwise the chaos of the
world wide web, where inadequate description of information objects makes
effective discovery of relevant items difficult.’12p.120

6.2.1.4 Access and Storage and Preservation
Given the potentially broad range of materials available for local studies
investigation, access to the physical collections themselves, however, is an active
concern. Respondents were asked about different users’ access to the local
collection itself:

Over two-thirds of respondents reported that their local collection was available to
all users, indicating that, overall, access is largely uninhibited for those who wish to
make use of the collections; while a fifth of libraries/LRCs limited access to staff and
students. Of the ‘Other’ responses, more than one cited that access was by
registration and appointment only, while Weymouth College reported that their
local collection is, by default, reference only, but that loans could be arranged. In
the case of the University of Cambridge’s Gonville and Caius College Library, a
specific readership is indicated in terms of access to the integrated collection,
described as limited to ‘Students, Fellows [and] External Scholarly Researchers.’

148

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
One of the chief matters affecting access relates to storage and preservation.
Respondents were invited to comment on any issues in this area that may have an
impact on how readers interact with the collection. A number of practitioners noted
explicitly that there are no issues; indeed, for one respondent, from Truro College,
the matter of access forms what appears to be a central principle regarding the
collection itself, with the practitioner explaining that ‘This is a live collection [i.e.
current and accessible] – we do not and would not aim to have a collection with
special requirements.’ While most other respondents for whom storage or
preservation issues have no effect did not offer any further information, on three
occasions it was noted that, because the items were of no significant monetary
value, access was not restricted; and, in two of these cases, the respondents also
noted that the materials were neither ‘rare’ nor ‘ancient’. ‘Value’, ‘rarity’, and ‘age’
was also specifically cited by a number of respondents whose collections had, to
some degree, limited access. At Keele University’s Special Collections and Archives,
for instance, ‘Particularly rare, fragile, valuable or oversize items are available upon
request during staffed hours’, with the respondent further explaining that ‘Storage
away from the main stock means that Material is unavailable when the office is
closed,’ while Cardiff University’s Information Services/Library reported that ‘As
items become more fragile (acidic paper, etc.), they are moved to the closed shelf
collections, to ensure long term preservation.’ Some other respondents indicated a
future requirement for special storage or limited access – or a current need that
simply has not been met at present. The Learning Centre at the University of Derby,
for example, expressed a need for ‘separate storage/display for some of the more
valuable books, but don’t have [this] yet. Some books are on open access which
shouldn’t be.’ In a similar vein, at North Nottinghamshire College’s Library/Learning
Resource Centre the respondent notes that ‘some of the items are deteriorating,
e.g., in the older items staples […] and pages are coming loose. We will have to
consider having these on a reference only basis.’
Concerns about preservation and/or storage also has an effect on collaboration with
other services outside of the library or learning centre. In the case of West Cheshire
College, while the respondent stated that the library does ‘not have significant

149

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
storage or preservation issues’ it was also reported that ‘Items that might require
[special storage or preservation] would be passed on to Cheshire Archives or to the
local reference library’. Similarly, at the Cyncoed Campus Learning Centre in the
University of Wales Institute, Cardiff, ‘In the rare instance that an item is identified
as having specialist preservation needs, and especially if little-used within UWIC, I
would liaise with the Glamorgan Archives Service to see if the material could be
lodged with them.’ The possibility of distributing stock elsewhere is also taken up by
the Somerset College of Arts Integrated Learning Centre, who states that ‘Donated
items of any real age/significance would probably be transferred to the Somerset
Archives or Local Studies Collections.’ These cases are particularly interesting when
one considers both the ‘anomaly’ of local collections in academic libraries and the
more ‘traditional’ relationship that is perceived to exist between local studies and
the public sector, where it is acknowledged that certain materials might well be
better-placed elsewhere, even if the decision to place stock in more ‘capable’ hands
might principally be guided by concerns over preservation.
Enquiries regarding access and storage were also made with reference to archives,
where respondents were asked for information on whether archival material – that
is, the likes of records, letters, diaries, manuscripts and so on – was housed outside
of the library, for example, in a Special Collections department. Of 59 respondents
who supplied answers, 18 responded affirmatively, although a small number noted
that, like a few respondents who had replied negatively, archives were housed in a
separate section in the library. Keble College Library in Oxford University, for
instance, explained that archives are ‘Housed in the locked stack, a separate location
within the library,’ while at Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge University, items
are held in a ‘Separate archive with [a] part-time professional archivist, though
housed in same accommodation as the Library.’ A number of respondents explicitly
cited Special Collections departmentsxxii – both within and without the library – as

xxii

It should be noted that, of those who responded to the second questionnaire, six
identified as Special Collections and/or Archives. These were: Keele University Special
Collections and Archives; the Welsh Library and Special Collections at the University of
Wales, Bangor; the University of St Andrews Special Collections Department; the University
of Huddersfield’s University Archives and Special Collections; the Library and Archives at The

150

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
the designated location for archival material, including the University of Kent, Cardiff
University, and Keele University, the last-mentioned of whom explained that, ‘The
Local Collection is one of our Special Collections and part of the Special Collections
and Archives Department […] It is the only open access Special Collection, as the
archival material is housed in adjacent archive stores, but still within the University’s
main library.’ While the questionnaire did not explicitly enquire as to how archives
were handled when the institution is, for whatever reason, unable or unwilling to
accommodate these items, it is perhaps still somewhat surprising that only one
respondent made mention of external resource organisations: The Cyncoed Campus
Learning Centre at the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff, noted that archival
material that makes its way to the centre ‘would be offered to the Glamorgan
Archive Service, or possibly the Public Library Local Studies Department,’ suggesting
that the learning centre views these establishments as better equipped to house
such items, and echoing the respondents above whose concerns regarding
preservation and storage lead them to place local material elsewhere.

6.2.1.5 Materials, Study Packs and Publicity
Issues raised during the discussion of storage and preservation, as well as results
presented in the previous chapter regarding the age of the collections, go some way
to underlining the point that, as Barber puts it, ‘The value of materials in the local
studies collection is that many are rare or unique […] Every local studies library is a
specialist resource.’13p.69 Once again, this characterisation of its resources arguably
posits local studies as inherently different from other fields, where textbooks and
other more contemporary resources may form the bulk of material that supports
study. In the next chapter, the acquisition of collections is discussed within the
context of looking at the purpose behind building local collections in the first place
and whether there may be value in acquiring material that might not be used at the
present time. Here, results are reported regarding how local material is acquired
that may have some bearing, not only on the issue of collecting as an ideological
concern, but also on the matter of the types of material that are being collected.

Antiquarian/Second-

While over two-thirds of respondents reported that local material is acquired from a
library supplier, the most common source from which local items are obtained are
donations and/or bequests. In the following chapter, this type of acquisition will be
shown to have had a considerable influence on local studies’ presence in academia
in at least one particular case; as a more general trend, it perhaps speaks once again
to the difference of local studies in comparison to other academic subjects,
suggesting two significant and related aspects of local studies resources: not only
the kinds of material that might be found in local studies collections – that is, the not
uncommon unique quality of many items – but also where they can be found and the
importance of these sources to the subject itself. By their very nature, local studies
resources, if archival, may be limited to one or two original documents (say, a deed
or a letter); if published, the scale of the publication, depending on the locality
covered, may well be quite small – that is, not mass-produced or seldom out-ofprint. It also, however, suggests a third aspect: a somewhat passive approach, at
least initially, to collecting. While the development and maintenance of a sound
local collection, particularly within academia, may frequently rely on an active
interest taken by a librarian or manager, the fact that donations and bequests form
such a large proportion of material perhaps suggests that – unless the librarian is
actively engaged in seeking out potential benefactors – the collection is frequently
dependent on the goodwill and generosity of others in order to grow, develop or
even exist in the first place. This, however, is not necessarily a criticism or a
152

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
shortcoming that can be corrected. Short of harassing benefactors who may not be
willing or able to part with material at a given time, the nature of much local studies
material, as mentioned, may well almost dictate such a dependency.

When considering the purpose of any collection in the academic library, central to
the issue of access – in terms of both admission to the items themselves as well as
user-friendliness – is the format of its items. The increasing role of the internet as a
part of everyday life in developed countries has led to a revolution of sorts in a
number of ways when it comes to the availability of material; but, while accessing
information from home or other more ‘convenient’ settings is becoming an
increasingly popular way to gather data, both public and academic libraries continue
to serve as environments from which all kinds of resources can be – and are
expected to be – accessed. Suggesting that ‘making provision for access to
electronic resources […] is at the heart of information management today’ Breivik
and Gee also note that:

This does not imply that print materials are a thing of the past. The reality is
that one million new titles were published worldwide from 2003 to 2004 […]
Electronic resources will never meet all the scholarly needs of the campus,
nor will the internet.14p208

This is perhaps especially true when it comes to local studies collections, where,
given the various forms local research can take, and the variety of subjects that may
incorporate elements of local studies, a broad range of material is available. As
Barber puts it:

The local studies collection is constantly being renewed. It is a contemporary
resource, not purely a retrospective one, in which current and historical
materials are of equal value […] The scope of its materials reflects an evolving
interdisciplinary focus encompassing geography, economics, social science,
planning, commerce, politics and culture […] Printed books and pamphlets
are still at the heart of the collection, but maps and plans, prints and
153

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
photographs, visual and sound recordings, and increasingly electronic forms,
are all part of the rich resource which exists to meet the needs of users, and
enable staff to answer every kind of enquiry about the local area.15p.69

Based in part on Barber’s comprehensive outline of various materials in which local
resources are either the primary focus or can be found, respondents were asked to
indicate which of the following types of local material were held in the library or LRC:
Regional Histories; Victoria County Histories; Reference Works; Government
Publications; Literature; Sale Catalogues; Dissertations and Theses; Directories;
Electoral Registers; Old Parish Registers; International Genealogical Index; Census
Enumerators' Book; Other Genealogical Sources; Newspapers; Periodicals; County,
Town, Parish Maps; Ordnance Survey Maps; Goad Maps and Plans; Photographs;
Prints and Engravings; Drawings and Watercolours; Other Illustrated Material;
Ephemera; Oral Histories; Music Recordings; In-house (film) Productions;
Documentaries; Feature Films; and Television.

Respondents were also asked in which formats the above material was to be found.
Choices comprised the following:

Text-based material

Hard Copy; Micro-form; CD-ROM; Internetbased; Other

Audio material

Reel-to-Reel; Gramophone; Record; Cassette;
Compact Disc; Digital; Other

Visual material

Projector; Video Cassette; DVD; Digital; Other

A detailed account of different local studies materials and formats held in
respondents’ libraries and LRCs can be found in Appendix 4: Materials. To
summarise, however, of the 69 participants who responded to the question of which
materials are held in what formats, the vast majority of text-based material is held in
hard-copy form, with regional histories, reference works, literature, Ordnance
Survey Maps, and government publications proving the most commonly held items
across most institution types. Of formats other than hard-copy, CD-ROMs and
154

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
Micro-form are considerably less popular, while Internet-based formats are, overall,
considerably more commonly used than either. Indeed, in most instances, online
information takes precedence over both CD-ROMs and Micro-form in terms of
popularity, most notably in the cases of government publications, directories,
newspapers and Ordnance Survey Maps. Given the rate at which internet
communication and access to information is increasing, it is more than likely that, as
Breivik and Gee indicate, access to electronic resources is fast becoming central to
the provision of information in libraries.

Audio material overall is not commonly held in college or university libraries, with a
small presence noted for all formats. The most popular item, for example, comprises
oral histories on cassette tape, held by less than ten respondents. When it comes to
visual formats, perhaps surprisingly, videocassette is, at the time of this survey, still
more prevalent than DVD,xxiii with documentaries and television programmes the
most frequently cited material, albeit not to the extent of the most popular hardcopy items. However, this may indicate, once again, the unique nature of many local
items; for instance, over 14% of items on videocassette are cited as in-house
productions – that is, these ‘exclusive’ items were created by the institution at a
time when video was the preferred format and have possibly not been upgraded or
digitalised for finance-related reasons or even simply a lack of interest. In other
instances, upgrading to a more recent format may not be possible – for example, the
documentaries that make up the largest single proportion of items held on
videocassette – due to lack of availability.

It may be suggested that, should a similar survey regarding materials be carried out
in the near future, the findings presented herein may well look quite different, given
the rapid growth of digital materials as a source of information, an issue discussed
further in the chapter that follows. As these results stand, however, it does appear
that local studies collections provide a wealth of different materials with which the
student, teacher or researcher can engage.
xxiii

Blu-ray, not officially released for commercial use until 2006, was not included in the
questionnaire as a potential format.

155

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections

The question of study packs was also raised in the second questionnaire. Of the 60
institutions who responded as to whether or not study packs were available for
students’ use, only seven libraries or LRCs responded affirmatively, leaving 88.33% of
respondents not making use of this resource.

Belinda Allen at North Lindsey College – one of the seven responding institutions
that do provide local studies packs for students – describes how the packs are
compiled, where, once a week, one or two experienced members of the library staff
check various sources for new items, organise newspaper and other cuttings and
materials for inclusion, check through already-existing items to make sure they are
still relevant, and, generally, ensure that the packs are ‘in order’. Allen, however,
notes that the packs are ‘probably not as heavily-used as they should be.’16 Indeed,
one second-year student, considering a project on ‘women in domestic service’ as
part of the English and History course at the college, claims that, while students were
informed in lectures about various resources, such as History Today, and locally-held
periodicals, they were not made aware of the study packs.17 Allen disagrees with
this account, explaining that, not only does the library offer an induction, but an
index is supplied in photocopied form for the student’s use. Notices and guides
referring to the resources available are also visible throughout the learning centre.

156

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections

Figure 2: 'Shipping/River Navigation/Ferries' Study Pack, Learning Resource Centre, North
Lindsey College

Allen does point out that, once the students are made aware of the packs, they
become a valuable resource:

I would probably say that student you’ve spoken to today, she will probably
use those quite often now … If they can use it once, they’ll probably find that
they’ll always be able to use it … somewhere, weave it in with what they’re
doing – their research or whatever […] it’s just getting them to use it in the
first instance [that’s the problem].

Yet, given the small number of respondents whose libraries or LRCs make local
studies packs available in the first place, it appears that, as a resource, these items
are not particularly popular with collection managers. Also, while study packs
provide a convenient way for students (or other researchers) to engage with
resources, once again, the possibility is raised that access to local resources might be

157

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
made too convenient for students who may benefit from external field research, and
from experiencing other research-based skills, such as the ability to collect and
collate material and information from a variety of sources.

The issue regarding awareness of resources was also raised in terms of whether
libraries or LRCs made use of publicity materials in order to promote their local
studies collections. Of 68 respondents who answered the question, only 17 replied
in the affirmative. Asked to provide brief details, a small number mentioned online
presence as a form of publicity, although the amount of information available varies
from ‘only in [a] note’ on the University of Paisley’s library website, to ‘detailed
information aimed at distance/external users’ on Keele University’s Special
Collections website. Institutions such as Clydebank College, Dudley College of
Technology, and Queen’s University Belfast, appear to restrict promotion to within
the library itself. Clydebank describes its publicity material as ‘just basic awareness
poster/shelf guides’; Dudley provides ‘Library-based displays aimed at all users with
interest in the subject’; and Queen’s University promotes unspecified material to
‘Our own users and visitors.’ At St Andrews University publicity material is less
precise: ‘Leaflets cover most areas of Special Collections holdings, but not specifically
local studies on their own.’

A number of respondents use more than one format to promote local studies
material. For example, in addition to web-based information, Keele also employs the
use of a factsheet ‘primarily aimed at visitors entering the Main Library’; leaflets and
posters are used at the University of Huddersfield; and the Southampton Institute
provides the following combination of publicity material:

Posters aimed at all students/staff; leaflet explaining collection and
promoting its uses along with other local studies resources in the area; a
subject page on our website providing links to useful local information that is
available online or held in the collection.

158

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
Others, such as North Nottinghamshire College and the Institute of Continuing
Education at the University of Cambridge, include information in prospectuses and
brochures.

While the information provided by respondents reveals a variety of publicity
materials and methods used to promote local studies collections, the low number of
libraries and LRCs who make use of promotional material at all – whether in print or
web-based form – indicates that generating interest in local studies resources is not
a priority for most.

6.2.2 Resources: Budgets, Staffing, Induction and Training, and Enquiries

As Brophy suggests, while the term ‘resource management’ can be principally
applied to financial considerations, a ‘broader definition is possible’. He points to,
not only budgets, staff and stock, but also knowledge as ‘the “resources” of the
academic library.’18p.107 With this in mind, this section looks at questions regarding
funds allocated to local collections, as well as staffing and the ways in which the
knowledge or expertise of staff is utilised as a ‘resource’ when it comes to handling
local studies enquiries.

A marginal proportion of responding institutions has a budget for local collections
that is separate from the library’s main funds. A range of reasons, provided by a
small number of respondents, were offered for this. Most explanations simply noted

159

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
that monies required for purchase or upkeep fell under the larger library budget. In
two further cases where local funds formed part of the larger budget, the acquisition
of local resources was explicitly tied to whether or not there was a curriculum-based
requirement for such items. The respondent from the University of Lincoln noted
that ‘If local items are on history reading lists I can purchase items but, if not, there is
rarely money to buy local items and the collection depends on donations; in the case
of Trinity and All Saints College, Leeds, it was explained that ‘Stock has been
purchased from general funds or obtained in the past from the old BL Booknet
service. Little has been added in recent years because courses do not currently focus
on local studies.’ Where local collections were separately funded, more than one
respondent cited a ‘small’ allocation of funds. The collection manager at North
Lindsey College indicated that the separation of funds was performed ‘in-house’ –
that is, the decision to divide the budget was made somewhat unofficially, with the
respondent noting that ‘I do not receive a separate budget.’ Bridgend College
provided a notable account of its separate local studies collection budget, one that
stands in interesting contrast with the two respondents cited earlier whose
acquisition of stock was dependent on curriculum need. In the case of Bridgend, the
respondent explained that ‘Expenditure on books and other material on Welsh life
and history are denoted separately in my budget records; this is because the
resources do not directly support any part of the syllabus, but reinforce the identity
of the library.’ Bridgend’s approach to its local studies collection in this matter,
however, appears to be quite unusual, since the overall picture suggests that local
resources do not appear to be a priority when it comes to the distribution of funds.

6.2.2.2 Staffing, Induction and Training, and Enquiries

In the second questionnaire, questions were put forward as to the staffing of the
libraries’ local studies collection and whether separate induction and training
approaches were employed. A further question was asked regarding enquiry policies
and whether a specific policy was in place for responding to local studies-related
questions. When analysing the responses to these separate areas of enquiry, it
became apparent that relaying these findings could not be done without a significant
160

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
degree of overlap occurring, especially when, not entirely surprisingly, amongst the
responses to the subjects of induction and training, explicit mention was made of the
ability to handle readers’ enquiries.

Only eight of the seventy libraries or LRCs that took part in the second questionnaire
has a local collection that is separately staffed, all of these in universities. The types
of staff arrangements cited reveal a fairly broad range of different approaches to the
staffing of local collections. The Haddon Library of Archaeology and Anthropology at
Cambridge explain that ‘the Cambridge Antiquarian Society's collection is the
responsibility of the Society's Hon. Librarian,’ while Keble College Library at Oxford
describe a Main Reading Room staffed by a Librarian and Library Assistant, while its
Archives and Locked Stack employ an Archivist and Librarian. Special Collections
staff were cited by three respondents, with St Andrews referring to ‘a staff of eleven
[including nine full-time equivalent] who deal with the local material as well as other
collections’, noting that the collection is ‘Separately staffed, then, in the respect that
it is staffed separately from the general library lending and reference collections.’
Queens University in Belfast cites two full-time equivalent library assistants, plus one
special collections assistant and a ‘pool of people, including PhD students [who
cover] term-time evening duty’; while Keele University describes an arrangement
comprising ‘One Special Collections and Archives Assistant, with occasional help
from Library Assistants from the Main Library.’ In the remaining three instances, a
part time archivist is employed; another makes use of two full-time equivalent staff,
including a Senior Assistant; and, in the case of the Aerial Photograph Library, Unit
for Landscape Modelling at Cambridge, one librarian is employed, while ‘others [are
used] to collect data.’ While these examples show, as mentioned, quite a broad
161

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
selection of ways in which local resources are staffed – including, in some cases, the
adoption of what appears to be a necessarily flexible approach – the small
proportion of libraries and LRCs who designate staff for, specifically, local studies
collections, is small. Furthermore, of the eight who do employ staff for this purpose,
only one – Queen’s University, Belfast – incorporates both induction and training in
local studies librarianship.xxiv

Despite the somewhat uneven responses received in terms of which fields were and
were not completed, it is nonetheless clear that induction and training in local
studies librarianship within academic libraries is not common.

The remaining responses to both categories were either ‘no’ or appeared as ‘undefined’.
In addition to the two respondents whose libraries or LRCs provided both induction and
training, there were two who filled in only the training field, leaving the induction field as
‘undefined’.
xxv

162

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
Reasons for not providing induction or training specifically in local studies were,
again, varied. The size of the collection was cited more than once, with, for instance,
the Learning Centre Manager at Duchy College, Rosewarne noting that ‘the
collection is very small and all staff are aware of its existence and subject content
which is very specialised. Any request for use is normally referred to myself before
access is given,’ while, similarly, at Weymouth College, the collection is both ‘very
small and rarely used. Staff know about it and can direct people to it.’ While both
these responses focus initially on the small size of the collections, it is interesting to
observe that the respondents also take care to note that the collections are both
known to staff and are accessible, suggesting that visibility is perhaps not a given.
The former response also touches on – but does not make explicit – the suggestion
that a staff member’s own, sometimes broader, experience may also be posited as a
factor in whether or not induction or training is provided or deemed necessary. The
library at the University of Lincoln, for instance, does not provide induction or
training since, according to the respondent, not only is the collection ‘tiny’, but ‘as
Subject Librarian for History, I can manage it myself.’ Similarly, at the University of
Kent, no special induction or training is provided since ‘The History Subject Librarian
deals with any enquiries.’ Other libraries operate in a similar way in terms of relying
on other staff, but this may depend on the specific type of library or department
within the institution. For instance, at the University of St Andrews Special
Collections department, ‘No specifically local studies training is given, but the
general training and induction given to staff will include familiarisation with all of the
collections; and we have collection area specialists within the staff, who will supply
further information/training as necessary.’ During a follow-up interview in 2005,
however, Dr Norman Reid touched on a further element of the issue of staff
expertise when it comes to local studies. He talked about a then-new staff member
who was employed in part due to her strong interest in local history as a subject,
having conducted a significant amount of local studies work on Auchtermuchty in
Fife. Dr Reid opined that, to have someone with a strong interest in her own local
history was helpful to readers, because ‘she knows the roots to research ... she
knows the techniques, even if she doesn’t know the specifics of the local history [of
St Andrews itself] ... She knows the techniques for accessing it.’ Here, then, the
163

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
question of what kind of induction or training might be appropriate to enable
successful management of a local collection is raised. Duckett’s somewhat facetious
tone in the previous chapter regarding the tragedy of the heroic, but ultimately
doomed, local studies librarian makes it difficult to ascertain just how seriously one
should take his assessment, but certainly his contention that the librarian’s skills are
‘untransferable’ seems to fall somewhat flat when one considers Dr Reid’s point
about the techniques that enable the history (or otherwise) of a locality in which the
librarian is not an expert to be uncovered. It suggests that, far from being a section
of the library in which the custodian’s expertise relies solely on his or her fascination
with the locality under question – in which ‘expertise’ is presumed to equal the
ability to act as a human encyclopaedia – there is room for induction and training
that focuses on techniques and methods rather than familiarity with the location
itself. This is not to say that there is no room at all for Duckett’s more ‘traditional’
local studies librarian – the ‘encyclopaedic’ kind, as his comment on ‘untransferable’
skills seems to suggest; after all, it is more likely than not that the majority of local
studies enquiries that the staff member is required to deal with are about the
locality itself – that is, enquiries based on ‘who’ or ‘what’ or ‘when’ questions. What
Dr Reid’s take on potentially useful skills does imply is that a staff member might be
trained in local studies management without having to be an expert in the locality;
that there are techniques and approaches that are, if not necessarily unique, then
particularly useful when it comes to information that falls under the ‘local studies’
heading. In other words, it might be said that the difference between the librarian
who knows all about the town/city/county and the librarian who might not know
about the locality, but knows how to access this information is similar to the
difference highlighted in the colloquial analogy between giving a man a fish and
teaching him to fish. Brophy, for example, cites several different ‘forms’ of enquiry
that might be made by users: directional, factual, relating to policy or procedure,
skills-related, known-item searching, and subject. He notes that ‘This last category
is, of course, the most complex, and may require the librarian to refer the user on to
a specialist in that subject.’ Here, Brophy appears to form a link between the subject
enquiry, which he describes as an enquiry ‘such as how to find information on any
particular subject’ [researcher’s emphasis]; and the factual enquiry, characterised as
164

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
‘asking for a discrete piece of information, such as the boiling point of a
chemical.’19p.165 Unfortunately, the references to ‘enquiries’ by respondents do not
specify whether answers given to users relied on actual information itself (who,
what, when) or ways in which the information might be retrieved (how).

Regarding formal procedures, respondents were also asked to reply to an open
question regarding whether or not their libraries or LRCs had a policy for dealing
with information enquiries relating specifically to local studies. Fifty-one
respondents offered replies that varied in terms of the amount of information
supplied. While quite a few respondents answered with a simple ‘No’, offering no
further information, a number of more detailed responses revealed a range of
different approaches towards local studies enquiries. More than one respondent
explained that local studies enquiries were treated, for instance, as the respondent
from Dunstable College put it, ‘as per the entire collection’ or that, like Southport
College and the Head of Rare Books at Cambridge University Library, no ‘separate’ or
‘individual’ policy was in place. In one case, the Library of the Museum of English
Rural Life (MERL) noted that, while any local studies enquiry ‘comes under the
general enquiry policy’ the policy was ‘currently under review with a view to FOI
compliance’. This was not the only time that the Freedom of Information Actxxvi was
cited with respect to enquiries. In addition to MERL, the University of Paisley noted
that, ‘We try to deal with any requests received. If we are unable to satisfy we will
refer on to another source (members of the Old Paisley Society or public library local
history collection, or national/regional archives, etc.). FOI might (or might not) affect
this.’ Referring to the Freedom of Information Act (Scotland) 2002, and noting that

SLAINTE’s Freedom of Information (FOI) Section at
http://www.slainte.org.uk/foiscotland/foiindex.htm.

165

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
the ‘public sector organisations and institutions’ affected include both ‘government
agencies and educational institutions’, as SLAINTExxvii puts it:

At the heart of FOI is the right of everyone to access information. Many
governments are now requiring public authorities and other publicly funded
organisations to provide the public with access to as much information as
possible. This is resulting in a major change in culture, with more emphasis
on greater openness and accountability.20

Since local collections often can and do include primary resources such as
government documentation, it is clear that consideration will have to be given to
policies that – even if not specifically limited to local material – may affect how such
information is handled. As well as policies regarding enquiries or requests, access
policies – whether formal or informal – may have to be reconsidered.

The response from the University of Paisley also brings up the issue of collaboration
with other holders of local studies materials. For instance, North Devon College cites
‘access to the Devon Libraries Catalogue’ and an ability to ‘borrow some of the
county’s printed materials’ if the library is unable to help directly with enquiries; this
comes in addition to being able to ‘phone the Public Local Studies Library Staff and
make an appointment for our College staff or students to visit them at a mutually
convenient time.’ Bridgend College too relies on outside assistance, where ‘any
enquiries which we can’t satisfy are usually referred to the Bridgend Libraries HQ
where there is a local studies collection with [a] designated member of staff.’

It has been noted earlier in the thesis that local studies and local studies collections
are not uncommonly viewed as ‘different from’ or ‘special’ when it comes to how
they are approached in comparison – or contrast – with other subjects or areas of
study. Overall, when it comes to resource management and local collections, it

166

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
appears that this ‘special’ status can be just as complex as any other aspect of local
studies. For instance, it is interesting to compare the response from the library at St
Edmund Hall in the University of Oxford with that of Dunstable College. The former
notes that ‘the [local collection] is treated and so administered in the same way as
the main collection, so no special training is necessary’, while the latter responds
that ‘All sections [are] treated similarly.’ While at first glance, these responses seem
very similar in nature, in the case of Dunstable College, the respondent gave a ‘Yes’
response to the question of local studies librarianship induction and training, thus
indicating a significant difference in the way local collections management can be
approached even when not singled out as particularly different from the rest of the
collection. In the former case, not treating the local collection any differently means
that no special attention is given to the ways in which, say, enquiries might be
handled or to how the material itself might be approached in terms of familiarising
oneself with (at least some) of the content. In the latter case, it would appear that
every section of the library – including local studies – is treated as ‘special’, with each
having its own particular needs. In another instance, the University of Durham made
a specific point of noting that, in its case, local studies is not different, stating that,
‘There have been no special needs identified for the local studies collection in terms
of induction and training.’ Here, it is not simply a case of treating all collections the
same way regardless, or of treating all collections as individually ‘special’. Given the
wording of Durham’s response, it is not clear whether all collections are treated
similarly unless proven otherwise or all collections are carefully evaluated as to
whether or not they require special attention; either way, the response does not
negate the fact that the library has, indeed, identified the needs of the local studies
collection as ‘not special’.

6.2.3 Supporting Subjects
Of the 68 second questionnaire respondents who replied to the question of whether
courses in the institution were supported by the local collection, 55 (80.88%)
indicated that courses were supported to some degree. Of these, nine did not
specify which courses or area of study, but instead provided a broad description of

167

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
how the collection might typically be used. For example, while the collection in the
library at Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge is apparently used in a supportive
capacity, the respondent noted that ‘the library is geared towards undergraduate
research. Local studies material is not bought to support any specific course.’ Of
the 46 respondents who did provide more precise course-related information,
specific responses were grouped into subject categories. The most popular were as
follows:

These results are discussed further in chapter seven, within the contexts of the
impact of local studies on the curriculum and attitudes towards building collections.
In the immediate context, as can be noted, the subject-area most commonly making
use of the local collection is, perhaps unsurprisingly, history. Courses include History
at BA level, Post-graduate History courses, and one course described as ‘Social
History’. The second most frequently cited subjects, albeit at less than half the rate
of the above-mentioned more broad history-based disciplines, are specifically local
studies-related. Courses included those such as ‘Welsh Language and Literature’,
MA Local History, a local studies module as part of an access-level History course,

168

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
and a Local History Diploma. English, including one ‘Creative Writing’ course, is the
next most popular subject-area to make use of local collections, while Businessbased subjects include Business Studies and Management. Subjects cited by five
respondents each comprise Archaeology; Travel and Tourism or Leisure-related
courses; and Art-focused subjects including Art Design and Art History (note the
historical nature of the latter). Other less frequent responses highlight the sheer
variety of subjects that can, and apparently do, make use of local collections held in
the library or LRC. These include Education, Modern Studies, Popular Culture, Social
Work, Environmental Studies, Philosophy, Theology, Psychology, Economics,
Engineering, a course based around the collection of Meteorological Data, and
Sports Therapy. While these results may not provide the depth of detail supplied in
the case of North Lindsey’s English and History course, discussed in the chapter that
follows, it does appear that local studies is having some impact on a variety of, for
the most part, more ‘mainstream’ subjects, allowing for a perspective outside of
standardised texts and other typical teaching materials.
The extent to which local studies resources impact courses overall within universities
and colleges was also raised in the second questionnaire, summarised in the
following table:

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
While it is encouraging that 80% of responding libraries and LRCs report that courses
within the institution are supported, when asked for an estimate as to the
proportion of courses that rely, to some degree, on local studies resources, the
results are perhaps less inspiring. For example, of 41 respondents who offered an
approximate percentage or other quantitative indications,xxviii the most common
response is that five percent or fewer courses make use of local studies material,
such as the University College Northampton’s Rockingham Library. In approximately
12% of cases, such as the Library and Learning Centre at East Devon College, the
estimated proportion given was either one percent or less than this. Almost a
quarter of respondents, such as North Highland College and the St Edmund Hall
Library at the University of Oxford, offered an estimate that fell between six and ten
percent. North Nottinghamshire College put forward an estimate of 15%, while
three respondents suggested that 30% of courses employ local studies resources,
this proportion being the highest estimate provided. Some other respondents were
not as precise, but instead offered descriptions that indicated a low rate of support
for courses, such as Keele University’s ‘a very small percentage’, and Coleg Powys’
Newton Campus Learning Resource Centre’s response of ‘very little’.xxix

When considering the value of local studies materials in terms of how they are put to
use, a distinction between subject support and research may be difficult to ascertain.
Webb draws attention to a survey conducted by the Library and Information
Statistics Unit (LISU), referred to in the Follet report, ‘where many respondents had
difficulty in differentiating between library activity in support of teaching and
research.’ Regarding another study undertaken for the Follet Review Group, in
which monographic loans between 1981 and 1991 were analysed by the University
of Sussex, Webb states:

xxviii

Estimates were noted, then categorised by a percentage range.
Because those who were placed in the ‘unknown’ category had responded to the
question – that is, the field had not simply been left undefined – it was felt appropriate to
include these responses, despite the absence of either a figure or descriptive comment that
might indicate how much course-based use is being made of these collections. See, for
example, the University of Aberdeen’s comment that a percentage is ‘not possible to
determine.’
xxix

170

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
Results showed a very substantial degree of common use of book stock for
teaching and research. It is also possible that developments in teaching
methods have intensified the use of journals and monographs for teaching
purposes, further blurring such distinctions. This is particularly so in cases
where such material is used in projects and dissertations in final year
undergraduate or taught Masters courses.21p.138

In chapter seven, the growing popularity of independent ‘resource-based learning’ as
a teaching and learning method is addressed, a method that may well contribute to
the blurred distinction between teaching and research activity within the library. In
addition, while the present survey did not make a point of enquiring as to whether
or not the same local materials were used for course-based subject support and
research, it is possible, if not probable that, given the idiosyncratic nature of much
local studies material, some crossover may occur. In terms of gauging the types of
research activity undertaken by both students and staff, respondents were asked
which of four categories of research output in their universities or colleges –
undergraduate dissertations, postgraduate dissertations, higher theses, and
academic staff research – incorporated the use of local studies resources. Despite its
often limited reach, the contribution of such output to the reputation of local studies
in academia, as well as to the field itself, was recognised early; in J.L. Hobbs’ seminal
work, Local History and the Library, first published in 1962, the author points to the
significant contributions made to local studies under the aegis of academic
endeavour:

Public awareness of the importance of thesis literature has increased during
recent years: many important local studies submitted for degrees or teaching
diplomas are never published and have a very limited availability in university
and college libraries. Yet in these can be found some of the most valuable
original research work done upon the area ...’22p.66

While a significant proportion of potential respondents did not reply to the question
of which research activity was supported, the majority of non-responses were from
171

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
Further Education Colleges, a category which had largely not been expected to
respond to the query, given the categories offered and the nature of these
institutions. However, four institutions identifying as Further Education Colleges did
provide responses and these are included in the following summary drawn from 41
participants:

Taking into account that 24 universities responded to this question, the proportion
of these institutions in which local studies resources are employed in research is
perhaps significantly high. Undergraduate dissertations are represented by 87.50%
of universities, postgraduate dissertations by 83.33%; higher theses by 75.00%; and
academic staff research by 70.83%.

A Four-Set Construction Venn Diagram providing an at-a-glance representation of
the range of research types supported by separate institutions, underscores the
predominance of university activity when it comes to research:

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections

Figure 3: Types of Research

Of the 17 institutions whose local collections support all four research types, 14 of
these are universities; undergraduate dissertations alone are represented by two FE
colleges, three FHE colleges, one HE college, and two universities; the third most
common range cited – undergraduate and postgraduate dissertations – is found in
one HE college and three universities.

The findings indicate that universities offer more opportunity than other types of
institution to undertake research where at least some focus will rely on the use of
local studies material. This is perhaps inevitable, even at student-level, given the
emphasis placed on independent research at higher education level, where learners’
research projects not only can allow the individual to focus on topics that bring
together different disciplines, thus broadening the scope of potentially relevant

173

Chapter Six: The Purpose of Local Studies Collections
materials, but can also provide a degree of intellectual and creative ‘freedom’ that
may be absent – or necessarily restricted – when it comes to shorter, taught-course
assessments.

In terms of outputs produced through Academic Staff Research, a small number of
respondents supplied details – to varying degrees of specificity – regarding
publications in which local resources were employed. The respondent from Queen’s
University, Belfast, for instance, stated that ‘Almost any book written by one of our
academics on an Irish topic will have involved use of our material.’ A more specific
example was provided by the respondent from the Andrew Kean Learning Centre at
Trinity and All Saints (now Leeds Trinity University College),xxx who reported on
‘books and articles on the history of the Yorkshire Dales published by Christine
Hallas,’xxxi also noting that, since the former member of staff left the institution,
‘there is less specific interest in local history.’ Also included, by the respondent from
the Museum of English Rural Life (MERL), was University of Reading lecturer, Dr
Jeremy Burchardt for his work The Allotment Movement in England, 1793-1873,
published by Woodbridge in 2002. In addition to other academic works cited by
respondents, a more commercial publication was highlighted, where the participant
from the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge brought attention to
photographs from the library having been used in Simon Singh’s Big Bang, published
in 2004 through Fourth Estate.

independent study. This means it is also a context in which libraries and their
resources, including materials and staff, have become arguably more important than
ever in terms of serving the institution and its students, teachers and researchers.

While some discussion of findings has taken place, it is in the chapter that follows
that these results, and those found in chapter five, will be drawn together and
reflected on with the aim of providing an overall view that takes into account not
only the current status of local studies resources in academic libraries, but also the
future implications of the present situation. Conclusions will also be drawn and
recommendations made.

Chapter Seven
Key Findings and Further Considerations
7.1 Introduction
In the previous two chapters, findings were presented principally based on
responses drawn from two questionnaire surveys, with additional information and
commentary taken from interviews conducted during observational visits to a small
number of college and university libraries. In this chapter, key findings are
summarised within the context of the study’s aims and objectives, in order to
provide an at-a-glance overview. In addition, while some analysis of findings has
taken place in the previous chapters, further and related issues, themes, and
considerations that have emerged throughout the course of the research undertaken
are reflected upon and posited within a framework that seeks to explore both the
present and potential future, in terms of the relationships between local studies
collections, academic libraries, and teaching, learning and research.

Finally, at the end of this chapter, the study’s methodological, empirical and
theoretical contributions to knowledge are discussed; followed by the study’s
limitations, and recommendations for future investigation.

7.2 Aims and Objectives and Key Findings

As noted in Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches, the methodologies employed
to achieve the study’s objectives may not necessarily match each objective in turn;
instead, the methods and techniques used tend to reflect either the depth of
coverage or the angle from which a particular issue was approached.

Here, the aims and objectives of the study are re-stated, with key findings drawn
principally, but not exclusively from the questionnaires, providing an indication of
the extent to which each objective, serving the first two aims, has been met,
whether wholly or in part.

178

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations

Aim 1: To examine the content and scope of local studies collections within further
and higher education libraries in the United Kingdom.

Aim 2: To examine the purpose of local studies collections within these colleges
and universities.

Aim 3: To compile an inventory of local studies collections in academic libraries.
An inventory of local studies resources holdings was compiled using data from the
first questionnaire. See Appendix 5: Inventory of Local Collections at Responding
Institutions.

Objective 1: To identify and examine definitions of ‘local studies’ in order to
ascertain the different interpretations placed on this term, whether geographical,
historical or otherwise.

The largest single proportion of collections cover a county-wide geographical scope,
followed by region. Coverage of a particular town or city accounts for almost 10% of
collections. Ten local collections, distributed across all institution types, have a
country-wide focus; while four university collections’ geographic scope includes
more than one country. The most popular title for named collections is ‘Local
History’, followed by ‘Local Collection’ and ‘Local Studies’.

Further analysis in Chapter Five, drawn from interviews and other secondary
sources, build on the findings above that indicate quite a broad geographical
‘definition’ of the term ‘local’, examining issues such as shifting boundaries and the
idea of a ‘local identity’. In addition, the prevalence of local history collections, as
reflected in the findings above, is explored, indicating that this objective has been
met.

179

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
Objective 2: To investigate the acquisition, organisation and management of local
studies collections; this will include an examination of how information technology
has contributed to the collection and use of local studies material.

Over 60% of responding institutions hold local studies material in their libraries or
learning resource centres. The most commonly held types of local materials are
regional histories, followed by reference works, then government publications,
periodicals, then newspapers. The most popular format is hard-copy by a broad
margin, then internet-based media. Almost 80% of local studies acquisitions are
through donations or bequests, followed nearly 70% through library suppliers.

Just over a fifth of local collections were started in the 1970s, followed by the 1960s,
then 1980s. The most commonly cited single era in which collections were started in
Further Education Colleges is the 1970s; in the case of universities, it is the 19th
Century. The largest single proportions of collections of over 1000 items were
started in the 1960s, followed by the 19th Century. Universities tend to have the
largest collections, with over half of these institutions holding collections of over
1000 items. It was found that a slight majority of local collections are housed
separately from the library’s main collection (most local collections of over 1000
items are held separately from the main collection). This is followed by almost a
third whose local collections are integrated throughout the library stock, then those
whose local material is partly separate and integrated.

Over 60% of respondents use the Dewey Decimal Classification system to organise
local collections; the vast majority of these respondents do not use a second scheme.

Almost half of the respondents have all their library’s local studies items listed on
OPAC, with just less than a third having most items listed. Just over 50% of libraries
allow all potential users remote access to OPAC; a quarter permit internal access
only.

180

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
Only 11% of local collections are separately staffed. Approximately 12% of libraries
or LRCs provide induction for local studies librarianship, while approximately eight
percent provide training; only three libraries or LRCs provide both induction and
training.

Questionnaire findings have, for the most part, answered this objective. How
information technology has impacted the collection and use of local resources has
relied more on further secondary research conducted after the fieldwork stages,
due, in part, to rapid changes in technology taking place in a relatively short period
of time. Digitisation is discussed in 7.5 Materials.

Objective 3: To examine external influences on local studies collections, including
non-institutional users with a view to ascertaining the impact such access might
have on this service.

Physical access to two-thirds of local collections is available to all; a fifth may be
accessed by registered staff and students only. Although further on in this chapter,
external users are mentioned briefly in terms of requests for local material, overall,
this population does not appear to have too great an impact on the academic
library’s local studies service.

Other external influences appear mostly to concern other libraries or local studies
providers. For instance, a common reason given for not holding a local collection is
the perception that the public library’s local studies provision is adequate. This issue
of the public library’s role as the ‘natural’ home of local studies is examined and
discussed throughout the thesis, with the issue of duplication and its potential
impact also discussed further on in this chapter.

Since no further external influences were identified, this objective has been met.

181

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
Objective 4: To identify other influences that might mould priorities: financial
constraints, for instance, or a perceived obligation to improve access to material on
neighbouring regions or communities.

In terms of other influences that may shape priorities, it was found that the vast
majority of local collections – over 85% – do not have a separate budget. Financial
constraints and other concerns, including issues regarding space, and time with
which to organise material, are examined later in this chapter. No obligation to
improve access to local material elsewhere was identified, thus indicating that this
objective has been met.

Objective 5: To analyse the relationship between academic institutions’ local
studies collections, their curricula and research activity.

The most common subject sections where integrated local collections are found is
just over 60% in History, over a third in Geography, and over a fifth in Archaeology.
The next most common subject sections are Geology, Art, and Local Government,
each integrated with almost 15% of collections. The most popular courses supported
by the local collection are History-based, with almost half of all respondents citing
this subject-area. This is followed by Local Studies, cited by just over a fifth of
respondents; English-based subjects cited by approximately 15% of respondents;
followed by Business/Management courses by approximately 13%.

The most frequently cited percentage of courses to be supported by local studies
resources, estimated by over a quarter of 41 respondents, is between two and five
percent. The second most common percentage range, estimated by just under a
quarter of these respondents, is between six and ten percent.

Approximately 90% of 41 respondents claim that undergraduate dissertation
research is supported by the library or LRC’s local studies collection. Sixty-three
percent state that postgraduate dissertation research is supported, while Higher
theses and academic staff research are each supported by approximately 61% of
182

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
respondents. Of the 17 respondents whose collections support all four types of
research, 14 of these are universities.
Of those libraries and LRCs who do not hold local collections, one of the most
commonly cited reasons is that the material is irrelevant to what is being taught or
researched in the institution.
The findings above provide a concise overview of the extent to which local
collections are being used in the service of taught subjects and research activity. In
addition to the discussion in Chapter Six throughout the presentation of these
findings, teaching, learning and research within the context of academic libraries and
local studies resources is explored at some length later in this chapter, thereby
meeting this objective.
Objective 6: To examine the roles of the collections within the institutions.
Here, the objective is met not through findings as such. While there is some overlap
with the preceding objective, the main concern here is, given the figures above
indicating the low extent to which local studies collections are used to support
courses, whether local collections belong in academic libraries if they are not being
used, or if there is any other value in holding a local collection within an academic
environment. In the section that follows, considering is given to the roles – potential
or otherwise – of local collections outwith engagement with the curriculum and
academic research. With frequent reference to open-ended question responses
gathered from the questionnaires, consideration is given to possible reasons for
collections not being utilised, future plans for collections, currency of the material,
and other issues.

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations

7.3 Collections and Collecting for Use
Earlier, in chapter four, the common metaphor of the academic library as the ‘heart
of the university’xxxii was alluded to. This much-used phrase – which, as Brophy
notes, ‘was picked up in the UK and appeared in various reports, including the
influential Parry Report in 1967’ – suggests a number of (often overlapping) issues in
terms of the library’s relationship with the institution. With regard to the purpose
behind the academic library, the following might be suggested: that the library is
essential to the university; that it is, in fact, central to the university’s ability to
operate; and that its sole – or at the very least primary – function is to serve the
larger institution.
This last-mentioned factor is particularly relevant to the question of purpose – that
is, in the context of this thesis, the ways in which local collections are used, or,
implicitly, whether they are used at all. For those who advocate that collections
serve an immediate function, for instance, having access to a collection that
‘matches’ the curriculum is of principal importance. As Webb notes, ‘In order to
support student learning, the collection should reflect back to students the range of
learning outcomes which have been specified in the courses they study. Thus
material on reading lists should be available, as should a suitable range of resources
to support research for assignments.’1p.136 In this instance, the ‘heart’ metaphor
might, then, be utilised further. The organ in question, after all, is an active
contributor to the body’s ability to function; it is not simply ‘just there’, waiting to be
used if or when required. If, therefore, a collection is not being used, can the library
be said to be carrying out its role effectively? Payne takes a strong view when it
comes to the library’s role in the university, declaring that the ‘only rationale’ for its
existence is in serving the user. Employing the collection-for-potential-use library as
a counter to the actual user-focused one, he writes: ‘Yes, there are a few prestige
University libraries who have a role in preserving the nation’s heritage. However, for
xxxii

Noting that ‘the exact origins of this phrase are unclear’, Brophy cites Grimes’ suggestion
that it was initially used by Charles William Eliot during his time as President of Harvard
University, a post he held from 1869 to 1909. (Brophy, Peter. The library in the twenty-first
century. second ed. London: Facet., 2007, p.28.)

184

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
the vast majority of libraries, the primary concern is with the need of our existing
clientele rather than meeting the needs of future generations of scholars. 2p.59
However, the fact that libraries seemingly more intent on collecting for future use
exist in the first place may be where the cracks in the library-as-bodily-organ
metaphor appear, where a given collection’s contribution to the institution may not
always be as immediate as the ‘heart’ analogy suggests. In fact, it may well be
argued that this is especially true of local collections, given the often unique manner
in which items are collected and managed, and where a significant degree of
forethought, luck – or even, as in the example detailed below of the University of
Leicester, building on an unexpected opportunity – might be required in order that
the collection ultimately not be considered improvident. For instance, Duckett
observed in 1997:

It is currently fashionable to say that collections are for use [...] and so they
are – up to a point. There is a case to be made, however, and local studies
librarians will be to the fore in making it, that collections are for future use
and not just for the present. As today’s patrons use material collected a
decade or a century ago, so will tomorrow’s users bless or curse us for what
we have, or have not, collected today. Besides, a collection has to be
collected before it can be used, and there is many a collection now used
which survived by chance – not collected with future intent. But in the end, a
collection has to be used to justify its existence.3p173

Here, Duckett presents something of a paradox, where the purpose of a collection
may not always be immediately obvious and it could be suggested that, depending
on the point one wishes to pursue, the passage can be viewed as both a defence of
the philosophy of ‘collecting for the sake of collecting’, while at the same time
underlining the ideology of ‘collecting as a means to an end’. The ambiguity that
such a paradox can give rise to is evident in responses to the survey. For instance,
when asked about future plans for their local collection, the questionnaire
respondent from the Rockingham Library at University College, Northampton
explained that ‘We intend to house the Fowler Collection (a collection of secondary
185

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
texts collected by the Bedfordshire Records Society) with our existing collection. At
that point we will publicise the collections and aim to build on them.’ Yet, according
to the respondent when asked about which courses are served by the collection, the
local collection as it stands supports only two, a History BA and undergraduate QTS
(Qualified Teacher Status) Education, amounting to less than five percent of the
institution’s total courses, suggesting that the acquisition of the Fowler Collection –
and the plans to build on this attainment – may not be in response to immediate
needs, but rather, the expansion described may result in a collection intended for
future use.

Bridget Andrews, Library Project Manager of the Museum of English Rural Life
(MERL), a museum of the University of Reading, also highlighted this often blurred
line between collections that are used and the not-always-evident purpose behind
the collection itself. She talks about how the museum’s collection is principally
concerned with ‘the nature of the material that we collect and also about retention,’
while also looking at the different ways the material itself might be approached by
researchers. ‘Currency’, for instance, is a term used frequently in research and for
good reason. However, when examining a subject like ‘local studies’ the question of
what does and does not constitute a robust approach towards resources can
produce necessarily blurred responses. The pursuit of local studies frequently relies
on the investigation of material that may, in many cases, be considered ‘out-of-date’;
to use the relatively simple example of investigating an individual’s house, the
researcher may be compelled to view architectural plans from decades previous;
ownership documents that have been passed on through generations; local
government documents from an earlier period regarding land purchases and so on.
While, of course, the material mentioned here refers to primary documentation,
there is also a need to recognise that published material may also be collected that
serves a dual secondary and primary role. As Andrews explained:

The university library is a research-level collection in certain subject areas
which are specialities of this university. MERL is a research-level collection
full-stop. We don’t throw material away because it’s out-of-date, because
186

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
it’s the nature of history [...] that a secondary source can become a primary
source. If you’re, for example, studying the history of agriculture then an
agricultural textbook from the 1930s can become a primary source. And so
we have a very different attitude to the collections; they’re not supposed to
be current, if you like.’4

Figure 4: A selection of secondary/primary local studies material at the Museum of English
Rural Life (MERL), University of Reading

The ‘fashionable’ argument that collections are meant to be used may, however, also
give rise to another approach, one where what is being taught or learned is bent to
the will of the collection – that is, where students are actively encouraged to study
material based on its availability. For instance, while Webb’s discussion of reading
lists is addressed more fully below, it is worth mentioning at this time her
acknowledgment that ‘Teaching staff compile reading lists either based on what is
already available in the library or based on what is relevant to the course they are
teaching.’ She also states, however, that ‘It is more common for teaching staff to
create reading lists based on academic criteria’ (noting too that this may result in the

187

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
fact that ‘not all items on the list are in stock, nor all in print’).5p.153 Yet the
compilation of reading lists ‘based on what is already available in the library’ – say,
an older edition of a standard text, or one textbook that is relatively interchangeable
with another, unavailable, work – is a far cry from the building or acquisition of a
collection that then has to find a home within the curriculum. Of course, while the
potential for collected material to actively dictate teaching or learning is not
restricted to local studies collections, Duckett’s point above suggests that local
collections may be particularly vulnerable to such an approach. Asked in 2006
whether or not this attitude is a valid way to approach academic local collections,
Michael Dewe was wary:
I think it’s one that can be questioned, because one could argue – in the
same way that you provide any collection – that it should reflect the needs of
the users, and you shouldn’t be spending money and time and effort on
building up things which are not related to the aims and objectives of the
institution for which the collection is being built up.6
However, Dewe also acknowledged that collections in academic institutions that do
not have a pre-planned purpose are not necessarily wasted or wasteful, noting that,
‘universities do attract these other collections for one reason or another … and they
can become the focus for research and teaching; [but] it’s accidental rather than
planned.’
Perhaps surprisingly, this ‘accidental’ approach lies at the root of arguably the most
prominent – and certainly oldest – example of an academic institution that clearly
does make use of its local studies collections. As Professor Harold Fox of the
Department of English Local History at the University of Leicester explained, when
outlining the background of the department:
A man called Hattonxxxiii gave a vast amount of local history books to the
library when the university was very young. And when [W.G.] Hoskins came
xxxiii

Thomas Hatton (1876–1943), ‘the owner of a boot-manufacturing business and a boxing
and crossword promoter, donated his collection of 2000 topographical works to the
University College (the predecessor to the University of Leicester) in 1920, establishing the

188

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
here, it was the existence of that [...] that got him interested. And when he
founded the Department of English Local History in 1948, it was to match the
collection. It wasn’t the other way around; the collection was already
there. He thought, “Well, we’ve got a collection, let’s have a
department to match it.”7

While the origin of the Department of Local English History provides an excellent
example of how local collections already acquired have been put to use, it may be
fair to assume that, while not necessarily the ‘exception that proves the rule’, the
Department has, indeed, proved exceptional and it is unlikely that every ‘accidental’
collection is going to result in an endeavour as successful and groundbreaking as that
of the University of Leicester, something very unlikely to be replicated in the
universities of today. Even success at a smaller level may prove problematic. For
instance, Dewe’s acknowledgement that sometimes accidents do produce
favourable outcomes comes with a qualifier that encompasses both pragmatic and
ideological concerns, when he suggests that:

What one has to argue is that, in the future, can universities – some can, of
course – can most universities continue to operate in that way; that is,
acquiring things, as it were, accidentally and then suddenly finding they can
fit a course or some research activity to them? You know, is that the
best way of organising both a university library collection and, indeed,
creating appropriate teaching and research?

When asked what the most positive way of looking at this approach to using
collections might be, Dewe elaborated on the ‘practical’ versus ‘ideal’ dichotomy,
one in which ‘management’ encompasses not only concerns about costs and
maintenance, but concerns about use: ‘Of course, yes – if it’s [the collection’s] there,
why not make use of it? But, whether you can justify it, in terms of what it costs to
Library's Special Collections.’ Fyfe, Christine. Royal visit delight at University. News, [Internet]

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
maintain and of the use that it gets, is another question … I’m speaking managerially,
of course – I’m not speaking as a librarian or a researcher.’ In fact, while Duckett’s
suggestion above is made in reference to public library collections, it is strongly
arguable that, within the context of academic libraries, where, as mentioned, the
library’s principal purpose is to serve the larger institution, the case for ‘justifying a
collection’s existence’ in terms of the collection being used becomes even more
important.

In chapter five, the issue of whether or not university and college libraries should
seek to build local studies collections that do not serve an immediate, identifiable
purpose was touched on. While the earlier discussion was raised within the context
of libraries and LRCs that do not hold local collections (or, at least, do not identify as
holders of such material), 13 respondents whose libraries do hold local collections
stated that the material held is not used to support any courses, with five also
reporting no supported research activity. A few respondents suggested that local
material is occasionally put to use. At Westminster Kingsway College, for example,
the respondent noted that, at present, no courses are supported, ‘although some
requests for information are course-generated.’ At the Royal College of Physicians
and Surgeons of Glasgow, meanwhile, the collection ‘supports study by outside
individuals, no organised courses [are supported],’ with all four types of research
indicated. Other responses pointed to very casual use. Middlesbrough College, for
instance, explained that the collection is ‘just for general use and [for] anyone who
may have to ‘dip’ in for any research projects,’ although no formal research activity
was noted in the questionnaire; while Weymouth College stated that ‘Most requests
[are] from external users.’ Given the varying proportions of course-use indicated by
those whose collections do support set programmes of study – as noted above, over
a quarter of collections support less than five percent of the institution’s courses – as
well as the large number of respondents who did not reply to the question regarding
support for research, the matter of how much use is being made of local collections
in academic libraries, and to what level this may be a concern, is raised.

190

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
Yet, the somewhat difficult position – or at least grey area – in which local studies
resides when it comes to the justification for holding material is highlighted in, for
instance, the responses received from Coleg Sir Gar’s Learning Centre Ammanford
Campus. According to the respondent, the local collection, comprising
approximately 500 hard-copy items, including regional histories, reference works
and government publications, none of which, as noted in chapter six, have been
‘accessioned or indexed’ has ‘a relevance to the local community, but not directly to
any courses the college offers.’ Nor is any formal research activity noted. This, of
course, begs the question of why the college has such a collection in the first place.
The possible ‘reasons’ – if not a fully-fledged justification – become clearer when it is
noted that the campus ‘is housed in what was once a college of mining … [which
was] a very important industry in the locality’ and that the ‘material was rescued
from the threat of disposal.’ While the way in which the collection emerged may
suggest that the current attitude towards the items is somewhat akin to ‘retaining
material for sentimental reasons’, such a description does not seem adequate. It is
difficult to imagine, for instance, that someone at some point in time will not find a
500-item collection on mining, indexed or otherwise, useful. As it is, the learning
centre has ‘never had/made the time to catalogue the material and publicise its
presence with potential users‘ and so ‘perhaps once a year someone asks to look at
the material – usually someone local who remembers the past function of the
building and comes [to the learning centre] in hope that we have material related to
mining.’ While one external visitor a year is hardly the most compelling justification
for keeping a collection in the library, it is possible to see the collection manager’s
dilemma, where time and/or budget constraints or, indeed, where publicising local
collections falls low on the priority list of the library or learning centre, prevents the
material from being used in any significant way and thus the ‘value’ of the material
can be difficult to ascertain. However, it is worth bearing in mind that when it comes
to local collections that are essentially ‘useless’ in terms of serving the best interests
of the institutions – ideologically, financially or otherwise – the scenario that arises
is not necessarily a dire, dichotomous one where the only choices are to dispose of
material that may at some point be of potential use to the local community or
continue to house a stagnant collection. When asked about future plans, if any, for
191

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
the collection, the response from Coleg Sir Gar was fairly pragmatic, and reflected
those responses noted in the previous chapter that referred to storage and
preservation issues: ‘In an ideal world [the plan would be] to catalogue and produce
publicity material; realistically perhaps it will be handed to a specialist collection.’

The situation described at Coleg Sir Gar, as well as the wider issue regarding whether
or not academic collections are for (immediate) use, once again highlights the grey
area where local studies and its resources can often be found when one considers
the question of who the current or future users of these collections may be. The
external enquirers referred to by the respondents from the Ammanford Campus and
Weymouth College are, after all, a reminder that, while the academic library and its
resources may exist primarily to serve the institution – regardless of whether the
materials are being used at that precise time or not – the actual readership of any
given college or university library usually includes external users who, even if they
are not the principal intended client, are a presence. Brophy, for instance, notes
that, while ‘few academic libraries have a large body of external readers […] this
group can be important. Those academic libraries with major collections can find
themselves under considerable pressure from this direction…’8pp.67-68 External use is,
of course, not limited to local studies material; nor is internal use necessarily limited
to that which directly seeks to meet the institution’s teaching or research aims.
According to Keele University’s Special Collections and Archives Assistant, Helen
Burton, a couple of lecturers who work on the Victoria County History editorial team
are ‘often in [Special Collections and Archives], researching that. They’ll use the
town court rolls and Sneydxxxiv manuscripts as primary source information for the
VCHs; and they do Staffordshire studies as well.’9

With regard to a potentially broader user base than students, teaching staff and
academic researchers, however, issues can arguably be said to be compounded by
the nature of local resources, given not only the often unique flavour of the items
held in any given collection, but also the public library’s remit regarding local
material and the arguments against the academic library operating in competition
with the public sector. The ‘traditional’ link to the public library is an aspect of local
studies that has been raised more than once in the thesis. However, it might be
suggested that taking such a relationship almost for granted means that what might
prove ‘best’ for a given collection risks being overlooked simply because the ‘local
studies = public library’ model is so prevalent. In the case of St Andrews University
Special Collections, for instance, the department finds itself in something of a unique
position in that, according to the Head of Special Collections, Dr Norman Reid, the
department is more involved in the field of local studies – ‘in the immediate St
Andrews area certainly’ – than is the public library, with the university holding

193

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
‘curatorial responsibilities’ for archival material relating to the town.10 As Dr Reid
explains, until relatively recently there was no Fife Council archival provision at all,
which is why the National Archives deposited the likes of church and borough
records with the Special Collections Department, with the stipulation that, because
the documents are public records, they should be made available to any member of
the public who wishes to see them. In contrast to the respondents cited in the
previous chapter who had, or who planned to, deposit material elsewhere due to
preservation and/or storage issues, the Special Collections Department found itself
the recipient of material that would normally be held in the public sector. As Reid
explains it, while the public library in St Andrews has always held local material – the
core collection being the David Hay Fleming Collection that gave the section the
name ‘The Hay Fleming Reference Library’ – it was decided some years ago to
deposit the collection, which included manuscripts and photographs as well as
printed books, with the university’s Special Collections Department, due to the
university being in a better position to ‘provide the sort of curatorial care and control
needed’. As far as the public library is concerned, it was a ‘difficult’ collection ‘to
look after properly’ and the Special Collections Department had more appropriate
facilities to store and maintain the material. In addition, given the shortage of space
at the public library, moving the collection to the university enabled the public
service to expand the more general library provision, thus benefiting both the public
and university libraries, since the latter was able to add to ‘the other manuscripts
and local studies collections we already had.’ In other words, St Andrews provides
an example of a university collection that serves a much broader community than
that of the members of the institution and a handful of external users. It is,
arguably, a collection that might well be described in the same terms as Dewe used
to characterise the public library collection in chapter five: a collection built in
perpetuity that may well be used in a hundred years time. Yet, as mentioned, the
Special Collections department is in a fairly unique position, and this distinctiveness
arguably extends to the geographical and cultural context in which the institution
itself exists. That is, it may not be unreasonable to make the claim that St Andrews
University is St Andrews, a town known chiefly for two things: golf and the oldest
university in Scotland, established 600 years ago. Indeed, Reid himself notes that St
194

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
Andrews, and the central role that the university has in the town in terms of its
history and identity means that ‘the [university] library has always been a public
resource to some extent.’ It is within this context that the university library and
Special Collections department has ‘taken over’ the role normally inhabited by the
public sector in serving the community, and clearly, not every university or college is
in such a position.

The issue of whether or not college and university libraries can – or should – seek to
build collections rather than simply operate on an ‘as needed’ basis, then, is as
complex as any aspect of local studies resources. While St Andrews may be a
somewhat exceptional case, evidently as invested in serving the wider community as
it is the university itself, the arrangement is one that clearly works for the Special
Collections Department, the public library and the communities that both
organisations serve. Similarly, most responding libraries and LRCs appear to take a
somewhat pragmatic approach to collections and collection-building, albeit with a
sense that perhaps not all collections are being allowed to achieve their potential.
Indeed, earlier, in chapter five, the notion was raised that local studies resources in
academia may rely on the active enthusiasm of a librarian or collection manager in
order to be fully effective. Although respondents were not asked directly about how
personally invested they are in local studies provision, one way of gauging levels of
engagement may be by looking at responses regarding future plans for local
material. While some libraries’ plans arguably fall under quite a basic remit –
Thurrock and Basildon College’s plans are simply ‘to maintain the print-based
collection’ – a small number of libraries and LRCs point to a fairly active interest,
where responses indicate a number of specific ways in which the collection is being
developed. At the Southampton Institute, for instance, a concern for both the
currency and the scope of the collection is suggested in order to provide a more
robust collection of local studies material; according to the respondent, the
collection ‘is currently being reclassified which should be finished soon. The
collection also needs to be weeded. I am looking to update the collection and
strengthen material for the local areas that are not covered so extensively.’
Elsewhere, concern that the needs of the institution are being met is expressed. At
195

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
Truro College, for instance, the library ‘will continue to provide [local] material
relevant to courses and [the collection] will adapt, evolve and grow according to the
needs of the staff and students,’ while at the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff,
the respondent notes that, since ‘Our collections are targeted towards our
programme of courses, and thus whilst local studies materials remain pertinent to
courses, we will continue to maintain and acquire [materials to add to] it.’ Not all
course-related plans reported are about the collection’s potential growth, however.
According to the respondent from Bell College’s Dumfries Campus, the end of a
community studies project undertaken by Pre-registration Nursing students means
that ‘the collection is not maintained with the rigour that is once was and the
contents of the boxes created to support the Community Studies project will
probably be discarded or transferred to the Statistics and Reports section as
appropriate.’ Meanwhile, at Coleg Powys’ Newton Campus Learning Resources
Centre, where the percentage of courses supported by the local collection is
described as ‘very little’ (Travel and Tourism is the only course named), the
respondent indicates a low degree of usage by stating that future plans amount to
‘None until I get a request.’ This response may be fairly straightforward, and the
small amount of use is understandable given the fractional quantity of courserelated support required; nonetheless, there is perhaps something almost circular in
the reasoning presented, where a request from a (potential) user is required before
plans can be made that may help to increase the profile of a collection comprising
between 50 and 100 items. Furthermore, this is not the only example where the
reasoning is arguably somewhat skewed. At Wirral Metropolitan College, for
example, ‘Constraints on space mean that the entire library collection must be ‘live’:
we have little space to develop and increase stock which accounts for less than
0.01% of library usage.’ While, on the surface, what might seem like two perfectly
reasonable justifications for a lack of development can be extracted from this
response – a shortage of space and that the miniscule usage does not validate
expansion – the juxtaposition of these two issues implies something more than
simply an adherence to set programmes of study (in this case, a diploma in Local
History is the only supported course cited) or a lack of room. Contrasted, for
instance, with Trinity and All Saints College’s clear cause-and-effect explanation that
196

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
‘The collection has been low priority for a number of years because it is less relevant
to our current range of courses,’ the response from Wirral College comes across as
somewhat ambiguous, where the circular reasoning employed – expansion is not
possible, but the collection does not get used very often, so expansion would
probably be unwanted anyway – cannot help but suggest that local studies resources
may not be a priority at least partly because they are not being prioritised.

Some respondents’ future plans also include the intent to publicise materials. In
chapter six, a low rate of affirmative responses was reported with regard to the
question of whether the library uses promotional material to draw attention to its
local collection; information supplied from respondents, however, suggested that
even when some form of promotion is employed, it is often restricted to in-house
‘advertising’, such as leaflets or posters in the library itself, although a few
respondents do make mention of some coverage on the library’s website.
Promotion, however, forms a significant part of Cambridge University Library’s
future plans for its local collection, where the respondent plans to ‘Enhance web
pages with digital images of items in the collection; look at cataloguing material with
no online catalogue records; include items from the collection in exhibitions.’ While
the very act of promoting material carries with it the assumption that more potential
users may be drawn to the collection, perhaps oddly, the University of Durham, as
well as outlining other projects, is one of the only responding libraries to explicitly
mention an intention to improve the amount of use the collection receives:

Promote it for more general local use as well as increased academic use.
There has been a retrocon project in the past 2 years to provide full records
for all the early printed books, to upgrade the modern book records and to
simplify the classification of periodicals. Aim to complete this. Early printed
books and maps on ‘Pictures in Print’ web database. Complete cataloguing of
printed maps.

Yet, an enthusiasm for the material and a willingness to develop and/or promote the
collection can go only so far when other considerations, sometimes outside of the
197

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
collection manager’s control, come into play. As reported in chapter six, responses
to the question of how budgets for local collections are organised suggest that
funding for local materials is not a priority for many libraries. When it comes to
making plans for the collection, funding is a concern for a number of respondents.
According to the respondent from the University of Wales, Bangor, ambitious plans
for an expansion of facilities rely mostly on an uncertain financial ability to do so: ‘If
and when funding is provided, [we plan to build] an extension or new [building] that
can better house all the Special Collections and Archives, as well as provide a better
conservation workshop, reading room and exhibition area.’ Dudley College of
Technology, too, has plans that rely on having the financial means to do so, reporting
that ‘Having collated all materials in one area over past couple of months the hope is
to develop the collection but [this] depends on budget allowing.’ Similarly, money is
at the root of future plans by Southport College, who intend to ‘Submit a bid to
Lottery or similar for funding to expand collection and marketing.’ In the case of the
response received from the University of Lincoln, budget constraints are viewed as
an issue that can be weighed alongside the user’s ability to access materials
elsewhere and a collaborative attitude towards other collections, where future plans
are composed of ‘Expansion if funds ever permit. But there are other good
resources close by – would want to complement these.’

While the examples provided above may not definitively measure attitudes held by
respondents to their local collections, they do offer at least an indication of varying
degrees of active enthusiasm for organising, developing and promoting the library’s
local studies resources. Together with the findings based on supported subjects and
research presented in the previous chapter, it does appear that, overall, these
collections exist primarily to serve the institution’s needs at present. There are, of
course, exceptions: some collections may no longer be used in the capacity as they
once were, as in the case of Bell College; others, such as Coleg Sir Gar, find
themselves in possession of material that does not have a purpose within the
institution while conversely, St Andrews finds itself in possession of material that has
a purpose both within and, to a relatively unusually high degree, without the
institution. There is, however, little evidence that managers are wilfully amassing
198

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
huge collections in the hope that, perhaps in the future, the material might be
employed. For example, of those whose collections number over a thousand items,
only one – Newcastle College, discussed further below in this chapter – indicated
that neither courses nor research activity are supported. It is within a context where
local collections are, for the most part, intended for use, that these resources and
their contribution to the aims of the institution can be examined more closely.

7.4 Teaching, Learning and Research

Baker proposes that ‘Universities and other institutions of higher education have two
basic functions: to teach and to research.’11p.4 While Baker’s statement, at first
glance, is difficult to argue with – indeed, it very neatly captures a common
understanding of what ‘goes on’ within the walls of higher education institutions – it
is also perhaps somewhat narrow in scope, omitting what might be considered a
third function: that which relates to learning. It is perhaps not surprising that this
role is not rendered explicitly under Baker’s ‘basic’ remit, since learning is commonly
regarded as a necessary counterpart to, or result of, teaching. When addressing the
subject of library resources especially, however, the teaching/learning model
arguably becomes more complex. Library resources, for instance, do not simply exist
for the benefit of teachers or researchers. Although it may be suggested that any
study of a book or other material within an academic setting is done in the pursuit of
‘research’, since Baker refers specifically to ‘institutions of higher education’, it might
be assumed that he is referring to what is commonly perceived as ‘academic
research’, i.e., research undertaken for the likes of dissertations, theses or for
publication. However, the different ways in which students are encouraged to learn,
means that the ‘basic functions’ of higher, or even further, education cannot
necessarily be limited to teaching and research and, with particular regard to the
former, directly related activities. Learning, for instance, cannot be rigidly defined as
what goes on in the classroom while students are actively being ‘taught’ – the reason
why student access to academic libraries exists in the first place is to enable learning
to continue outside of the immediate teaching environment.

199

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
An emphasis on ‘learning’ is underlined by Laurillard, who looks at what ‘the aim of
teaching is,’ pointing to different beliefs in methods of teaching and what these
approaches require of the student. She comments on ‘what used to be the
prevailing view of university teaching’, suggesting that ‘If you believe that teaching is
about imparting knowledge, then the main requirement of the lecturer is that they
should possess that knowledge in the first place.’12p.13 She goes on to add that:

Of course, ‘imparting knowledge’ does not succeed as a teaching aim, as
many essays and examination papers testify. Academics have always been
well aware of this, but while higher education was an elitist enterprise it was
possible to make this failure the responsibility of the student, reified in the
‘fail’ grade.

That ‘imparting knowledge’ is not the aim of teaching should surprise no one who
has any interest in academic libraries; if it were the primary purpose, then, as
suggested above, the academic library’s user-base would be very limited. Laurillard,
instead, quotes Ramsden’s view that ‘The aim of teaching is simple: it is to make
student learning possible.’ However, Laurillard also notes that there may be
something of a gulf between the theory of this approach and the practice since,
‘Making student learning possible places much more responsibility with the teacher.
It implies that the teacher must know something about learning, and about what
makes it possible.’ Yet, it does appear that teachers in academia are more than
aware that learning is not merely an outcome based on passing down hard
knowledge:

Academics have ambitious definitions for student learning. When asked to
define the nature of learning in their subject area they produce descriptions
of high-level thinking, such as “critically assessing the arguments”, “compiling
patterns to integrate their knowledge” [...] Course descriptions and syllabuses
inevitably tend to focus on the subject content that students will be learning,
but clearly, in reflecting on what it is really about, academics are fascinated
by the process itself […] They see learning not simply as a product, but as a
200

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
series of activities. How students approach their subject is as important to
them as what they end up knowing13pp.14-15

It is perhaps in ‘how students approach their subject’ that it can be found that the
responsibility to bridge the gulf between the theory and practice of making learning
possible does not rest solely on the shoulders of teachers. As suggested, once the
model of ‘teaching = imparting knowledge’ is dismantled, the academic library’s role
becomes of primary importance to the students’ ability to learn.

Of course, the relationship between what goes on in the classroom and what
happens in an institution’s library can take different forms. Webb, for example,
looks at reading lists which, she states, ‘form the critical connection between
teaching and learning strategies and the library. Students will invariably use mainly
or exclusively material named on the reading list which the lecturer has supplied
unless there is an assignment which requires additional independent study and
research [researcher’s emphasis].’14p.153 The point about ‘independent study and
research’ is stressed further when Webb notes that, while the fact that in ‘many
academic libraries, especially in newer universities, most stock is purchased to
support taught course requirements’ theoretically means that ‘all stock acquired will
be used’, this approach in practice is ‘mechanistic and reactive’, since students tend
to utilise a broader range of resources than those included on reading lists,
particularly if the named item is on loan to another borrower or the assessment
requires the student to undertake independent study.15p. An emphasis on this mode
of study is underlined further as Brophy too draws attention to the way in which
learning has increasingly become an activity that occurs outside of the classroom,
pointing out that the ‘expansion of universities has been one of the driving forces
behind changes in teaching and learning methods in higher education.’ Although he
cites the ‘notable’ way in which the emphasis continues to be strong on lectures
delivered by staff – albeit with students encouraged more to contribute during these
sessions – he also notes that there has been a growth in, for instance, group work as
a teaching method and ‘importantly for libraries, much greater emphasis on
independent study.’16p.15 Indeed, Brophy also notes that the role of the library itself
201

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
has altered, where the expectations of what its staff are required to do is, again,
rendered more complex:

Because staff-student ratios have worsened, staff tend to be much less
accessible to students than in the past and so students can be thrown more
on their own devices. As a result, library staff can find that independent
learning places greater strains on them as advisers and tutors – a role they
are not always well prepared for or even well qualified to carry out.17p.15

Within the present context of local studies, certainly, as the results in the previous
chapter show, training for library staff in this area is not common, no doubt
contributing to the lack of preparation and qualification cited above. While taking up
a role usually occupied by teaching staff may be an ‘unfair’ expectation placed on
library staff, there are nonetheless undoubted similarities between the roles held by
those who work chiefly in the classroom or lecture hall and those whose contribution
to teaching, learning and research is carried out in the library. For instance, as was
pointed out in the previous chapter, the ability for library staff to provide
information to prospective learners tends to fall into two broad categories –
categories that echo the different teaching methods cited above of ‘imparting
knowledge’ versus ‘making learning possible.’ This overlap between teaching and
librarianship is, as suggested by Brophy above, exacerbated by the nature of
‘independent learning,’ where the increased expectation on library staff reveals the
term itself to be something of a misnomer; the student may be acquiring skills and
knowledge outside of the classroom, but the reliance on library resources and
guidance from library staff means that the act of accumulating knowledge is more
collaborative than the term ‘independent learning’ suggests.

Although questionnaire respondents were not asked about ‘teaching’ students or the
library’s relationship with teaching departments or lecturers, when asked about
interactions with students visiting the library in order to use local material, Keele
University’s Special Collections and Archives Assistant, Helen Burton, provided an
example of a large number of geography students arriving, unannounced, looking for
202

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
European documentation. Burton explained to the students’ lecturer that it might
have been advisable to bring the students to the Department in smaller groups,
where she would have been able to introduce them to the material, point out key
items, and familiarise them with the archives. However, apparently in most cases,
students usually have a ‘fair idea’ of what kind of material they are looking for and
Burton is able to provide appropriate assistance. In fact, during the candidate’s
conversation with Burton, one second-year student studying French and History was
observed undertaking research for a portion of the course focusing on the Doomsday
Book within the geographical context of Staffordshire. An assigned topic, the
student had made the Special Collections department her first port-of-call, using ‘the
catalogue downstairs to see where everything was [then being] able to come straight
in here, straight to what I wanted to see.’18 Yet, in general, according to Burton,
there is ‘not a great deal of contact’ between the Special Collections and Archives
and the teaching departments that might make use of the items held, although there
are a ‘few regular faces’ who are known to the department. One particular lecturer,
for example, takes groups of students into Special Collections and Archives
occasionally in order to introduce them to key items that might be of use for carrying
out coursework; while, later, the students may come to the department
independent of the lecturer in order to undertake more in-depth research.
Thus, even putting aside the pressures cited by Brophy that are faced by library staff
due to diminishing staff-student ratios, it is clear that libraries within academic
institutions serve a purpose far beyond simply supplying books or other materials to
teachers and researchers. Brophy looks at ‘resource-based learning’ a method that
he admits ‘means different things to different people’ but ‘at its heart lies the idea
that much learning can take place through direct contact between learners and
resources, such as documentary material.’ Interestingly, however, its popularity
does appear somewhat skewed:

There has been considerable use of this approach in further education,
especially through the development of open learning materials, but take-up
of the idea in higher education has been much more limited. The eLib-

203

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
funded IMPEL projectxxxv … found that in only just over 10% of institutions
was resource-based learning used in all faculties or departments, while over
40% reported that it was not used at all.19p.16

In keeping with Brophy’s observation that resource-based learning is an approach
more readily adopted in further education the majority of respondents who
identified their places of study as Learning Resource Centres, or variations thereof,
were indeed Further Education Colleges. For example, as mentioned in chapter five,
37 out of 72 Further Education respondents used the name Learning Resource
Centre, Learner Resource Centre or Learning Centre alone; while a further 13
incorporated LRC or LC into its name. In contrast, only six out of 76 respondents
from universities used LRC or LC solely as a name, while a further two used these
terms as part of a larger title. While the use of ‘Library’, ‘Learning Resource Centre’
or ‘Learning Centre’ may not necessarily impact the main focus of this study to a
significant degree, the choice of name is perhaps worth considering as an indication
of the difference in focus – at the very least on a surface level – that institutions
themselves wish to get across. The differences between the terms ‘library’ and
‘learning resource centre’ may well be negligible when it comes to practice. Both
terms, for instance, are commonly understood, at least in the academic world, to
refer to locations where books, journals and other material, including (more
recently) digital media may be found for the purposes of study. However, ‘libraries’
– even when open to new technologies – arguably have a history very much tied to
the acts of collecting and/or reading books: When a person refers to one’s own
library, for instance, he or she tends to be referring to a book collection; similarly,
mention of a library in a museum or stately home may bring to mind an image of
large rooms filled imposingly from floor to ceiling with rows and rows of scholarly –

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
often inaccessible – hard-copy volumes; and a similar picture may be envisioned
when referring to university libraries, particularly with regard to ‘old universities’.
Learning Resource Centres or Learning Centres, on the other hand, may well imply a
broader scope when it comes to the provision of material, particularly given the rise
in online and other digital media that has become a regular part of both amateur and
professional research and study. More importantly, the term ‘Learning Resources
Centre’ arguably puts the emphasis on not, say, reading for leisure purposes, but on
– as its name suggests – learning; that is, LRCs provide the tools with which to gain
useful knowledge and skills.

When it comes to local studies, the term ‘resource requirements’ arguably becomes
even more complex. It might, for instance, be considered self-defeating or – to be
even more blunt – rather pointless, for a student to conduct a local investigation
without having to leave the college or university’s grounds – that is, to not venture
‘into the field’, an activity which, as Bryant‘s observation implicitly suggests in
chapter two, 20p.62 is one of local studies’ greatest strengths in terms of the research
experience a local investigation grants. In fact, the questionnaire respondent from
South Kent College cited in chapter five who was happy to leave local collections to
the public sector may well have inadvertently highlighted one of the possible
inherent contradictions of academic libraries hosting local collections material: if
local studies provides a first-rate opportunity for the student to get his or her
researcher’s toes wet, does placing the material within easy reach perhaps defeat a
large purpose of the local studies assignment? After all, it is not difficult for one to
assume that local studies is an ideal area for independent, resource-based learning;
should the focus be on the immediate geographical area, materials can often be
found relatively close to hand, with newspapers, official documents, photographs,
people, and so on available for ‘direct contact’. As Dewe points out, ‘It is difficult to
imagine another area of study, research or enquiry where the source materials are
so varied and so dispersed over a variety of resource providers at local level.’21p.25
Hobbs too takes note of the academic library’s responsibility with regard to the
provision of local studies resources and how this responsibility may not necessarily
be limited to the collection(s) located within the immediate vicinity. While he notes
205

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
that it is the library’s ‘primary function’ to provide ‘advice and help’ when both the
student and amateur researcher embark on ‘The discovery of source material’, he
also offers a further consideration in terms of how ‘no library can hope to secure
more than a fraction of the available material on local studies’ and ties this to the
broadening of the search for potential materials and the value of this endeavour:

This does not mean that the student is to be denied, or is to be carefully
shielded from, the delights of searching for his sources on his own account.
On the contrary, it is salutary that he should undergo this essential
preliminary training and the amount now available is so great that no library
can have even know about all that is needed for any specific line of research,
however limited it may be.’22p.183

In 1990, an article published in the Library Association’s Local Studies Librarian
journal focused on the local studies collection held in Newcastle College. The
intention of the collection was made clear, where the Librarian and Head of Library
Services ‘hoped that the collection would help the lecturing staff to introduce the
topic into their own teaching programmes and would stimulate research and
exploration by the students into their own heritage.’23p.9 The article provides a
number of examples of how local collections can be used to enhance the curriculum
across different subject areas:

Art students may research local artists, craftsmen, and architects, or use the
city and surrounding areas as inspiration in their own right; business
students consider past or present industrial growth, retail trade, service
industries, transport networks, regional finance or the workings of local
authorities; science students study the geology, ecology and natural history
of the region …24p.10

It is clear that Newcastle did not see the collection as one limited to a narrow range
of disciplines – namely, those of a historical nature; indeed, the article’s authors are
careful to point out, when discussing the beginnings of the collection, that ‘whilst we
206

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
appreciated Newcastle’s past, we were just as interested in the present.’25p.9 In
addition, the library’s managers seemed to be aware of the potential arguments
against local studies collections in an academic setting, addressing possible
limitations by reframing the purpose of such collections – instead of positing the
collection as a complete resource for students who have only to visit the college
library in order to carry out local studies research, the article instead forwards the
collection as an introduction to local studies as an area of research:

We try, if we can, to give students a start to their enquiries in the hope that
some measure of quick success will encourage them to move on to better
and more comprehensive collections in the public libraries and archives.26p.10

Indeed, it might be argued that the case of Newcastle College as described in the
article cited provides a first-rate example not only of the breadth of local studies
potential to enhance curriculum subjects, but also of a solid, justifiable purpose
behind the idea of stocking local studies resources in academic libraries: as a starting
point to local studies investigation. In other words, a situation is presented where
local studies collections in further or higher education libraries are seen as
complementary to local collections in the public sector rather than as complete
resources to be used instead of those available elsewhere.

Yet, as ideal as Newcastle’s example of local studies resources in academic libraries
once appears to have been, the college library’s response to the present study’s
questionnaires over a decade later, suggest that the integration of local studies into
the curriculum was not, or at least is no longer, quite as effectively rendered as the
article cited would imply. When asked the question, Which courses in your
institution does the collection support? the following answer was given: ‘None
specifically. The local studies collection was developed as an item of interest, and
hence now v. little [sic] funds are directed towards it.’ In addition, not only is the
college’s collection no longer the integral element of the curriculum that the 1990
article seemed keen to promote, but neither are any links to be found with other
local studies collections in the area, nor are there any ‘future plans’ for the
207

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
collection. However disappointing this more recent response might be, given the
enthusiasm expressed above, there is evidence in the findings that a majority of
institutions that hold local collections are seeing these resources employed, to one
degree or another, in support of curriculum subjects. History, English,
Business/Management, Travel and Tourism, Archaeology, Art and Design, and Local
Studies itself are just some of the subjects that respondents cite as making use of
local studies resources.

The English and History BA Honours Degree at North Lindsay College in Scunthorpe
provides one such example of how local studies is utilised in other subject areas or,
more accurately in this case, provides a focus for both historical and literary study.
According to the Degree Course Leader, Pat Henderson,27 English and History BA
Honours is a joint honours degree that came about when the college was franchised
by what is now the University of Lincoln to facilitate the first year of the university’s
BA Combined Studies, which contained elements of English, History, Geography,
Law, Psychology, and Social Sciences. This carried on through a change to BA
Humanities to the late 1990s, when, with the thought that ‘more specific degree
titles’ would benefit the students, the BA Honours English and History emerged,
combining the ‘main strands’ from both the English and History single honours
degree courses. Henderson uses an example from the first year of what is now a
two-year start to the degree at North Lindsay College, where a unit is completed on
Victorian History, including urban culture, social and economic history and also
literature, all of which can contain elements of local investigation: ‘So, in fact, the
two [subjects] come across very, very well. [For instance] They can use North and
Southxxxvi both as a literary source and as a historical source as well.’ Henderson
points to the benefits of such an approach, arguing that the student does not receive
an education on history and English in which one is necessarily diluted by the
inclusion of the other. On the contrary:

xxxvi

208

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
To some extent, they actually gain, because they get a historical context for
the literature. Or, if you want to say it the other way around, they get
literature as another strand in the narrative of history. Whichever way you’re
coming from, the two do actually come together very well.

Asked specifically about the contribution of local studies to the course, tutor
Stephanie Codd points to the first year ‘research methods essay’ where students are
encouraged to undertake oral history research involving family members, which they
can then relate to other primary sources such as newspapers or other materials that
can be found in the library at North Lindsay College. Codd continues:

In the second year, there is actually a unit called Themes in Local and
Regional History. So, it’s to put it in a broader context. So, again, they’re
encouraged to use local studies and – not just in this library, obviously – but,
the reference library at Scunthorpe Library as well. But, they do use the stuff
we’ve got quite a lot. So, there is a local theme throughout [the course].

Codd also contributes to the supply of local studies resources used on the course,
where students are encouraged to use both primary and secondary material. In
Themes in Local and Regional History, for instance, ‘we look at primary sources. So, I
use Trade Directories as an example of that. But this [the library] is very useful for,
certainly, secondary sources, so they can go to the books and then … get references
from there to do further work.’

While the results reported in the previous chapter do not provide the depth of detail
supplied in the case of North Lindsey’s English and History course, it does appear
that local studies is having some impact on a variety of, for the most part, more
‘mainstream’ subjects, allowing for a perspective outside of standardised texts and
other typical teaching materials.

As suggested by the example above, as well as shown in the results noted in the
previous chapter, however, History is, by a broad margin, the subject area most likely
209

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
to provide opportunities for making use of local material suggesting once again that,
for many practitioners and users, there remains a strong connection between local
studies and studies of the past. The conflation of local studies with local history is a
theme that has emerged throughout the thesis. As noted in chapter five, for
instance, twice as many named collections refer to ‘local history’ than ‘local studies’,
while Dewe notes that ‘modern’ investigations are largely usurped by those of an
historical nature. More potentially troubling, however, is that this conflation may
not merely be a case of one subject persistently, but harmlessly, being mistaken for
the other. Instead, the situation appears to be that historical investigations actively
dominate local studies. While the findings support the notion that local studies has
found itself utilised within a fairly broad range of disciplines, it might also be
reasonably argued that the prevalence of history perhaps cannot help but act as
something of a background hum that may prevent local studies from achieving a
more prominent role within the curriculum, in research, and in the library itself.
Witness, for instance, the respondent in chapter five who does not identify as
holding a local collection – despite describing the presence of some local items –
because ‘we are not a historical collection.’

For those who would like to see local investigations more explicitly integrated with
contemporary fields of study, the dominance of history is undoubtedly frustrating.
Yet, the dominance of ‘History’ as the go-to subject area for local studies – as well as
the term ‘local history’ having the reputation it does as the synonym that will not go
away – need not necessarily be considered a failure to bring local resources up-todate, nor an indication that actual local history is doomed to merely provide
‘background’ to more contemporary studies. Instead, it might be suggested that the
term ‘history’ (or ‘historical’) is not static – there is no immutable ‘end’ point, a
suggestion raised during the interview with Professor Harold Fox of the Department
of English Local History in Leicester University in 2005 where, given the emphasis on
studies of the past that its name explicitly suggests, the question of the department’s
relevance to studies of the present was broached. Discussing the era covered by the
department (studies do not cover ‘pre-history’ – that is, history prior to the Roman
era) and how contemporary the department is permitted to be in its focus, Fox
210

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
posits the suggestion that ‘In some senses, it [history] doesn’t stop’. For example,
Fox points to a number of lectures having been delivered in the university on how to
conduct interviews with people ‘who are still living’. Not only does what Fox
describe allude to a dependent relationship between the past and the present,
where the two are inextricably intertwined (without the present perspective, the
history being relayed cannot exist) but the given example also illustrates something
of an on-going history: If the subject him- or herself can be considered a historical
presence, it stands to reason that, if the subject is still living, the ‘history’ continues.
Similarly, as a landscape historian, Fox notes that the landscapes with which he is
concerned are often visible in the present day; they have not simply disappeared
into a historical fog embedded in the past. In addition, he can use his knowledge and
awareness of the landscape’s history ‘to help in the planning process’, for example,
providing advice for future preservation purposes or indicating what can or cannot
be demolished or retained in the present. While this may not solve the ‘problem’ of
the strong association of local studies with studies of the past, by taking a different
approach towards the very definition of ‘history’ itself – one that encompasses both
the ‘old’ and contemporary – a means of incorporating local studies into more
modern fields of investigation arguably is enabled.

When it comes to examining types of research activity, it is perhaps worth returning
to the question raised earlier regarding the potential for local studies to provide
sound research experience. Dewe, for instance, is ‘thoroughly in support’ of the
view that local studies might serve as a ‘very useful approach to acquiring research
skills’:

If you look at the local studies guidelines, one of the things they say is that …
not talking particularly about students, but they’re talking about people
getting involved in local studies as a way of, shall we say, “acquiring a study
habit” […] In terms of undergraduates and others [it does give them] an
opportunity to develop research skills, that they get to use a range of sources
which perhaps they wouldn’t use in other fields. You know, everything from
maps, websites to ephemera – and also including fieldwork [...] And then
211

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
they have the job of analysing the information from all these varied
resources.28

If, as Dewe suggests, local studies investigation can provide a means of gaining
research experience and honing appropriate skills, it might be said that local studies
research provides something of a groundwork for future academic investigation. It
might also be suggested, however, that, while this is a valuable aspect of local
studies, its importance should not be overestimated at the expense of recognising
the value of local research as a pursuit in and of itself. The question of whether or
not academic libraries ought to be providing the resources with which to carry out
such research – thus potentially undermining the more adventurous aspects of local
investigation that takes the student out of the campus grounds – is perhaps, from
this perspective, something of a moot point. As Dewe points out, ‘fieldwork’ is not
the only benefit or pleasure that can be drawn from local studies investigation:
exposure to a variety of resources, as well as the ability to analyse information,
provides value too. In addition, the ‘introductory’ approach taken by Newcastle
College in the article cited earlier (regardless of the collection’s long-term success or
lack thereof), as well as collaborations between academic libraries and public
libraries and archives, also suggest that the student may well find him- or herself ‘out
in the field’ at any rate.

Yet, when considering the value of local studies materials in terms of how they are
put to use, a distinction between subject support and research may be difficult to
ascertain. Webb draws attention to a survey conducted by the Library and
Information Statistics Unit (LISU), referred to in the Follet report, ‘where many
respondents had difficulty in differentiating between library activity in support of
teaching and research.’ Regarding another study undertaken for the Follet Review
Group, in which monograph loans between 1981 and 1991 were analysed by the
University of Sussex, Webb states:

Results showed a very substantial degree of common use of book stock for
teaching and research. It is also possible that developments in teaching
212

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
methods have intensified the use of journals and monographs for teaching
purposes, further blurring such distinctions. This is particularly so in cases
where such material is used in projects and dissertations in final year
undergraduate or taught Masters courses.29p.138

While the present survey did not make a point of enquiring as to whether or not the
same local materials were used for course-based subject support and research, it is
possible that, given the idiosyncratic nature of much local studies material, some
crossover may occur.

7.5 Materials

In the previous chapter and the related Appendix 4 that lists the types of local
materials held in college and university libraries, it is shown that institutions still tend
to carry a majority of items in hard-copy format. Given the nature of much local
material and the ways in which it is often acquired – for instance, material of a
‘historical’ nature; books and photographs donated to the library – and the fact that
the majority of local collections held by respondents were started prior to the 1980s,
this is perhaps not too surprising. It also speaks to the often unique flavour of the
materials gathered and the value that can be placed outside of the ‘usefulness’ of
the content of the items themselves – for example, letters and manuscripts that are
viewed not only as providing insight into the locality due to the knowledge that can
be drawn from what is contained in these documents, but also as historical artefacts
that are worth preserving in and of themselves; that is, a document’s age and/or
origin alone can give it ‘value’ beyond its content. Even when material is employed
in learning, its usefulness might not be limited to the substance of its text. Dr
Norman Reid at St Andrews, for example, points to the study of calligraphy as a
subject that not uncommonly makes use of the local manuscripts kept in the
university’s Special Collections.30

Also noted, however, is that the second most popular format cited is local studies
content that is internet-based. As suggested in chapter six, a similar survey on local
213

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
studies resources in academic libraries carried out since the primary research
referred to in the present study was conducted would likely see the gap between
hard-copy and digital holdings narrowed. As Reid notes, ‘[It] can be argued that the
Internet revolution of the last ten years [i.e. prior to 2003] has been the most
important change in libraries since the introduction of the free public library. No part
of the library is immune from the changes being wrought by the Internet.’31p.14

Arguably, one of the ways that the impact of the ‘internet revolution’ on libraries is
most likely to be felt is in regards to the issue of, as Baker puts it, ‘access versus
holdings’, a matter focused on the ‘concept of access to materials rather than
holding them on-site.’32p.85 He draws attention to one of the most pressing problems
faced by libraries when it comes to holding material, noting that:

… it is not just the direct cost of buying the material which causes concern
[for libraries]. The growing problem is not the standard indirect costs of
acquisition … but the cost of space in which to house it. UEA [University of
East Anglia] Library was built to house 500,000 volumes; it now contains
700,000. The building is full by any standard or definition.’33p86

Here, the problem identified concerns lack of space to physically accommodate
items and the potential (monetary) costs of rectifying this. Indeed, as reported in
chapter five, a number of libraries or LRCs that do not carry local material cite a lack
of space and budget restrictions as a reason for the absence. Furthermore, a lack of
physical space is not a concern limited to those respondents who have prioritised
local studies out of their library collections entirely; as in the case of institutions such
as Wirral Metropolitan College and the University of Wales, Bangor, monetary
concerns can also impact negatively upon the potential expansion of existing
collections.

However, as Reid suggests, digitisation may well provide a potential solution, where
‘the mounting of local studies materials on the Internet can result in overcoming […]
the location of the physical collection.’34p.81 Not only might the digitisation of local
214

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
material save room and reduce ongoing concerns about balancing the need to house
items with the associated costs required to do so, but there are other benefits that
perhaps depend less on the ability to make items potentially accessible in the first
place (the ‘space’ problem) and more on making potentially accessible items more
usefully accessible. Reid points to a situation whereby the creation of digital
content can provide a ‘universal point of access to the collection,’ and not only in
terms of bringing together material held in separate locations. As he puts it:

Perhaps the greatest single benefit of the Internet is, however, the ability
to reach a much wider audience anywhere in the world. The creation of
digital content is not simply about enfranchising members of the local
community but is also about enabling a much wider audience to share in
unique local resources.35p.80

Once again, one of the arguably strongest arguments for digitisation points to the
distinctiveness of local studies materials as a learning resource. Whether
intentionally or not, however, Reid underlines the perhaps paradoxical – and thus,
possibly problematic – nature of a resource whose singular flavour makes it a
potentially very desirable focus for digitisation and broader access while, at the same
time, lacking the ‘mainstream’ or broad appeal of more general educational
resources:

Certainly the goal is to enable users to find an answer or a response to their
particular question or problem but the same universality of sources simply
does not exist across the board within the local studies context. It is the
individuality of local studies collections that makes them so important. Each
individual collection has the capacity, if not always the ability, to provide
access to a unique range of holdings; there exists the potential to create
digital resources made up of materials that cannot be accessed in any other
way beyond the narrow geographical confines of the ‘local area’.36p.80

215

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
Reid, however, is clear that it is the very distinctiveness of local materials that makes
it an ideal candidate for wider access. Indeed, to approach the opportunity for
broader ‘distribution’ otherwise could arguably be said to reduce access to
educational resources (whether their ultimate use is academic, amateur or
professional) to a mere popularity contest, particularly when the means of
distribution is a tool whose principal, if not sole, purpose is to share information
without borders (barring censorship or copyright issues that may affect certain
territories).

Discussing the University of Dundee’s Archive Services digitisation project, Brown
highlights further potential benefits of digitisation, involving not only the possibility
of easier admission to traditionally difficult-to-access formats, but also the
prospective practical use that access to digital material may have when it comes to
the overall organisation and management of collections:

Creating a digital copy of an item provides a surrogate which can be accessed
and used instead of the original thereby assisting in the preservation of the
original. Archives that are difficult to access because of their physical
nature, such as large plans, glass plate negatives and 35mm slides become
immediately accessible. Selecting items for digitisation and having a
bank of images available on a computer gives archivists a better overview
of their collections and can assist with the cataloguing process.37p.170

Yet, despite the potential advantages highlighted above, very few respondents
explicitly cited digitisation as part of their library or LRC’s future plans, with only
North Highland College, the University of Cambridge, and Cardiff University
unambiguously bringing attention to this issue as a means of possible development.
Whether potential costs of digitisation, present low usage of local material, or even
the possibility that the issue simply did not occur to the respondent when answering
the open question (that is, the questionnaire did not prompt respondents with
potential options) affected respondents’ attitudes, again, it is probable that views on
this subject have changed since the survey was conducted.
216

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations

There are, of course, other potential issues to be considered when evaluating the
prospect of digitisation as a means of permitting broader access to local materials.
For example, for collection managers, meeting appropriate image quality standards,
such as those laid out in the National Archives’ Digital Records: Digitised Image
Specification, may be a consideration,38p.6 as might other practical issues, such as a
possible accompanying increase in the cost of server space, or the potential
environmental impact of converting items into a digital format.39 When it comes to
prospective users, the issue of admission to digital materials requiring access to the
access point in the first place is arguably a further cause for consideration. With
regards to online access, the Office for National Statistics reports in the first quarter
of 201240 that 83.7% of the UK population above 16 years of age have, at some
point, used the internet, with only a slight gender gap of 86.15% male to 81.3%
female; neither does a difference in weekly earnings amongst those in paid
employment appear to affect access to any significantly negative degree, with all pay
bands found between 90% and (in two cases among the top three earnings bands)
100%. When considering the issue within a local studies context, perhaps
interestingly, the most discernable gaps occur when it comes to age, where only
27.4% of those 75 years old and over, 61.3% of those aged between 65 and 74, and
81.8% of the population in the 55 to 64 years old bracket have used the internet, in
contrast to, for example, 98.6% of those aged between 16 and 24. While the
correlation between an older demographic and relatively recent technology may be
(stereo)typically unsurprising, within the context of local studies, such figures may
require a more nuanced approach. Professor Harold Fox, for example, points to the
popularity of local studies with older people, noting of approximately three quarters
of those undertaking the Local History MA at the University of Leicester: “They don’t
need a degree, they’re simply doing it for pleasure … Their holiday cruise [comparing
in terms of cost] is the MA course.”41 This suggests that, in terms of local studies
resources, there is yet another paradox – or perhaps conundrum – whereby a
demographic amongst those most likely to benefit from digital access is also one of
those least likely to make use of the means with which to access the material.

217

7.6 Conclusion

The research presented in this thesis aimed to provide an exploration of the
presence of and reasons for local studies collections in the libraries and learning
resource centres of further and higher education institutions in the United Kingdom.
While contributions have been divided into methodological and empirical
contributions, and theoretical contributions, some overlap does occur between
these categories.

7.6.1 Methodological and Empirical Contribution: Scale and Scope of the
Study

As noted in chapter one’s rationale, the subsequent literature review in chapter two,
and elsewhere in the thesis, one of the chief reasons for having undertaken the
present study is the dearth of research and writing on the subject of local collections
in college and university libraries and LRCs. Prior to the current investigation, the
only substantial literature to focus on this particular area of interest is that based on
Paul and Dewe’s 1984 survey, which the authors themselves describe as a
‘preliminary’ study of local resources in academic libraries.

While an acknowledgement of Paul and Dewe’s work as an influence on the study
presented herein is certainly warranted, the research and findings reported in the
thesis suggests that, for such a significant gap in the literature – where the public
library has, for a long time, been assumed the natural domain of local studies
resources – a ‘preliminary’ study, by definition, does not grant the subject of local
collections in further and higher education institutions the importance it deserves;
rather, at best, it serves as a starting-point for investigations that are both more
expansive and delve deeper into the whys and wherefores of the area under
discussion.

218

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
One of the most important aspects of the present study is the scale and scope of the
investigation. Given this focus, it is not surprising that the methodological and
empirical contributions to knowledge appear so dependent on one another – in
other words, the methodological approaches employed to carry out the study were
very much dictated by the deliberate decision to cast a wide net in order to collect
and analyse empirical data on local studies material in academic libraries on a scale
and scope that had not been seen before. While this may seem self-evident –
methodology should depend on the information being sought – it is perhaps worth
reiterating that, in this case, the methodological approach was not only informed by
the type of data required in order to provide information that would benefit the
study, but the sheer reach of the study itself.

Consideration has, therefore, been given to the methodological and empirical
contributions to knowledge as separate entities, but with the acknowledgement that
they are profoundly linked.

7.6.1.1 Methodological Contribution

Methodologically, the study comprises both quantitative and qualitative approaches
and methods, including questionnaires, observational visits, interviews, and
secondary literature.

Quantitative data was collected largely through the distribution of two
questionnaires: the first distributed to all identified targets, with a view to providing
broad coverage of the content and scope of local collections in university and college
libraries in the UK; the second aimed at providing further detail that spoke to the
purpose of the collections held. A two-tiered approach was adopted for two
reasons: to avoid receiving an overwhelming amount of data in the first instance;
and to avoid discouraging potential respondents by distributing a large questionnaire
at the initial data-collection stage.

219

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
As noted both below and in Chapter Three: Methods and Approaches, the decision
was made to target as many further and higher institutions as possible in Scotland,
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Sources including several online Bubl subdirectories pertaining to universities, colleges and academic libraries, and the
2003/2004 World of Learning directory were consulted in order to provide the
researcher with a comprehensive list of potential respondents. Once email
addresses and the names of appropriate individuals were located by either checking
library home pages or contacting the library by telephone, the first questionnaire
was distributed to 802 libraries and LRCs. Following the receipt and analysis of the
questionnaire’s responses, a second survey was distributed to 223 respondents who
had expressed an interest in contributing further to the study.

The decision to employ questionnaires for these stages reflects the size and scope of
the study, allowing the researcher to reach a large number of respondents within a
relatively short time. What adds to the uniqueness of the study in terms of the
methodological contribution, however, is the decision to combine this method with
other, qualitative, methods that served to provide a richer, fuller picture of local
studies resources in academic libraries. A small number of observational visits were
organised, with purposive sampling employed in order to ensure a robust
justification for the selection of each institution; interviews were arranged with the
institution’s library, special collections department, or learning centre’s collection
manager in order to build on responses received at the questionnaire stage; with
further interviews conducted with educators and students. An interview was also
carried out with Michael Dewe, a renowned figure in local studies, in which findings
from the study were discussed in-depth; with a follow-up set of reflective questions
forwarded to Dewe later in the year.

The combination of a large-scale questionnaire survey; a further, more detailed
questionnaire; observational visits to a number of carefully selected institutions; and
interviews with collection managers, experts and others, has resulted in the
contribution of a mixed methodology that encompasses both a broad scope and
deep focus.
220

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations

7.6.1.2 Empirical Contribution

As noted above, one of the first ways in which the thesis’ research makes a
significant contribution to the field of local studies literature, as well as that focused
on academic libraries and the relationship between resources and teaching, learning
and research in colleges and universities, is in the scale and scope of the study.
Because of the scale and scope, investigations are not limited by either geography
(within the United Kingdom) or the types of subjects taught within institutions.
Indeed, to have limited the study in this way can be immediately reckoned to run
counter to the point of carrying out an investigation seeking to focus on both the
content and scope and the purpose of local studies resources in the first place. For
example, to have narrowed the examination of local studies resources’ engagement
with courses mainly drawn from the arts and social sciences, as was the case in the
1984 study, would arguably have led to a bias in the literature not dissimilar from
that which assumes, and arguably propagates, the ‘local studies = public libraries’
model. In other words, there is already a well-established affiliation between local
studies and the humanities, especially historical studies, and limiting the
investigation to institutions whose educational focus is based around these subjects
risks a significant degree of confirmation bias before the findings are even analysed
with regards to what kinds of teaching, learning and research are ‘most likely’ to
make use of local resources. In order to avoid this potential constraint, a broad
scope when considering potential participants in the study, therefore, became
essential. In terms of limiting the study by geography, while not presenting a
problem similar in any way to that just mentioned, there may perhaps be something
of an inherent irony in launching an investigation, in which the extent to which local
resources are used is a main component, that narrows its geographical scope to
specific parts of the country in question. As discussed later in this conclusion, the
term ‘local’ itself comes with a wealth of interpretations that frequently rely not just
on geographical lines mapped out by official government bodies (where, even then,
the term ‘local’ might mean anything from the institution itself to entire countries) ,
but on historical areas, ‘shifting’ borders, community identities and other unofficial
indicators.
221

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations

By targeting the entire (as far as possible) population under consideration, including
departmental libraries within Oxford and Cambridge universities, the study allowed
for a broad picture to be taken of the current situation with regard to local resources
in colleges and universities. One that permitted, for example, libraries supporting
natural science subjects to be represented as much as those whose institutions are
focused on history or education; while, similarly, further and higher education
institutions from all areas of the United Kingdom could, ideally, take part in the
survey. The study, therefore, stands as the first large-scale survey of the content,
scope and purpose of local studies collections in colleges and universities throughout
the United Kingdom, where participation does not depend on certain types of
subjects being taught in the curriculum, or by geographic location in the UK. That is,
the research represents the first in-depth investigation into local studies resources to
focus on libraries within the Further and Higher Education sector.

As the findings suggest, employing an expansive scale and scope to the investigation
has allowed for a much richer examination of local collections in academia than has
previously been carried out. Not only does this in itself suggest a unique
contribution to the discourse of library resources and local studies, but, as proposed
earlier, it also serves to interrupt the dominant narrative found in local studies
literature that, until now, has firmly positioned local studies within the context of the
public library, often with only the briefest of allusions made to local resources that
might be found outside of the public sector.

While the issue of the definition of ‘local’ is discussed further below, it is important
to note at this point how critical the relationship is between local resources and the
field of local studies, and how the study’s focus on resources draws attention to an
inextricable link that may not always be evident when thinking about resources and
disciplines in a ‘traditionally’ hierarchical manner, where library materials can
frequently be thought to take a ‘supporting’ role to the area of enquiry itself. Local
resources themselves, however, arguably have a much more immediate impact on
the study of localities. Local materials, for example, largely define what is meant by
222

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
local within the context of a given collection; this is especially true of local material in
the academic sector, which, as mentioned previously in the thesis, is subject to fewer
restrictions than public libraries regarding geographic scope. As such, if a collection
is expanded upon in terms of geographic coverage, the definition of ‘local’ is, by
extension, expanded and must, therefore, be revisited. This emphasises the
criticality of the role of resources within local studies and further underlines the
importance and significance of this research.

What the study does then, as far as contributing to the broader discourse is
concerned, is to reconceptualise local studies through the prism of academic libraries
and resources rather than keep the subject contained within the ‘traditional’ realm
of the public library. In this way, as will be discussed further when recommendations
are made, the door is opened for further explorations of local studies resources
outside of the public sector.

Of course, this does not necessarily mean that a sharp division should be drawn
between the public and academic sectors. Rather, the attention given to resources
within universities and colleges can also be viewed as cause to examine more closely
the likes of collaborations and partnerships between public libraries and archives
and neighbouring higher and further education institutions. While bearing in mind
Dewe and others’ caution regarding duplication of materials, findings suggest that
collaboration with the public sector has been a consideration for a number of
respondents including, in the case of St Andrews University, primary responsibility
for city archives being handed from one sector to the other. The issue of
collaboration and creative partnerships between resource providers is perhaps
especially relevant in the current financial and political climate, where cuts in both
the public sector and in education are not uncommon. Economic austerity can
frequently be a driving force behind collaborations between those hit hardest by
budget cuts and restraints; given the nature of local studies material – that is, in the
case of, say, a town or city home to a public library, city archives and a university or
college, a range of material that shares a common, and in some cases, strong,
geographical theme – local resources would appear to lend itself most readily to
223

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
partnerships and affiliations that can benefit both/all parties. In other words,
because of the quite specific thematic sameness of the material, a relationship
between the resources held by different providers already exists and can be built
upon without having to create (perhaps more artificial or arbitrary) connections
between materials.

7.6.2 Theoretical Contribution: Questioning ‘Local’

In addition to reframing local studies resources – and thus local studies itself – by
focusing on materials outside of a public sector context, carrying out a survey of this
size and scope also allowed for a more thorough than previously undertaken
examination of one of the most fundamental aspects of local studies investigation:
the definition of the term ‘local’ itself. While an assessment of this facet of local
studies had been identified as one of the study’s objectives early on, the extent to
which the question of defining the term featured in the research was somewhat
unexpected. As indicated above, the scale and scope of the study may well have had
some bearing on the reason why this particular issue emerged as a key point,
allowing the objective to be met and surpassed. Asking respondents from the
largest possible population in terms of further and higher education institutions to
describe the geographic scope of their collection(s) encouraged a broad range of
answers that frequently belied ‘commonsense’ notions of what ‘local’ is, or how –
even within the literature – the term is generally understood. As described in
Chapter Five, not only did respondents’ answers range from ‘local as institution’ to
‘local as several countries’, but secondary investigation that suggested ‘local’ as a
term commonly used, yet arguably with a limited degree of clarity, consensus or
understanding, revealed that this aspect of local studies had also been largely
neglected in the literature. This is not to suggest that defining the term – or rather
examining how the term is or can be defined – has been of no interest to previous
practitioners and scholars; only that, again, given how central the concept of ‘local’
is, and should be, to local studies, there has been relatively little research and writing
done on this specific, but arguably overarching, aspect of local studies and its
resources.
224

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations

The present research does not provide a definitive answer to the question of what
the term ‘local’ means within the context of local studies – probably the least
problematic and most easily applied definition that carries some degree of
consistency is that ‘local studies’ may refer to the study of one or more localities,
with the proviso that defining specific localities in the first place can frequently come
with its own set of ambiguities (as mentioned earlier, for instance, ‘localities’ are not
always strictly dependent on government-drawn boundaries). What the research
and subsequent findings do, however, is open up an under-investigated issue for
further consideration. For example, responses could be grouped into broad
descriptive areas, from material whose scope is limited to the institution itself (as in
the case of, for instance, the Institute of Astronomy Library at the University of
Cambridge), through collections that focus on the immediate town or city (such as
the Library and Learning Centre at Hugh Baird College), the county (for instance,
Perth College), up to the likes of the University of Leicester, where the collection of
‘local’ material reaches across more than one constituent country.

While it may be unrealistic to expect that a consensus can or even should be reached
as to a single definition of the term ‘local’, the wide range of responses received
from the libraries and LRCs that took part in the study suggest that it is an area worth
investigating further in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how
geographical areas can be perceived, whether in terms of physical spaces,
communities, history or otherwise, rather than relying on tacit knowledge that
mostly assumes that the reader or researcher will ‘just know’ what ‘local’ in any
given context means.

That the focus placed on definition(s) of the term ‘local’ constitutes the theoretical
contribution is precisely because it is so central to the subject of local studies and,
equally, to its resources. As noted in the previous section, local resources are not
easily separated from local studies. Yet, what constitutes ‘local’ – the primary
concept that separates this type of study from almost all others – has rarely been
interrogated to the extent that it arguably should be. The findings clearly challenge
225

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
common notions of what ‘local’ is, whether held by lay-persons, academics,
librarians, or local studies experts. By opening it up to interrogation, allowing
theories and concepts to emerge that challenge perceptions of places, boundaries
and even identities, a theoretical contribution is made that focuses on the very heart
of local studies.

7.7 Limitations of the Research

As noted above, the use of survey questionnaires permitted the large scale and
broad scope of the study. However, the response rate for the first questionnaire was
low, at 28%. This limits the significance of the findings to a degree. Yet, as pointed
out earlier by Paul in Chapter Three, the response rate for questionnaires in general
does not tend to be very high42p.62 and so, while not an ideal result, it may be
counted as a realistic response, especially given that the targeted population was so
specific.

Another notable limitation concerns the progress of technology. During the
research, a number of innovations occurred and advancements made that may have
benefit the study had they been incorporated. It is suggested in the thesis itself, for
example, that, given the rapidly increasing popularity of digital resources, responses
to the question regarding types of materials held might look very different should
the same question be asked in the not-too-distant future, or even today. Similarly,
at the time of the research design and implementation, social networking sites and
more interactive, visitor-friendly blogs were neither as ubiquitous nor heavily used
as they latterly became. Not only could these sites have been utilised as tool for
communicating with prospective respondents, but it is possible they would have
found their way into the research itself, for instance, cited as a potential publicity
tool used by respondents.

226

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations

7.8 Recommendations

By focusing on local studies resources within the academic sector, the research not
only aimed to shed light on this underrepresented area of local studies, but also
sought to provide ideas and suggestions for how the investigation and findings can
be carried forward.

The tendency for local studies collections to be equated with the public library
service is one that perhaps puts unnecessary limits on the potential of local studies
resources. Further investigation into local resources outside of the public sector may
ultimately provide a means of enhancing access – that is, broadening the scope for
admission to local materials – as well as shedding a light on collections that may, at
present, be neglected; this applies not only to collections that may be lying dormant
in colleges and universities or are simply underused in academia, but also private
collections that, due to the local studies-public library paradigm, have not been
allowed to be discovered by those with a serious interest in local studies – whether
amateur, professional or academic. After all, local studies collections are not
infrequently home to ‘hidden treasures’ that further investigation into different
collections may help to uncover. With this in mind, collaboration between public
and academic libraries might also be explored further. In addition to the potential
for broadening access, collaboration may also provide, for example, practical
benefits in terms of shared resources, such as those based on financial concerns, or
it may lead to a reduction in the redundant duplication of materials.

Improved access may also be attained if further consideration is given to digitisation.
Although academic libraries are taking the lead in digitisation in general, relatively
few academic libraries are engaged in such projects with respect to local materials.
Yet, while it would be a mistake to assume that digitisation can provide a cure-all
remedy for neglected or underutilised items, there are benefits to undertaking such
projects, not only in terms of providing potential wider admission to ‘difficult to
access’ material, but also in digitisation’s capacity to serve a role in preserving the
types of rare, aged, and sometimes valuable items – not to mention those that,
227

Chapter Seven: Key Findings and Further Considerations
through age of prior lack of care, might be vulnerable to damage – that are not
uncommonly found in local collections.

However, the belief that there is room in academic libraries for local collections
should not necessarily usurp more practical considerations. It may well be, for
instance, that a collection is simply redundant within a given college or university,
whether due to lack of use thanks to an incompatibility with courses or research
activity or an inability to provide suitable accommodation for the material through a
lack of space, or absence of other resources that would enable material to be held
for other purposes. In such cases, as may occur in the instance described earlier of
the collection held at Coleg Sir Gar’s Learning Centre Ammanford Campus, handing
material over to a specialist collection may well be the most pragmatic solution,
affording the material its best chance both to be looked after properly and to find
enthusiastic users.

In addition, as implied earlier when discussing the contribution to theory, further
research could be undertaken as to how the present understanding of ‘local’ as a
concept affects not only the literature, but the practice of local investigation and the
management of collections. As proposed, this concept is central to local studies, yet
largely neglected as an area of examination, and arguably deserves far more
attention than has been given thus far.

Appendix 1: Questionnaires
The documents that follow comprise hard-copy versions of both the first and second
questionnaires that formed the initial two stages of empirical data collection. In
both cases, online versions were made available via links sent to potential
respondents, with hard copies available on request.

Local Studies Collections in College and University
Libraries
Notes for the respondent
Although the questionnaire title, and the questions themselves, refer to local studies collections, I am
chiefly interested in local studies materials held in your library or learning centre. Such materials may,
in fact, be organised as an easily identifiable single collection, or they may comprise individual items
or more than one collection dispersed throughout the library stock. Therefore, the term collection
refers to the existence of any local studies items, with certain questions designed to determine the
actual nature of their organisation.
The term,"local studies" basically refers to any material concerned with your local area, whether its
subject is history, geography, art, science or otherwise. As for "local" itself, definitions of this term can
be determined in many different ways. It may, for instance, refer to a town or city, a region, or even a
certain distance measured by radius from your college or university. In Question 3 of SECTION B,
therefore, the respondent is asked to indicate his or her library’s own definition of this concept.
May I also take the opportunity to thank you in advance for your contribution to this study.

Local Studies Collections in College and University
Libraries – Questionnaire Part 2
Notes for the Respondent
As the PhD study moves forward, more attention is given to both the management and the purpose
of local studies collections in the library or learning resource centre. The information received from
this questionnaire will help to identify how collections are organised, the types of materials found in
the collections, and how local studies resources support teaching, learning and research within the
college or university.
Please note that, as before, the term "collection" refers to individual items, materials that may be
organised as a single collection, or more than one collection dispersed throughout the library stock.
Should you have any questions regarding the survey, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Once again, thank you for continuing to support this PhD study.

Do you think that local studies research can serve as a useful introduction to
research skills?

•

Can you comment on the drop in popularity of local studies as a focus of research
activity at levels above undergraduate dissertation research?

•

Is there a ‘local’ paradox? [No consensus on what the term ‘local’ means]

•

Do you think there is an inherent difference in local studies as a subject
compared to other subjects?

•

Are there circumstances in which it would be appropriate for the university
library to duplicate the public library in terms of local studies, or is this something
that should not happen under any circumstance?

•

Do you agree with suggestions in the literature that that local studies requires a
more active interest on the part of the librarian?

•

Is it possible that collections not only reflect what is being taught, but that what
is being taught deliberately reflects the collection?

Appendix 3: Reflective Questions
Reflective questions sent to Michael Dewe on 19 December 2006, following the
analysis of questionnaire responses and interview transcripts.

A few common themes seemed to crop up during the visits and interviews conducted and it’s these,
mostly, I’d like to pursue in terms of gaining your considered opinion.

1 – Local history as a historical enquiry.

Professor Harold Fox at the Centre for Local English History noted that, as far
as he was aware, local history no longer carried the stigma of ‘second-class
history’ and that PhDs tended not to be written about, for example, ‘the
industrial revolution’, but rather about ‘the industrial revolution in West
Yorkshire’. On a related note, a second year ‘English and History’ student at
North Lindsay College observed that, when it comes to local history, “You’re
getting a bit more focused, aren’t you? A bit more in-depth,” than tends to be
the case with broader historical study.

a)

We talked a little in the original interview about this ‘deeper’ dimension to historical study
when placed in a local context, but that was more to do with the ‘original contribution to
knowledge’ aspect of producing a piece of research. I wondered, therefore, if you had any
additional thoughts about this idea that, academically, local studies/history is being
employed as a means of looking at wider issues (e.g., the industrial revolution), as well as
providing a more ‘in-depth’ examination of ‘what happened when’.

2 – Local history as an (academic) hobby

Professor Fox also reckons that about 75% of those undertaking the
university’s Local History MA course are doing it ‘for pleasure’. The majority of
students involved in this course are ‘mature’ and include people with PhDs,
surgeons, and even nuclear physicists: “Their holiday cruise [comparing by
way of cost] is the MA course.” Similarly, Andrew Dobraszczyc, who runs
classes for the Department for Continuing and Profession Education in the
Community at Keele, observes that many who attend his local history classes
– run in the daytime – are retired and want “something else to expand their
interests … that they enjoy, that stretches them,” and local history frequently
fulfills that remit. In other words, these local history students are there
because they want to be, unlike, for instance, an undergraduate who might be
more focused on simply gaining a degree than actually appreciating the value
of local history itself (a horrible generalisation, yes, but one that I can perhaps
suggest comes under the heading of ‘Playing Devil’s Advocate’ for a moment).

a)

Would it be fair to suggest that, even when placed in an academic setting, where students
are formally taught both history itself and the methods employed to carry out historic
investigation, local studies – or in the cases above, more specifically, local history – can often
retain an element of what might be considered amateur ‘pastime’ status?

b) If so, I’d be interested on your take as to how this view might affect the status of local studies
within academia. While, as in the example of the first question, there is little doubt it is
taken ‘seriously’ as a subject by many institutions, might this aspect set it apart from other
academically sound subjects in terms of the value placed on it by students?

3 – An added ‘bonus’.

Both Professor Fox and Dr Norman Reid, the head of the Special Collections
Department at St Andrews University noted the benefits of local history
materials in terms of palaeography. Dr Reid mentioned that local manuscripts
are employed explicitly by tutors in that field to provide first-hand examples of
written works, while Professor Fox noted that, when his department teaches
local history, they also “have to teach the handwriting”, since, certainly prior
to 1800, the handwriting “is not easy.”

In the first instance, we have a case where academic local studies collection
material is used outside of its actual content; in the second, an aspect of local
history teaching that may not be immediately apparent is identified.

a)

Once again, not really a question as such, but an aspect of local studies/history that, I must
admit, had never really occurred to me before. I’d like your view on the suggestion that
there is an aesthetic quality to local studies that may well have been hitherto neglected
when discussing the value – or, indeed, even ‘simply’ the pleasure – in undertaking local
studies as a subject (whether amateur or academic).

b) If so – and taking a broader view – is it possible more could or should be done to highlight
these ‘secondary’ aspects of local studies or local history in order to encourage potential
students to the field?

4 – The academic library as a public resource.

St Andrews University Special Collections Department was of particular
interest to the study, since, as Norman Reid suggested, it has what can almost
be characterised as a public library remit when it comes to the local collection.
That is, while the public library does maintain a small local studies collection of
published material, the Special Collections Department at the university is
where a ‘deliberate’ local studies collection has been developed and
maintained which holds not only manuscripts and records deposited by the
National Archives concerning the Fife area, but also published material; also,
these records have to be made available to any member of the public who
wishes to see them. As Reid puts it, the department has “a much more public
responsibility, if you like, than many university libraries would consider
themselves to have.” Indeed, he observes that within St Andrews itself, the
university library has “taken over” the local studies responsibility for the town
(the David Hay Fleming Collection, for example, once held by the public
library, has been passed onto the university).

Part of the reason for this ‘takeover’, he suggests, is that, not only does the
university have the means to “provide the sort of curatorial care and control
needed” for certain materials, but the geographical location of the university –
“right in the centre of town” – means the library and department has a certain
status and reputation as a “major resource.”

a)

This, naturally, brought up the question of the ‘traditional’ link between the public library
and local studies. I’d be interested in your thoughts as to whether or not it’s possible that
there is, potentially, a rather arbitrary aspect to this relationship. That is, it may be a case
that the ‘tradition’ of the public library as the ‘people’s resource’ has merely dictated that
the public library takes primary responsibility for material on the locality, whereas the
academic library is more than capable of building and maintaining a collection that can be
used by all.

5 – Another ‘local’ definition.

During our first interview, we discussed the various interpretations that can be
attached to the term ‘local’ and how ‘local studies’ can frequently mean the
study of a locale, rather than, necessarily, the immediate locality (the latter
arguably providing the most common notion of what ‘local studies’ is).

Further to this, Dr Norman Reid brought up an interesting point, I think, when
we discussed the geographical scope of the Special Collections local material.

He says: “Fife is a place that tends to divide itself up into localities … and East
Fife tends to have a fairly distinctive local identity. And there are even more
local identities within that, of course … But, generally speaking, I think most
people would agree that there is a sort of East Fife identity.”

It is therefore, a ‘local identity’ that the Special Collections tends to draw on
when assembling its ‘boundaries’ – “But, it’s not clearly defined.” – thus
arguably adding yet another dimension to the question of what we actually
mean when we talk about ‘local studies’.

a)

I would appreciate your take on this, since a ‘local identity’ doesn’t necessarily fit into any
definition I’d come across at that time. While there is a geographical element here, of
course, there is also the suggestion that an ‘identity’ is something that can be carried by an
individual – or group of people – across traditional or contemporary government-set
boundaries, thereby not only taking ‘local’ to a different place again (as when, for example,
we discussed the ‘locality’ of a river that might travel all across the country), but almost
internalizing it, so that ‘local’ becomes a state of mind as opposed to something that can be
defined only in physical terms.

6 – Any further thoughts

Basically, you have free reign to jot down any additional thoughts, opinions, or
comments on local studies, academic libraries, teaching, learning, and
research that you might have.

As with the first interview, Mike, I hope these questions are not too interrogative. If they come across
as such, you have my sincerest apologies. Also, as mentioned earlier, should you have any questions
yourself, please let me know.

Thank you once again – I look forward to hearing from you.

complete newspapers); a collection of hard-copy council minutes; and
meteorological data and cropping information.

Appendix 5: Inventory of Local Collections at Responding Institutions
The order each entry’s information takes is as follows: the name of the institution;
the name of the library or learning resource centre; the name of the collection; the
time period in which the collection was started; the geographic scope of the
collection; the size of the collection.

Please note that in some cases, not all information following the name of the
institution is included. This may be due to data not being provided, relevant (e.g.,
not all collections are named), or known by the respondent (e.g., when the collection
was begun).

University of Cambridge and Oxford libraries are listed in separate sections.
