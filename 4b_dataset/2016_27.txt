Acknowledgments
In my innocent pre-dissertation days, I naïvely assumed that I would conduct this
study largely on my own. Experience has disabused me of this notion; I now know that
the efforts of many individuals are required to conceptualize and carry out a study of this
magnitude, and I would like to thank those who made it possible.
I gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Dr. Marian Gibney, my dissertation
adviser. Dr. Gibney always had kind, encouraging words for me when my doubts about
my ability to complete this project threatened to overwhelm me. I honor her for her
patience in explaining statistical concepts to one who is rather less than mathematically
inclined. I would also like to acknowledge Dr. Anymir Orellana, my committee member,
whose helpful criticisms have no doubt made this study a better one than it might have
been, and Dr. Steven Krosner, who offered a great deal of help and encouragement at the
early stages of the project.
Thanks are also due to my parents, Dr. Carol Young Wilson and Louis Donald
Wilson, who not only encouraged my early literacy, but who also proofread, without
complaint, numerous drafts of this manuscript. Camille McCutcheon, Dr. Anita
Ondrusek, and Stephanie Dunn helped immeasurably in their work to validate the
instruments. Thanks also to the librarians in my life: Kimmetha Herndon, John Rivest,
Bettie Sumner, DeWayne Williams, Karen Simpkins, and the wonderful staff of the
interlibrary loan department at Nova Southeastern University.
I dedicate this dissertation to three individuals who have loved and nurtured me in
more ways than I can count: My mother, Dr. Carol Young Wilson, whose adventures in
higher education inspired many of my own, and my two grandmothers, Jean M. Young
(1919–2000) and Blanche K. Wilson (1896–1973).

Abstract
Librarians’ Use of Instructional Design Methods in Creating Information Literacy
Instruction. Michael W. Wilson, 2016: Applied Dissertation, Nova Southeastern
University, Abraham S. Fischler College of Education. ERIC Descriptors: Instructional
Design, Information Literacy, Library Instruction, Academic Libraries, Library Science
The purpose of this sequential explanatory mixed methods study was to determine
whether instruction librarians in the United States and Canada were using instructional
design (ID) methods, and to identify potential explanations for their adoption or rejection
of those methods. The theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985) served as the theoretical
framework for the study. Research questions examined the relationship between
respondents’ reported use of ID methods and the following factors: (a) behavioral,
normative, and control beliefs, (b) demographic factors, and (c) professional identity as
teachers.
A survey adapted from Ajjan and Hartshorne (2008) and from Julien and Genuis (2011)
was distributed to members of the American Library Association’s Information Literacy
Instruction Discussion List. Quantitative data from 101 subjects were analyzed using χ2
and t tests for independent sample means. Qualitative data from seven volunteers were
compared to the quantitative data to identify areas of validation or disconnect.
Pearson correlations between use scores and behavioral, normative, and control beliefs
revealed that control construct scores (r = .59) had the strongest correlation with ID use,
followed by behavioral (r = .56) and normative (r = .53) scores. Qualitative data
supported the conclusion that there was a strong relationship between ID use and both
behavioral and normative scores, but not between ID use and control scores. Chi-square
analysis found no relationship between subjects’ use of ID methods and the length of
time they had worked in libraries (χ2 = 5.14). A significant relationship was found
between ID use and the length of time subjects had taught information literacy (χ2 = 7.91)
and reported type of training in ID (χ2 = 24.59). Subjects who identified primarily as
teachers used ID more than those who did not (t = 2.61).

Chapter 1: Introduction
Statement of the Problem
In 1876, Melvil Dewey, who is widely acknowledged as the “father of modern
librarianship” (Birdsall, 2009, p. 2), penned the following words for the inaugural issue
of American Library Journal, the official publication of the American Library
Association (ALA):
The time was when a library was very like a museum, and a librarian was a
mouser in musty books, and visitors looked with curious eyes at ancient tomes
and manuscripts. The time is when a library is a school, and the librarian is in the
highest sense a teacher, and the visitor is a reader among the books as a workman
among his tools. (Dewey, 1876, p. 5)
In this essay, Dewey made the first definitive statement about the role of instruction in
the newly emerging profession. The teaching component, in Dewey’s opinion, was one of
the things that distinguished the future of librarianship from its past (Roffman, 2007).
The concept of the librarian as teacher predates Dewey, however. As early as the
17th century, German institutions were providing library instruction for their students
(Ewert, 1986). In the United States, librarians at Harvard College were carrying out
instructional activities as far back as the 1820s (Weiss, 2003). Although the first wave of
instructional efforts in academic libraries began toward the end of the 19th century, it was
not until the early 1960s that the modern library instruction movement was born (Gibson,
2008; Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009; Lorenzen, 2001). The antecedents of the modern
discipline of instructional design (ID) have even more ancient roots; consideration of
instructional methods began with the Elder Sophists in the late fifth century BCE
(Saettler, 2004). ID as we know it today, however, did not emerge until after the Second
World War, driven by the need for training large numbers of soldiers quickly and
efficiently (Booth, 2011; Willis, 2011a).

2
ID and library instruction, then, have coexisted for approximately fifty years, but
they seem to have done so without having intersected meaningfully until the first decade
of the 21st century. This may be attributable to the speed at which library instruction
changed and matured over that period (Gibson, 2008; Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009), to
the differences in professional cultures of designers and librarians (Rose, 2002), or to
some other factor. Lately, many studies have investigated the relationship between library
instruction and ID, but none has yet been undertaken to determine the extent to which
librarians actually use ID theories or models to create library instruction.
The Research Problem
Changes both inside and outside the library profession have driven the need for
instructional services in libraries. Technological growth and evolving concepts of
information literacy (IL) are two trends in librarianship that have necessitated the
expansion of librarians’ skills to include designing and delivering instruction (Shank &
Dewald, 2012). Librarians traditionally have had neither the training nor the support
infrastructure for course design and delivery that other disciplines have enjoyed; without
these factors, the quality of IL instruction may suffer. The problem is that the extent to
which librarians have adopted ID methods to create IL instruction is unknown. Without
this fundamental knowledge, it is difficult to determine the efficacy of librarians’
instructional efforts in higher education.
Background and Justification
IL is an essential set of skills for navigating the academic library, and thus
ultimately has an impact on students’ overall academic success; learning these skills is
particularly important for undergraduate students, who typically score low on objective

3
measures of IL while at the same time overestimating their abilities in this area (Gross &
Latham, 2012). According to Eisenberg (2008), IL is important not only in the academic
environment, but also in work, public service, and even recreational settings as well. In
all of these situations, individuals must be able to find accurate information and to use it
to solve problems in the environment. Far beyond the academy, then, IL is a foundational
skill for functioning in an information-intensive society. To what extent, however, is IL
instruction informed by ID? While recent literature reflects a lively interest in ID themes,
does this suggest that most instruction librarians do indeed make use of ID? Further, do
instruction librarians themselves embrace their teaching role, and if not, does this have an
impact on whether or not they bother to use ID? Julien and Genuis (2011) surveyed a
national sample of 788 Canadian librarians and found that “the majority of respondents
identify instructional work as integral to their professional identity, but nearly one-third
see this work as a duty or expectation, and a small proportion view it as an imposition”
(p. 103), an observation which casts doubt on the quality of a large percentage of the IL
instruction currently being conducted.
For much of its history, the library instruction movement has seemed relatively
untroubled by considerations of design, and perhaps the reason for this lies in its origins:
bibliographic instruction, which was oriented to training users in basic research
techniques, was an informal, ad hoc practice that rarely inspired its adherents to consider
its possible theoretical underpinnings (Gibson, 2008; Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009).
When the movement came to embrace IL, which is process oriented and concerned with
developing critical thinking skills, librarians began to understand the necessity of using
models to create instruction and of connecting that instruction to learning theories

4
(Gibson, 2008).
The rise of information literacy. In 1974, Paul G. Zurkowski introduced the
term information literacy to the instruction librarian’s lexicon. According to Zurkowski,
information literate individuals were those who could apply information gleaned from a
variety of sources to problems in their personal lives and in the workplace (Badke, 2010;
Gibson, 2008; Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009). During the 1980s and 1990s, numerous
authors prominent in the library instruction movement refined and expanded upon
Zurkowski’s concept (Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009). There were common themes that
emerged in these authors’ definitions of information literate individuals: The information
literate person recognizes when information is needed (Bjorner, 1991; Doyle, 1996), is
skilled at using specific information resources and tools (Breivik, 1985; Bruce, 1997;
Doyle, 1996), and carefully evaluates the information found (Breivik, 1985; Bruce, 1997;
Kuhlthau, 1989, 1990). He or she is persistent in searching for information, is capable of
focusing on details (Breivik, 1985; Kuhlthau, 1989, 1990), and has good problem-solving
abilities (Breivik, 1985; Doyle, 1996). The information literate person also recognizes
that the research process is nonlinear and iterative (Kuhlthau, 1989, 1990), accurately
gauges the time and effort required to retrieve information (Kuhlthau, 1989, 1990), and is
able to adapt his or her search strategies to new information environments (Rader, 1991).
The ALA (1989), in its Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report,
codified the definition of IL:
To be information literate, a person must be able to recognize when information is
needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed
information. . . . Ultimately, information literate people are those who have
learned how to learn. They know how to learn because they know how knowledge
is organized, how to find information, and how to use information in such a way
that others can learn from them. They are people prepared for lifelong learning,

5
because they can always find the information needed for any task or decision at
hand. (para. 3)
As IL replaced bibliographic instruction as the dominant paradigm, librarians
began thinking more about how their instruction sessions could encourage students to
develop the critical thinking skills required to be information literate (Grassian &
Kaplowitz, 2009). The literature reflected increasing concern with ID beginning in the
late 1970s and continuing through the 2010s, as revealed by a search of the Library and
Information Science Abstracts database. Two early works (Adams, 1976/1977; Bantly &
Freedman, 1979) were published during the decade in which librarians first took notice of
ID; 30 years hence, that number had mushroomed, as the literature review will show.
The profession’s response. Library educators were slow to respond to this trend.
The last three decades of the 20th century saw increasing emphasis placed on user
instruction in academic libraries without a corresponding emphasis on andragogy in
library school curricula (Colborn, 2011; Hensley, 2015; Saunders, 2015; Sproles,
Johnson, & Farison, 2008). As Colborn (2011) wrote, “many roles in libraries require that
librarians teach, lead workshops, or give instruction to patrons in some way, but most
librarians are not adequately prepared for teaching as part of their formal education” (p.
15). Even though many librarians may lack formal instruction in andragogy, they
increasingly must satisfy the demands of their institutions to provide IL instruction,
because in the majority of cases this instruction is mistakenly seen as the exclusive
purview of the library (Association of College and Research Libraries [ACRL], 2001;
Gibson, 2008). They must also answer to the requirements of various accrediting bodies,
such as the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the National Council for
Accreditation of Teacher Education, to provide adequate instruction in library use

6
(Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges, 2012; National
Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, 2008).
Library schools have recently attempted to respond to these changing needs.
Although there were 154 courses in library user education offered in the 55 library
schools accredited by the ALA as of December, 2012 (ACRL, 2012), the impact of these
courses on the abilities of newly minted librarians to design and deliver IL instruction
remains to be seen. In fact, there is some indication that this new curriculum is having
little effect: A recent survey of library administrators (Click & Walker, 2010) revealed
that 86% believed that library schools inadequately prepared new library and information
science graduates for instructional duties, while 47% identified “preparing a lesson” as
“the biggest area needing improvement” (p. 5). In any case, the recency of these
curricular changes has left a large number of librarians who were trained earlier without
essential teaching skills (Polger & Okamoto, 2010).
Many librarians, then, may not possess the ability to create well designed IL
instruction. Instruction that lacks a coherent design has the potential to fail in a number of
ways: Lessons may be generally disorganized and confusing, they may not meet their
objectives, their content may be too simple or too complex for the target audience, and
the evaluation may not match what was taught (Piskurich, 2006). Further, poorly
designed instruction places students at risk for failure to develop IL skills, the teaching of
which is one of the main objectives of the modern academic library (ACRL, Information
Literacy Best Practices Committee, 2012). Clearly, librarians must have knowledge of
instructional techniques if they are to teach effectively. Before interventions can be
designed to remedy a lack of knowledge in this area, the extent of the problem must be

7
determined.
Deficiencies in the Evidence
A preliminary review of the literature failed to yield any research on the question
of whether or to what extent librarians use ID to create IL instruction. Despite the fact
that traditions of ID and library instruction have coexisted in American higher education
for many years (Hardesty, Schmitt, & Tucker, 1986; Rose, 2002; Saettler, 2004), there
seem to have been no empirical studies performed to date that specifically investigate
whether instruction librarians actually use ID as a basis for instruction.
While the number of published works devoted to the use of ID methods in
creating IL instruction may give the impression that the practice of designing instruction
systematically is prevalent among academic librarians, there is some indication in the
literature that this is not so. As previously mentioned, Click and Walker’s (2010) study
revealed that 86% of library administrators had little confidence in the ability of library
schools to prepare their graduates to teach. In one recent study, librarians’ lack of training
in ID was identified as a problem to be remedied by professional development (Starkey,
2010). Additionally, the ACRL’s Instruction Section identified design and
implementation of library instruction as an area in need of further research (ACRL,
Instruction Section Research and Scholarship Committee, 2013).
Rationale for Utilizing a Mixed Methods Design
Social science research is inherently complex; most research questions are
multifaceted, and a single approach is rarely sufficient to explore them in detail
(Creswell, 2009). As Creswell put it, “there is more insight to be gained from the
combination of both qualitative and quantitative research than either form by itself. Their

8
combined use provides an expanded understanding of research problems” (p. 203). The
present study, specifically, required a mixed methods design because it sought not only to
gather numeric data on the number of instruction librarians using ID methods, but also to
understand their reasons for choosing to use or not to use those methods.
Audience
Instruction librarians, library administrators, and others who are directly involved
in teaching library skills and IL competencies will benefit from this study, as will
instructional designers, faculty members, and others who may interface with librarians in
designing IL instruction. Library educators may use the results of the study to determine
future curricula, and library school students may benefit from their decisions in that
regard. Students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels may also benefit indirectly
from improvements in IL instruction brought about by others more directly affected by
the study.
Purpose Statement
The purpose of this sequential explanatory mixed methods study was to determine
whether instruction librarians in the United States and Canada were using ID methods,
and to identify potential explanations for their adoption or rejection of those methods.
The theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1985) guided the inquiry at both the
quantitative and qualitative levels. A survey was used to collect information about
respondents’ behavioral, normative, and control beliefs, their intention to adopt ID
methods, and their subsequent adoption or rejection of those methods of those methods.
The reasons for respondents’ adoption or rejection of ID methods in creating IL
instruction were explored using qualitative interviews. Both quantitative and qualitative

9
data were collected and converged in an attempt to gain a broader understanding of the
problem than either type of data alone could provide.
Definition of Terms
This section provides definitions for various terms used in the study.
Behavioral beliefs. According to the TPB, behavioral beliefs, defined as the
perception of the consequences of a behavior, are one of three factors (along with
normative and control beliefs) that determine one’s intention to perform a behavior
(Ajzen, 2006; Ajzen, 2012).
Bibliographic instruction. The teaching of library practices and procedures to
users. This may include instruction in the use of library catalogs, periodical indexes,
reference works, electronic resources, and various finding aids. The practice of IL
instruction has largely superseded that of bibliographic instruction.
Control beliefs. According to the TPB, control beliefs, defined as “the perceived
presence of factors that may facilitate or impede performance of a behavior” (Ajzen,
2006, Control Beliefs section, para. 1), are one of three factors (along with behavioral and
normative beliefs) that determine one’s intention to perform a behavior (Ajzen, 2012).
Course management system (CMS). A software based virtual classroom
environment that provides interaction between and among faculty and students. It allows
students to access various communication tools such as email, discussion boards, wikis,
gradebooks, blogs, and video and audio conferencing.
Digital learning object (DLO). The definition provided by Mestre et al. (2011)
of digital learning objects as “reusable instructional resource[s], usually digital and Webbased, developed to support learning,” will be adopted for this study.

10
Information literacy (IL). The ability to “recognize when information is needed
and . . . to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information” (American
Library Association, 1989). Unlike bibliographic instruction, which is skills-focused, IL
addresses the process of finding, interpreting, evaluating, and using information (Koneru,
2010).
Information literacy instruction. Any formal instructional activity related
specifically to IL, as defined above.
Instruction librarian. Any librarian who has responsibility for teaching IL in a
classroom setting. This may include individuals who have instruction as their primary job
responsibility, or those with only occasional teaching duties.
Instructional design (ID). A systematic process for the analysis and
improvement of problems in learning and performance, characterized by the
identification, selection, implementation, evaluation, and management of solutions to
those problems. This process may involve the use of strategies, models, methods, or
principles that are based on one or more design theories and used to organize instruction
(Reiser & Dempsey, 2011; Richey, Klein, & Tracey, 2010; Rothwell & Kazanas, 2011).
Instructional design model. The study will adopt Gustafson and Branch’s (2002)
definition of ID models “as conceptual, management, and communication tools for
analyzing, designing, creating, and evaluating guided learning, ranging from broad
educational environments to narrow training applications” (p. xv).
Instructional design theory. The study will use Reigeluth’s (1999) definition of
ID theories as those “that [offer] explicit guidance on how to better help people learn and
develop. The kinds of learning and development may include cognitive, emotional,

11
social, physical, and spiritual” (p. 5).
Library instruction. An umbrella term that will be used to refer to all formal
instructional activities in libraries, including IL instruction or bibliographic instruction.
The term will not be used to refer to point-of-use instruction, such as that received at a
library reference desk.
Normative beliefs. According to the TPB, normative beliefs, defined as the
perception of others’ approval or disapproval of a behavior, are one of three factors
(along with behavioral and control beliefs) that determine one’s intention to perform a
behavior (Ajzen, 2006; Ajzen, 2012).
Summary
American academic librarians have been teaching library skills to users for nearly
200 years. In the 20th century, the practice of bibliographic instruction, which
emphasized teaching practical research techniques to users, was gradually replaced with
IL instruction, which focused not only on locating information but applying it to solve
problems. Whereas bibliographic instruction had often been conducted on an informal, ad
hoc basis, librarians found that IL instruction, which is more process oriented and seeks
to develop critical thinking skills, required an approach informed by relevant learning
theories.
ID theories prescribe specific ways to design effective instructional interventions,
and seem an obvious choice of tools for librarians who endeavor to create IL instruction.
Nevertheless, no empirical studies have yet been undertaken to determine whether
librarians use ID methods. This study attempted to determine whether or not ID methods
were actually being used to create IL instruction. A mixed methods approach was used to

12
investigate the problem, since it combines the strength of both quantitative and
qualitative methods. The study should be of interest to anyone involved in providing IL
instruction to students in higher education settings. The purpose of this sequential
explanatory mixed methods study, which was to determine whether instruction librarians
in the United States and Canada were using ID methods and to identify potential
explanations for their adoption or rejection of those methods, was described and
elaborated. Terms used in the study were defined and clarified.

13
Chapter 2: Literature Review
Chapter 1 presented the research problem to be addressed in this study. Chapter 2
examines literature related to the topic. The chapter is divided into six sections. The first
section presents the theoretical framework that will guide the inquiry. Subsequent
sections describe how instruction librarians have used ID theories and models; explore
the ways in which instruction librarians have collaborated with instructional designers,
faculty members, and others to achieve well designed instruction; describe how ID has
been used in IL instruction; discuss prior research and how it relates to the present study;
and define the research questions.
Theoretical Framework
The TPB (Ajzen, 1985) served as the theoretical framework for this study. The
TPB, an extension of the theory of reasoned action (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Fishbein &
Ajzen, 1975), was designed to improve upon the ability of the theory of reasoned action
to predict behavioral intention. According to Ajzen (2012), the theory of reasoned action
held that one’s intention to perform a behavior is determined by two factors: behavioral
beliefs, or the perception of the consequences of the behavior, and normative beliefs, the
perception of others’ approval or disapproval of the behavior. The TPB extended this
framework by adding the dimension of control beliefs, “the perceived presence of factors
that may facilitate or impede performance of a behavior” (Ajzen, 2006, Control Beliefs
section, para. 1).
According to the TPB, behavioral beliefs are the basis for one’s attitude about a
behavior. Attitude is defined as “the degree to which performance of the behavior is
positively or negatively valued” (Ajzen, 2006, Attitude Toward the Behavior section,

para. 1). Normative beliefs give rise to an individual’s concept of a subjective norm,
which is “the perceived social pressure to engage or not to engage in a behavior” (Ajzen,
2006, Subjective Norm section, para. 1). Perceived behavioral control, or a person’s
beliefs about his or her ability to succeed at a behavior, is based upon control beliefs.
Together, these factors determine one’s intention to perform a behavior. Intention is
considered to be a strong predictor of behavior, but only to the extent that one is actually
able to perform the specific behavior in question (Ajzen, 1991). The figure below
graphically illustrates this process of the formation of behavioral intention and ultimate
performance of the behavior.

The theory is an appropriate framework for the present study because its power to
predict intention and behavior furthers the study’s purpose of exploring the reasons that
instruction librarians adopt or reject ID methods in creating IL instruction. Sutton’s
(2007) overview of seven meta-analyses of observational studies of the TPB (Ajzen,
1991; Albarracín, Johnson, Fishbein, & Muellerleile, 2001; Armitage & Conner, 2001;
Godin & Kok, 1996; Hagger, Chatzisarantis, & Biddle, 2002; Sheeran & Taylor, 1999;

15
Trafimow, Sheeran, Conner, & Finlay, 2002) confirmed that the theory was effective in
predicting both intention and behavior; multiple correlations for the former ranged from
0.59 to 0.71, and from 0.51 to 0.59 for the latter. This would explain between 35% and
50% of the variance for intention, and between 26% and 35% of the variance for
behavior.
One of the strengths of the TPB lies in the fact that it is a general theory that can
be applied in numerous situations without modification (Sutton, 2007). Indeed, the theory
has been used to predict behavior in such diverse arenas as health practices, energy
consumption, and use of public transportation (Ajzen, 2012), leisure choice (Ajzen &
Driver, 1992), consumer adoption of electronic commerce (Pavlou & Fygenson, 2006),
and honesty (Beck & Ajzen, 1991). Nevertheless, further extensions of the TPB have
been proposed; it has been suggested that the dimension of self-identity, among others
(Conner & Armitage, 1998; Masser, Bednall, White, & Terry, 2012; Rise, Sheeran, &
Hukkelberg, 2010), be added to the model to increase its predictive power. One aspect of
self-identity, that of professional identity, is of interest to this study; it is therefore
tempting to modify the theory for the purposes of the study to include the construct of
self-identity, as some researchers have done (Masser et al., 2012). However, rather than
modifying the theory by adding a further construct as a predictor of intention and
behavior, self-identity will be subsumed under attitude, as suggested by Rise et al.
(2010); doing so preserves the parsimony and the theoretical coherence of the TPB
(Sutton, 2007).
Instruction Librarians’ Use of Instructional Design Theories and Models
Many benefits are to be derived from instruction that is designed systematically.

16
ID takes learners’ needs into account and imparts goals to instruction, thereby
encouraging learner engagement and improving classroom performance (A. L. Davis,
2013). Still, many librarians lack training and experience in ID (Colborn, 2011; A. L.
Davis, 2013; Hensley, 2015; Summey & Valenti, 2013), and despite the fact that
professional organizations have called for ID training (ACRL, Instruction Section
Research and Scholarship Committee, 2013; ACRL, 2008), many library directors fail to
perceive its importance. For instance, Shank and Dewald (2012) described a study in
which library directors rated the importance of four sets of instructional skills. Two of
these—teaching and presentation—were more traditional, while the other two—
educational technology and ID—were considered less so. The directors rated each skill
set on a 4-point scale, from 1 (least important) to 4 (most important). Over 50% of the
respondents rated teaching as the most important skill; the mean score for this item was
3.19. Presentation skills were rated second in importance (M = 2.84), followed by
educational technology (M = 2.25) and ID (M = 1.98). Perhaps it is not surprising, then,
that so few librarians have training in ID methods. Nevertheless, the literature does
reflect an attempt on the part of librarians to use ID theories and models to structure
lessons. The following subsections will describe how they have gone about doing so.
Theories. ID theories differ from other types of theories in some very important
ways. In contrast to formal scientific theories, which are descriptive and predictive
(Hawking & Mlodinow, 2008), ID theories are prescriptive; that is, they prescribe the
best way to achieve instructional goals in different situations, rather than describing or
predicting how learning will occur (Morrison, Ross, Kemp, & Kalman, 2012). As
Reigeluth and Carr-Chellman (2009) put it, an ID theory “assists in the creation of

17
something, while descriptive theory seeks to describe what already exists” (p. 7). For
instance, Hawking and Mlodinow (2008) cited Newton’s general theory of gravitation as
an example of a formal scientific theory. This theory, based on the three laws of motion,
allowed Newton to describe and to predict the movement of heavenly bodies, the tides,
and other phenomena (Hawking & Mlodinow, 2008; “Newton, Sir Isaac (1642–1727),”
2002). A design theory, on the other hand, is “intended to provide direct guidance to
practitioners about what methods to use to attain different goals” (Reigeluth, 1999, p. 8)
rather than describing or predicting phenomena. Learning theories are classified as
descriptive theories, rather than design theories; although the latter are in many ways
more useful than the former in designing instruction, only one recent article (Rand, 2013)
discussed the use of ID theories in any depth. Learning theories, however, earned
mention in several articles (Blummer, Kenton, & Song, 2010; Bobish, 2011; Stiwinter,
2013).
Even though constructivism has replaced behaviorism as the dominant learning
theory (Ertmer & Newby, 2013), many instructors still used the techniques of the latter in
their lessons (Blummer et al., 2010; Bobish, 2011; Stiwinter, 2013). Behavioral theory is
characterized by an emphasis on providing a stimulus to a learner to elicit a response;
learning is considered to have occurred when the appropriate response follows a
particular stimulus (Colborn, 2011; Ertmer & Newby, 2013). The relationship of learners
to the environment is seen as reactive rather than active; that is, they are thought to react
to elements in the environment instead of actively engaging and discovering it (Ertmer &
Newby, 2013; Willis, 2011a). Table 1 lists certain assumptions and principles of
behaviorist theory in the first column, followed by possible ID applications of that

18
assumption or principle in the second column.

Instructional Design Perspective,” by P. A. Ertmer and T. J. Newby, 2013, Performance Improvement
Quarterly, 26(2), pp. 49-50.

Blummer et al. (2010) used various behaviorist interventions in a face-to-face
instruction session with graduate students in education. They relied on the use of
behavioral objectives, steps, practice, and informative feedback to encourage the
development of IL skills. For example, in one exercise students were given the objective
of obtaining a book through ILLiad, the interlibrary loan system. They were provided
with the steps required to create an ILLiad account and to order materials, and given an
opportunity to practice doing so. Stiwinter’s (2013) online tutorial used software
simulations to teach students how to navigate various web sites and database interfaces;
this was seen as an application of both behaviorist and cognitive theories, since students
were afforded the opportunity to experiment and practice but also had to “use cognitive

19
theory to look at the screen, analyze possible solutions to the task, and then act” (p. 23).
Both Blummer et al. (2010) and Bobish (2011) emphasized that behavioral techniques
could be used to reinforce learning outcomes related to the ACRL’s Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (ACRL, 2000). Bobish pointed out that the
outcomes of the Standards “provide instructors with an array of measurable behaviors
which can be reinforced as appropriate” (p. 55). Bobish then gave the example of
Standard 2, Indicator 5, Outcome (d): “Records all pertinent citation information for
future reference” (ACRL, 2000, p. 11), which could be measured by examining students’
citations and reinforced with a grade.
Constructivism, too, is often invoked when designing IL instruction (Blummer et
al., 2010; Bobish, 2011; Colborn, 2011; Koneru, 2010; Rand, 2013; Willis, 2011b).
Blummer et al. (2010) explained that “constructivists view learning as constructed by the
learner through a reconciliation of present experience with prior knowledge” (p. 231). In
distinguishing cognitivists from constructivists, Ertmer and Newby (2013) stated that for
the former, the mind was something of a “reference tool to the real world,” (p. 55), while
for the latter, it was more like an instrument that receives and filters sense impressions
and constructs a map of reality from them. Ertmer and Newby go on to say that “learners
do not transfer knowledge from the external world into their memories; rather they build
personal interpretations of the world based on individual experiences and interactions” (p.
55).
Given the typical characteristics of adult learners—a tendency to be self-directed,
possession of prior experience, a desire to apply knowledge in authentic contexts, and the
wish to learn practical problem solving skills—constructivist learning theory is

20
particularly well suited to adult education (Blummer et al., 2010). As Koneru (2010)
stated, “constructivist learning enables the learner [to] co-construct meaning by exploring
an environment, solving a problem, or applying information to a new situation that he/she
helps to define” (p. 26). Table 2 lists certain assumptions and principles of constructivist
theory in the first column, followed by possible ID applications of that assumption or
principle in the second column.

Instructional Design Perspective,” by P. A. Ertmer and T. J. Newby, 2013, Performance Improvement
Quarterly, 26(2), p. 58.

In the literature on IL, constructivism is often discussed in the context of the uses
of Web 2.0 technologies. Magnuson (2013) named several characteristics of these
technologies that make them particularly useful in furthering processes central to

21
constructivist pedagogy. In Web 2.0 applications, users are both producers and
consumers of the product, a dynamic which drives the “participatory culture” (p. 244)
associated with them. Also, the technologies lend themselves well to “harnessing the
collective intelligence” (p. 244) of their participants. Finally, the nature of the
technologies encourages users to reuse, and possibly to transform, artifacts contributed by
others.
Bobish (2011) described how social media can further the learning outcomes of
the ACRL’s Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (ACRL,
2000). Bobish contended that these media support constructivist learning environments
mainly because they enable collaboration. Further, a successful constructivist learning
intervention requires the following elements: “complex and challenging learning
environments, social negotiation and shared responsibility, multiple representations of
content, the understanding that knowledge is constructed, [and] student-centered
instruction” (p.55). According to Bobish, the fact that Web 2.0 technologies bring
together content created by multiple users renders them inherently complex and
challenging. Social negotiation abilities are required for cooperation on wiki-based
assignments, and such tools as YouTube and Flickr provide multiple representations of
content that users must learn how to use ethically and effectively for academic purposes.
Wikis are also an ideal vehicle for demonstrating that knowledge is socially constructed,
since they bring users together to construct, literally, an artifact of knowledge. The notion
of social construction is further enhanced by other technologies, such as blogs; “by
viewing a blog posting on a topic and the ensuing stream of comments, students can
examine how a final consensus was or was not reached on [a] question” (p. 56). Finally,

22
Bobish notes, “the very fact that students can participate in the construction of knowledge
in their subject area rather than simply receiving accepted knowledge from the instructor
is student-centered” (p. 56).
Not all Web 2.0 technologies were found to enhance participation in constructivist
learning environments, however. Magnuson (2012) found that the applications she
examined could, depending on the situation, either help or hinder students in this regard.
To the extent that they assisted students in collaborating and harnessing their collective
intelligence, these tools were found to further the ends of constructivist instruction. For
example, students created a wiki in PBworks (an online collaboration tool) with very
little input from the instructor. Magnuson (2012) noted that this was “an example of the
progression from knowledge being something that was previously held by the specialist
(me, the instructor) to a knowledge space were everyone must learn and contribute” (p.
139). On the other hand, the fact that each application was separate and did not
interconnect with the others made it difficult for students to see others’ contributions as a
whole; this served as a hindrance to collaboration. Magnuson (2012) also noted that the
cognitive load placed on participants by the use of so many different technologies
became too much for many of them at some point, and that learning how to use the tools
took away from other class activities.
An example of an initiative whose design draws upon several different learning
theories is Stiwinter’s (2013) interactive online library tutorial, which was created to
impart basic information about the research process to students in multiple sections of an
introductory English course (N = 485). The author used various theories of learning to
inform the design of the tutorial, which integrated behavioral, cognitive, and humanistic

23
approaches. Interactive software simulations of such tools as periodical databases, the
online public access catalog, and the library web site formed a large part of the tutorial.
These simulations shared both the behavioral emphasis on structured kinesthetic learning,
and the value that cognitive learning theory places on analysis, the search for solutions,
and action. The interactive nature of the tutorial forced students to stay engaged in the
learning process, since the simulations would not move forward without feedback from
the participant. Consistent with humanistic theory, the author also strove to “make the
tutorial an extension of the friendly and unintimidating help they receive from library
staff” (Stiwinter, 2013, p. 23) by building in responsiveness to student input and
providing an informal narrative tone.
Various modules of Stiwinter’s (2013) tutorial were created as Adobe Captivate
videos, Prezi presentations, or static web pages. The decision about which media to use
was based on the complexity of the module, the most basic modules using the static web
pages and the most complex using Captivate. This allowed the researcher to study the
effectiveness of these platforms for teaching. The tutorial was incorporated into the class
as a graded assignment, worth 5% of the final course grade. Three slightly different
versions of the tutorial were created to discourage cheating.
Two main outcomes were assessed in Stiwinter’s (2013) quasi-experimental
study: the extent to which (a) the tutorial was self-sufficient (that is, able to be completed
without staff intervention), and (b) student scores improved from pretest to posttest. The
first outcome was assessed by a voluntary student feedback survey and analysis of usage
statistics, and the second by an examination of pretest and posttest results. Of the 39
students (8%) who returned the student feedback survey, 82% indicated that they found

24
the tutorial easy to understand. An analysis of usage statistics revealed that 465 students
(96%) were able to complete both the pretest and the posttest without staff intervention.
Thus, according to Stiwinter (2013), “the goal for self-sufficiency was effective, which
the author attributed to the careful design of the tutorial” (p. 31).
Participants scored an average of 21 points better on the posttest than on the
pretest, indicating a high level of student learning. The author noted that the questions
covering modules created using Captivate showed the most improvement, while those
constructed with Prezi were somewhat less improved. The author attributed this
difference to the fact that the Captivate modules required much more interaction than the
Prezi modules, and that it was the interactivity in the design that increased student
learning. Posttest questions involving the modules created as static web pages, which
provided less interactivity than either the Captivate or Prezi modules, showed even less
improvement.
One module, which consisted of a Cooperative Library Instruction Project video,
fared worst of all in posttest evaluation. The module had initially taken the form of a
static web page, and pilot participants scored poorly on the evaluation; the author
assumed that study participants would benefit from a more detailed product. While the
content of the video was much richer than that of the static web pages, the posttest scores
for the study participants were just as dismal as those of the pilot participants. The author
postulated that, in the absence of anything to hold participants’ attention, they might have
simply skipped both versions of the module. In any case, she concluded, retention was
low because neither version required participants to apply their learning in the tutorial.
At first glance, Stiwinter’s (2013) research might resemble a media comparison

25
study, in which case it would be tempting to dismiss it entirely. But rather than studying
the effects of the particular technologies used to create the modules, the author evaluated
the interactivity, or lack thereof, inherent in the design of each module and its effect on
the learning of the participants. Nevertheless, one wonders whether at least some of the
improvement in scores for modules that used Captivate is not at least partly attributable to
the novelty effect. The author tacitly acknowledged this when she discussed lack of
engagement as a potential reason that students apparently disregarded the video.
Stiwinter’s (2013) methodology is problematic in some respects. There were three
different versions of the tutorial, which necessitated three different posttests. As Stiwinter
pointed out, one of the versions had significantly higher scores (between 23% and 36%)
than the other two. Additionally, the same test was used as both pretest and posttest for
each group of participants, which exposed the research to threats to validity due to the
testing effect. Finally, the feedback survey was returned by a mere 8% of the students
who completed the tutorial, which was a less than adequate response rate.
Models. Ryder (2013) provided an apt description of models. According to
Ryder,
models, like myths and metaphors, help us to make sense of our world. . . . A
model offers its user a means of comprehending an otherwise incomprehensible
problem. An instructional design model gives structure and meaning to an I.D.
problem, enabling the would-be designer to negotiate her design task with a
semblance of conscious understanding. Models help us to visualize the problem,
to break it down into discrete, manageable units. (para. 1)
The ID model mentioned most frequently in the literature was ADDIE, an
acronym for its five phases: analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate (Booth,
2011; Chang & Siao, 2012; Colborn, 2011; A. L. Davis, 2013; B. E. Fox & Doherty,
2011; Koneru, 2010; Kumar, Ochoa, & Edwards, 2012; Stern & Kaur, 2010; Summey &

26
Valenti, 2013; Willis, 2011a, 2011b). ADDIE is not a formal model of ID, but is rather a
description of the structure common to many such models (Summey & Valenti, 2013).
As A. L. Davis (2013) put it, ADDIE “is a strategic plan for course design and may serve
as a blueprint to design IL assignments and various other instructional activities” (p.
205).
Two authors examined ADDIE in detail and offered examples of how librarians
could use it to accomplish various design tasks. Koneru (2010) analyzed the phases and
their associated steps, and described how the model could be used to construct what she
termed “web-enabled information literacy instruction modules” (p. 23). Summey and
Valenti (2013) related the phases to components of more formal models, such as those of
Morrison, Ross, Kemp, and Kalman (2012), and Dick, Carey, and Carey (2009). A. L.
Davis (2013) and Chang and Siao (2012) followed brief considerations of the model with
accounts of using it to structure course-integrated instruction and DLOs, respectively. B.
E. Fox and Doherty (2011) called ADDIE a backward design model, noting that the steps
in ADDIE correspond to those of backward design. Mestre et al. (2011) mentioned
Wiggins and McTighe’s (2008) understanding by design model, based on backward
design, in the context of creating DLOs.
Koneru (2010), Summey and Valenti (2013), and Chang and Siao (2012) each
emphasized the cyclical nature of ADDIE, which allows for continual assessment and
improvement of instruction, and stressed that the model is appropriate for the creation of
instruction in a variety of formats. Some of these included 50 minute sessions scheduled
during regular class sessions (A. L. Davis, 2013), web tutorials (Chang & Siao, 2012;
Koneru, 2010; Summey & Valenti, 2013), library guides (Summey & Valenti, 2013), and

27
credit-bearing courses (Summey & Valenti, 2013).
Interestingly, there exists an adaptation of ADDIE specific to libraries known as
BLAAM, an acronym for blended librarian adapted ADDIE model (Bell & Shank, 2007;
Booth, 2011; Summey & Valenti, 2013). This simplified model is less comprehensive
than ADDIE, and was designed for librarians with few ID skills. It involves a much
abbreviated process of assessing instructional needs, creating learning objectives,
developing activities, delivering instruction, and measuring outcomes (Bell & Shank,
2007). In creating it, Bell and Shank (2007) hoped to extend some of the benefits of ID to
libraries that did not have the resources for full ID initiatives. Another ID model designed
specifically for libraries is IDEA, an acronym for interview, design, embed, and assess,
the major steps in the model (Mullins, 2014). The interview stage involves analyzing the
syllabus and interviewing the instructor to gain an overview of the course, followed by
identification of IL goals in the design stage, then embedding IL content into the course
and assessing the effectiveness of the design.
Other, more formal models received scant attention in the literature. Summey and
Valenti (2013), as mentioned above, discussed the Morrison, Ross, Kemp, and Kalman
(2012) and Dick, Carey, and Carey (2009) models in the context of the ADDIE phases,
and recommended the ARCS model (Keller, 2010) for development of materials. Mestre
et al. (2011) stated that the Dick, Carey, and Carey model was particularly suited to the
development of DLOs. Colborn (2011) briefly mentioned Gagné’s (2007) nine events of
instruction as a way to structure IL instruction, and discussed Merrill’s (2002) attempts to
discern principles underlying ID theories. Colborn pointed out that Merrill’s first
principles of instruction were consistent with constructivist notions of the ideal learning

28
environment. According to Colborn, Merrill’s principles were drawn largely from
constructivist theory, while Gagné’s nine events represented principles underlying
cognitive theory. The seven principles for good practice in undergraduate education
(Chickering & Gamson, 1987) include principles that somewhat overlap those of Gagné
and Merrill, but also address the affective aspects of learning, such as motivation,
learning styles, and relationships between teacher and learner.
Rand (2013) based her model of ID for IL instruction in distance education on
Merrill’s principles and on Reigeluth’s elaboration theory (Reigeluth, Merrill, Wilson, &
Spiller, 1980). Kumar et al. (2012), in the introduction to their needs assessment of online
doctoral students, simply noted that the analysis phase is the first step in several ID
models, including Morrison, Ross, Kemp, and Kalman (2012), ASSURE (Smaldino,
Lowther, & Russell, 2008), Dick, Carey, and Carey (2009), and ADDIE.
The needs assessment performed by Kumar et al. (2012) was the only empirical
study identified that related to a particular phase of the instructional systems design
process. Two cohorts of online doctoral students (N = 49), one entering a teacher
education program (group A) and the other beginning a program in educational
technology (group B) were examined. The researchers distributed a survey to both groups
of students to gauge their experience with library instruction, database use, searching,
evaluation of resources, citation of resources, and online instruction generally. Affective
questions measured the students’ levels of anxiety and sense of confidence in the library
environment.
Fifty percent of the students in group A (n = 26) completed the survey, as did
91% of the students in group B (n = 23). On examination of the results, stark differences

29
between the groups emerged. For instance, none of the respondents from group A rated
themselves as “very experienced” in using library resources, whereas six, or 17%, of the
group B respondents did; these numbers were identical for the question about the use of
databases and the library catalog.
Group B was consistently more aware of the existence of various databases (six
periodical databases, the library catalog, WorldCat, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,
Social Sciences Citation Index, Web of Science, Google and Google Scholar) than group
A, and tended to use these databases more regularly; the only exceptions were the ERIC,
Education Full Text, and JSTOR databases. Group A respondents were on average 6.6%
more aware of the existence of ERIC, 37% more aware of Education Full Text, and
17.6% more aware of JSTOR than group B. Group A used ERIC 1.7% fewer times than
group B respondents, but used Education Full Text 35% more, and JSTOR 23.3% more.
Further, group A reported less confidence using databases and catalogs, and more anxiety
when performing searches. They rated themselves nearly 50% less able to evaluate the
quality of resources than group B, and only 25% as capable of citing resources correctly
as their group B counterparts.
Kumar et al. (2012) concluded that the differences between the groups’ levels of
IL skills as measured by the survey revealed the necessity of conducting needs
assessments at the group or cohort level as a first step in creating library instruction. This
is particularly important in the online environment, given the problems posed by
transactional distance; specifically, the inability of the librarian to adjust instruction to fit
the needs of a group or individual spontaneously, as is often done in a face-to-face
setting. The findings underscored the importance of analyzing the needs of learners,

30
which was also articulated by Stern and Kaur (2010), Summey and Valenti (2013), and
Koneru (2010).
Two methodological problems were apparent in the study conducted by Kumar et
al. (2012). First, the small sample size (N = 49) made it difficult to generalize the results.
Second, the research relied upon respondents’ self-evaluation of skills, and such data is
notoriously unreliable (Gross & Latham, 2012). The authors acknowledged these
limitations, and argued in the second case that students entering a doctoral program
would be more likely to understand their strengths and their limitations, and thus their
self-assessments were more likely to be accurate.
Instruction Librarians’ Collaborative Work to Design Instruction
One of the ways in which librarians, as subject matter experts, can create an
effectively designed product is by forming partnerships with experts in ID. There exist a
substantial number of articles which describe and endorse such partnerships (Clapp,
Johnson, Schwieder, & Craig, 2013; Lo & Dale, 2009; Shell, Crawford, & Harris, 2013;
Stiwinter, 2013). In his discussion of ID in academic libraries, R. Fox (2013) underscored
how important such partnerships could be to the quality of the instruction, noting that
instructional designers were perhaps better equipped than librarians themselves to “assist
the library in catering their pedagogical methods to the needs of the students and faculty
they serve” (p. 9).
Instructional designers can interface with librarians in a number of ways. A
campus ID department can assign a liaison to the library on a permanent (McMillan,
2011) or a temporary (Clapp et al., 2013; Thornes, 2012) basis. An instructional designer
may be hired directly by the library to work with its librarians; in one instance, such an

31
individual identified both as a librarian and a designer (Lo & Dale, 2009). Also, the roles
assumed by instructional designers in libraries can vary substantially. Often, librarians
make full use of designers’ capabilities, allowing them to provide “creative ways of
teaching the content online” (West-Pawl, 2012, p. 8). Shell et al. (2013), for example,
described a scenario in which the designer was “responsible for ensuring that a sound
instructional strategy based on learning theories and best practices [was] used for the
design” of the product. The designer collaborated with faculty and librarians to create
DLOs for an online course, met with the faculty member to formulate student learning
outcomes, and ensured that the DLOs were appropriately integrated into the CMS. At
other times, designers are relegated to merely technical roles; they may edit video footage
(Clapp et al., 2013), provide software support (Stiwinter, 2013; Thornes, 2012), or simply
implement the librarian’s own design in the technical environment (Clapp et al., 2013).
Collaboration with faculty was one factor that several authors identified as vital to
the success of an instructional initiative (DaCosta, 2010; Lo & Dale, 2009; Stiwinter,
2013; Stowe, 2011; Strittmatter, 2012). Lo and Dale (2009) stated bluntly that
“incorporating Information Literacy into the curriculum requires the cooperation of
teaching faculty” (p. 152). Stiwinter (2013) suggested that this insistence on faculty
support for IL instruction stemmed from a rather large body of literature showing that
online tutorials that were graded, or were otherwise required components of courses,
were more effective than those that were not. Despite the proven utility of partnerships
between librarians and faculty, however, barriers to their formation often exist. Many
faculty question the idea that librarians should have a teaching role, and thus may not
accept them as partners in instructional endeavors; they may believe that students are

32
already information literate and thus fail to understand the value of IL instruction; they
may also perceive that the time devoted to IL instruction could be better spent on
disciplinary content (DaCosta, 2010; E. L. Davis, Lundstrom, & Martin, 2011; Oakleaf,
Millet, & Kraus, 2011; Shell et al., 2013). Further, both the librarian and the faculty
member may lack expertise in designing instruction.
Collaborations between librarians and faculty, like those between designers and
librarians, can take several forms. Held (2010) discussed working with a faculty member
to build content in a CMS. While faculty could simply have embedded preexisting DLOs
into the CMS themselves, a collaborative approach was shown to result in more
personalized and relevant products that enhanced student learning. Other options for
providing IL instruction within CMSs included librarians setting up their own courses
within the system; a fully integrated approach in which library instruction was not a
separate unit but was taught concurrently with course assignments; and inclusion of a
forum which was monitored by librarians (Held, 2010; Mestre et al., 2011).
The above initiatives reflect a distinct division of labor between the librarian and
the faculty member, with the former firmly in charge of the IL instruction component. In
other situations, faculty share some of the responsibility for IL instruction with librarians.
Oakleaf et al. (2011) stressed collaborative IL instruction, with instructors as well as
librarians teaching IL concepts. As part of a Quality Enhancement Plan, IL was to be
infused into the curriculum of the institution where Oakleaf et al. were based. In this case,
collaboration took the form of workshops for faculty on teaching IL skills in the
classroom and the development of rubrics to measure students’ grasp of the associated
concepts. According to Stowe (2011), faculty and librarians share responsibility for

33
interweaving library instruction into course content; that is, both must contribute to the
design of instruction so that it conveys both disciplinary content and the IL skills
necessary to research that content. Stowe emphasized that it was “incumbent on teaching
faculty to stress not only the importance of course-related library instruction but also to
motivate students towards maximizing their opportunities to acquire and expand their
individual library research skills” (p. 83).
In addition to the bilateral collaborations described above, many ID initiatives
take a team approach, in which faculty, librarians, designers and others work together to
create instruction; the convergence of disciplinary viewpoints is typically seen as
strengthening the design of instructional products (B. E. Fox & Doherty, 2011). Roles
that team members may take on in these situations include the following: faculty course
coordinators (Clapp et al., 2013; B. E. Fox & Doherty, 2011; Shell et al., 2013); editors
(West-Pawl, 2012); embedded librarians (Shell et al., 2013); graphic designers (B. E. Fox
& Doherty, 2011; Koneru, 2010); librarians working together in a team (B. E. Fox &
Doherty, 2011; Koneru, 2010); instructional designers (Clapp et al., 2013; B. E. Fox &
Doherty, 2011; Koneru, 2010; Shell et al., 2013; West-Pawl, 2012); instructional
technologists or technicians (Clapp et al., 2013; Koneru, 2010; Shell et al., 2013;
Thornes, 2012); multimedia producers (Koneru, 2010; Shell et al., 2013); subject matter
experts (Clapp et al., 2013; Koneru, 2010; West-Pawl, 2012); and content authors or
developers (Koneru, 2010).
Koneru (2010), in laying out specific directions for the use of ADDIE to create
library instruction, stated that the creation of materials in the development phase required
a team approach; at this stage, librarians should collaborate with “instructional

34
designer[s], subject matter expert[s], . . . content author[s]/developer[s],
programmer[s]/developer[s], [and] graphic designer[s]/media producer[s]” (pp. 30-31).
The team convened by Shell et al. (2013) combined a subject librarian with an
instructional designer and a faculty member. These three individuals created DLOs that
could be reused for multiple courses and easily embedded in a CMS. The DLOs proved
successful in improving student learning, a result that was partly attributed to successful
collaboration that led to a “synergistic process that reduce[d] barriers and increase[d] the
likelihood of success” (p. 154). Not all teams, however, achieve this level of efficiency
and functionality. Clapp et al. (2013) described how an IL course was designed by a team
composed of three librarians and an instructional designer. Two of the librarians were
subject specialists, while the third served as the instructor for the course. The librarians
followed the procedure of designing the content of the course, which included “lectures,
PowerPoint presentations, assignments, readings, links to Websites, discussion board
questions, quizzes and exams, homework, . . . and final projects” (p. 250). This content
was subsequently provided to the instructional designer, whose role it was to transfer it to
the CMS. As noted earlier, this arrangement fails to take full advantage of the
instructional designer’s talents, and also places an undue workload on the librarians.
The most extensive study of a design team collaboration was that conducted by B.
E. Fox and Doherty (2011). An IL podcast for forestry students was created using
backward design, which the authors defined as simply determining student learning
outcomes, “then building the course or curriculum in ways that help the student achieve
these outcomes” (p. 145). The authors took Koneru’s dictum to heart in forming their
diverse, multidisciplinary team, which consisted of a group of librarians, the director of

35
the Master’s degree program in forestry, an instructional designer, and a graphic
designer.
The first step the team took was to meet with faculty to get a sense of the
students’ IL needs; it is not clear whether the students themselves were assessed. The
team designed the podcast by determining, based upon their combined expertise, what the
student learning outcomes should be; these outcomes were then aligned with the
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (ACRL, 2000). A
separate online assessment was created at this point, to be used by the instructor at his or
her discretion. Six modules were developed based on the student learning outcomes. The
design team chose the podcast as the delivery method, mainly due to the fact that
instruction in this medium could be downloaded onto a variety of devices and was
compatible with the university’s CMS.
B. E. Fox and Doherty (2011) discussed the experience of working with the team
to create the podcast. On the positive side, they noted that the interdisciplinary nature of
the team enriched the final product. One unexpected result of working with the director
of the forestry program was that IL became a student learning outcome at the program
level in the Forestry Department. The authors also mentioned a few elements of the
collaboration that, in retrospect, would have worked out better if they had been done
differently. A better organized workflow would have helped the team stay on track and
complete the project in a more timely manner. Student learning outcomes, they
discovered, should be as specific as possible. Also, assessment should be integrated into
the product from the beginning so that student comprehension can be determined.
Perhaps most importantly, the authors realized that more effort should have been spent

36
analyzing the needs of students.
Instructional Design in Information Literacy Instruction
Unsurprisingly, the literature contains a wealth of articles related to IL instruction,
and a few of these discuss the topic in the context of ID. A number of themes emerge
when examining this body of literature; in the previous five years, researchers have
concerned themselves with ID as it applies to the following four topics: the ACRL’s
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (ACRL, 2000),
student learning styles, embedded librarianship, and the use of DLOs. The sections below
will explore each of these themes in detail.
ACRL Standards. The ACRL’s Information Literacy Competency Standards for
Higher Education were published in 2000 as a tool for assessing an individual’s level of
IL competency. Each of the five standards is accompanied by a set of performance
indicators, which in turn are associated with various outcomes (ACRL, 2000). While they
were never intended to serve as a formal ID model, these standards, which draw upon
both behaviorist and constructivist principles (Bobish, 2011), are widely used as a
framework for creating IL instruction. Since these standards represent a broad consensus
among librarians for the types of skills that information literate individuals should have,
they are often used as a template for creating (Blummer et al., 2010; B. E. Fox &
Doherty, 2011; Gunn & Miree, 2012; Strittmatter, 2012) or revising (Anderson &
Mitchell, 2012) learning objectives. Despite this consensus, it should be noted that not
everyone agrees with the practice of using standards; Roberts and Taormina (2013)
cautioned that “when librarians try to follow codified IL standards, their instruction is
intrinsically stagnant” (p. 48).

37
The Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (ACRL,
2000) have been used to structure face-to-face instruction (Blummer et al., 2010;
Strittmatter, 2012), online tutorials (Anderson & Mitchell, 2012; Gunn & Miree, 2012),
podcasts (B. E. Fox & Doherty, 2011), and courses (Clapp et al., 2013). The online,
credit-bearing IL course designed by Clapp et al., for example, used the standards as a
course outline, with the five course units corresponding exactly to the five IL standards.
In one significant empirical study, the standards were used both to create an
online tutorial and to structure its assessment. Having noted that IL levels were not
significantly different between first- and final-year business students at Oakland
University in Michigan, Gunn and Miree (2012) conducted a study to explore the effect
of ID on two different factors. First, they sought to determine whether a single IL tutorial
would be beneficial to cohorts of students at different levels. Second, they sought to
determine whether this tutorial was equally as successful in teaching each of the ACRL
IL skills specified. The tutorial made use of active learning exercises and was delivered
in the form of a video available online.
Gunn and Miree (2012) then developed a pretest and a posttest designed to
measure six different IL skills drawn from the ACRL standards: “identifying sources of
information,” “selecting methods and systems,” “constructing and implementing a
keyword strategy,” “retrieving full-text materials,” “extracting and managing
information,” and “evaluating sources of information” (pp. 24-26). Cohorts of first- and
final-year business students (n = 130 and n = 114, respectively) were given a pretest,
allowed to take the tutorial and work through the active learning exercises, then given a
posttest. Analysis of scores revealed that there was no statistically significant difference

38
between groups in terms of scores either on the pretest or the posttest. There was,
however, a statistically significant difference between pretest and posttest scores within
each group: The first-year students scored an average of 19 points better on the posttest
than the pretest, while the difference between pretest and posttest scores for the final-year
students averaged 19.4 points. The researchers concluded from these data that the tutorial
was beneficial to students at both the first- and final-year levels.
Learning styles. The ambivalence toward the concept of learning styles among
many librarians is perhaps best reflected in the title of one recent ALA conference
presentation: Learning styles: Fiction, nonfiction, or mystery? (Deitering, Booth,
Runyon, & Mestre, 2012). Even though professional library organizations such as the
ACRL Information Literacy Best Practices Committee (2012) have urged librarians to
consider student learning styles when designing IL instruction (Koneru, 2010; Sanderson,
2011), learning style theory has been widely criticized for having questionable theoretical
underpinnings (Dembo & Howard, 2007), and there is little evidence that commonly used
learning style inventories such as Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory (Kolb, 2013), the
Index of Learning Styles Questionnaire (Felder & Soloman, n. d.), or VARK (Fleming,
2001), are valid or reliable (Coffield, Moseley, Hall, & Ecclestone, 2004; Hawk & Shah,
2007; Pashler, McDaniel, Rohrer, & Bjork, 2008; Platsidou & Metallidou, 2009).
Nevertheless, many librarians still attempt to insure that their instruction appeals
to students who display different learning styles (Anderson & Mitchell, 2012; Koneru,
2010; Thornes, 2012). Koneru (2010) identified learning style as a cognitive
characteristic to be considered during learner analysis in the first phase of ADDIE.
Anderson and Mitchell (2012) argued that tutorial “content should appeal as much as

39
possible to all types of learners (i.e., visual, aural, kinesthetic)” (p. 153), and to that end,
tutorials should be interactive and incorporate multimedia. Thornes (2012) attempted to
accommodate these different types of learners by incorporating video, drag and drop
assignments, and online tests into her tutorial. Mestre et al. (2011), who studied the use of
DLOs in IL instruction, reported that several respondents to their survey indicated that a
DLO “must include multiple instructional options specifically designed to accommodate
various learning styles to promote learning for all students, regardless of format” (p. 248).
Universal design for learning is intended to benefit not only individuals with
varying learning styles, but also those with learning or physical disabilities. Zhong (2012)
described universal design for learning as an initiative to “design course instruction,
materials, and content to benefit people of all learning styles without adaption or
retrofitting” (p. 33). Universal design for learning asserts three guiding design principles:
1. Provide multiple means of representation (providing content in different modes
such as visual, graphic, or auditory);
2. Provide multiple means of action and expression (providing students with
multiple opportunities to demonstrate what they have learned); and
3. Provide multiple means of engagement (providing a variety of ways to involve
students in learning). (Zhong, 2012, p. 36)
Zhong (2012) gives examples of how these principles can be used to design or
modify IL instruction. Instead of using simple PowerPoint slides, instructors may use
more complex PowerPoint presentations that include audio, video, and notes. Doing so
provides multiple means of representation that can assist those challenged by hearing,
visual, or learning disabilities. Instructors may provide students with diverse means to
express themselves by assigning work in a variety of formats, such as papers, oral
presentations, and discussion postings within a CMS. Group activities, CMS discussion

40
boards, in-class assignments, and homework allow students to engage in different ways.
One study was conducted to determine the effect of learning styles on student
preferences for tutorial format. Mestre (2012) sought to determine whether a culturally
diverse sample of undergraduate (n = 15) and graduate (n = 6) students preferred
multimodal IL tutorials (which incorporate video, sound, and text) to those that consisted
simply of static web pages with screen captures. The students’ learning styles were
explored using the Index of Learning Styles Questionnaire (Felder & Soloman, n. d.) and
the VARK Questionnaire (Fleming, 2001) to determine whether or not they had an effect
on their preferences. Mestre formed four hypotheses based upon a review of literature
related to online tutorials:
1. Students, in general, will prefer going through tutorials created with
screencasting tools such as Camtasia or Captivate [i.e., multimodal tutorials] than
those that are static web pages with screen shots.
2. Students, in general, will be better able to recreate steps after going through
screencast tutorials that were created using multiple modes (such as video, audio,
text) than with only text and images.
3. Students who have a high visual or auditory learning style preference will
perform better after viewing a tutorial creat[ed] using screen casting software.
4. Students who have a high sequential learning preference will prefer the static
web page with step-by-step instructions and screen shots. (Mestre, 2012, p. 259)
The literature review suggested that most students would favor tutorials that
included video and sound as well as text, and that only those with sequential learning
styles would prefer static pages. Contrary to expectations, however, Mestre (2012) found
support only for the fourth hypothesis. Only three of the participants strongly preferred
the multimodal tutorial over the static one; two others mildly favored the multimodal
tutorial, but stated that they would probably refer to the static one if they wanted to

41
“figure out how to do something” (p. 270), which disproved hypothesis one. The second
hypothesis fared no better: 19 of the 21 participants were able to complete a posttest that
required them to recreate the research steps described in the static tutorial, while only six
were able to do so with the multimodal tutorial. Eleven of the participants had high visual
or auditory scores on the two inventories and were projected to perform better on posttest
after the multimodal tutorial, but eight of these actually did better on the posttest after
having viewed the static tutorial. This would seem to disprove the third hypothesis, but
the author noted that the static tutorial did indeed include visual information, which could
have had an uncontrolled positive effect on the visual learners. None of the participants
scored high on sequential learning measures, leaving the fourth hypothesis difficult to
test. Nevertheless, those with moderate scores on sequential learning measures performed
better on the posttest after the static tutorial, and this data at least partially supported the
fourth hypothesis.
Two criticisms can be made of Mestre’s (2012) study. First, the small sample size
makes it unlikely that the results could be generalized to a larger population. Second, the
validity and reliability of the instruments used is in question. The Index of Learning
Styles Questionnaire has been criticized for its weak internal consistency reliability
(Platsidou & Metallidou, 2009). Hawk and Shah (2007) pointed out that there is little
evidence of the validity or reliability of VARK beyond that presented by its authors.
Leite, Svinicki, and Shi (2010) provided preliminary evidence for the validity of VARK,
but cautioned that their conclusions were “not sufficient to support the use of the VARK
with research” (p. 336).
Embedded librarianship. Instructional strategy can be a major concern both in

42
distance education and in IL instruction. One innovation in implementing online courses
is the inclusion of an embedded librarian. As the embedded journalists for whom they are
named were inserted into military units (West-Pawl, 2012), embedded librarians are
integrated into the classroom environment. Also known as blended, course, or lurking
librarians (Shell et al., 2013), embedded librarians maintain a presence in the course,
typically through the use of the CMS, so that they can serve students at their point of
need (E. L. Davis et al., 2011). These librarians combine the skill sets of traditional
librarians, instructional designers, and information technologists to design and deliver IL
instruction online (Held, 2010; Shell et al., 2013; Summey & Valenti, 2013).
Researchers named several advantages to the embedded arrangement. Embedding
a librarian in a course contributes to the creation of “a cohesive and self-contained
learning environment” (Shell et al., 2013, p. 144), where all the resources needed for
success in a course are available (R. Fox, 2013; Held, 2010). Taking resources and
services directly to students was seen as particularly beneficial; Shell et al. (2013) pointed
out that direct interaction with a librarian was vital for online students, since they “tend to
not reach out beyond the course environment, even when doing so can preserve their
academic success” (p. 144). Additionally, working within a virtual classroom
environment was found to be conducive to the development of rapport with students
(Held, 2010; Shell et al., 2013), and was even reported to increase the likelihood that
those students would visit the physical library (West-Pawl, 2012).
There are several pitfalls that can derail the success of embedded librarians. While
many librarians may understand the use of ID methods in more traditional contexts, they
may be unaware that other considerations come into play when designing instruction for

43
distance learners (Shell et al., 2013). Shell et al. give the example of a librarian who
underestimated the time and design requirements for creating new web-based instruction
from existing paper materials. The term “shovelware” has been used to describe materials
originally prepared for face-to-face instruction that have been presented online with few
design changes, and librarians who lack online ID skills run the risk of creating such
uninspired presentations (Mestre et al., 2011; Shell et al., 2013). By the same token,
instructional designers may know little about matters that librarians take for granted, such
as searching skills or database layout (Held, 2010; Shell et al., 2013), and this, too, can
affect the quality of instruction.
CMSs themselves were the topic of several discussions. Held (2010) related the
technology to Vygotsky’s theories of zones of proximal development and scaffolding.
Held advanced the idea that the configuration of CMSs “‘scaffolds’ novices toward
[Vygotsky’s] higher zones by offering self-paced instruction, peer teaching opportunities,
and communication forums” (pp. 154-155). Several authors discussed the need for
librarians to have instructor rights in the CMS (Held, 2010; Mestre et al., 2011; Shell et
al., 2013). Shell et al. pointed out that a “librarian that is assigned a teaching role within
the [CMS] can post messages, respond to student concerns, . . . e-mail resources to
students, and view quiz results” (p. 144). Specific tools within the CMS that proved
particularly useful to embedded librarians were librarian blogs and web conferencing
programs such as Elluminate and Wimba (West-Pawl, 2012). Separate library course
shells, library tabs within the CMS, and pinned discussion board topics devoted to
information issues and monitored by a librarian can be effective; tutorials, tip sheets, and
simple pages with librarian contact information have also been mentioned (Held, 2010;

44
West-Pawl, 2012).
Digital learning objects. Much attention has been paid to the creation of DLOs in
the recent literature. Mestre et al. (2011) likened DLOs to LEGOs, the small plastic
building blocks that can be used to create an astonishing variety of larger objects. DLOs
are small blocks of discrete instruction that can be combined, taken apart, and
recombined to build various learning experiences. They can be used to “introduce
content, gauge prior knowledge, reinforce understanding, assess learning, save
development time, and personalize curriculum” (Mestre et al., 2011, p. 238). Four ID
models—ADDIE, Dick, Carey, and Carey (2009), understanding by design (Wiggins &
McTighe, 2008), and knowledge building theory (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2010)—were
identified in the literature as pertinent to the design of DLOs (Chang & Siao, 2012; B. E.
Fox & Doherty, 2011; Mestre et al., 2011).
DLOs are reusable, granular, independent of other objects, and durable in the
sense that they do not need frequent updating (Chang & Siao, 2012). They are also
interoperable, accessible, cost efficient, and time saving (Mestre, 2010). Using
preexisting DLOs can significantly cut the effort and development costs involved in
developing materials; both Chang and Siao (2012) and Lo and Dale (2009) used existing
DLOs in creating IL instruction. Held (2010) used preexisting DLOs available through a
campus based bank of learning objects, emphasizing that reuse was important because it
helped defray development costs. An example of the independence and durability of a
DLO was provided by B. E. Fox and Doherty (2011), who emphasized that their podcast
was platform independent in that it was designed to be downloaded to several different
types of devices, and it was durable in that the database modules were not interface

45
specific and thus did not have to be updated frequently.
DLOs can take many forms. Blogs, games, diagrams, images, animations,
cartoons, modules, narrated PowerPoint slides, photographs, podcasts, quizzes, research
guides, surveys, software simulations, web tutorials, and videos are common formats (Lo
& Dale, 2009; Mestre, 2010; Mestre et al., 2011; Strittmatter, 2012; Sult, Mery,
Blakiston, & Kline, 2013; Thornes, 2012). In their study of librarians’ use of DLOs,
Mestre et al. (2011) found that 35% of the respondents had created tutorials; of these,
11% made videos, 9% each wrote quizzes and research guides, and 8% favored
PowerPoint slides. Surveys scored 7% in popularity, blogs 6%, screencasts and podcasts
each came in at 4%, and only 2% of the respondents used wikis.
Although many of the claims made for the effectiveness of computer games as
teaching tools have been criticized (Bekebrede, Warmelink, & Mayer, 2011), games that
are well designed can serve as positive learning environments that promote student
engagement (Whitton, 2011). Markey, Leeder, and St. Jean (2011) described the creation
and implementation of a web-based IL game which they called BiblioBouts. The game
was intended to teach students how to cite sources, as well as how to judge their
authority, relevance, credibility, quality, and accuracy. Markey et al. found that the game
provided several benefits to players. It encouraged players to collaborate, and increased
their engagement with the course. Part of the game involved a contest to see who could
find the most relevant resources on a topic; citations to the resources were then submitted
to a shared database, which allowed the players access to a greater number of sources
than they could have located through their individual efforts. Also, the game was found to
sharpen players’ ability to discern the quality of information sources. The major

46
drawback noted was that some aspects of the game architecture allowed players to inflate
their scores artificially by gaming the system.
DLOs are typically, but not necessarily, embedded in online courses (Shell et al.,
2013; Tooman & Sibthorpe, 2012). Thornes (2012), for example, reused DLOs originally
developed for an online course in a face-to-face course. Several advantages of embedding
DLOs were identified in the literature. DLOs that are accessible within a CMS provide
students with support at their point of need (Thornes, 2012), which is important since few
online students have been observed to go outside the environment of the CMS for course
support (Anderson & Mitchell, 2012; Shell et al., 2013). While DLOs lack the personal
quality that face-to-face contact supplies, Thornes (2012) saw this as an advantage;
whereas students may be reluctant to ask an instructor to repeat a point, they can review
the contents of a DLO as many times as needed for comprehension without
embarrassment. Librarians, as well as students, benefit from the use of DLOs. A well
designed object can save librarians time spent on instruction (Sult et al., 2013), an
important consideration when reduced budgets are combined with increased enrollments.
Nor should librarians feel as though they are neglecting their clientele in sharing
responsibility for IL instruction with software; both Lo and Dale (2009) and Tooman and
Sibthorpe (2012) found no significant statistical difference in outcomes when face-to-face
instruction was compared to computer assisted instruction.
Several barriers to the creation of DLOs were noted. Lack of financial and staff
resources are perennial problems in libraries; the costs of software and the time required
to transfer preexisting materials to an online format are thus obvious barriers. Further,
librarians may not possess the technical skills to use relevant software effectively, and

47
may also lack the design expertise to create effective online content (Held, 2010; Mestre
et al., 2011). Thornes (2012) identified two issues related to transactional distance that
may serve as barriers to teaching and learning using DLOs. Although an absence of faceto-face contact could allow shy students to interact with materials in a DLO without fear
of embarrassment, this same factor makes it virtually impossible for librarians to assess
those students’ instructional needs in the same way that they could in person. Also, the
visual cues one picks up from the face-to-face encounter convey a large amount of
information, a fact that often goes unappreciated until one is immersed in a software
environment. Thornes stated that “the content on the screen is no longer just a visual aid
(as the slides in a PowerPoint presentation would be), it is the place the student is getting
all their meaning from” (p. 84).
Despite these barriers, many reasons to create and use DLOs were identified in
the literature. Time efficiency was the most frequently mentioned rationale for the use of
DLOs. “The challenge,” wrote Stiwinter (2013), “is to create more time with students
without increasing the workload on librarians or faculty” (p. 15). The demands on staff
time at reference desks can be intense. Sult et al. (2013) realized that they were spending
an inordinate amount of time responding to a single reference question asked over and
over again; this provided the impetus to create their first database tutorial. Tooman and
Sibthorpe (2012) successfully introduced a DLO into a face-to-face course as a way of
reducing demands on reference staff. Technology can also be used to ease administrative
responsibilities such as grading assignments so that librarians have more time for
instruction (Tennant, Edwards, & Miyamoto, 2012).
Librarians also use DLOs to extend the reach of their instruction (Mestre et al.,

48
2011). The three full time librarians at Stiwinter’s (2013) institution reached only a
fraction of the 5,000-member student body with IL instruction; the use of a DLO allowed
them to reach many more students than they otherwise would have been able to do.
Standardization of delivery quality was another reason for using DLOs in place of faceto-face instruction; Tooman and Sibthorpe (2012) pointed out how difficult it was to
ensure that all students were being provided an equivalent experience, given that
knowledge and teaching quality varied with each instructor.
Faculty acceptance was deemed essential to the success of DLOs; student use of
DLOs was seen as dependent on faculty endorsement of them (Lo & Dale, 2009;
Stiwinter, 2013). As Anderson and Mitchell (2012) put it, “students value what their
professors value; consequently, faculty approval, encouragement, and assignment of
library tutorials are essential to success” (p. 150). As mentioned earlier, DLOs that are an
integral, graded part of a course are more likely to be taken seriously by students than
those that are simply presented as supplemental course material (DaCosta, 2010; Held,
2010; Stiwinter, 2013; Tooman & Sibthorpe, 2012).
Sult et al.’s (2013) database tutorial represents a typical initiative to design,
implement, evaluate, and redesign a DLO. The researchers originally sought to create a
tutorial to supplement face-to-face library instruction sessions. Having experimented with
commercial database tutorials and found them lacking, they worked with campus
technical staff to create a split screen product, which presented database instruction on
one side and a live database session on the other. The goals for the tutorial were to teach
students how to navigate specific databases, how to distinguish research studies from
other types of articles, and how to retrieve the full text of articles from a list of search

49
results. One important feature of the product was that it allowed students to use their own
topics instead of relying on generic examples. This was accomplished by the use of a text
field in the tutorial, into which students could type their chosen topics. All tutorials were
corrected and scored by librarians and returned to the students.
Sult et al. (2013) conducted an assessment of the tutorial on eight sections of a
course in which it was being used. The control group consisted of four sections, which
were provided with traditional in-class library instruction; the other four, the
experimental group, took the tutorial. Of the 92 students in the experimental group, 78
achieved the objectives on their first attempt, and 11 did so on their second attempt.
Having been deemed effective, this iteration of the tutorial was implemented;
soon, Sult et al. (2013) found that the effort involved in maintaining the tutorial was not
sustainable, given the demands of responding to submissions. The institution then
experienced an increase in enrollment and a decline in staff, which further reduced the
number of hours librarians were able to devote to the project. This prompted the
researchers to explore ways to make the tutorial more self-sustaining. They decided that
the design of the tutorial relied too much on feedback from librarians and not enough on
active learning experiences. By this point, the librarians involved had a sense of questions
typically asked about the tutorial, and had developed a repertoire of answers; they used
this repertoire to develop automatic feedback for the new tutorial, which they named the
Guide on the Side. This new approach had students answering questions designed to
prompt reflection on the mechanics of searching, the construction of search statements,
and the successful execution of searches. This called into play their critical thinking
skills, and the interactive nature of the tutorial kept them engaged in learning. An

50
evaluation of the effectiveness of the Guide on the Side compared to other approaches
was underway at the time of the publication of this article.
The redesign effort yielded a product that was both less demanding on staff time
and was thought to be more effective at developing critical thinking skills. The amount of
effort put forth in teaching, then, was found to be less important than appropriate ID in
achieving learning outcomes. The conclusions made by Sult et al. (2013) must be
regarded as tentative, however, because assessment figures were not fully reported.
Presumably, statistics were compiled for the control group in the assessment described
above, but none were reported. This makes it impossible to determine whether the
experimental group performed better than the control group, and equally as impossible to
infer the superiority of the tutorial to traditional face-to-face instruction. Also, since the
evaluation of the Guide on the Side was still in progress at the time of the article’s
publication, no data exist to indicate whether or not it actually enhanced critical thinking
or succeeded better than other products.
Prior Research and the Present Study
Previously published works have focused extensively on the practical aspects of
using ID to create IL instruction. A number of articles have been devoted to the
application of various ID models, such as ADDIE (Booth, 2011; Chang & Siao, 2012;
Colborn, 2011; A. L. Davis, 2013; B. E. Fox & Doherty, 2011; Koneru, 2010; Kumar et
al., 2012; Stern & Kaur, 2010; Summey & Valenti, 2013; Willis, 2011a, 2011b),
Morrison, Ross, Kemp, and Kalman (Summey & Valenti, 2013), and Dick, Carey, and
Carey (Mestre et al., 2011) to IL instruction. Both behavioral (Blummer et al., 2010;
Bobish, 2011; Stiwinter, 2013) and constructivist (Blummer et al., 2010; Bobish, 2011;

51
Colborn, 2011; Koneru, 2010; Magnuson, 2012; Rand, 2013; Willis, 2011b) interventions
in IL instruction have been described in the literature. Various collaborative ID efforts
involving librarians, faculty, and instructional designers (Clapp et al., 2013; Lo & Dale,
2009; Shell et al., 2013; Stiwinter, 2013) have also been detailed.
Many authors (Anderson & Mitchell, 2012; B. E. Fox & Doherty, 2011; Gunn &
Miree, 2012; Markey et al., 2011; Mestre et al., 2011; Stiwinter, 2013; Sult et al., 2013;
Tooman & Sibthorpe, 2012) used ID methods to create online tutorials or other DLOs.
Others (Anderson & Mitchell, 2012; Blummer et al., 2010; Clapp et al., 2013; B. E. Fox
& Doherty, 2011; Gunn & Miree, 2012; Strittmatter, 2012) focused on using the ACRL’s
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (ACRL, 2000) as a
framework for structuring IL instruction. Despite criticisms of the validity and reliability
of learning style measures (Coffield et al., 2004; Hawk & Shah, 2007; Pashler et al.,
2008; Platsidou & Metallidou, 2009), some researchers (Anderson & Mitchell, 2012;
Koneru, 2010; Thornes, 2012) advocated taking learning style into consideration when
designing IL instruction. In several studies (E. L. Davis et al., 2011; Held, 2010; Shell et
al., 2013; Summey & Valenti, 2013; West-Pawl, 2012), embedding a librarian in online
courses was found to be helpful in the implementation of ID.
Research Questions
This study examined the following research questions:
1. What is the relationship between respondents’ behavioral, normative, and
control beliefs and their reported use of ID methods when designing IL instruction?
2. How do various demographic factors, such as prior education or experience in
ID, the length of professional work experience, primary job function, and educational

52
level relate to instruction librarians’ use of ID methods when designing IL instruction?
3. Do librarians who self-identify as teachers use ID methods to create IL
instruction more than those who do not?
4. Why do instruction librarians adopt or reject ID methods to create IL
instruction?
5. In what ways do the qualitative data confirm or support the quantitative data?
Summary
The purpose of this study was to determine whether instruction librarians in the
United States and Canada were using ID methods, and to identify potential explanations
for their adoption or rejection of those methods; since the TPB (Ajzen, 1985) has been
shown to be effective in predicting intention and behavior, the study adopted it as a
theoretical framework. The literature review examined the ways in which learning
theories such as behaviorism and constructivism have been used in creating IL
instruction, and noted the dearth of articles devoted to the use of ID theories in the library
science literature. Descriptions of how various authors had used ID models, such as
ADDIE; Dick, Carey, and Carey (2009); Gagné’s (2007) nine events of instruction;
Merrill’s (2002) first principles of instruction; and Morrison, Ross, Kemp, and Kalman
(2012), were provided.
Many authors described collaborative efforts between and among librarians,
instructional designers, faculty, and others. Different models of collaboration were
described in the literature, and their advantages and disadvantages were considered. The
ACRL’s Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000),
student learning styles, embedded librarians, and digital learning objects were often

53
discussed in the literature in relation to ID theories and models.
A series of quantitative and qualitative research questions were developed to
explore the relationship between respondents’ behavioral, normative, and control beliefs
and their reported use of ID methods when designing IL instruction; whether various
demographic factors, such as prior education or experience in ID, the length of
professional work experience, primary job function, or educational level related to
instruction librarians’ use of ID methods when designing IL instruction; whether
librarians who self-identified as teachers used ID methods to create IL instruction more
than those who did not; and why instruction librarians adopted or rejected the use of ID
methods to create IL instruction. A mixed methods research question explored the ways
in which the qualitative data confirmed or supported the quantitative data.

54
Chapter 3: Methodology
Chapter 2 described the theoretical framework for the study, provided a review of
the literature related to the topic, articulated the purpose of the study, and presented
quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research questions. Chapter 3 discusses the
participants, design, instruments, procedures, and limitations of the study. A sequential
explanatory mixed methods study was employed to examine the research questions and
address the purpose of the study. The purpose of the study was to determine whether
instruction librarians in the United States and Canada were using ID methods, and to
identify potential explanations for their adoption or rejection of those methods. The study
addressed the following research questions:
1. What is the relationship between respondents’ behavioral, normative, and
control beliefs and their reported use of ID methods when designing IL instruction?
2. How do various demographic factors, such as prior education or experience in
ID, the length of professional work experience, primary job function, and educational
level relate to instruction librarians’ use of ID methods when designing IL instruction?
3. Do librarians who self-identify as teachers use ID methods to create IL
instruction more than those who do not?
4. Why do instruction librarians adopt or reject ID methods to create IL
instruction?
5. In what ways do the qualitative data confirm or support the quantitative data?
Participants
This section describes the methods used to identify participants in both the
quantitative and qualitative portions of the study.

55
Quantitative. The target population for the present study was defined as the set
of all instruction librarians working in institutions of higher education in the United
States and Canada. The sample was the membership of the ALA’s Information
Literacy Instruction Discussion List, which had 5,627 subscribers as of August 6, 2014
(Driscoll, n. d.). The 101 participants for the quantitative portion of the study were
recruited from this listserv. The specific procedure used to select the sample is
described fully in the Quantitative Procedures section.
Qualitative. Survey subjects were asked to indicate their willingness to take
part in a brief telephone interview intended to explore their reasons for using or not
using ID methods to create IL instruction. Of the 101 individuals who submitted
usable responses to the survey, 24 volunteered to be interviewed. A sample of ten of
these volunteers was chosen to participate in the interviews. The specific procedure
used to select the sample is described fully in the Qualitative Procedures section.
Ultimately, only seven of these volunteers responded to requests to be interviewed.
Design
A multifaceted approach is required to explore the complex questions posed in
social science research. Used in conjunction, qualitative and quantitative methods can
illuminate these questions better than either method alone (Creswell, 2009). Because the
purpose of this study was to determine not only whether instruction librarians use ID
methods in creating IL instruction, but also why they adopted or rejected those methods,
the sequential explanatory mixed methods approach was identified as the most
appropriate research design. According to Creswell (2009), “a sequential explanatory
design is typically used to explain and interpret quantitative results by collecting and

56
analyzing follow-up qualitative data” (p. 211).
The sequential explanatory mixed methods approach has three distinguishing
characteristics: (a) it makes use of both quantitative and qualitative methods; (b) both
quantitative and qualitative data are collected and analyzed sequentially; and (c)
quantitative and qualitative data are not mixed; instead, the latter is used to confirm or
disconfirm the former. As in other mixed methods approaches, quantitative and
qualitative data may be weighted differently; emphasis is usually placed on the
quantitative data (Creswell, 2009). Though not required, theory may inform studies based
on a sequential explanatory approach, according to Creswell. In the present study, the
TPB (Ajzen, 1985) served as an organizing principle; the TPB is, as Creswell put it,
“reflected in the purpose or research questions of the study. It is the driving force behind
all methodological choices” (p. 215).
Quantitative data were gathered for the study by means of a web-based survey
adapted from instruments created by Ajjan and Hartshorne (2008) and Julien and Genuis
(2011). Survey research is undertaken to determine the attitudes or behaviors of large
groups of individuals by examining smaller subgroups (Czaja & Blair, 2005). Survey
methodology was chosen as a means of collecting quantitative data for the present study
because of its demonstrated efficiency in doing so (Creswell, 2009); as Schutt (2012)
wrote, “survey data can be collected from many people at relatively low cost and,
depending on the survey design, relatively quickly” (p. 160). The survey was conducted
to answer Research Questions 1, 2, and 3.
Telephone interviews were used to gather qualitative data, since this was the only
feasible method for the primary investigator (PI) to collect data from a nationwide

57
sample; as Creswell (2009) pointed out, interviews are “useful when participants cannot
be directly observed” (p. 179). Survey participants who volunteered to take part in the
telephone interviews answered a series of open form, qualitative questions designed to
explore their reasons for adopting or rejecting ID methods to create IL instruction. Three
of these questions were developed by the PI, and the other four were adapted from the
instrument created by Julien and Genuis (2011). Each of these qualitative questions is
detailed in Appendix B. The qualitative questions were intended to address Research
Question 4.
Consistent with the procedures of the sequential explanatory mixed methods
approach, quantitative and qualitative data for the study were collected sequentially; in
this study, more emphasis was given to the former than the latter. Since qualitative data
were gathered to provide supportive and confirmatory data for the primary, quantitative
data set, the qualitative data were not integrated with the primary data (Creswell, 2009).
In studies using sequential explanatory designs, according to Creswell, “weight typically
is given to the quantitative data, and the mixing of the data occurs when the initial
quantitative results informs the secondary qualitative data collection. Thus, the two forms
of data are separate but connected” (p. 211).
Because the validity and reliability of both the quantitative and qualitative
instruments may have been negatively affected by various adaptations and additions
made by the PI, a pilot test was conducted for content validation by a group of three
librarians who met the study’s eligibility requirements. Feedback from the pilot group
was used to clarify survey and interview questions. Participants in the pilot group were
excluded from participation in the study in order to maintain its integrity. Further details

58
about how information gathered during the pilot study was used to improve both
instruments is provided in the Quantitative Procedures and Qualitative Procedures
sections.
Instruments
The following section describes the development of both the quantitative and
qualitative instruments.
Quantitative. The Instruction Librarians’ Behavioral Intention Survey (ILBIS)
questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data. The SurveyMonkey software was
used to administer the questionnaire via the web. ILBIS consisted of two sections:
Section I collected demographic data, and Section II measured behavioral, normative, and
control beliefs regarding participants’ use of ID methods. Section I included eight
demographic questions adapted with permission (H. Julien, personal communication,
March 18, 2014) from a study by Julien and Genuis (2011) that was designed to explore
Canadian librarians’ attitudes toward teaching. The questions on the Julien and Genuis
survey, the final phase of a three-part study, were inspired by interviews the authors
conducted in the first phase. To validate these questions, the authors conducted a pilot
study that consisted of two rounds of testing by librarians, which resulted in revisions of
the wording of the questions. The adapted questions elicit information about subjects’
length of professional experience, educational background, primary job function,
professional identity as teachers, use of ID methods when creating IL instruction, and
familiarity with and use of various ID models. The questions in Section I were intended
to provide an answer for Research Question 2, which is whether various demographic
factors, such as prior education or experience in ID, the length of professional work

59
experience, primary job function, or educational level, relate to instruction librarians’ use
of ID methods when designing IL instruction; and Research Question 3, which is whether
librarians who self-identify as teachers use ID methods to create IL instruction more than
those who do not.
Section II of ILBIS was adapted with permission (H. Ajjan, personal
communication, March 18, 2014) from the instrument developed by Ajjan and
Hartshorne (2008), which was designed to measure instructors’ behavioral intention to
use Web 2.0 technologies in teaching. The authors reported Cronbach alpha values
ranging from 0.67 to 0.98, which they deemed “acceptable for exploratory research” (p.
75). The authors validated the instrument by performing a pilot study with a small sample
of subjects, and making modifications to questions that were unclear. In Section II,
subjects indicated their degree of agreement with a series of statements on a 5-point
Likert scale. The 20 questions in this section were divided into three categories. The first
eight questions were designed to measure behavioral beliefs, the next six questions
measured normative beliefs, and the last six questions measured control beliefs. In order
to develop scores for each of the three constructs, participants’ scores for each question
were averaged so that each participant had one score for behavioral beliefs, one for
normative beliefs, and one for control beliefs. Section II was used for the purpose of
answering Research Question 1, which sought to determine the relationship between
respondents’ behavioral, normative, and control beliefs and their reported use of ID
methods. The complete ILBIS survey is reproduced in Appendix A.
Qualitative. The qualitative instrument, which was administered by the PI over
the telephone, consisted of seven open form questions, three of which were developed by

60
the PI and four of which were adapted with permission (H. Julien, personal
communication, March 18, 2014) from the instrument created by Julien and Genuis
(2011). These questions asked participants their reasons for using or not using ID
methods, whether they used other models or methods when designing instruction, what
they found enjoyable and challenging about instruction, whether they considered teaching
part of their professional identities, and whether they had any other comments to add. All
of the qualitative questions were intended to answer Research Question 4: Why do
instruction librarians adopt or reject ID methods to create IL instruction? The qualitative
questions are included in Appendix B.
Quantitative Procedures
The following section will describe procedures related to the quantitative portion
of the study. Gall, Gall, and Borg (2003) set forth the major steps in survey research:
defining the objectives of the research, selecting the sample to be studied, designing the
testing instrument, pilot testing the instrument, contacting members of the sample prior to
distribution of the instrument, composing a cover letter and administering the instrument
to the sample, contacting individuals who do not respond to the instrument, and analyzing
data. The following is a description of how these steps were applied in creating the ILBIS
survey.
Definition of objectives. The objectives of the study were developed and refined
by following the procedure outlined by deVaus (1992), as described by Gall et al. (2003).
DeVaus suggested that researchers consider the importance of the following five factors
in defining research objectives: the time frame of the inquiry, any geographical
restrictions pertaining to the sample, whether to focus broadly or narrowly (in terms of

61
subjects), the specific aspect of the topic to be studied, and the level of abstraction
applied to the inquiry. These considerations were applied to the present study in the
manner described below.
1. Time frame. The study entertained responses only from instruction librarians
who currently have IL instruction duties. However, in responding to any of the questions
on ILBIS, subjects were allowed to consider either current or past experience.
2. Geographical restrictions. The sample was limited to instruction librarians
working in libraries in the United States and Canada.
3. Focus. This study was broadly focused on instruction librarians; no subgroups
were compared.
4. Aspect of the topic studied. The quantitative portion of the study examined
whether instruction librarians used ID methods to create IL instruction. The qualitative
portion of the study, which consisted of the telephone interviews, explored subjects’
reasons for rejecting or adopting these methods.
5. Level of abstraction. The aim of this sequential explanatory mixed methods
study was both to report facts and to interpret findings. Quantitative results established
baseline statistics on the number of instruction librarians who used ID methods to create
IL instruction; these data may allow future researchers to measure increases or decreases
in ID use by this population. Qualitative results can inform efforts by library educators or
others who wish to increase knowledge of ID methods among librarians; for example, by
examining instruction librarians’ reasons for declining to adopt ID methods, and
designing interventions to help future practitioners overcome identified objections to their
use.

62
Sample selection. A nonprobability convenience sample was used for the
quantitative portion of the study. While probability sampling is desirable, it would be
difficult to implement this sampling procedure due to the time constraints placed on the
study. As Gall et al. (2003) pointed out, “it is much more difficult to make valid
inferences about a population from nonprobability sampling methods, but these methods
are used in more than 95 percent of research studies in the social sciences” (p. 179). Gall
et al. go on to state that the ease of selecting a nonprobability sample is undoubtedly the
reason for the popularity of this method.
Gall et al. (2003) emphasized the importance of choosing the right target group
for study. “If you do not have thorough knowledge of a situation,” they warn, “you might
make the mistake of sending your questionnaire to a group that does not have the desired
information” (p. 225). In the present study, the PI chose to approach a group likely to be
made up of individuals who qualify for participation; the Information Literacy Instruction
Discussion List, from which the quantitative sample was drawn, is maintained to
facilitate “communication among librarians from a variety of settings and backgrounds”
who wish to engage in a “thriving exchange on instruction and information literacy”
(Driscoll, n. d., para. 1).
Instrument design. Gall et al. (2003) identified three factors—anonymity, item
form, and measuring attitudes—to consider when designing survey instruments. The
following is a description of how each of these factors was applied to the design of
ILBIS.
1. Anonymity. According to Gall et al. (2003), anonymity is a concern when
surveys are designed to elicit highly personal information. Although the questions

63
contained in ILBIS are innocuous, Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols still
require the protection of research participants’ anonymity. To this end, the
SurveyMonkey software was chosen to administer the survey because of its ability to
shield subjects’ identities from the investigators. The SurveyMonkey software was
configured in such a way that participants’ names, email, and IP addresses were not
displayed, thus protecting their anonymity. The software also insured that the survey was
taken by each recipient only once by disallowing responses from the same email or IP.
Further, the participation letter informed subjects that all information obtained in the
study would be held in confidence unless disclosure was legally required, that data would
be maintained in a locked filing cabinet, and that their names would not be used in any
publications or conference presentations of study findings.
2. Item form. Careful consideration was given to the creation and adaptation of
questions on both sections of the survey. In accordance with Gall et al.’s (2003)
recommendations for writing survey questions, definitions of technical terms were
provided; intelligible instructions were given for each section; survey questions were
written in a succinct and clear manner; and the survey interface was designed to be both
visually attractive and well organized. As mentioned earlier, ILBIS, the survey
instrument used for this study, is an adaptation of two separate instruments: Sections I
and II are adapted from the Julien and Genuis (2011) survey and the Ajjan and
Hartshorne’s (2008) questionnaire, respectively.
The Julien and Genuis (2011) survey originally consisted of ten closed form and
four open form questions; the former were adapted to form Section I of the survey, while
the latter were adapted for the telephone survey instrument (adaptation of the telephone

64
survey will be described further in the Qualitative Procedures section). Two of the closed
form questions were eliminated because they did not reflect any of the research questions
in the present study. These questions asked respondents to describe the nature of their
instructional work in libraries, and whether they expected to be performing instruction
when they began their careers. Three questions were formulated by the PI and added to
Section I. The first, ILBIS question 7, which asked subjects to what extent they used
instructional design methods when designing IL instruction, was intended to answer
partially Research Questions 2 and 3, as described below. The second added question,
ILBIS question 8, which asked subjects what specific ID methods they used when
creating IL instruction, was added to establish whether or not they actually used any
formal ID methods when designing IL instruction. The third added question, ILBIS
question 9, which asked subjects whether they saw themselves primarily as teachers or as
librarians in their current role, was added to answer partially Research Question 3, as
described below.
The Ajjan and Hartshorne (2008) questionnaire was originally created to explore
teachers’ attitudes toward using Web 2.0 technologies in the classroom. The major
adaptation of this questionnaire involved replacing references to Web 2.0 technologies
with references to IL instruction. Of the 35 original items on the questionnaire, 16 were
either eliminated outright because they were redundant, or were combined with similar
questions. One question, ILBIS question 25, which asked subjects to rate their agreement
with the statement, “I have been reading and hearing more about the use of instructional
design methods to create information literacy instruction,” was added to gauge subjects’
awareness of the prevalence of the use of ID methods in libraries.

65
3. Measuring attitudes. Section II of ILBIS was designed to measure subjects’
attitudes about the use of ID methods in creating IL instruction. Gall et al. (2003)
recommended that researchers who intended to measure attitudes search the literature for
a suitable instrument, rather than attempting to develop one of their own. The instrument
on which Section II is based (Ajjan and Hartshorne, 2008) was deemed suitable to the
purposes of the present study, since it was specifically designed to measure subjects’
behavioral, normative, and control beliefs.
Gall et al. also recommended that scales be used to measure attitudes. They
compared attitude scales to one-item tests, which are designed to elicit discrete pieces of
information. “When questions assess attitudes, . . . the one-item test approach is
questionable with respect to both validity and reliability,” they wrote. “A questionnaire
that measures attitudes generally must be constructed as an attitude scale . . .” (p. 228).
Consistent with these recommendations, Section II of ILBIS presented a series of
statements about the use of ID methods in creating IL instruction. It used a 5-point Likert
scale, with responses ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” to gauge the
degree of subjects’ agreement with each statement.
Pilot testing. Gall et al. (2003) stressed that thorough pilot testing of survey
instruments is vital. ILBIS was pilot tested for content validity, readability, and ease of
use by three individuals qualified to participate in the study. One tester has both a Master
of Library Science degree and a PhD in instructional systems and teaches an IL course at
an ALA-accredited library school. Two others hold Master of Library Science degrees
and have taught IL extensively. The survey was updated to reflect their suggestions for
clarification of terminology and for the addition of space for subjects to add comments.

66
To avoid bias, these pilot testers have agreed not to participate in the actual survey.
Contacting the sample in advance. A solicitation (Appendix C) for the study
was sent to subscribers of the Information Literacy Instruction Discussion List. The
solicitation introduced the PI, explained the reasons for the study, provided a definition of
ID, and explained who was eligible to participate. A link to the survey on the
SurveyMonkey web site was also provided. The listserv owners granted the PI
permission to contact listserv members with this request (A. Driscoll, personal
communication, December 4, 2014).
Cover letter. The initial page of ILBIS contained the Nova Southeastern
University IRB’s participation letter, which served as the cover letter for the survey. The
participation letter provided the names and contact information of the principal and coinvestigators, and the phone number and email address of the IRB. The participation
letter further provided a description of the study, as well as information about the
following: risks and benefits to participants, cost and payments to participants, participant
confidentiality, and participants’ right to withdraw from the study.
Nonrespondent follow up. A follow up email was sent to listserv subscribers two
weeks after the initial solicitation, thanking them for their participation if they had taken
the survey and reminding them that it was still available if they had not. The survey
remained open for two weeks after the follow up email was sent.
Qualitative Procedures
Similar to their description of the major steps in survey research, Gall et al. (2003)
outlined steps to be taken in preparing and conducting qualitative interviews. These steps
are as follows: defining the purpose of the interview, selecting an appropriate sample,

67
designing the format of the interview, developing interview questions, selecting and
training interviewers, pilot testing the interview questions, conducting the interview, and
analyzing data. Each subsection below describes how these steps were applied to the
qualitative portion of the study.
Definition of the purpose of the interview. Gall et al. (2003) identified three
major types of research interviews: key informant interviews, which consist of interviews
with experts in a particular area of knowledge; survey interviews, which are undertaken
to provide supplementary data to other types of qualitative or quantitative research; and
focus group interviews, in which groups of individuals with knowledge of a specific topic
are interviewed. Since the purpose of the qualitative portion of the study was to provide
supportive and confirmatory data for the primary, quantitative portion, the survey
interview method was most appropriate in this instance.
Sample selection. The following procedure was used to select the sample for the
qualitative portion of the study. ILBIS question 11 asked subjects to indicate their
willingness to be interviewed. Of the 101 individuals who submitted usable responses to
the survey, 24 volunteered to be interviewed. Ten volunteers were chosen to participate
in the interviews using the following procedure:
1. The PI divided the volunteers into 5 groups. One group was created for each of
the 5 responses to ILBIS question 7, which asked subjects to what extent they used ID
methods when designing IL instruction; specifically, one group each was created for
volunteers who (1) never used ID methods, (2) rarely used ID methods, (3) used ID
methods about half the time, (4) frequently used ID methods, and who (5) always used ID
methods.

68
2. Each of these groups was subdivided into two subgroups according to how the
volunteers answered ILBIS question 2, which asked subjects what percentage of their
jobs was devoted to IL instruction. The first subgroup consisted of those who indicated
that up to 50% of their jobs were devoted to IL instruction. The second subgroup
consisted of those who indicated that more than 50% of their jobs were devoted to IL
instruction.
3. Two volunteers from each subgroup were chosen to participate in the
interviews using a simple random sampling procedure. Alternate volunteers in each
subgroup were identified, to be questioned if the first round of volunteers could not be
contacted.
Interview format. Gall et al. (2003) described three interview approaches. In the
structured interview, investigators pose closed form questions only and do not probe for
more nuanced information. While these types of interviews elicit the same kinds of
responses as questionnaires, their response rates tend to be better, since interviewers can
follow up immediately with participants who do not answer all of the questions. The
semistructured interview involves asking both open and closed form questions, thus
allowing for greater probing. Gall et al. stated that this approach “has the advantage of
providing reasonably standard data across respondents, but of greater depth than can be
obtained from a structured interview” (p. 240). In the unstructured interview, there are no
closed form questions; rather, the interviewer formulates questions as the interview
proceeds based on responses from the interviewees. This type of interview is best suited
to research projects that involve obtaining highly sensitive information. A semistructured
interview format was chosen for the present study for its ability to provide nuanced

69
answers to research questions. The interviews were conducted by telephone, since it
would not have been feasible to conduct face-to-face interviews of a nationwide sample.
Question development. The qualitative instrument contains seven open form
questions. Four of these (interview questions 4–7) were adapted from the Julien and
Genuis (2011) study, while the others (interview questions 1–3) were developed by the
PI. The interview questions explored participants’ attitudes about using ID methods to
create IL instruction, and about teaching IL as it relates to their professional identity as
librarians.
Selection and training of interviewers. Since the PI was the sole interviewer,
selection and training of multiple interviewers was not carried out.
Pilot testing. The three pilot testers for the ILBIS survey were also used to
evaluate the interview questions for content validity and ease of use. Each tester found
the interview questions to be adequate and made no recommendations for change.
Conducting the interviews. Prior to conducting interviews, the PI obtained
written consent from participants by sending them an IRB approved consent form via
email. All consent forms were signed electronically and returned to the PI.
The way in which researchers present themselves can have an effect on how well
they establish rapport among participants (Gall et al., 2003). For instance, when
interviewing librarians, researchers who are also librarians would likely be able to
establish rapport because of their professional standing. The PI presented himself to
participants as both a librarian and a teacher in an attempt to establish rapport (he has 15
years’ experience working in academic libraries, has taught IL sessions and creditbearing courses at the graduate and undergraduate level, and currently teaches in a

70
graduate library science program).
The PI audio recorded and subsequently transcribed the interviews. As suggested
by Creswell (2009), the PI took handwritten notes during the interviews in case the audio
recording equipment failed.
Quantitative and Qualitative Data Analysis
After the surveys were returned, the responses were organized and input into the
Microsoft Excel 2010 software package for analysis. In Chapter 4, an overarching
descriptive analysis of the survey questions has been reported in both narrative and table
format; separate analyses have been provided for each individual research question, as
outlined below. Analysis of qualitative data consisted of examining responses to
interview questions for themes that confirm or disconfirm the quantitative data.
Research Question 1. What is the relationship between respondents’ behavioral,
normative, and control beliefs and their reported use of ID methods when designing IL
instruction? In order to answer this question, the PI first calculated scores for each of the
constructs. Pearson correlations were then calculated between respondents’ behavioral,
normative, and control construct scores and their reported use of ID methods.
Each question on ILBIS Section II consists of a statement about the use of ID
methods in creating IL instruction. A 5-point Likert scale allows subjects to rate the
extent to which they agree with each statement. ILBIS questions 12 through 19 measure
subjects’ behavioral beliefs in relation to using ID methods. ILBIS questions 20 through
25 measure their perception of subjective norms, and ILBIS questions 26 through 30
measure their control beliefs in relation to the use of ID methods. To determine the
relationship between their behavioral, normative, and control beliefs and their use of ID

71
methods, mean scores for behavioral beliefs, subjective norms, and control beliefs were
tabulated for each subject, then correlated with scores for ILBIS question 7, which asked
subjects to rate the extent to which they used instructional design methods when
designing information literacy instruction.
Research Question 2. How do various demographic factors, such as prior
education or experience in ID, the length of professional work experience, primary job
function, or educational level relate to instruction librarians’ use of ID methods when
designing IL instruction? In order to answer this research question, the PI intended to
calculate χ2 tests to compare responses to ILBIS questions 3 through 6 (which measure
the length of time subjects have worked in libraries, the length of time they have taught
IL, their educational attainment, and the discipline of other graduate degrees) with ILBIS
questions 7, which asked subjects to rate the extent to which they used ID methods when
designing IL instruction, and 10, which asked them to identify the main way in which
they had been trained in using ID methods. However, the survey did not yield enough
data to calculate accurate correlations between ILBIS question 7 and ILBIS questions 5
and 6. Instead, the χ2 analyses were calculated between ILBIS questions 7 and 10.
Research Question 3. Do librarians who self-identify as teachers use ID methods
to create IL instruction more than those who do not? In order to answer this question,
subjects were divided into two groups, those who identified as primarily as teachers and
those who identified primarily as librarians. Mean scores for the two groups were
calculated for ILBIS question 7, which asked subjects to what extent they used ID
methods when designing IL instruction. A t test for independent sample means was then
conducted to determine if there was a significant difference between the groups.

72
Research Question 4. Why do instruction librarians adopt or reject ID methods
to create IL instruction? In order to answer this qualitative question, responses to the
interview questions were reviewed for themes related to this topic. An organized
narrative outlining participants’ responses is included in Chapter 4.
Research Question 5. In what ways do the qualitative data confirm or support the
quantitative data? In order to answer this question, results from the quantitative questions
contained in ILBIS were compared to responses to the qualitative interview questions to
identify any areas of validation or disconnect. Responses to the qualitative questions were
examined for common themes that were recorded and compared to the quantitative
findings.
Limitations
Selection procedures represent one limitation of this study. Creswell (2009)
identified selection bias as a threat to internal validity, and suggested random selection of
subjects as a strategy to overcome this threat. For the present study, a nonprobability
convenience sample was drawn from the membership of a listserv that caters exclusively
to the needs and interests of instruction librarians; this procedure was followed because
random sampling was deemed not to be feasible. This method of selecting subjects may
have introduced an element of bias into the study, since individuals who subscribe to this
kind of listserv are likely to be enthusiastic about IL instruction. Further, individuals who
do not use ID methods to create IL instruction may have selected themselves out of a
study about the use of such methods, unaware that their responses might be valuable.
Mortality is another limitation of the study. Creswell (2009) mentioned mortality,
or the tendency of participants to “drop out” (p. 163) of a study, as a further threat to

73
internal validity. In the present study, three (30%) of the participants in the qualitative
portion dropped out. This number represents 100% of those who never used ID methods,
and 50% of those who rarely did. “The outcomes,” as Creswell wrote, “are thus unknown
for these individuals” (p. 163).
The fact that participation in the study was restricted to librarians who engage in
IL instruction represents another limitation. Because of this restriction, the results of the
study only apply to the creation of IL instruction by librarians, and cannot be generalized
to other populations.
To ensure validity of qualitative results, Creswell (2009) recommended using
“member checking to determine the accuracy of the qualitative findings through taking
the final report or specific descriptions or themes back to participants and determining
whether these participants feel that they are accurate.” Given the time constraints of the
study, no such procedure was followed. This represents a fourth limitation of the study.
The final limitation is the fact that there were insufficient data to answer Research
Question 2, and alternative analyses had to be carried out. Further, in order to analyze the
relationship between use of ID methods and reported type of training in ID, Yates’s
correction for continuity (Furr, 2010; Preacher, 2001) had to be applied, and this may
have compromised the integrity of the results. According to the article “Yates’s
correction (for continuity)” (2005), “Yates’s continuity correction is less widely used
than it once was, largely because many statisticians think that it may overcorrect for the
possibility of Type I error and thus increase the chances of Type II error” (p. 348).
Summary
Instruction librarians working in academic libraries in the United States and

74
Canada were contacted through the ALA’s Information Literacy Instruction Discussion
List and asked to respond to a web-based survey. The survey attempted to answer
Research Questions 1, 2, and 3. A subset of survey participants took part in telephone
interviews, which were intended to answer Research Question 4.
In this sequential explanatory mixed methods study, the primary, quantitative data
were gathered first, followed by the secondary, qualitative data. The latter was intended
to provide supportive and confirmatory data for the former; therefore, the data were not
mixed, but remained separate, though connected. A pilot study of both the survey and the
interview questions was conducted, and where indicated the instruments were adjusted
according to the advice received from the pilot group.
The procedures outlined by Gall, Gall, and Borg (2003) for conducting
quantitative and qualitative research were used to create the survey and interview
questions, respectively. Steps in designing quantitative research include the following:
defining the objectives of the research, selecting the sample to be studied, designing the
testing instrument, pilot testing the instrument, contacting members of the sample prior to
distribution of the instrument, composing a cover letter and administering the instrument
to the sample, contacting individuals who do not respond to the instrument, and analyzing
data. Steps in designing qualitative research are as follows: defining the purpose of the
interview, selecting an appropriate sample, designing the format of the interview,
developing interview questions, selecting and training interviewers, pilot testing the
interview questions, conducting the interview, and analyzing data. The chapter described
in detail how these steps were applied to the creation of both the quantitative and
qualitative instruments. Statistical tests were undertaken to determine answers to

75
Research Questions 1, 2, and 3. Qualitative data were examined for themes that
confirmed or disconfirmed quantitative data.
Limitations of the study included selection issues, mortality, limited
generalizability, lack of member checking of qualitative results, and inadequate data to
answer Research Question 2.

76
Chapter 4: Results
Chapter 3 presented the method employed to examine the research questions of
this sequential explanatory mixed methods study. Chapter 4 presents the findings. The
purpose of this study was to determine whether instruction librarians in the United States
and Canada were using ID methods, and to identify potential explanations for their
adoption or rejection of those methods. The research questions that guided the study are
as follows:
1. What is the relationship between respondents’ behavioral, normative, and
control beliefs and their reported use of ID methods when designing IL instruction?
2. How do various demographic factors, such as prior education or experience in
ID, the length of professional work experience, primary job function, and educational
level relate to instruction librarians’ use of ID methods when designing IL instruction?
3. Do librarians who self-identify as teachers use ID methods to create IL
instruction more than those who do not?
4. Why do instruction librarians adopt or reject ID methods to create IL
instruction?
5. In what ways do the qualitative data confirm or support the quantitative data?
These questions are recapitulated below and serve as the organizing structure for
the chapter.
In order to gather data for the quantitative portion of the study, the PI developed
ILBIS, a two-part survey designed to measure subjects’ intention to use ID methods. An
electronic version of ILBIS was created and placed on the SurveyMonkey server, and a
link to it was posted on the ALA’s Information Literacy Instruction Discussion List for

77
four weeks. At the conclusion of the survey, a total of 126 individuals had responded. Of
this number, five were eliminated because they did not work in academic libraries in the
United States or Canada, and one was eliminated because he or she had no IL teaching
responsibilities. A further 19 were eliminated because their surveys were incomplete,
leaving 101 usable surveys.
Section I of ILBIS contained demographic questions adapted from an instrument
used by Julien and Genuis (2011) to explore Canadian librarians’ attitudes toward
teaching. Responses to questions in Section I are summarized in the Participant
Demographics section of this chapter. Section II of ILBIS was adapted from Ajjan and
Hartshorne’s (2008) survey. Responses to questions in Section II are organized by
research question and summarized below.
In order to gather data for the qualitative portion of the project, the PI developed a
series of telephone interview questions designed to explore participants’ reasons for using
or not using ID methods to design IL instruction. This instrument consisted of seven open
form questions, four of which were adapted from the instrument created by Julien and
Genuis (2011), and three of which were developed by the PI.
Participant Demographics
Responses to questions on Section I of ILBIS are summarized in Tables 3
through 9. The questions in this section were intended to explore participants’
educational backgrounds, professional experience, professional identity, practices related
to ID, and attitudes about the use of ID. The initial question, which asked subjects
whether or not they worked in an academic library in the United States or Canada, was
intended only to establish participants’ eligibility to complete the survey; thus, its results

78
will not be analyzed.
ILBIS question 2, which asked subjects what percentage of their jobs were
devoted to IL instruction, was included not only to determine the amount of time subjects
spent on IL instruction, but also to eliminate the surveys of those who had no teaching
responsibilities; one survey was eliminated in this fashion. A total of 29 (29%) subjects
indicated that up to 50% of their jobs were devoted to IL instruction, compared to 72
(71%) for whom IL duties comprised more than 50% of their job duties.
Professional experience was one participant characteristic explored in Section I.
The largest number of subjects, 77 (76%), had been working in libraries between two and
20 years, as shown in Table 3. Fifteen (15%) had fewer than two years’ experience
working in libraries, whereas only 9 (9%) had greater than 21 years’ experience.

Sixty-eight subjects (67%) reported teaching IL in libraries between two and 20
years, as shown in Table 4. An almost identical number of subjects had worked in
libraries between 11 and 20 years (53%) as had taught IL during the same range of years
(54%). More subjects (23%) had worked in libraries between two and 10 years than had
taught IL during that same time (13%). Twenty-one subjects (21%) had taught IL for 21
years or more, while 12 (12%) had taught IL for fewer than two years.

Another characteristic explored in Section I was that of educational background.
Table 5 provides a summary of subjects’ educational attainment. As expected, all subjects
held a Master of Library and Information Science or equivalent university degree, while
36 (36%) also held subject master’s degrees. Only four subjects (4%) reported having a
doctorate. Responses to ILBIS question 6, which asked subjects with doctoral,
specialist’s, or subject master’s degrees to indicate their discipline or major, revealed
that, of those individuals who possessed a subject master’s degree (n = 36), 13 (32.5%)
had degrees in the discipline of English or related fields, six (15%) in instructional

technology or design, and a further six (15%) in education or related fields.
One of the central questions addressed by the study was the extent to which
subjects used ID methods when designing IL instruction. As shown in Table 6, 48
subjects (48%) either never or rarely used ID methods when creating IL instruction,
while 39 (39%) either frequently or always did so. A further 14 (14%) used these
methods about half the time.

The study also sought to determine the specific ID methods used by subjects.
Table 7 summarizes subjects’ reported use of various ID methods. Twenty-seven subjects
(27%) reported using no ID method, and 12 (12%) indicated that they used multiple
methods for creating IL instruction. The most popular methods used were Bloom’s
Taxonomy (36%) and ADDIE (13%). One subject (1%) reported using the Morrison,
Ross, Kemp, and Kalman (2012) model, and one other (1%) used Merrill’s (2002) first
principles of instruction. None of the subjects reported using Gagné’s (2007) nine events
of instruction or the Dick, Carey, and Carey (2009) model.

Subjects’ conception of their professional roles was also of interest to the study.
As shown in Table 8, 70 subjects (69%) indicated that they identified primarily as
librarians in their current role, while only 31 (31%) identified primarily as teachers.

Finally, the main ways in which subjects reported being trained in using ID
methods are summarized in Table 9. Twenty-nine subjects (29%) had learned ID
primarily through on-the-job training, 26 (26%) learned ID primarily in an academic
setting, 20 (20%) listed workshops or other hands-on training as the main way in which

82
they learned ID, and 22 (22%) had never received training.

Research Question 1

What is the relationship between respondents’ behavioral, normative, and control
beliefs and their reported use of ID methods when designing IL instruction? In order to
answer this question, Pearson r correlations were calculated between the means of the
behavioral, normative, and control construct scores and values for ILBIS question 7,
which asked subjects to indicate the degree to which they used ID methods when
designing IL instruction. The results of these correlations are summarized in Table 10.

Behavioral construct scores, calculated by averaging the scores from ILBIS

83
questions 12 through 19, measured “the degree to which performance of the behavior is
positively or negatively valued” (Ajzen, 2006, Attitude Toward the Behavior section,
para. 1). In this study, the behavior in question is the use of ID methods to create IL
instruction. The Pearson r = .56 (df = 99, p < .0001) indicated that there was a significant
positive relationship between subjects’ behavioral beliefs and their reported use of ID
methods when designing IL instruction. We may conclude from this that subjects who
had positive attitudes toward using ID methods were more likely to use them to design IL
instruction.
Normative construct scores, calculated by averaging the scores from ILBIS
questions 20 through 25, measured “the perceived social pressure to engage or not to
engage in a behavior” (Ajzen, 2006, Subjective Norm section, para. 1), the behavior in
this case being the use of ID methods to create IL instruction. The Pearson r = .53 (df =
99, p < .0001) indicated that there is also a significant positive relationship between
subjects’ normative beliefs and their reported use of ID methods when designing IL
instruction. Subjects who perceive social pressure to use ID methods, therefore, are more
likely to use them in developing IL instruction.
Control construct scores, calculated by averaging the scores from ILBIS questions
26 through 31, measured “the perceived presence of factors that may facilitate or impede
performance of a behavior” (Ajzen, 2006, Control Beliefs section, para. 1), specifically,
in this study, the use of ID methods to create IL instruction. Once again, the Pearson r =
.59 (df = 99, p < .0001) indicated that there is a significant positive relationship between
subjects’ control beliefs and their reported use of ID methods when designing IL
instruction. This positive relationship suggests that subjects who believe that using ID

84
methods is within their control are likely to use them.
Research Question 2
How do various demographic factors, such as prior education or experience in ID,
the length of professional work experience, primary job function, and educational level
relate to instruction librarians’ use of ID methods when designing IL instruction? In order
to answer this question, the PI intended to use χ2 comparisons between ILBIS questions 7
(To what extent do you use instructional design methods when designing information
literacy instruction?) and 10 (What is the main way in which you have been trained in
using instructional design methods?) with ILBIS questions 3 (How long have you been
working in libraries?), 4 (How long have you been teaching information literacy in
libraries?), 5 (What is your educational background? Please check all that apply) and 6 (If
you have a doctorate, a specialist’s degree, or a subject master’s, please indicate your
discipline or major below). Chi-square analyses between ILBIS question 7 and ILBIS
questions 3 and 4 were performed, and have been analyzed below. The survey did not
yield enough data to calculate correlations between ILBIS question 7 and ILBIS
questions 5 and 6, however. Instead, the χ2 analyses were calculated between ILBIS
question 7 and ILBIS question 10. The results of these calculations are summarized in
Tables 11 through 13.
Because there were insufficient responses in some of the four response categories
(fewer than 2 years, between 2 and 10 years, between 11 and 20 years, and 21 years or
more) for ILBIS questions 3 and 4, the categories were collapsed into two groups for
analysis: subjects with ten years’ experience or fewer, and subjects with 11 years’
experience or more.

85
Length of time working in libraries. The results for the χ2 calculation between
ILBIS question 7, which asked subjects to rate the extent to which they used instructional
design methods when designing IL instruction, and ILBIS question 3, which asked them
how long they had been working in libraries, are summarized in Table 11.

ILBIS question 10 had five response categories: On-the-job training, Formal
academic courses in instructional design, Workshops or other hands-on training, I have
never been trained to use instructional design methods, and Other—please specify. In
order to calculate χ2, observations in each cell must be greater than five; since only four
subjects chose the Other category, their responses were assigned to one of the other
categories to avoid insufficient numbers in cell data. This reassignment was based on an
analysis of subjects’ responses to other questions; for example, one subject who chose the

87
Other category had a degree in ID, and was therefore reassigned to the Formal academic
courses in instructional design category.
Despite category reassignment, there remained three cells with fewer than five
observations. Accordingly, Yates’s correction for continuity (Furr, 2010; Preacher, 2001)
was applied. The data were calculated to include the Yates χ2 value (24.59, p(6) = .0004).
The χ2 = 24.59 (df = 6, p < .0001) indicates that there is a significant relationship between
the use of ID and the reported type of training received.
Research Question 3
Do librarians who self-identify as teachers use ID methods to create IL instruction
more than those who do not? To answer this question, a one-tailed t test for independent
sample means was calculated between mean scores of self-identified teachers and of selfidentified librarians on question 7, which asked subjects to rate the extent to which they
used ID methods when designing IL instruction. Table 14 summarizes the results of the t
test.

88
Research Question 4
Why do instruction librarians adopt or reject ID methods to create IL instruction?
In order to answer this qualitative question, responses to the interview questions were
reviewed for themes related to this topic.
Reasons for using ID methods. Interview participants provided a range of
reasons for using ID methods when creating IL instruction. One participant who always
used ID methods indicated that they were simply the most appropriate tools to design
instruction. “If you had a Swiss Army knife in your toolkit,” he said, “and you needed to
whittle something, why wouldn’t you take it out?” The same participant gave the opinion
that using ID methods resulted in instruction that was more learner centered. “The
learners become a lot more central when you start thinking about designing a class,
because then it becomes about student learning, and it becomes about their experience.”
Another participant who always used ID methods reported that the teaching role
of librarians was valued both in her workplace and by her supervisor. “The environment
which I’m in now very much values teaching,” she said. “I have non tenure track faculty
status, and my boss also is very much about the teaching.” A frequent user of ID methods
said, “I use them because I want to be doing best practices in my field.” Another
participant, who always used ID methods, stated simply that “I always do it because it’s
the right thing to do.”
Three (43%) of the seven participants stated that they used ID methods
unconsciously. For example, one participant who used ID methods about half the time
said, “I think I don’t necessarily always know that I’m doing it, like it’s not necessarily a
conscious thing.” In two instances, participants stated that they allowed what they had

89
learned of ID methods to inform their intuition and proceeded to design instruction on
that basis, rather than applying ID methods in a formal way. “It’s not a laborious, theoryladen process with me,” said one librarian who always used ID methods. The other
participant who intuitively applied ID methods stated, “When I read about [ID methods],
I’m like, ‘Oh, I do that—that’s great!’ But I don’t always remember what it’s called, or
anything like that.” She went on to say that “the names of things are not necessarily at the
top of my brain.” This participant indicated that she used ID methods about half the time.
The one other participant who reported unconsciously using ID stated that she always
used ID methods. She said that “I realized through stumbling around for many years that
I was doing instructional design; I was just unaware of it.” She went on to explain that,
in library school . . . , I had one class where we learned that backward design
model, and even then, I don’t think it was taught to me as being called
instructional design. It was called backward design, but I didn’t realize that that
was instructional design. So I guess I did kind of know about it, and I was actually
educated in it, but I didn’t know that that’s what the official name was.
Reasons for not using ID methods. Five of the seven participants offered
reasons for not using ID methods to create IL instruction. Four of the five mentioned a
single factor that inhibited their creating IL instruction using ID methods: time. One
participant who frequently used ID methods captured the frustration shared by several
others when she mentioned that, on the occasions that she did not use them, it was
“because an instructor shows up and says, ‘Oh, can you come to my class in five
minutes?’” Another participant, who rarely used ID, coined the phrase, “surprise
instruction” to refer to these eleventh hour requests.
Two participants stated that, when pressed for time, they depended on their
experience with ID methods to inform impromptu teaching, echoing others who said they
typically applied ID methods intuitively to the creation of IL instruction. “In my previous

90
position, sometimes you did just have to wing it because you didn’t have a chance to
prep. [But] I wasn’t really winging it,” one participant who always used ID methods said
of instruction for which she had little time to prepare. “It was because I’d done it so much
that I was able to tailor the instruction.” A frequent user of ID methods stated that,
when I have a short amount of time, and it’s got to be done fast, I just rely on
experience and what is it that I need to do, and how can I do this as quickly as
possible. If it’s a bigger, longer project, then I really do try to sit down and work it
out, and make sure that I am covering all my bases and I am doing it as best I can.
One participant expressed the opinion that using ID methods to design brief
instruction was unnecessary. “Since I’ve been doing it for such a long time,” he said,
“some of the simpler stuff doesn’t require it.” He reported using ID methods about half
the time. In contrast, another participant, who rarely used ID methods, stated that “I
would tend to use [them] especially when I’m pressed for time.” He went on to explain
that
in a 50-minute session, I feel it’s especially critical to [use ID methods]. The cases
when I don’t go through at least that kind of minimal design process . . . would
usually be the surprise instruction sessions that pop up. In almost all other cases,
I’ll at least scribble down some objectives.
Two of the participants, both of whom frequently used ID methods, reported that
their instruction was in some instances designed by someone else. In one of these cases, a
librarian at a branch campus taught an IL course that had been designed by someone at
the main campus. The other participant explained that when she was teaching students to
find information on a subject with which she was unfamiliar, she made use of a
repository of predesigned IL lesson plans on various topics compiled by librarians at her
institution, rather than designing the instruction herself.

Research Question 5
In what ways do the qualitative data confirm or support the quantitative data? In
order to answer this mixed methods question, results from the quantitative questions
contained in ILBIS were compared to responses to the qualitative interview questions to
identify any areas of validation or disconnect. Responses to the qualitative questions were
examined for common themes that confirmed or disconfirmed the conclusions of the
quantitative data. Qualitative data related to Research Question 1, which sought to
determine the relationship between respondents’ behavioral, normative, and control
beliefs and their reported use of ID methods when designing IL instruction, were
gathered during the interviews and are compared to quantitative data for that question in
the paragraphs below. No qualitative data related to participants’ demographic
characteristics were obtained; therefore, this section will not address Research Question
2, which sought to determine how various demographic factors, such as prior education
or experience in ID, the length of professional work experience, primary job function, or
educational level relate to instruction librarians’ use of ID when designing IL instruction.
Because all seven participants (100%) strongly identified as teachers, comparison of
quantitative and qualitative data for Research Question 3, which attempted to establish
whether librarians who self-identify as teachers use ID methods to create IL instruction
more than those who do not, would be meaningless, and was not attempted.
Analysis of quantitative data for Research Question 1 found that behavioral
beliefs, which form the basis for one’s attitudes toward a behavior, had a significant
positive relationship with subjects’ reported use of ID methods when designing IL
instruction. Attitude is defined as “the degree to which performance of the behavior is

92
positively or negatively valued” (Ajzen, 2006, Attitude Toward the Behavior section,
para. 1). In interviews, participants named eight factors that suggested they positively
valued the use of ID methods: the beliefs that (a) ID methods produce better learning
outcomes, (b) using ID methods results in instruction that is more learner centered, (c)
using ID methods is a solution to instructional challenges, and (d) using ID methods
gives structure to IL instruction. Further factors identified were having undertaken (e)
courses in ID, (f) the ACRL Immersion Program (ACRL, 2015), (g) professional
development in ID, and (h) an academic degree in ID. Table 15 relates the frequency of
use of ID methods (i.e., rarely, about half the time, frequently, and always) with the
above mentioned attitude factors.

The one participant who rarely used ID methods mentioned none of the attitude
factors identified. The participants who used ID methods about half the time mentioned
two of the factors, those who frequently used ID methods mentioned four of the factors,

93
and those who always used these methods mentioned nine of the factors. Thus, the
number of attitude factors present increased with the frequency of participants’ use of ID
methods. These qualitative data tend to support the conclusion reached in the quantitative
portion of the study that behavioral beliefs were positively correlated with subjects’ use
of ID methods when designing IL instruction.
Quantitative analysis of survey data indicated that normative beliefs, defined as
“the perceived social pressure to engage or not to engage in a behavior” (Ajzen, 2006,
Subjective Norm section, para. 1), had a significant positive relationship with subjects’
reported use of ID methods when designing IL instruction. Only two interview
participants commented on normative factors that may have played a part in their
decision to use ID methods. One participant who always used ID methods stated that
their use was favored by her supervisor, and that teaching was valued in her professional
environment. Another participant, who used ID methods about half the time, indicated
that, as the head of the instruction department, he set the norms regarding use of ID
methods for other librarians. Given the paucity of qualitative data about normative
beliefs, it is difficult to determine the extent to which they support the quantitative data;
nevertheless, what data there are support the conclusions of the quantitative portion of the
study.
Analysis of the quantitative data revealed that control beliefs, defined as “the
perceived presence of factors that may facilitate or impede performance of a behavior”
(Ajzen, 2006, Control Beliefs section, para. 1), also had a significant positive relationship
with subjects’ reported use of ID methods when designing IL instruction. Participants,
then, were found to be more likely to use ID methods to create IL instruction if they

94
believed that using those methods was within their control. As mentioned earlier, one of
the main impediments to the implementation of ID methods identified by participants was
lack of time. This factor was cited by one participant who rarely used ID methods, by one
who used ID methods about half the time, by two who used ID methods frequently, and
by one who always used ID methods. The fact that lack of time was mentioned by
individuals at all points on the spectrum of ID use casts doubt on the conclusion that the
presence of this impeding factor actually discouraged the use of ID methods.
The other factor identified by participants as inhibiting their control over whether
or not they used ID methods was the fact that, in some instances, instruction was
designed by others. Still, both of the individuals who reported this to be the case said that
they used ID methods frequently. One of the individuals stated that her IL course was
designed by others, but that she was still free to design one-shot classroom presentations.
The other indicated that the use of lesson plans previously created by other librarians was
an option, but not mandatory. It would appear, then, that this factor did not significantly
impede these participants’ use of ID methods.
Summary
The purpose of this sequential explanatory mixed methods study was to determine
whether instruction librarians in the United States and Canada were using ID methods,
and to identify potential explanations for their adoption or rejection of those methods.
Survey data indicated that there was a significant positive relationship between
behavioral, normative, and control construct scores and the use of ID when designing IL
instruction. The highest correlation was for the control construct at .59. Analysis of
survey data also found that there is no significant relationship between the length of time

95
participants have been working in libraries and their reported use of ID methods, that
there is a significant relationship between the length of time teaching IL in libraries and
the use of ID methods, and that there is a significant relationship between the use of ID
and the reported type of training received. Further, subjects who identified primarily as
teachers used ID methods to create IL instruction at a significantly higher rate than those
who identified primarily as librarians.
The qualitative portion of the study explored interview participants’ reasons for
using ID methods. It was found that participants used ID methods because they were
considered the most appropriate tools to design instruction, because using them results in
instruction that is more learner centered, because librarians’ teaching role is valued in the
workplace and by a supervisor, and because participants desired to teach according to
best practices. The lack of time and the fact that instruction was sometimes designed by
someone other than the librarian were reasons given for not using ID methods.
The conclusion drawn from the quantitative data that there was a significant
positive relationship between behavioral and normative construct scores and the use of ID
was supported by the qualitative data. Quantitative data indicated a significant positive
relationship between participants’ control beliefs and their use of ID methods, but this
relationship was not supported by the qualitative data.

Chapter 5: Discussion
Chapter 4 presented the findings of the study. Chapter 5 provides an overview of
the study, summarizes and interprets the findings, discusses the context and implications
of the findings, and suggests directions for future research.
Overview of the Study
The purpose of this sequential explanatory mixed methods study was to determine
whether instruction librarians in the United States and Canada were using ID methods,
and to identify potential explanations for their adoption or rejection of those methods. A
survey (Appendix A) based on questions drawn from two instruments (Ajjan &
Hartshorne, 2008; Julien & Genuis, 2011) was developed to obtain quantitative data,
while telephone interview questions (Appendix B) partially adapted from Julien and
Genuis and designed to explore participants’ reasons for adopting or rejecting the use of
ID methods, was used to gather qualitative data. The TPB (Ajzen, 1985) served as the
theoretical framework for the study. This theory was chosen because of its demonstrated
ability to predict individuals’ behavior based on their behavioral, normative, and control
beliefs.
Of the 126 individuals who returned surveys, 25 were eliminated either because
they did not meet the inclusion criteria or because their surveys were incomplete, leaving
101 usable surveys. Twenty-four of the 101 survey subjects volunteered to be
interviewed; of this number, ten were chosen to be interviewed based on the extent to
which they reported using ID methods and the percentage of their jobs devoted to IL
instruction. Although 10 potential participants and nine alternates were identified, only
seven participants were ultimately surveyed. There were difficulties in recruiting subjects

97
who either rarely or never used ID methods to create IL instruction. The required number
of participants were found for the categories always, frequently, and about half the time;
of the 24 initial volunteers, four responded that they rarely used ID methods, while 3
responded that they never did. Only one individual who rarely used ID methods, and
none of the three who never did, responded to requests to be interviewed.
Summary of Findings
This section describes participant demographics and summarizes the results of the
survey and of the interviews.
Participant demographics. Experience working and teaching in libraries was a
characteristic of subjects explored using the survey. The majority of subjects, 23 (23%),
had worked in libraries between two and ten years. Fifteen subjects (15%) had fewer than
two years’ experience working in libraries, 54 (53%) had between 11 and 20 years’
experience, and 9 (9%) had greater than 21 years’ experience. Twelve subjects (12%) had
taught IL in libraries fewer than two years, 13 (13%) had between two and ten years’
teaching experience, 55 (54%) had between 11 and 20 years’ experience, and 21 (21%)
had taught in libraries for 21 years or more. When asked what percentage of their jobs
were devoted to IL instruction, 29 survey subjects (29%) reported a figure of up to 50%,
and 72 (71%) indicated that more than 50% of their duties involved instruction.
Educational attainment for the sample was somewhat greater than that reported by
the ALA for its members; 4 subjects (4%) in the present study possessed a doctorate, and
36 (36%) held subject master’s degrees, while the ALA reported that 4% of its members
had doctorates and 26% had other master’s degrees (ALA, 2014). Thirteen (33%) of the
subject master’s degrees held by individuals in the present study were in the discipline of

98
English or related fields, six (15%) were in instructional technology or design, and six
(15%) were in education or related fields.
A surprising number of subjects, 48 (48%), never or rarely used ID methods
when creating IL instruction. Thirty-nine (39%) frequently or always used them, and 14
(14%) used ID methods about half the time. Twenty-seven (27%) participants indicated
that they did not use any ID method, and 12 (12%) reported using multiple ID methods.
The majority of subjects, 70 (69%), indicated that they identified primarily as
librarians in their current role; 31 (31%) identified primarily as teachers. Twenty-nine
(29%) subjects listed on-the-job training as the primary method by which they learned ID
methods. Twenty-six (26%) learned ID primarily through academic courses, 20 (20%)
indicated that workshops or other hands-on training had been their primary means of
learning ID, and 22 (22%) had never received any ID training.
Research Question 1. What is the relationship between respondents’ behavioral,
normative, and control beliefs and their reported use of ID methods when designing IL
instruction? This research question attempted to determine whether subjects’ beliefs
about using ID methods influenced their decision to use or not to use those methods to
design IL instruction. The three beliefs examined were as follows: (a) behavioral beliefs,
which are an individual’s perception of the consequences of performing a certain action;
(b) normative beliefs, or the perception of others’ approval or disapproval of that action;
and (c) control beliefs, which are an individual’s perception of whether there are either
stumbling blocks in the way of performing the action, or factors that would help them to
perform it (Ajzen, 1985). When the quantitative data were analyzed, it was found that all
three of these beliefs were moderately correlated with a subject’s subsequent

99
performance of the action in question, which is the use of ID methods to design IL
instruction. In other words, the more subjects believed that there were positive
consequences associated with the action, that others approved of it, and that they could
control whether or not they performed it, the more likely they were actually to perform it.
Subjects’ control beliefs were more strongly correlated with whether or not they
performed the action than either behavioral or normative beliefs.
Research Question 2. How do various demographic factors, such as prior
education or experience in ID, the length of professional work experience, primary job
function, or educational level relate to instruction librarians’ use of ID when designing IL
instruction? Because responses to questions in part one of the survey were insufficient to
answer this research question, the analyses that were originally proposed could not be
carried out. Instead, alternative analyses were performed to determine whether subjects’
use of ID methods was related to (a) the length of time they had worked in libraries, (b)
the length of time they had taught IL in libraries, and (c) the type of training they had
received in ID. According to these analyses, there was no relationship between the length
of time working in libraries and use of ID methods. There were, however, positive
relationships between the use of ID and the other two factors. The longer subjects had
taught in libraries, the more likely they were to use ID methods when designing IL
instruction. Also, subjects used ID methods either more or less depending upon the type
of ID training they had received.
Research Question 3. Do librarians who self-identify as teachers use ID methods
to create IL instruction more than those who do not? On the survey, subjects were asked
whether they identified primarily as teachers or as librarians at their current jobs, and

100
were divided into two groups based on their answers to this question. The subjects were
also asked about the extent to which they used ID methods to create IL instruction. When
the two groups were compared in terms of their answers to the latter question, it was
found that the teacher-identified subjects reported using ID methods to a much greater
extent than the librarian-identified subjects.
Research Question 4. Why do instruction librarians adopt or reject ID methods
to create IL instruction? Participants in the telephone interviews were asked why they
chose to use or not to use ID methods to create IL instruction. They provided the
following reasons for using ID methods: (a) they are the most appropriate tools to design
instruction, (b) using these methods results in learner centered instruction, (c) librarians’
teaching role is valued in the workplace, (d) teaching is valued by a supervisor, and (e)
the methods are consistent with best practices. The lack of time and the fact that
instruction was sometimes designed by someone other than the librarian were reasons
given for not using ID methods.
Research Question 5. In what ways do the qualitative data confirm or support the
quantitative data? This question was answered by comparing comments made by
interview participants to the results of the survey to see whether the former confirmed or
contradicted the latter. The content of the interviews amply supported the conclusion of
the survey analysis that behavioral beliefs were directly correlated with the use of ID
methods; that is, the higher one’s score on the behavioral questions of ILBIS, the greater
one’s tendency to use ID methods.
The comparison weakly supported the correlation between normative beliefs and
the use of ID methods. Only two participants discussed normative factors in relation to

101
their use of ID methods, thus there were little data to analyze. Nevertheless, the data that
do exist confirm the conclusion that participants tended to use ID more often when others
approved of their doing so.
The comparison did not confirm the correlation between control beliefs and the
use of ID methods. Lack of control over the use of ID methods was discussed by four of
the seven participants, including those who used them rarely, about half the time,
frequently, and always. This suggested that instruction librarians across the board
perceived impediments to their use of ID methods, contrary to the expectation that only
those who rarely or never used them would cite obstacles to their use. Participants’
comments, even those who frequently or always used ID methods, about feeling
constrained in their ability to use them, tended to contradict the conclusions of the
quantitative data. This was significant in that the quantitative analysis showed that
control beliefs were most strongly correlated with ID use.
Interpretation of Findings
One of the goals of this study was to ascertain whether respondents’ behavioral,
normative, and control beliefs were related to their reported use of ID methods when
designing IL instruction. In order to determine this relationship, Pearson correlations
were calculated between values for ILBIS question 7, which asked subjects to rate the
extent to which they used ID methods when designing IL instruction, and the means of
the behavioral, normative, and control construct scores. Analysis of these quantitative
results indicated that there was indeed a significant positive relationship between
behavioral, normative, and control construct scores and the use of ID when designing IL
instruction. The control construct had the highest correlation at .59. The correlation for

102
the behavioral construct was .56, and for the normative construct, it was .53. According
to the quantitative data, then, ID use was correlated most strongly with control beliefs,
followed by behavioral and normative beliefs.
These conclusions were largely supported by the qualitative data. Examination of
interview transcripts suggested that a positive attitude (one of the features of the
behavioral construct) toward the use of ID methods was associated with an increase in
their use. This supported the conclusion reached in the quantitative analysis that
behavioral beliefs influenced participants’ decision to use ID methods. Participants
identified factors that suggested they positively valued the use of ID methods; the more
that they used ID methods, the more of these factors they mentioned during their
interviews. Quantitative data also indicated that normative beliefs had a significant
positive relationship with subjects’ reported use of ID methods when designing IL
instruction. Although only two interview participants mentioned normative beliefs, their
commentary supported the conclusion of the quantitative data.
Analysis of the quantitative data also showed a significant positive relationship
between participants’ control beliefs and their use of ID methods. Interestingly, however,
when examining the interview transcripts, subjects’ control beliefs were found to have
little relationship with their decision to use or not to use ID methods. The main factor
cited as an impediment to participants’ control over their use of ID methods was lack of
time; this factor was mentioned by participants who used ID methods rarely, about half
the time, frequently, and always. Although it was expected that inhibiting factors would
be cited mainly by those who never or rarely used ID methods, the qualitative data found
that these factors were ubiquitous. These data suggested that instruction librarians across

103
the board perceived time as an impediment to their use of ID methods, and tended to
disconfirm the conclusions of the quantitative data. This discrepancy may be explained
by a possible flaw in the behavioral control construct of the TPB identified by Trafimow
et al. (2002), and discussed more fully in the Implications of Findings section of this
chapter. It may also be possible that perceived behavioral control may be less predictive
of behavior in certain situations, as suggested by Armitage and Conner (2001), who
wrote that
in situations where (for example) attitudes are strong, or where normative
influences are powerful, PBC may be less predictive of intentions. Thus . . . the
magnitude of the PBC-intention relationship is dependent upon the type of
behaviour and the nature of the situation. Indirect evidence for this claim has been
demonstrated in studies that have shown that measures of attitude strength . . . and
individual differences in sociability . . . increase the relative predictive power of
attitudes and subjective norms, respectively. (p. 472)
The study also sought to determine the relationship between ID use and subjects’
demographic characteristics. Since responses were insufficient to establish these
relationships, the χ2 calculations designed to analyze them could not be carried out as
originally proposed. Instead, alternative χ2 analyses were calculated that revealed the
following: (a) there is no significant relationship between the length of time participants
have been working in libraries and their reported use of ID methods, (b) there is a
significant relationship between the length of time teaching IL in libraries and the use of
ID methods, and (c) there is a significant relationship between the use of ID and the
reported type of training received. Thus, subjects who had taught IL for longer periods of
time were more likely to use ID to design IL instruction. Subjects who had had academic
training in ID were the most likely to use ID methods, while those who had never had any
instruction were the least likely to use them.

104
Why was there no significant relationship between the lengths of time subjects
had worked in libraries and their use of ID? One possible answer may lie in the fact that
there is such a wide variety of specialties in academic librarianship. Besides reference
and instruction librarians, there are catalogers, acquisitions librarians, circulation
librarians, systems librarians, special collections librarians, music librarians, law
librarians, and map librarians, to name a few. It is entirely possible that many subjects
spent a portion of their careers in one of these areas, in which the word instruction is
barely breathed, before being thrust into an instructional role.
In order to discover whether librarians who self-identified as teachers used ID
methods to create IL instruction more than those who did not, a one-tailed t test for
independent sample means was calculated between mean scores of self-identified
teachers and of self-identified librarians on question 7, which asked subjects to rate the
extent to which they used ID methods when designing IL instruction. The t test revealed
that the former used ID methods to create IL instruction at a significantly higher rate than
the latter. As already mentioned, 100% of the interview participants identified as
teachers, and all had varying rates of ID use; therefore, no conclusions can be drawn
about whether the quantitative data is supported by qualitative data.
When asked why they adopt or reject ID methods to create IL instruction,
interview participants gave a variety of responses. One participant stated that he used ID
methods because they were the most appropriate tools to design instruction, and that
using ID methods results in instruction that is more learner centered. Another participant
indicated that, in her workplace, librarians’ teaching role is valued by a supervisor. The
desire to teach according to best practices was given as a reason for the adoption of ID

105
methods by another participant. The lack of time and the fact that instruction was
sometimes designed by someone other than the librarian were reasons given for not using
ID methods.
Context of Findings
Although much has been written about ways in which librarians can use ID
methods to create IL instruction, no research to date has been identified that specifically
establishes whether, and the extent to which, instruction librarians actually use ID
methods. Prior studies mainly focused on practical aspects of using ID models and
learning theories to create IL instruction. For example, the use of models such as ADDIE
(Booth, 2011; Chang & Siao, 2012; Colborn, 2011; A. L. Davis, 2013; B. E. Fox &
Doherty, 2011; Koneru, 2010; Kumar et al., 2012; Stern & Kaur, 2010; Summey &
Valenti, 2013; Willis, 2011a, 2011b), Morrison, Ross, Kemp, and Kalman (Summey &
Valenti, 2013), and Dick, Carey, and Carey (Mestre et al., 2011) to create IL instruction
have been described in the literature.
Other authors have focused on using behavioral (Blummer et al., 2010; Bobish,
2011; Stiwinter, 2013) and constructivist (Blummer et al., 2010; Bobish, 2011; Colborn,
2011; Koneru, 2010; Magnuson, 2012; Rand, 2013; Willis, 2011b) learning theories as
guides to creating IL instruction. The use of ID methods to create DLOs has also been
detailed (Anderson & Mitchell, 2012; B. E. Fox & Doherty, 2011; Gunn & Miree, 2012;
Markey et al., 2011; Mestre et al., 2011; Stiwinter, 2013; Sult et al., 2013; Tooman &
Sibthorpe, 2012). The present study extended this prior research by focusing on the
fundamental question of whether, and to what extent, instruction librarians used ID
methods to create IL instruction.

106
Implications of Findings
The findings of the study have several practical implications. Library educators
may be able to use these findings to design or redesign library school curricula. The
insights gained in the study could shed light on why individuals may be reluctant to use
ID methods, and educators could design instruction to address impediments to using ID.
Similarly, library administrators might use the findings to design professional
development experiences. Future researchers will benefit from having a starting point for
research into the numbers of instruction librarians using ID and their reasons for using it.
The findings also call into question whether the TPB (Ajzen, 1985), as currently
conceived, accurately predicts intention and behavior. Trafimow et al. (2002)
hypothesized that the construct of perceived behavioral control might more usefully be
viewed as two separate constructs, those of perceived control and perceived difficulty.
They distinguished between these two constructs in the following way: “Perceived
control refers to the extent to which people consider the performance of a behaviour to be
under their voluntary control. Perceived difficulty refers to whether people consider a
behaviour to be easy or difficult to perform” (p. 101). The findings of Trafimow et al.
supported separating the construct, and suggested that perceived difficulty better
predicted intention and behavior than perceived control.
The discrepancy between the quantitative and qualitative data for Research
Question 1, specifically the conclusion drawn from the quantitative data that the control
construct was the greatest determinant of ID use and the failure of the qualitative data to
confirm that conclusion, may be explained by the hypothesis put forth by Trafimow et al.
(2002). Because the present study did not differentiate between perceived control and

107
perceived difficulty, it is impossible to determine how survey subjects or interview
participants would have scored on measures of these constructs. Still, when interviewed
about their control beliefs, the main impediment to using ID methods participants cited
was lack of time, which would seem to refer to the perceived control construct in the
scheme suggested by Trafimow et al. It is worth noting that not one participant indicated
that they refrained from using ID methods because it was too difficult to do so. These
observations suggest that the predictive power of the TPB (Ajzen, 1985) might be
improved by splitting the control construct into two separate constructs, as described by
Trafimow et al.
Future Directions
Future researchers might address the three major questions that were left
unresolved by this study. First, the study failed to establish a relationship between
respondents’ control beliefs and their use of ID methods; the quantitative and qualitative
data for Research Question 1, which sought to determine the relationship between
respondents’ behavioral, normative, and control beliefs and their reported use of ID
methods, appear to contradict each other. While quantitative data indicated that the
control construct was most strongly correlated with use of ID methods, qualitative data
suggested otherwise. One explanation for this discrepancy is that the control construct of
the TPB (Ajzen, 1985) may not adequately predict behavioral intention. Future
researchers may wish to explore whether behavioral intention is better predicted when the
control construct is split into two separate constructs, those of perceived control and
perceived difficulty.
Second, Research Question 2 could not fully be answered due to lack of data. This

108
research question attempted to establish how various demographic factors, such as prior
education or experience in ID, the length of professional work experience, primary job
function, and educational level relate to instruction librarians’ use of ID methods when
designing IL instruction. Because the data were inadequate, it is still unknown whether
there are correlations between ID use and (a) primary job function and (b) educational
level. Future research might establish correlations between ID use and these or other
factors.
Third, comparison of quantitative and qualitative data for Research Question 3,
which aimed to determine whether librarians who self-identify as teachers use ID
methods to create IL instruction more than those who do not, was not possible due to the
fact that 100% of participants identified as teachers. Future researchers might pay special
attention to the recruitment of interview participants who identify primarily as librarians.
Comparison of the qualitative responses of both these groups to quantitative data would
strengthen the conclusions drawn in this study.
The attitude factors identified in Research Question 5 (Table 15) could be used to
guide further qualitative inquiry about behavioral beliefs. Questions based on these
factors could be formulated and used to predict the likelihood that subjects will use ID
methods.
Finally, replicating the study using a random sampling procedure, rather than
convenience sampling, would strengthen the results, as would increasing the sample size.
Member checking of qualitative results would ensure their validity.
Summary
The purpose of this sequential explanatory mixed methods study was to determine

109
whether instruction librarians in the United States and Canada were using ID methods,
and to identify potential explanations for their adoption or rejection of those methods. In
this chapter, the findings of the study were summarized and discussed.
Quantitative analysis found that there was a significant relationship between
behavioral, normative, and control beliefs and the use of ID methods. High control
construct scores were most strongly correlated with ID use, although qualitative data did
not confirm this conclusion.
No relationship was found between the length of time working in libraries and use
of ID methods. Positive relationships were, however, identified between use of ID and
two other factors: the length of time subjects had taught in libraries, and the type of
training they had received in ID. Individuals who primarily identified as teachers were
also found to be more likely to use ID methods than those who primarily identified as
librarians.
When interview participants were asked why they used ID methods, they gave the
following reasons: (a) they are the most appropriate tools to design instruction, (b) using
these methods results in learner centered instruction, (c) librarians’ teaching role is
valued in the workplace, (d) teaching is valued by a supervisor, and (e) the methods are
consistent with best practices. When asked why they declined to use ID methods, they
replied that they often lacked the time to do so, and also said that instruction was
sometimes designed by someone else.
Interpretations of the findings were provided, and possible reasons for
discrepancies between quantitative and qualitative findings were offered. Findings were
examined in the context of existing literature on the topic, theoretical and practical

110
implications were discussed, and recommendations for future research were made.

Dear colleagues,
I am a doctoral student at Nova Southeastern University, and I am completing a
dissertation that explores instruction librarians’ use of instructional design techniques (for
example: ADDIE, Gagné’s Nine Events of Instruction, Bloom’s Taxonomy, etc.). Please
consider participating in my research by completing a brief (approximately 15 minute)
survey.
The survey is open to academic librarians who conduct any kind instructional activity, so
whether you only provide an occasional 50-minute information literacy session or you
regularly teach credit-bearing courses, this survey is for you! Even if you do NOT use
instructional design techniques, your participation is welcome—and important! The
survey results will be used to inform the practice and future research of instruction
librarians, instructional designers, and library educators.
To access the survey, please click the link below, or copy and paste the URL into your
browser’s address bar:
https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ILBISsurvey
A response by February 23, 2015 would be most appreciated. Thank you for your
willingness to complete the survey!
Sincerely,
Michael W. Wilson
Nova Southeastern University
