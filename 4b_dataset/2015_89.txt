THESIS ABSTRACT
Tara Elena Samson Puyat
Master of Arts

March 2015
Title: “The Gradual” at Oregon State University: A Rough Guide to Assessing the
Identity of a Late Roman Catholic Chant Book
In the 1930s, Oregon State University received an impressive oversized
manuscript, now known as “The Gradual,” as part of a large donation of books. Not much
was known about this manuscript. It does not have documentation attached from the time
of its acquisition, nor had any methodical study been undertaken regarding the
manuscript. This thesis examines the OSU Gradual, aiming to provide research tools for
the identification of musical manuscripts of unknown or unclear provenance that could be
useful to conservators, archivists, and librarians, irrespective of musical training. It is
conceived as a “rough guide” for working situations where there is no dedicated
manuscript specialist, in particular, a fulltime Latin paleographer or a chant scholar
overseeing a massive collection. Instead, its “how-to” nature addresses curators and
catalogers managing smaller manuscript collections as generalists, offering an
interdisciplinary approach both beneficial and suitable to the aims of this study.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
History
From 1932 to 1936, Oregon State University (then Oregon State College)
received several large donations of books from Mary McDonald (ca. 1850-1936), a
philanthropist who had inherited, and later sold, large holdings of Oregon timberland
from her husband James L. McDonald.1 This wealthy patroness discovered, to her
dismay, that OSU did not have a significant collection of rare books. She decided to
provide the library with a collection of many fine and rare volumes through the services
of San Francisco book dealer, Agnes Gheraghty.2 The focus of the collection was to be
“classics of literature, history, art and science” that would allow students to develop an
appreciation for “fine printing, binding and illustrations.”3 In time, the collection grew to
be so large – over 2,400 volumes – that McDonald provided funds for a reading room in
which to house it.
One of the volumes included in this substantial donation is an impressive
oversized manuscript. This leather bound volume consists of over 200 leaves of
parchment primarily containing Latin liturgical chant. Not much was known about this
manuscript until recently, and it does not appear to have documentation attached to it

from the time of its acquisition. Originally thought to be an antiphonal, a collection of
chants sung during the celebration of the Divine Office, Dr. Tharald Borgir, chair of the
OSU Department of Music from 1987 to 1993, later identified the manuscript as a
gradual, that is, a volume containing chants sung during the celebration of the Roman
Catholic Mass.4 No methodical study had been undertaken regarding this manuscript,
although general dates and origins were put forth on the OSU Valley Library Special
Collections website which describes the book as, “probably hand-printed and illuminated
in 13th-century manuscript by a 15th-century Flemish monk.”5
In the spring of 2011, the Gradual was brought to the University of Oregon for
some repair work because of detaching pages and a loose clasp. The volume was restored
in the Beach Conservation Lab by senior conservation technician Marilyn Mohr who, at
the suggestion of music librarian Leslie Bennett, brought the book to the attention of
Professor Lori Kruckenberg, member of the Musicology faculty and medieval music
specialist. When she examined the book, Kruckenberg questioned the proposed dating of
13th-century and found the volume to be worth investigating. When the OSU university
archivist Larry Landis expressed interest in a possible research project, the OSU volume
became the focus of a research assignment for Kruckenberg’s seminar on medieval and
Renaissance notation in the winter term of 2012. The class was given the task of making
an inventory of the volume’s contents in order to help identify when the book might have
originated. At that time Professor Alejandro Planchart, a specialist on the music of the

Middle Ages and early Renaissance, was in residence as a Robert M. Trotter Visiting
Professor. In consultation with and under the guidance of Planchart and Kruckenberg, the
class came to the conclusion that the OSU Gradual contains only a portion of chants used
during the course of the liturgical year; specifically, the OSU Gradual is a Sanctorale
with no Commune sanctorum per se.6 Thus, this volume presents chants used in the
celebration of masses for specific saints’ feast days and does not have a separate section
for chants used commonly for multiple saints throughout the church year. This Sanctorale
handles the need to reuse chants by cross-referencing subsequent feasts to the mass of the
first saint day that utilized the chant. The initial findings of the class also proposed that
the manuscript is of Spanish origin, probably dating to the late 15th- or 16th-century with
many later additions, perhaps as late as the 18th and 19th centuries.
I was a member of that notation class and from the very beginning I was
fascinated with the manuscript. Given my interest in becoming a manuscript conservator,
I wanted to examine the OSU Gradual and work with the 500-year old volume in order to
discover more about its origins, as well as the life that it led in the intervening centuries.
This has resulted in my current focus on the OSU gradual for this thesis. In this
document, I will outline my journey and provide a tool that could be useful to
conservators, archivists, and librarians, who may or may not have musical training, for
the identification of musical manuscripts of unknown or unclear provenance. This study
is conceived as a “rough guide” for working situations where there is no dedicated
manuscript specialist, in particular a fulltime Latin paleographer or chant scholar
overseeing a massive collection as one might find at the Bodleian Library, the
Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, the Parker Library in Cambridge, or the Newberry

Library in Chicago. Instead, the how-to nature of this investigation addresses curators and
cataloguers who manage smaller manuscript collections as generalists. These special
collections often lack a cache with a central focus. For that reason, I offer an
interdisciplinary approach that may be both beneficial and suitable to the aims of this
study.

Framework
To date, monographs on Gregorian chant manuscripts of the Iberian Peninsula –
particularly those of a later vintage – are still a rarity, even more so in the English
language. Moreover, except for Old Hispanic chant, sacred monophony representing the
Roman rite in Iberia and its centers has been little examined. Fortunately in more recent
years, there has been an increase in scholarly interest in this underrepresented field. In the
Review of Literature, I will outline some of the scholarship that I have encountered and
have found useful as models and reference sources for contextualizing the OSU Gradual
and for examination of its contents. Several Spanish sources available as points of
comparison are also mentioned in the chapter.
Since this study revolves around a particular manuscript, Chapter II is a basic
codicological description, noting the physical characteristics of the book in question. I
examine the materials used in the structure – for instance, the parchment support and the
outer binding – in an attempt to determine the usage intended for this volume. A close
look at the condition and additions can also provide clues about the “life” this book led.
Chapter III delves into the core of the manuscript – the chants and rubrics of the
book – and the organization of these materials. As established in the mentioned class

4

investigation, this gradual is a Sanctorale sans separate Commune sanctorum, and thus it
records the masses for saints. The masses of less commonly celebrated saints can point to
the geographical area where the book originated. Rubrics are also critical to indicating
place or region of origin. Moreover, a rough time period may even be established based
on the presence of certain saints, for often the popularity of a particular cult was a late
medieval phenomenon, made universal by decree from Rome.
Not forgetting that this is a book of music, Chapter IV contains a study of select
examples from chants found in the Gradual. Through a comparison with other available
chant sources, it may be possible to observe whether the chant tradition of the area of
origin is universal or more restricted in its transmission, and whether a chant has strong
roots and ties to the chants of another area. Thanks to the Roman Catholic Church’s
desire to standardize liturgical chant over the course of the Middle Ages, similarities to
other chant sources provide timelines that can be related to reform movements. Since a
recent hypothesis is that the Gradual has origins in the 15th- or 16th-century, perhaps the
Tridentine reforms instigated after the Council of Trent (1545–1563) are evinced in the
choice and versions of chants.
Finally, since this is an illustrated manuscript, the type of letter forms found in the
book, along with the construction of historiated initials (those with pictures embedded)
and other decorated initials, is examined in Chapter V. The calligraphy of a book
provides information about where it was scribed. Changes in decoration of the letters can
indicate layers, and different styles of script show when any changes may have been
done. In addition, the state of the initials, in terms of condition, quality and completion,
offers clues about who the scribes were and for whom the volume was intended.

5

Through this discussion, I hope to present research elements that will fill in the
gaps in the story of the OSU Gradual, such as what purpose it served, how and by whom
it was used and possibly its physical journey. By documenting my process and findings, I
hope to provide some illumination for book scholars, both musicians and non-musicians,
in puzzling out secrets from an early musico-liturgical manuscript.

Review of Literature
Sacred monophonic music of the Iberian Peninsula has been an area often
overlooked by scholars, due in part to the limited pool of primary sources. Nonetheless
there has been some scholarship focusing on music from the medieval and early
Renaissance periods in Spain that can serve as models and provide some insight into the
music and socio-political climate of late medieval Iberia. Largely because of the unique
history of conquest and, sometimes re-conquest, by Romans, Germanic tribes, Muslims
and Christians – add to this its relative geographic isolation – culture and music in the
Iberian Peninsula developed in a way different from the rest of Latin Christendom.7 A
local version of Old Hispanic chant prevailed for a long time and the Roman Catholic
form of the liturgy and Gregorian chant did not take hold in a majority of the peninsula
until the 11th-century.8
The use of Old Hispanic liturgy and chant was centered around the city of Toledo,
and at its peak, it had a sphere of influence that encompassed most of the peninsula.
However, in the northern-most parts of the Iberian Peninsula, including Catalonia, the

observance of the Roman liturgy took hold much earlier, and was adopted by the 8th- or
9th-century.9 The multi-volume Spanish-language series Historia de la música en España
e Hispanoamérica provides a comprehensive overview of the development of music over
the Hispanic area of influence.10 Volumes 1 and 2, edited by Maria Gómez Muntané,
cover the time period of interest to this study. A handy English language resource that
discusses Old Hispanic chant and other early forms of music in the Iberian Peninsula is
the chapter by Nicolas Bell in The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Music.11
The late 11th-century suppression of the Old Hispanic rite in favor of the Roman
understandably led to the loss of Old Hispanic music sources over time. Nevertheless, a
few sources have survived and their preservation has resulted recently in an increase of
scholarly interest in these earliest extant specimens of Iberian music. In Silent Music,
Susan Boynton gives insight into how 18th-century scholars viewed and studied this early
chant tradition, specifically the Old Hispanic rite practiced in the region of Toledo prior
to the introduction of the Roman rite in 1086.12 She follows the 18th-century study done
by the scholar Andrés Marcos Burriel and his collaborative scribe, Francisco Santiago y
Palomares, under the auspices of the short-lived “Royal Commission on the Archives” of
Ferdinand VI.13 Boynton finds their inquiry to be useful since it includes meticulous
copying of the chants in question and provides a written facsimile of something that

social climate in the 18th-century, including the view on the musical corpus.15
Additionally, Emma Hornby and Rebecca Maloy produced a monograph touching upon
the Old Hispanic Liturgy, specifically on lamentation chants called Threni and their use
as personal expression.16 Maloy’s article on Old Hispanic chant and early liturgy is on the
forefront of research on this early chant that existed before the Carolingian reforms
brought the widespread use of Gregorian chant.17
Kathleen Nelson looks at the chant traditions in the Spanish city of Zamóra,
working with fragments of extant material known as the Pergaminos Musicales
originating from the 12th through the 16th centuries.18 This book’s introduction contains a
survey of the history of liturgical chant in Spain that can supplement Bell’s chapter as an
English resource.19 Another volume, Cathedral, City and Cloister, edited by Nelson, is a
collection of essays, many of which provide detailed analyses of early music manuscripts.

University of Sydney, providing a detailed description of the contents and features of the

had a part in the conception of the book in an attempt to further scholarship about them.21
In particular, an essay by James John Boyce addresses manuscripts housed in the Archivo
Central in Salámanca. Entitled “Choir Books in Context: The Salámanca Cantorales,”
Boyce’s works contains pictures of a manuscript that bears some similarity to the OSU
manuscript and could be a point of comparison and departure.22 Boyce also published a
book, Carmelite Liturgy and Spiritual Identity, focusing on the chants of the Carmelite
monastery in Kraków over several centuries. Although this book deals with chant from an
area far from the Iberian Peninsula, it contains comparisons of the late medieval
calendars used by various orders23 as well as descriptions for some specific Marian
feasts.24 For those who wish to delve into sources available in the Spanish language, Eva
Castro Caridad’s Tropos y tropos hispánicos, although primarily focused on the trope
genre, contains descriptions of various manuscripts from around the Iberian Peninsula
with regards to their content and construction.25
In the interest of providing a comprehensive reference volume for musical
liturgical manuscripts of this early Hispanic period, Susan Zapke has put together the
Hispania Vetus.

information about the history of chant in the Iberian Peninsula as well as confirming,
through the comparison with its exemplars, that the manuscript of this study is of a later
vintage.26 Zapke also highlights the types of notation present in the Iberian Peninsula
from the 9th- to the 12th-century, as well as where the main areas of production were.27 A
more general resource for chant is David Hiley’s Western Plainchant: A Handbook,
wherein the salient aspects of plainchant are outlined and discussed, including liturgical
use, chant genre, source types, and music theory. Hiley provides a useful template for the
investigation of unstudied chant manuscripts and identifying provenance. He
recommends: (1) examining rubrics for clues, (2) looking at which saints are celebrated
in the litanies and/or Sanctorale, and (3) comparing repertoire with other sources.28
Given the aforementioned interest in Old Hispanic chant and the focus on selected
major manuscripts such as the Codex Calixtinus of Santiago de Compostela, the Codex
Las Huelgas, the Cántigas de Santa María and the Llibre Vermeil in Monserrat,
scholarship on Iberian chant sources from the 13th-century onwards is currently quite
limited.29 Evenso, the late medieval period was a significant time for plainchant because
of the shift in notational practices (the move to square notes) from the end of the 12th into
the 13th-century, as well as the establishment of Roman liturgy.30 Currently, however,
there appears to be an increased interest in this under researched period.

monody from the 15th- to the 19th-century based on manuscripts found in the Cathedral of

his care.

A Mystery Manuscript: The Rosary Cantoral
One source that provides a well-outlined example of how to trace a manuscript of
unknown provenance is The Rosary Cantoral by Lorenzo Candelaria. In his monograph,
Candelaria deduces the origins of a Spanish chant book to be from Toledo, dating it to
around 1500. Candelaria does so through examination of contents, comparison with
other manuscripts and deciphering the context around materials in the cantoral. The book
is a good practical application of Hiley’s guidelines. When Candelaria first encountered
the Rosary Cantoral, nothing much was known about it. Candelaria treats this
investigation into the book’s origins, which spanned around a decade, like a mystery to
be solved. He opens with a general description of the manuscript as “an illustrated book
of music for the Mass compiled in Spain around the year 1500.”32 He goes on to define a
cantoral and how this particular one exhibits close ties with a confraternity of Catholic
laity with a particular devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

The Cantoral first came to the attention of modern scholars when it was acquired
by Yale University’s Beinecke Library in 1989, during one of their largest single
additions of Medieval and Renaissance materials. However, in spite of the number of
impressive books, the Rosary Cantoral was already significant merely for its size (96 x 62
cm) and beautiful illuminations. These illuminations were one major way in which
Candelaria was able to piece together the living history of the book and trace it back to its
place of origin, by linking the volume with other volumes that displayed similar
illustrations and themes. The discovery of related folios allowed missing leaves to be
traced, leading to the discovery of a book dealer in Paris, Arthur Rau, who brokered the
sale of the pages. Records revealed that the leaves came from “a convent near Toledo,”
thus providing scholars with an approximate point of origin for the volume. Candelaria is
of the opinion that the reason the mystery lasted for so long is because
chant manuscripts from Renaissance Spain have never received the scholarly
attention they deserve in spite of the fact that such volumes contain the melodies
that inspire much of the polyphony from Spain’s celebrated Golden Age of church
music.33
According to him, there were several indicators that should have made Spanish
provenance obvious: the size, the five-line staff for plainchant, the Spanish vernacular
inscriptions (perhaps missed because the Spanish language is not an emphasized
language by scholars – per Candelaria) and most usefully, the chants themselves as
signposts to liturgical practices.
The connecting theme in the illuminations is known as “The Emblem of the Five
Wounds,” a direct reference to the passion of Christ. In Toledo a connection between the
emblem and the rosary had existed since the early 16th-century; particularly the rosary in

a particular form used by a confraternity founded in Cologne in 1475. This confraternity
eventually extended its reach to Toledo and its surroundings, such as Santo Domingo in
Ocaña. In spite of the Inquisition in the late 15th-century, small churches such as this
managed to survive the destruction that was the fate of their larger sisters. In the case of
the Rosary Cantoral, Santo Domingo became its safe haven when San Pedro Martir in
Toledo went into decline and eventually exclaustration. The Spanish Civil War was then
the impetus by which the volume and its companions were spirited out of Spain onto
Paris.

Establishing A Baseline
Preliminary assessments of the OSU manuscript suggested a Spanish origin,
which was later confirmed after some in-depth study. Facsimiles of the Missale Vicence
(Vic, 1492), Missale ad usum alme ecclesie Salamanticenses (Salamanca, 1533), Missale
divinorum secundum consuetudinem alme ecclesie Hispalenensis (Seville, 1565) and,
Missale Pallantinum (Palanca, 1568) can provide points of comparisons based on text
with confirmed dates and locations in order to help narrow down terminus ante quem and
post quem dates and area of probable use.34 There is also an extensive collection of
manuscripts still housed in the Museo Episcopal of Vic, the location that is most likely

manuscrits anteriors al segle XVIII del Museu Episcopal de Vic by Josep Gudiol catalogs
and describes what is housed in the collection.35 From the article and through my
correspondence with Fr. Miguel S. Gros, the aforementioned scholar and librarian in Vic,
I have been able to learn about and access microfilms of three Graduals from the Vic
collection (Mss.107, 109 and 110/111), which can serve as exemplars that are more likely
to have commonalities with the OSU Gradual. Moreover, two books by Paul H.
Freedman, The Diocese of Vic and Church and Law and Society in Catalonia, 900-1500
provide insight into the history of Vic and its surroundings.36 To find a baseline
comparison with Western chant in general, it is possible to access datable manuscripts
and facsimiles in either print versions or through online resources such as Gallica,37 the
website of the Bibliothèque Nationale of France; the Cantus Index,38 a catalogue for mass
and office chants; and the Portuguese Early Music Database (PEM), a catalog that gives
access to pre-1650 manuscripts from Portugal and parts of Spain.39

Church, particularly as connected to the reforms post-dating the Council of Trent.
Theodore Karp’s An Introduction to the Post-Tridentine Mass Proper provides points of
comparison for chant content after the Tridentine reform, as well as insight from other
scholars.40 Although Karp’s work deals mostly with the Temporale rather than the
Sanctorale of the Roman Catholic Mass, he does study the Mass of the Purification of the
Virgin, which provides an intersection with the OSU Sanctorale. Karp also provides
chant texts and music from a selection of Post-Tridentine graduals of his choosing, and
these can be compared with the OSU Gradual to identify concurrences.
For the non-medievalist and/or non-chant music specialist, there are some basic
tools that can be used to help identify text and music scripts that are probably unfamiliar.
A baseline for text and music can be established using reference items, in particular the
Liber Usualis (LU) and Graduale Triplex (GT), resources available in most libraries.41
Sources such as Butler’s Lives of Saints and Jacques de Voragine’s The Golden Legend
(Legenda aurea) are also useful in providing information about the saints who are the
focus of the Gradual, and perhaps narrow down which are most significant for the
purposes of this investigation.42
It is often difficult to determine precisely the time frame for manuscripts of
Spanish origin since, from the 15th- to the late 17th-century, there is much “visual

coherence” in the appearance of the script.43 Writing or pattern books were frequently in
use as samples for scribes.44 Orthographia Practica by Juan de Iciar is a pattern book
dating from the 16th-century and it provides a sample of what was prevalent in the Iberian
Peninsula at that time.45 The Calligraphy of Medieval Music provides exemplars for the
type of writing used in the Gradual and possibly points to a span of time when the type of
calligraphy was utilized, including a chapter on notation in Toledo and relevant
resources.46 In addition, since the OSU Gradual is a Liturgical text, the article
“Dominican and Franciscan Books: Similarities and Differences Between Their
Notation,” from the volume provides more nuanced comparative information.47 This may
give clues to origin, since different areas and orders had their own way of forming text.
As a guide for comparing script types in the interest of possibly dating layers, The
Palaeography of Gothic Manuscript Books by Albert Derolez is a valuable resource.
Written in a style that is accessible for novices yet still useful to experts, Derolez

other aspects of working with manuscripts, the book Introduction to Manuscript Studies
by Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham provides a comprehensive guide into various
aspects of early manuscripts – from production of materials50 to different fonts used
through the centuries. It is very accessible to the beginner, yet provides enough in-depth
information to be helpful for a conservation practitioner.
There are many publications on the repair and care of manuscripts. The Museum
Tusculanum publishes the proceedings of an international seminar on the care and
conservation of manuscripts that occurs yearly at the University of Copenhagen.51
Conservation of Leather and Related Materials contains comprehensive information
regarding the care of the types of materials typically found in the composition of early
manuscripts.52 Techniques for other manuscripts of the time should be applicable to those
containing music. Current conservation practices veer towards doing nothing if an item is
coming to no harm in its present state, but surveying the condition of the manuscript may
be useful. There are also volumes that provide comparisons from an art history
perspective in order to assist with an analysis of the artistic style of the historiated initials.
Two volumes that I have found relevant for my purposes in this study are Spain: A
History in Art, which goes through the various styles of art of the Iberian Peninsula
through the ages, and Illuminating the Renaissance, which addresses the spread of the
Flemish style of manuscript illumination throughout Europe.53

In all, given the multi-faceted nature of this investigation, I will draw on these
pertinent handbooks and guides in addition to more specialized source materials from

CHAPTER II
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Based on first impressions of its appearance, the gradual in the Oregon State
University collection was possibly designed to be a ‘workhorse’ used regularly in the
celebration of the Catholic mass. It is a relatively large book, measuring 62.5 cm by 44
cm by 12 cm, with content that can be easily read from a few feet away. Being able to
read the book from a distance would have been essential for a group of singers looking
upon the same book while performing chants. Although the constituent materials used
were not of the finest quality, the volume is in fairly good shape. This was not a book
designed to impress, but rather for everyday use and to withstand regular usage by a
community of faithful worshipers.54

Cover and Binding
The cover is sturdy and made from wooden boards covered with a thick brown
leather, probably cow hide.55 Since the wood is completely encased on the outer surface
by leather and on the inner surface by parchment, it is not possible to visually confirm the
type of wood, although a likely candidate is oak.56 Alternate materials that were utilized
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
54

I have modeled my observation descriptions on the style used by scholars such as Boyce and
Nelson, when describing manuscripts, and I have used Clemens and Graham as a reference.

55

A closer examination into the specific types of leather, wood and metal could be covered in a more indepth study since testing the materials may require techniques that are invasive or need specialized
equipment and/or experience.

at the time are other types of wood, such as beech, or a pasteboard made from adhered
layers of parchment.57 It is unlikely that this cover is any other material than wood, given
its weight. Additionally, the heft of the book clasp, and the nails used to secure it,
necessitate a strong material to anchor to and pasteboard would be insufficient. The
leather’s surface is devoid of ornamentation and decoration, and although the leather
shows some signs of wear, it is intact aside from a little cracking on the upper front spine,
possibly from prolonged use. Care should be taken with the head of the spine towards the
front cover because of the visible splitting of the leather cover (Figure 2.1). The bottoms
of both front and back covers as well as the top corners are reinforced with metal strips
held in place with nails. Common metals used at the time ranged from iron, to copper
alloys such as brass or bronze to precious metals, such as silver.58 Judging by its
appearance, the metal for this volume is likely to be a sturdy iron or a copper alloy, such
as brass or bronze that has developed a dark patina from age or specialized treatment.59
The book is kept securely closed by a minimally-decorated, heavy metal clasp designed
to hinge at the top cover and hook on the bottom cover and probably made of the same
metal as the strips and nails. This swinging portion of the clasp appears to be constructed
in one solid piece with a “peg” (Figure 2.2) handle and the entire clasp apparatus is
secured onto the front and back covers with the same kind of nails as used for the metal
bands. Because the nails on the clasp are coming loose, caution should to be taken to

to slow down wearing on the cover since they are only placed on areas more susceptible
to wear and do not in themselves appear to be decorative. The metal work on the book is
simple with very little intricate detail, save for the hooking end of the clasp that is
attached to the back cover, which is made in a shape resembling a crown. The hooking of
the clasp on the back cover is a characteristic in manuscripts from southern France and
the Iberian Peninsula.60

Whether the outer binding and cover are original to the book, or whether the book
has been rebound, is difficult to assert since at this juncture there are no obvious telltale
signs. Because the clasp has come loose, it has been repaired at least once, but OSU is
reluctant to have it fully repaired since this would mean replacing nails that are possibly
original to the cover. In order to prevent further damage, the clasp must always be
supported when the book is open, such as with the foam wedges that are widely utilized
in library special collections.
22

Parchment Condition and Repairs
In general the parchment is in relatively stable condition and for the most part can
be handled as long as care is taken. The parchment used for the book is not of a
particularly fine quality, but it is serviceable. In addition, the parchment feels thick to the
touch and the hair follicles can be seen, which indicates rougher preparation.61 The slight
yellow tinge of the skin may indicate sheepskin rather than calf, which tends to be whiter
in color, although the size of the manuscript requires the skin of a large animal.62 The
material shows evidence of heavy usage, such as wearing down and thinning areas in the
skin, as well as dark smudges in the lower corners of many pages. Residual wax, possibly
from candle drippings, can be found on some leaves. Handwritten additions – many
comparatively recent – are in evidence throughout the book. Imperfections in the skin
have been worked around and at times repaired. These natural imperfections in the
parchment can be distinguished from holes caused by later tearing based on the smooth
edges of the natural holes.63 In any case, the Gradual is well worn and there are instances
in which pages have been crudely sewn to patch a tear. Figure 2.3 shows a repair done
using white thread to form two horizontal and three diagonal stitches. Although the
stitches touch or occur over several notes, they do not obscure the legibility of the text or
music; however the edges of the tear fold somewhat, and this could possibly result in
further damage in the future. A large number of patch and sewing repairs have been made
during various points in the book’s life; over eighty of the 200 folios have some sort of

parchment patch while four folios have stitching work.64 The parchment patches that
have been added to the book often appear to be remedial and inelegant repair jobs, or
designed to cover text that was meant to be removed from the volume, such as the case in
Figure 2.4.65 Repair work is generally crude and not indicative of an attempt at hiding it;
these repairs often make use of parchment patches that cover up text and they do not
overlap seamlessly (Figure 2.5) or are very large (Figure 2.6). In Figure 2.5, the two
strips of new material are lighter than the original base, with one passing diagonally over
the bottom staff on the page, obscuring the content and the other placed on the outer long
edge. Figure 2.6 shows a darker patch in a backwards L-shape and does not cover any
text. It is possibly from an older layer of repair given its worn appearance, especially
evident in the corner. It is difficult to date when repairs may have been made, but most
happened before arrival at OSU and no repair records exist. That the repairs happened at
different points in the manuscript’s life can be inferred by the attempts in some cases to
replace obscured text, indicating a continued need for the book to be usable, while in
other cases content was disregarded and repairs were made just to keep the book together.
There are a handful of instances where repair is carried out using glassine tape
(Figure 2.7) in the volume, and there is at least one repair made with Japanese paper. This
indicates more recent conservation work since glassine (a very thin paper with a smooth
and glasslike surface) and Japanese paper (a fibrous paper made in Japan that is preferred
for repair)66 are modern conservation materials. These more recent repairs may have been

in-library repair work done on the Gradual after its arrival at OSU. One documented
repair was done in 2012 in order to add support to the loose first signature and stabilize
the clasp. At the time, the conservation technician also removed insect and other debris
materials from the volume and may have done the repair using Japanese tissue.67
Regardless of when the repairs were done, signs point to the book having had a degree of
effort being exerted to either: (1) extend its continued service (as in the case of earlier
repairs) or (2) to maintain its condition and stem further deterioration once the
manuscript had reached the end of its working life.

I confirmed that the repair was done through an informal conversation with the conservation technician
Marilyn Mohr, but was unable to obtain official documentation.

Arrangement of the Gatherings
Because it is a large book, a thick and course thread was used to sew the OSU
Gradual together. Overall the sewing of the volume is still in good condition and is
holding it together well. The construction of the book gatherings is generally uniform,
and of the 31 extant gatherings, most consist of four bifolios of parchment (i.e., a
quaternio), which are folded to make gatherings containing eight leaves. Even the
recently reattached first gathering fits this pattern.68
There are, however, irregularities and the occurrence of cut threads between the
opposing gutters (Figure 2.8) serves as evidence that several pages have been removed
(Figure 2.9). The later alterations occur especially toward the end of the book. In
gatherings 5 and 18, the thick thread used to hold the volume together looks to have been
cut and some of the inner bifolios removed. The missing pages are obvious in the leap in
folio numbering and there are clear gaps in material content. Two possible explanations
for this are that: (1) these removals were part of a content revision with the intention of
replacing them later or (2) perhaps the removal of easier to access internal parts is due to
an attempt at taking souvenirs, or as a means to recycle parchment since one common
recycling practice at the time was to remove folios from manuscripts to be used as
binding materials in other books.69 There are two places in the OSU Gradual where an
initial had been removed: replacement patches have been inserted, each with a filled-in
initial.70 The re-use of parchment was standard practice since the material is expensive

Because the first gathering was detaching, the gradual was brought to the University of Oregon Beach
Conservation Lab in mid-2011. Senior Conservation Technician Marilyn Mohr re-secured the gathering.

and labor intensive to make. Large leaves such as those in the OSU Gradual might have
been used as a source for parchment, for even if the material is not of the highest quality,
it is still sturdy and could be used in applications where appearance is not an issue.71

One possible use is binding support.

Construction changes also happen toward the back of the book where the
gatherings start to vary in number of bifolios and several single folios are sewn in using
stubs. It is difficult to say when, in relation to the original compilation of the manuscript,
any of these changes had been made. Generally the sewing has remained secure and tight,
although there are areas that have been loosened, particularly in the first gathering.
Sewing stations,72 where the gatherings are sewn together, are apparent due to the fiveraised bands of the volume’s spine, indicating five-stations.

Page Layout and Writing Characteristics
The standard layout of each page is six music staves, with space provided
between each staff for a single line of text to be written as underlay to the music. Each
staff consists of five lines in red ink. The use of five lines in the notation of plainchant is
not as common and most chant sources from the 13th-century through the 16th-century
were utilizing a four-line staff. This practice continued even when the five-line staff came
into favor for the notation of non-chant repertories.73 Lorenzo Candelaria, a musicologist
specializing in Catholic sacred music of 16th-century Spain, states in his book The Rosary
Cantoral that the use of five lines in chant manuscript staves is a characteristic of Spanish
manuscripts.74 This premise seems to hold true for all the Spanish notated sources I have
consulted for this study, including the collection of antiphonaries in Salamanca75 and the
dated graduals from Vic (discussed below).
The pattern of staves is only broken when large text blocks of rubrics appear, or
for the inclusion of historiated initials. The ink and pen work in the volume appear to be
stable and not friable. There are instances where the text and notes appear to have
naturally faded through use, but in most instances the loss of ink was due to a purposeful
removal with the parchment support underneath showing evidence of having been
scraped. The square notation is copied in black ink with C and F clefs employed. Most of
the text is written in a clear gothic rotunda hand with the exception of the occasional

utilization of stencil in what appears to be newer additions to the original layer, as
evidenced by erasures.
Based on the physical appearance of the OSU Gradual, we can ascertain that it
was designed to be a book in heavy use for an extended period of time. It was not a
display piece but rather a tool and some effort was expended to make sure it performed.
Whether the cover is original is difficult to pin down, but it is consistent with what would
be expected of a book meant to last. And last the OSU Gradual did, it went through
physical alterations and repairs at various points in its lifespan and is still in usable
condition after hundreds of years. But although the physical appearance does not shed
light on all the mysteries, it does strengthen the argument of a Spanish origin for the
book. To find more detailed answers, the investigation must now turn to textual content
in Chapter III. A discussion of the initials, script types, and letter forms will resume in
Chapter IV.

32

CHAPTER III
A SANCTORALE: SAINTS AND THEIR FEAST DAYS
The reverence for saints as intercessors was an integral part of life in the late
medieval church. Because of the push for unification towards a common Roman rite,
many saints were generally acknowledged throughout the Catholic world as part of the
standard Roman martyrology. However, in addition to universally celebrated saints, there
were saints peculiar to specific localities, some even becoming the “patron saint” of the
geographic area, e.g. the town, province, or diocese. As established during the
preliminary investigation conducted in 2012, the OSU Gradual is not actually a complete
gradual for the entire liturgical year, rather it is a volume representing the Sanctorale,
thus containing chants for the masses celebrated on the feast days of saints.76
In a preliminary investigation of an unstudied chant manuscript, specialists work
to survey the content and its general purpose, place of origin and/or provenance, and the
date of construction.77 Since the type of book has already been established in the case of
the OSU Gradual, we may now turn our attention to issues concerning provenance and
dating. Ideally a manuscript would have identifiers within it such as a scribal colophon,
which is an inscription by a scribe that provides details of its content, place of use or
origin and sometime identity of the scribe.78 When available, these usually appear at the
end of a manuscript or a particular text. But only a small percentage of medieval

This is in contrast to a Temporale, which contains the chants of the daily masses.

manuscript have colophons.79 Rubrics, or headings at the beginning of chant sections, are
also a likely place to glean information, such as, in the case of a performance rubric, the
types of officiants (e.g. priest, bishop, prior, monk, nun) and singers that in turn can
inform about the type institution that the manuscript was utilized in (e.g. a monastery,
cathedral, or collegiate and other types of church).80
In the case of the OSU Gradual, one important discovery that was missed in the
earlier investigation is the presence of two key rubrics that contained a specific place
name that locates either origin or the provenance of use for the OSU Gradual. My closer
examination of the rubrics of the Gradual during the construction of the catalog of
contents (Appendix A) reveals that the origin of the manuscript is written within the book
itself. On two occasions, one on the feast of Justus of Vic81 (Figure 3.1) and the other, on
the feast of the Dedication of the Church82 (Figure 3.2), the text includes the word
“Vicensis” indicating that the OSU Gradual was probably made for use in Vic, a town
located in northern Spain, about eighty kilometers almost due north from Barcelona, in
Catalonia. The rubric for the feast of St. Justus indicated that the bones of the saint are
enshrined at the church where the OSU Gradual was used. In further confirmation of the
origins of the OSU volume, the cathedral of Vic did at one time have the remains of a
saint Justus entered in the Cathedral.83 Due to earthquakes in the region and intercessions

Let us now consider the special features of the Sanctorale as a whole. Had these
rubrics referring to the town of Vic not been in the manuscript, it still would have been
possible to at least narrow down an area of probable origin based on other contents of the
manuscript. Identifying special patron saints are one way of pinpointing where a
liturgical book may have originated or what group of faithful may have used it. The OSU
Gradual lends itself well to this sort of study because it contains not only saints
universally celebrated, but also the feast days of the saints whose cults were localized to
specific communities or regions and were considered special in the place where that
particular saint was venerated or honored. There are over 140 feast days listed in the book
and at least 105 represent saints common to the Roman rite in most Catholic areas.85 In
order to draw a preliminary list of less common saints, I cross referenced the saints
celebrated in the Gradual to basic reference sources such as the Roman Calendar in LU86
or the Proprium de Sanctis in GT,87 Hiley’s Western Plainchant,88 Butler’s Lives of
Saints,89 as well as more specialized sources such as Hesbert’s Antiphonale Missarum
Sextuplex (AMS),90 Usuard’s martyrology,91 and the Legenda aurea,92 all basic resources
easily accessed. Additionally, Misset and Weales’ Analecta Liturgica contains lists of

Local Saints
After looking closely at the saints’ feast days observed in the volume, an
argument for a Spanish origin is greatly reinforced. If one lists all the saints in the volume
and removes those that are common and universal to the Catholic Church, what remains
are saints who originated and/or were chiefly or especially celebrated in the Iberian
Peninsula. Based on this method, the following saints can be isolated as some of the
“people of interest” in this investigation: Leocadia, Eulalia of Mérida, Eulalia of
Barcelona, Quiteria, Justus of Vic, and Cucuphas.94 The two Eulalias and Leocadia (from
Toledo) are virgin martyrs. Quiteria is a Galician princess who refused to marry a pagan
and was thus martyred by being beheaded. Justus of Vic and Cucuphas are connected to
the northern part of Spain, namely the area of Catalonia, as is Eulalia of Barcelona. As
mentioned earlier, Justos of Vic was revered in the diocese of Vic and was a patron saint
until 1867. Cucuphas had especially close ties to the abbey Sant Cugat de Valles in
Barcelona. Other saints, such as Justa and Rufina, have their origins in the Old Hispanic
rite. As all these special saints are an important indicator of a more local liturgical
identity, it is worth taking a look into the stories of their individual origins.

December 9: St. Leocadia, martyr (d. 304?)
The cult of St. Leocadia originated around the area of Toledo/Oviedo. According
to her passion story, Leocadia was a young Toledan woman of noble origin. During the
persecution of Diocletian by Dacian, Leocadia was also tortured and imprisoned. While
she was in prison, she was inspired by the story of St. Eulalia95 and prayed to be worthy
of a similar fate. Her prayers were answered and she died in prison. In the 7th-century,
Ildephonsus (feast day, January 23) had a vision that Leocadia rose from her tomb to
thank him on behalf of the Blessed Virgin Mary for his work De virginitate Sanctae
Mariae. This historical note is seen to indicate that her cult was well established by this
time. In Toledo there are three churches dedicated to Leocadia and she is the patroness of
that city.96

December 10: Eulalia of Mérida (d. c.304)
Even though she was of a noble family, Eulalia97 rejected frivolity and luxury
even at a very young age. She preferred a life of austerity and strictness and wished to
remain a consecrated virgin. Martyred during of the persecution of Diocletian, she
refused to offer the required sacrifice to the pagan gods and even went so far as

97

The OSU Gradual has a feast day for St. Eulalia, possibly of Mérida, in December. There is some debate
as to whether two different saints named Eulalia existed, or if they are one and the same person. The
Eulalia in February is listed in the OSU Gradual as St. Eulalia of Barcelona.

reproaching Diocletian for leading souls astray. Eulalia was tortured, then burned alive in
an oven, her body buried later by Christians. Her relics are spread out in various places.98

February 12: Eulalia of Barcelona (d. c.304)
This Eulalia is said to have also been martyred during the persecution of
Diocletian. Part of her origin story, copied in the early 12th-century from a 7th-century
Latin hymn by Bishop Quiricus of Barcelona, overlaps with Eulalia of Mérida. The hymn
has survived in sources of Old Hispanic liturgy, attesting to the antiquity of her cult. Her
relics, moreover, are said to have been housed in the church of Santa Maria del Mar on
the outskirts of Barcelona’s city walls until 874 when they were transferred to the
cathedral where Bishop Frodoinus served.99

May 21: Quiteria, martyr (d. 5th-century)
Another saint of ancient origin, Quiteria is said to have been a Galician princess
who ran away from her father due to his wish for her to reject Christianity and marry a
pagan. She fled to Aire, Gascony, but was beheaded when found by her father’s
emissaries. The cult of St. Quiteria is centered in her tomb in Aire and the reach of its

of France being dedicated to her.100

May 28: St. Justus of Vic
Not much information is available about St. Justus of Vic. He lived in the area of
Vic before the 8th-century, possibly during the time of the Visigoths. What made him
significant were miracles attributed to him after his death, which led to his interment in
the Cathedral of Vic. Around 1448, he was made a patron saint in the area since he was
highly revered. In the 14th and 15th centuries, a series of major earthquakes struck the
region. When his tomb suffered no damage after a wall collapsed on it, people believed
that his intercession brought protection, thus St. Justus became the saint of protection
from earthquakes. In 1660, the people made a silver urn to house his relics and kept it in
the cathedral altar. It disappeared in 1809 because of the peninsular war and was replaced
in 1827, however the cathedral burned down in 1936 and the relics were lost. The cult of
St. Justus was most popular in the 14th-century and began its decline in the 17th-century.
He was removed as the patron of the diocese in 1867 and replaced by St. John the
Baptist.101

July 25: St. Cucuphas (d. 304)
Of a noble Christian family from Scillis, Africa, Cucuphas was martyred near
Barcelona during the persecution of Diocletian. Included in his tortures were whipping,
being roasted alive, and finally being beheaded. He is also known under the names
Cucufate, Cugat, Guinefort, and Qaqophas. The Benedictine abbey known as St. Cugat
de Valles is located where Cucuphas was martyred and some of his relics are in a shrine
in Paris, where he is also venerated.102

July 17/20: Sts. Justa and Rufina, martyrs (d. 287?)
The story of Justa and Rufina derives from an ancient tradition, reaching to Old
Hispanic practices of liturgical celebration.103 They are said to be virgin martyrs from 3rdcentury Seville who refused to sell the earthenware pots for use in pagan processions.
Angered, the pagans destroyed the pots and the Christian ladies smashed the pagan
statues in retaliation, leading to their subsequent arrest, torture and death. Throughout
their persecution and passion, Justa and Rufina remained faithful and refused to turn to
the pagan gods. Their cult was centered in Seville, which adopted them as patrons, as did
some other cities such as Toledo and Zaragoza.104
It may be of note that Justa and Rufina are included in this volume. In her book,
Boynton noted that the 18th-century scholar Burriel observed that:

in a Roman rite missal of Toledo, several important Spanish saints’ feast
were added in the margins with reference to a supplement; the feasts of Justa
and Rufina was not among them. The omission of this important feast
demonstrates that elements of the early Hispanic calendar were not always
reintegrated into the books of the Roman rite produced in the Iberian
Peninsula.105
Since northern Iberia was even more removed from the Old Hispanic rite than Toledo,
this points to a possible special significance of these saints to the area where the book
was in use, possibly a specific parish or church.
In terms of dating this manuscript, one way to help narrow down a terminus ante
quem for the OSU Gradual is to see which saints are ‘missing,’ for the Roman
martyrology is after all not a static set of feasts, but rather one always changing. Often,
existing cults grew, shrank or new cults were established as a result of competition
between areas.106 One famous Spanish example is the pilgrimage site of Santiago de
Compostela, which experienced a boost in the 12th-century.107 In addition, there are
always newly canonized saints, a practice that remains even in the modern Roman
Catholic Church. Official decrees from Rome and from other official councils instruct
which saint’s feasts are obligatory from a set time onwards.108
Since the saints examined thus far point to northern Spain (and more remotely to
southern France) as likely origin and because the aforementioned cults were established
well before the early to central Middle Ages, looking for saints who date from the later

Middle Ages, and especially the early modern/post-Tridentine era may provide more
points of comparison. Some prominent Spanish saints are:
Isidore, bishop of Seville, confessor, doctor of the church (April 4)
Ignacio de Loyola, confessor (July 31)
Theresa of Ávila, virgin, doctor of the church (October 15)
Francis Xavier, confessor (December 3)
A mass for Isidore of Seville, an important figure in the later Spanish Church and in
music theory, is not present in this Sanctorale. Could the fact that he was not canonized
until 1598 play a role in his omission from the OSU Gradual? However, in other
liturgical books from the Iberian Peninsula of the 16th-century (e.g. the missal of Seville
from 1565109 and the missal of Palanca from 1558),110 Isidore is found in the catalog of
saints. Might this be an indication that the first layer of the OSU Gradual is from an
earlier time than the other volumes and thus provide a probable terminus ante quem and
terminus post quem? The other possibility is that since Vic is located in northern Spain, it
varied in its liturgical practice from the southern cities that were more under the Toledan
influence. But following the logic of canonization dates it may be useful to note that
Ignacio de Loyola was canonized in 1622, as were Theresa of Ávila (beatified in 1614)
and Francis Xavier (beatified 1619). All three names are absent from both main text
block and the index of the OSU Gradual as well as in the Missale Vicense or calendars
found in the other Spanish missals examined. Based on these dates, the first layer
possibly originated in the early 16th-century, which could explain the lack of inclusion of
these later saints.

It should also be noted that the saints that appear in the main text block of the
Gradual, as well as some of the chant texts, do not always match the saints or chants
written in the index at the back of the book (see Appendix E). For instance, in the index
there is an entry for Our Lady of the Snows on August 5 and for St. John Lateran
(Basilice Salvatoris) on November 9, but neither has a counter part in the main text block.
This lack of consistency between the gradual proper and the index might indicate that the
latter is not from the original layer of the gradual. On closer examination, it appears that
all the saints who are listed in the index are those common to the Roman Rite,111
suggesting the index was added as an attempt at standardization, perhaps after the
Council of Trent. If the index is indeed a secondary layer, this might also help to account
for the odd construction observed in the sewing of the gatherings in the latter part of the
volume. In addition, Our Lady of the Snows and St. John Lateran are important churches
in Rome and that the Feast of Our Lady of the Snows was not imposed as a feast on the
general church until 1558.112
The city of Vic has a long history, starting out as a Roman outpost and surviving
many invasions, wars, and political upheavals. The Church of Rome has been a steady
and powerful influence in the region already since the late 10th-century.113 By the late
Middle Ages, Gregorian chant was certainly well established in the diocese of Vic. A
missal from 1496 – a liturgical book similar to a gradual, but which also contains the

prayers and readings of the mass in addition to the text of chants (excluding notation),114
not only survives today, but has been made available as a facsimile.115 Thus, the so-called
Missale Vicense from the years dating just before the turn of the 16th-century provides a
basis of textual comparison for the OSU Gradual. There are also three graduals from Vic
that have been photographed; the microfilms are available through the Hill Monastic
Library in Minnesota.116 To provide a wider basis for comparisons, I also consulted other
missals from various parts of Spain available online; these include those from
Salamanca,117 Seville,118 and Palanca.119

Layers of Change
As mentioned earlier, when looking at the OSU Gradual, many hands can be
detected as having been involved in its construction and ongoing updating. Not only do
we find different styles and eras represented by the handwriting and illustration – by no
means a unique occurrence in many service books used for multiple generations, and
even centuries – but we find changes in the contents. Texts in the Missale Vicense from
1496 are commonly identical to the original layer of the OSU Gradual. However, altered
texts in the Gradual – such as when an initial layer of text has been erased and replaced

with something different – are frequently at odds with the Missale Vicense. In some cases
palimpsests appear with up to three layers (Figure 3.3). The most recent layers often
match well with text found in later volumes of more standard Roman Catholic material,
such as the Graduale Triplex and Liber Usualis. Based on a close examination of these
altered sections it may be possible to approximate a date when the primary layer
originated, as well as hypothesize when subsequent layers would have been constructed.
It would be useful to look at a specific case study to illustrate these points, something I
will address in the next section.

Figure 3.3. Folio 28v has three visible layers of chant text

46

Case Studies
The types of alterations made to texts provide more clues concerning the dating of
layers. The masses in the OSU Gradual follow the standard format of a Roman Catholic
mass and provide the sung sections of the celebration, as expected in a gradual. These
would be, in order of the mass (abbreviation used is indicated inside the parenthesis): the
introit (In.) with or without its psalm verse (Ps.), the responsory gradual (Resp. Gr.), the
Alleluya chant120 and its verse, the offertory (Of.) and the communion (Co.). Generally
during the Lenten season the Tract (Tr.) occurs in the position of the Alleluya. In the
catalog for the main text block, I use “In.” for the more commonly recognized “Introit,”
even though the OSU Gradual uses “Officium” in the rubrics when referring to the
opening proper chant of each mass, in order to make a distinction from the offertory.
It is beyond the scope of this investigation to do a detailed analysis of all chant
texts in the OSU Gradual, but it is useful to investigate a couple of cases where the
palimpsests are apparent. In an effort to provide opportunities for contrast, I have selected
case studies that have counterparts in either other studies or other graduals from the same
area. Case studies 1 and 2 are both taken from Marian feasts. The fact that the OSU
Gradual even contains Marian feast is something of note since, in many collections,
Marian feasts are often found either in the Temporale or placed together in their own
section (or volume) rather than in the general Sanctorale. In the case of the other two

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
120

I am making use of the spelling of Alleluya with a “y” rather than the more typical Alleluia because the

However, even though the feast appears to be widely celebrated in 15th- and 16th-century
Iberia, the particular chants used were not uniform. This is probably a reflection of the
earlier practice at the time. The people of a locality could select the specific chant they
preferred to utilize for a feast from a common pool of chant texts defined by the Roman
Church.122 Since the Conception became a relatively important feast, it is reasonable that
the text would have been adapted during subsequent ecclesiastical reforms in favor of

standardization. As can be seen in the chart above, the main introit, gradual, offertory and
communion remain unchanged with regards to text. However, the original introit psalm
verse has been scratched out and replaced with a different text. If the manuscript page is
closely examined, it is possible to make out the text originally inscribed:
Ostendat faciem suam: sonet vox eius in auribus nostris:
quid eloquium suum dulce: et facies decora nimis
In comparison with the text of several missal sources from, this verse matches what can
be found in the Missale Vicense dated from 1496 and the Missale Pallantinum from
1568. The Missale Salamanticenses from 1533 and Missale Hispalenensis from 1565
share another text:
Gaudent angeli et exultant archangeli:
letantur iusti et congratulantus omnes sancti.
This reinforces that the liturgical practices of the time did not insure the uniform use of
text across the peninsula. A significant event in the 16th-century Catholic church was the
Council of Trent, which advocated reforms to standardize all observances and practices
across the Catholic world, partly in order to put a stop to the lack of chant uniformity.
Could the manuscript’s ‘life’ have begun before the Council of Trent and then continued
with later changes and updates partially explain why the OSU Gradual shows so much
evidence of alteration?
At first glance, the new text seems to indicate that it is a much younger layer than
the oldest layer, possibly even from as late as the 17th- or 18th-century, since the new text
appears to have been added with the use of the curious stenciled letters (a discussion of
this dating will follow in Chapter V).

49

Quam dilecta tabernacula tua domine virtutum:
concupiscit & deficit anima mea in atria domini.
This text does not appear in the Missale Vicense. The new text also does not appear in the
Liber Usualis or the Graduale Romanum; indicating that it is either a less used variant or
an intermediary text that was in use before the implementation of the later, more
standard, corpus. However, when the chant incipit Quam dilecta tabernacula tua is
entered into the online Cantus database,123 the text appears for the Feast of the Dedication
of a Church in sources dating from the 11th- to the 16th-century, originating from all
around Europe (France, Italy, and Germany), including Toledo.124 It also appears in some
of the texts in the Common of the Saints as well as in celebration for other saints, which
could mean it was part of the common pool. No other example of use in a Marian feast
was in the database, so whether this was common practice or an isolated incident is just
one of the many mysteries that become apparent the closer one examines this book.
Unfortunately it is not possible to compare the text with other graduals from Vic. The Vic
gradual dating from the 15th-century states that the chants for this feast are in another
book, probably one dedicated to Marian masses.125
Although the particular feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary
(Table 3.2) does not have as many alterations as the previous feast of the Conception of

Most of the chant text for this feast still belongs to the original layer. The only change is
in the chant of the Alleluya verse:
Adorabo ad templum sanctum tuum
We find that the first layer of text has been left intact and a newer chant text has been
written above in a “more casual hand” (possibly a chancellery or secretary script rather
than the more formal gothic rotunda in predominant use):126
Senex puerum portabat puer autem senem regebat.

A point of interest here is that when checking the chant incipits in the Gradual “index”
for concordances, all the chants match the first layer except the aforementioned Alleluya
verse. In the index, the incipit listed for the alleluya of this feast is the Senex puerum. It
has already been stated that the feasts in the saint’s feasts in the index do not exactly
match the saints’ feasts in the main text block. Could this be confirmation of the index
stemming from a later addition?
Since both case studies 1 and 2 involve Marian feasts – which is less felicitous for
comparison with other gradual exemplars – it would be useful to look at the feasts of
other saints as well.127 Two palimpsests – one for the feast of St. Cyriacus, the other for
the Beheading of John the Baptist – offer points of comparisons as well as having
available musical notation. They also appear in the graduals known to be from Vic, which
allows more facets for investigation in the following chapters.
Cyriacus (Table 3.3) is an example of a universal saint recognized through most
of the medieval Latin West. This could be why the text used for his feast has very little
alteration because it is possible that uniformity was a concern. Since there is no evidence
of any other alteration, even the post-offertory psalm that appears to have been removed
could also have just been a casualty of age and fading, or a case of repair. The addition of
the word “autem” to the communion chants is also a relatively minor change. Upon
comparing this feast with the exemplar from the 15th-century gradual housed in Vic,128
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
127

Although the Marian feasts are not a good basis for textual comparison, they are the only feasts in the
OSU Gradual that are also studied by Karp. They are used here in order to have case studies where multiple
facets are examined.
128

This is the volume Antiphonarium Missarum de Sanctis (Ms. 109). A 17th-century gradual from Vic is a
Temporale and does not provide a basis for comparison (Antiphonarium Missarum de Tempore, Mss. 110
and 111).

52

the texts of the Vic gradual and the OSU Gradual match well, except for the added autem,
as does the text in the Missale Vicense. The fact that the text of an unaltered chant
matches well with text from two sources dated from the 15th-century further supports a
dating of the initial layer as being no later than the early 16th-century. The music to
accompany this chant is examined in the next chapter.

In the chants for the feast of the Beheading of John the Baptist (Table 3.4),
changes and palimpsests abound. In fact, not much of the text of the original layer
remains legible for comparison to other Spanish graduals and missals. Fortunately some
of the text in the middle of the communion chant can still be read. In this case, a portion
of the text can be seen since nothing has been written over it. The older erased layer of
text matches up to both the MV and the 15th-century gradual from Vic.129 The text of the
incipit Dilexisti justitiam from the new layer can be found in the Cantus database used in
the common for virgins and for specific female saints, but it is unclear when the change

could have been made since usage ranges from the 10th-century onwards.130 It is possible
that the type of scripts that appear would provide some clues and that will be discussed in
chapter V. What is of note as well are the musical lines, which at first glance match very
closely with the Vic gradual. This indicates that although the text may have changed, the
chant melodies could have been recycled even if the melodies were erased then rewritten
to accompany a new text. This will be covered in the next chapter.

In this chapter we explored how the textual details in a manuscript can shed light
on its identity and purpose. Since this Gradual was already identified as a Sanctorale, a
closer examination of the saints it contained revealed its place of origin as Vic, Spain.
But even without this good fortune, further digging into the stories of significant saints

points to a northern Spanish origin. Narrowing down a time frame for the OSU Gradual
however is more difficult. To initiate, saints that are included in the book can provide a
general dating for the first layer as being no later than the first half of the 16th-century,
based on the canonization dates of missing late-Medieval saints. The decline of the patron
saint Justus in the 17th-century further lessens the likelihood of the first layer being later
since he is the focus of a celebration and the presence of his bones is mentioned.
The fact that the book has many erasures and alterations compounds the problem
of dating since various layers have different dates of addition. It is possible to place a
date for the index at the end of the book and propose it to be an addition made after 1558
due to the presence of the Feast of the Lady of the Snows, something that is missing in
the main text block (again pointing to early 16th for the first layer). Comparing chant text
details to exemplars from other manuscripts affords a framework from which aging can
be based. Strong text concordance between the OSU Gradual and the Vic source dating
from the late 16th-century further support the first layer dating. Although dates for the
later additions are harder to pin down, differences in script style can provide clues and
bears further investigation that is to be done in Chapter V.

CHAPTER IV
MUSICAL CONTENT
Since the OSU Gradual is, by its very nature, a musical liturgy book, it is essential
to consider both the notation and musical content in it. Musical notation styles evolved
based on time and location and the type of notation that is used in a manuscript is a useful
indicator of where and when a manuscript originated from. The type of notation utilized
in this case is square notation, a style first found in the 12th-century and one that
increasingly dominated notational types from the 13th-century onward.131 For the
conservator with no or little training in musical studies, analyzing music can be
intimidating. Notation styles are identifiable by looking for the forms that typify it. As a
starting point, Table 4.1 illustrates some of the common note forms for square notation
that are of interest. Using this tool, I begin with a few general observations concerning
the chant found in the OSU Gradual.
As has been established, the book consists entirely of liturgical chants used for
masses of the Roman rite. In Chapter II, I discussed that five-line staves were used, rather
than the four-line staff more commonly found in plainchant notation.132 Depending on the
range of pitches needed for the notes on the staff, either a C or an F clef is used. The clef
indicates the pitch assignments on the staff based on which line the center of the clef is
placed on (a C clef assigns that line as a C while a F clef makes it an F). The scribe of
the OSU Gradual makes regular use of custos, the “note keeper” symbol that tells the

performer what the first pitch on the next system of music will be, which is a helpful tool
for sight singers. These custodes appear at the end of each staff line, either as a small
diamond shape in the original layer, or, in some of the later additions, in the shape of a
small square with either an ascending or descending vertical “tail” on the right side.

to alter the written notes in a specified way. The notes utilized consist of a combination
of simple puncta (single square notes) and virgae (square notes with a descending tail on
the right side) as well as compound neume types such as the clivis (a two note descending
group), the climacus (a three note descending group), and torculus (three note up-downup group) (Figures 4.1 and 4.2). All of the multiple-note or compound-note groups appear
in a single horizontal layer (left to right) series with no stacking pedes (two notes
descending) or scandicus (three notes descending).135 This results in a melodic line that is
easy to follow even when having to look from a distance, which would be the case for a
book this size that is designed for multiple singers to use at the same time.
In some of the newer chant additions, vertical lines – which correspond to word
divisions – make an appearance (Figure 4.3), as do flat symbols added to the note B. Flat
sign markings can also be found added to the original layer (Figure 4.4), supporting the
case that this was a book in use for performance and that little reminders were placed,
when needed. The presence of these flats can give hints to what groups had a hand in the
production or “emendation” of a manuscript’s chant content.136 Another instance of a
“performance reminder” can be found in the Feast of the Chair of St. Peter where
someone has scribbled solfeggio syllables137 under the neumes (Figure 4.5). Upon close
inspection, we can see that some of the sol-fa syllables are consistent with their
corresponding pitch, while others are not. Most of the syllables utilized appear to be mi,
fa, sol and la. The syllables that match were likely used as mentioned above, for
performance cues to facilitate note reading. The use of these “performance practice”

Case Studies
Comparing all the music of the OSU Gradual to other sources and analyzing these
comparisons in detail would be a formidable task and is certainly beyond the scope of
this study. In Chapter III, I applied case studies to select texts and now I will select
musical examples and closely examine them since similarities and differences in melodic
lines often identify which chant traditions that are related to each other. Because the postTridentine period is one of the periods considered for the dating of the volume – in
particular added and altered melodies – Theodore Karp’s monograph on post-Tridentine
church observances is an important resource for potential comparisons between his
particular case studies and examples in the OSU Gradual. However Karp looks at
material mostly from the Temporale, and thus few comparisons are possible. Even so, he
does examine two chants also found in the Sanctorale of the OSU Gradual: these are both
from the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, specifically the introit
Suscepimus Deus and the communion Responsum accepit Simeon (Table 4.2). Thus these
will serve as samples for comparison of post-Tridentine versions of the two chants to the
same in the Gradual.139 Figures 4.6–4.10 contain synoptic comparisons of the music for
these chants found in the OSU Gradual with a selection from Karp.

To begin, a quick comparison between the music for this feast in the Gradual (line
1) and the examples in Karp’s book show a large concordance, or similarities with the
melodic lines, between the Gradual melodies and the melodies from the Graduale Triplex
(or Graduale Romanum) (line 2). Looking at two lines side by side in the beginning of
the responsory Suscepimus Deus (Figure 4.11), there is only one deviation from each
other and this can be attributed to ornamentation choices. In the communion Responsum
Accepit Simeon (Figure 4.12) there are also small differences, but the shape and direction
of the melodic line remains consistent.

Even when a majority of the notes are different, as in the case of the second part of the
Responsum (Figure 4.13), it is more of a transposition (stepping up or down of notes)
rather than a melodic variant and the shapes of the musical lines still follow each other.

so characteristics that are unique to a particular time are less likely to appear.
Other graduals that are represented here from Karp’s investigation straddle the
time period in which the Tridentine reforms were taking effect: namely (and as labeled by
Karp): Millange (1599), Medici (1615), Küchler (1671), Flandrus (1597), Benedictine
(1623) and Carthusian (1679). Each of these graduals is representative of chant traditions
(5)

70

existing in Europe.140 When examining all versions of the melodic line in conjunction, we
see that they have a relationship to each other. Even with variations happening, especially
in melismas, we can identify points where the chant melodies line up again (Figure 4.8,
points are encircled). A main difference that I noticed between the OSU Gradual and
other examples is in the performance choices for melismas (Figure 4.6, areas enclosed in
boxes). For example, in the incipit Suscepimus Deus, the OSU Gradual’s melisma on the
syllable “De-” of Deus starts on the A pitch, as does the same musical phrase in the
Millange, Flandrus, and Carthusian graduals. The other graduals begin on the G. This
change, however, does not help to narrow down any dates since the manuscripts that
agree with the OSU Gradual range in date from 1597 to 1679.
Where there is a striking difference between the OSU Gradual and all other
examples is in the second section of the responsory gradual at the incipit Sicut audivimus
(Figure 4.8). All the manuscripts contain a melisma at some point in the word
“audivimus.” However, while the OSU exemplar has its melisma on the syllable “-di-,”
all other surveyed versions present the melisma on the last syllable “-mus”. Karp finds in
his investigation that there is a preference for the suspending or “sustaining [the] accent”
to fall on the last syllable of the word,141 and we find that as we look at all his examples,
this is the case. In 1545, Pope Paul III convened the Council of Trent as a reaction to the
Protestant Reformation in order to clarify church doctrines and decide on musical

reforms.142 Karp posits that the melisma changes are emendations to bring the chants in
line with the need to make texts more understandable in response to the Tridentine
reform.143 Since the OSU Gradual is an outlier, perhaps it is a remnant of a former
practice that was not corrected. This suggests that this layer of the manuscript, which is
likely part of the first layer since the chants look unaltered, was pre-Tridentine, especially
since it differs from the late standard represented by the Graduale Triplex.
One other fact to note is that the manuscript labeled as issued by J. Flandrus (also
known as Juan Flamenco) from 1597 is found in Madrid. Karp states that it is difficult to
assign a place of origin to its contents or to identify if it is of Spanish origin or imported
from the Low Countries.144 Since there were strong political and economic ties between
the Iberian Peninsula and Flanders in the 16th-century, cross pollination is plausible, but a
definite link between Vic and Flanders cannot be proven as yet. Unfortunately, it is not
possible to compare these chants with the dated graduals from Vic since the music for
Marian masses are not included in those volumes. However, as mentioned earlier, it is
possible to make comparisons using other feast days. The feasts of St. Cyriacus (Figures
4.14–4.16) and the Beheading of John the Baptist (Figures 4.17–4.19) have been selected
here since their texts were studied in Chapter III, thus reinforcing a multi-faceted
approach.

Case study 2: August 8 - In festo Sancti Ciriaci martyris ad missam
In this example, there do not appear to be any emendations to the first layer of
either exemplar, suggesting a longer period of stability for the chants of this feast. When
we compare the melody of the introit for St. Cyriacus in the OSU Gradual with that in the
15th-century Vic gradual Ms. 109, Antiphonarium Missarum de Sanctis, not only are the
texts concordant, but melodies match up as well, with only small variants. In both
versions the syllabic and the neumatic distributions of notes per syllables line up, while
the melodic readings are nearly identical in pitch content. This is consistent with what is
expected since the texts in Chapter III were also concordant and the two graduals share a
common tradition. This can serve to strengthen a dating of the first layer as being not
much later than the early 16th-century.

In contrast to St. Cyriacus, the feast commemorating the Beheading of John the Baptist
appears to have gone through major changes. As the palimpsest in the verbal text makes
clear, the words of the introit Cognovi domine in the OSU Gradual has been almost
completely altered. Yet when we closely examine the musical script, the two exemplars
still match up, despite re-written verbal texts. This suggests that even though the text had
been changing, possibly toward more general uniformity, the same melodic texts
remained in use in the area. This is consistent with the general trend of chant melodies
having stability in spite of differences in text that is found in the Iberian Peninsula.145
Regrettably, an attempt to find a later source in order to see how long the melodic
tradition was in effect has been unsuccessful since the accessible 17th-century gradual

from Vic, Antiphonarium Missarum de Tempore (Vic Mss. 110 and 111), has only the
Temporale. Moreover, these particular chants do not appear in the Liber Usualis or
Graduale Triplex.
The type of notation and the simplicity of the melodic line lead me to believe
that, consistent with a book of this size, the OSU Gradual was designed for group
singing. The presence of additions and performance cues support that the book was
meant as a tool and not as a display object. But I find from this discussion that although
an identification of the type of notation provides clues to the usage and purpose of the
gradual, a more precise dating is still difficult. Even pursuing the Tridentine course
proves not fruitful since the trend of changes occurring in the text is not echoed in the
relatively stable melodic lines. Two reasons for this could be that (1) as Karp says, there
is very little scholarship at present regarding post-Tridentine sources, so more needs to
be done to establish a basis for comparison or (2) the Tridentine course is not a useful
path to follow in this case because the melodic emendations implemented were not
significant. Since this line of study still leaves some questions, such as the dating of
subsequent layers, the next chapter’s discussion of the decoration and images of the
OSU Gradual can provide more insight into the multiple layers of the OSU gradual and
when they may have been added.

76

CHAPTER V
ILLUSTRATIONS AND LETTERING
Historiated Initials
As in many early manuscripts, some of the most eye-catching features of the
OSU Gradual are its historiated initials with their miniature portraits and the decorated
initials done in two main styles. There are over fifty historiated initials in the gradual
depicting various subjects, most related and a few, like the putti, with an unclear
connection to the chant texts or feasts they lead into.146 Befitting a Sanctorale, the
majority of these initials depict the saint of the day along with his or her attributes.
The very first saint who appears in this Sanctorale is St. Andrew (feast day
November 29) and he is depicted twice in a row, once at the beginning of his vigil mass
and a second time at the beginning of his main mass. This pair of images fortunately
provides an opportunity to compare and contrast two different illustrations of the same
subject. To begin with, both depictions are easily identifiable as St. Andrew because of
the X-shaped cross, which he is either holding or leaning against.147 However, in spite of
sharing the same subject matter, the two drawings have little in common stylistically in
how they are rendered. The first initial with Andrew is found on the first page of the
original layer of the book, in the initial D of Dominus secus mare Galilęę and is part of
an elaborately illustrated front page that also includes a border, illustrations of the four

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
146

The complete list of historiated initials and their subjects can be found in Appendix C.

147

St. Andrew is said to have been crucified on an X-shaped cross, now called a St. Andrew’s cross, at his
request because he did not think himself worthy to be crucified on a T-shaped cross in the same manner as
Jesus.

The saint is drawn by a hand exhibiting skill at producing well-proportioned
detail work, including a well-draped robe, finely drawn hands and facial features that are
defined and articulated with subtle shading. This Andrew is surrounded by a scene
containing plants and flowers. Upon closer inspection (Figure 5.2), Saint Andrew
appears to be holding something in his right hand, which is likely a book, an item that
makes a common appearance in St. Andrew iconography.148 This depiction of his book
may be the first clue that the illustrations can provide with regards to dating. Toward the
end of the Middle Ages (exemplars survive from the mid-15th-century),149 the “girdle
book” was a popular way to allow a user to wear a manuscript and facilitate reading in a
standing or sitting position without the need of external support. The book is bound with
extra leather on the cover designed to extend past the boards so that it can be tied into a
knot. The knot is secured on a belt or held, resulting in a portable book.150 Thanks to this
practice, the girdle book makes its appearance in late medieval illustrations, especially
those depicting saints or apostles.151 This style of book construction eventually lost favor
after the 16th-century.152 The use of it in the OSU manuscript may be an indication that
at least some layers of illustration were added in the 16th-century when girdle books
were popular. The ornamentation on the “D” initial around the saint indicates that care
has been put into this image of Andrew.

initials) and blue ink (which shows up in over 20 initials), this is the only historiated
initial that has gold included, as well as a box around it with elaborate floral details.
Unfortunately, even on very close inspection it is difficult to differentiate the layers
visually and conclude which parts were added first.

The second depiction of Andrew (Figure 5.3,) is not as finely wrought as the first
initial featuring the saint. Found within the initial “M” for the introit Mihi autem nimis
honorati sunt, he is holding a more straightforward representation of a book, but the
drawing of his hands and feet are not particularly skillful, and might even be called
clunky given their unnatural positions and the stubby appearance of the digits. The
proportions of the image are slightly squat and the shading is not as delicately done.
Although the “M” initial has some leaf and scrolling detail, the entire letter is colored in
red with little attempt to highlight the decorative detail. As opposed to the tableau of the
first Andrew, here, the inside of the initial is filled with fern-like foliation and ornate
circular details. In spite of this less favorable comparison to the first Andrew initial, this
historiated initial is still one of the most decorated in the entire volume as many of the
other letters give an impression of being incomplete.

Figure 5.3. Folio 5r – Second depiction of St. Andrew

As exemplified in this comparison, more than one hand can be detected in the
construction of the illustrations in the volume. According to Prof. James Harper of the
University of Oregon Art History department, differences in the drawing style, from
81

initial to initial, could stem more from varying levels of skill on the part of the artist,
rather than stylistic difference because of the chronology. It is possible that the OSU
Gradual was put together in a scriptorium or alternate setting where many hands
contributed, from master down to apprentice. However, it was also common practice to
purchase half-finished manuscripts and have illuminations added as the patron could
afford to spend money.153 Looking at other images that appear more than once, such as
St. Mark who is both in the front-page border (Figure 5.4) as well as in an initial during
his feast day (Figure 5.5). We can surmise that one sketch was modeled after the other
since both have the same pose and attributes, the lion, the gospel book, and the scroll
proclaiming St. Mark’s name,154 but this would be possible in both a master-andapprentice scenario as it would be in the case of a later artist trying to copy another
example in the manuscript. There does appear to be a regular patterning in play since all
female saints other than the Virgin Mary are drawn in the same pose, standing straight
and facing forward while holding a palm leaf with their bent right arm and a signifying
attribute in their left arm, as can be seen in these depictions of St. Barbara with her
tower (Figure 5.6)155 and St. Lucy with her eyes (Figure 5.7).156 St. Prisca (Figure 5.8)
and St. Agnes (Figures 5.9 and 5.10) are also draw in the same position but Agnes has

The saints represented in an initial typically include their identifying
iconographic attributes. For example, St. Lucy holds her eyes on a plate in her hand,158
and St. Lawrence carries the grid-iron on which he was tortured.159 One symbol that
appears often is the palm leaf, an indication of martyrdom, as for instance with the four
female saints depicted above. In contrast to this uniformity, each depiction of the Virgin
Mary is unique (Figures 5.11 to 5.14) to the feast day that is being celebrated. During
the Expectation, Mary is drawn with Elizabeth and in the Purification she is presenting
the infant Jesus to a rabbi. The Annunciation and Nativity also have appropriate scenes

Tabor, The Saints in Art, 76. In the story of St. Lucy, part of her torture was having her eyes gouged
out. Rather than having her hold the dagger she was tortured with, as is often the case, this St. Lucy is
holding a palm leaf, which is a representation of martyrdom.

As part of his torture, St. Lawrence was placed on a grid iron over a fire. Legend says that he cheerfully
told his tormentors to turn him over once he was sufficiently “done” on one side.

for their occasions. Just as there is a variance in the subjects of the images, there are
also significant stylistic differences in the drawing; an obvious one is the pointed halo in
the Nativity scene whereas the halos in the other scenes are standard circles. The even
wider variance seen here supports the theory that the historiated initials of the OSU
Gradual were not done all at once, but rather in stages, likely at different times and
conditions.

As brought up earlier, the illustrations vary in level of completion, and possibly
in age. Some saints and their letters are merely sketched out in black ink. Other
historiated initials have red and/or blue ink added as decoration on the letter, but not on
the depiction of the saint. The historiated initials that do not contain a saint, such as in
the case of St. Valentine, depict one putto or two putti, little winged boys. In the St.
Valentine initial, one putto is riding a large dolphin-like creature (Figure 5.15). The
combined winged boy and dolphin image is found as companions to Eros and Venus in
ancient Roman art.160 The Louvre has a marble statue in its collection dated from the 4thcentury called “Venus with Putti, a Triton and a Dolphin.”161 The putto is riding on the
back of a dolphin twice its size. The putto-dolphin pairing fell into disuse during the
Middle Ages but it re-emerges in the 1470s in a sculpture by Andrea del Verrocchio.162
From that time onwards the putto on the dolphin experienced a resurgence, continuing to
be used even into the early modern period.163 The use of imagery that was prevalent in
16th- and 17th-century art supports the idea that illustrations were added to the OSU
Gradual in stages, starting from an initial 16th-century layer, onwards.

One “historiated initial” that may provide a direct link to the manuscript’s place
of origin is from the mass in celebration of the Dedication of the Church (one of the
feasts discussed in Chapter III that contained the word “Vicensis” in the rubric). In the
image (Figure 5.16) there is a sketch of a giant monk (taller than a church) kneeling in
prayer in front of a church. Could this be a snap-shot of the Cathedral in Vic at the time
that the illustration was made? Since the original church was destroyed it may not be
possible to base comparisons of appearance on the Cathedral that now stands in Vic. But
in the future it may prove fruitful to investigate whether there are depictions of the
churches in Vic contained in the manuscripts housed at their Museo and possibly match
the monk’s church to its moment.

Secondary Initials
In the OSU Gradual, historiated initials are only found in introit texts as the first
letter of the feast for each saint. Other chants in the masses make use of a decorated
initial without a figure. These initials appear in two styles: either in black stylized
calligraphy (in use for the beginning of verses) or in a red geometric style (found at the
start of the main mass part chants). Both of these capitalization styles can be found in
manuscripts for at least as far back as the 15th-century. One of the reasons it is difficult
to date Spanish manuscripts is that “copy books” were in widespread use in the Iberian
Peninsula from the 15th- to the 18th-century as exemplars for scribes on how to construct
91

their letters. One such book that is readily available today in facsimile was produced in
the 1540s by Juan de Yciar and is known to have been a model for a collection of
manuscripts from Salamanca.164 In this book we can find an alphabet depicted in a
similar style to the black initial from the OSU Gradual. Yciar labels this style as “Letras
Quebradas.”165 Although not exactly identical to the letters in the OSU book, there are
some details that are very close, such as the diamond patterning and the curving, scrolllike designs. Something similar to the red initial can also be found in Yciar’s book under
the name “Letras de Compas.”166 The shapes of the letters are the same, although
Yciar’s versions are a little squatter and have more decoration. Some of the elaborate
“Moorish style” circle and curls in Yciar’s decorations resemble those found in the
second historiated St. Andrew discussed earlier, as does the shape of the “M.”
One memorable aspect of the black initials is the occasional appearance of a
face in profile (Figures 5.17 and 5.18). I have not encountered these in other exemplars
of the initial style except for in the manuscripts from Vic in the Hill microfilms, from
the 16th-century (Figure 5.19–5.21)167 and the 17th-century (Figures 5.22 and 5.23).168
Both of the examples from Vic have an extensive collection of more developed facial
illustrations with the black initials. The base initials are also in the same style as the
OSU manuscript. This lends more support to the dating of the OSU Gradual as having

time. The second type of non-historiated initial, the red, also has a counterpart in the Vic
volumes. What is missing from the Vic volumes are historiated initials with figures, as
most of the larger initials are decorated with either pen flourishes, or the curls and
circles found in Yciar’s book.

Scripts
Now the discussion can turn to the lettering that comprises a majority of the
Gradual, the chant text scripts. The main portion of the writing appears to be in the
Gothic Rotunda book hand, a favored script in southern Europe that first made its
appearance in the 12th-century. The most informal of the Gothic styles, it is
characterized by its more rounded appearance. A particular form of the Gothic Rotunda,
called the Italian Gothic Rotunda169 or Southern Textualis170 was not just favored in
Italy, but was also in use in southern France, Spain and Portugal.171 This style was so
much in favor that it was still in use in the 17th-century. Some significant features that

characterize this style can be seen in the OSU manuscripts: for example, the two styles
of d (Figures 5.24 and 5.25), uncial and half-uncial,172 the three forms of s (Figures 5.26
and 5.27), straight, uncial and half-uncial,173 the two types of r (Figure 5.28) straight and
round,174 and a characteristic abbreviation for “et”175 (Figure 5.29). In folio 5v, at least
two ways of writing the r are on the same page. A look at Yciar’s book reveals that the
multiple versions of d and r are consistent with a style that he calls “Letras de libros.”176

Later scribal additions to the OSU Gradual, some appearing to have been
stenciled in, are in Humanistic Bookhand script, a precursor to modern typeset.177
Humanistic Bookhand appears in sections where corrections or text replacements have
been made. One immediate feature that pops out to identify the style is the characteristic
shape of the g (Figure 5.30). Although the handwriting of these sections is still neat and
quite legible, this scribe does not have the finesse of the scribe(s) of the original rotunda
layer;178 that is, although the lettering is regular and the letter styles are consistent, the
sizing and alignment are occasionally off (Figure 5.31). One signifier that may help to
date this younger layer of text is the appearance of the “æ” (Figure 5.32) symbol, which
is absent in the older layers of the manuscript. According to James Boyce, the use of this

after 1582,179 making it likely that this addition is a post-Tridentine correction.

Comparing these areas once again to the exemplar from Vic (Ms.109), we also
find some “stray” Humanistic cursive in the volume from the 16th-century in a part of
the book that has a date written on it of 1761 (Figures 5.33 and 5.34). Could this indicate
that some of the Humanistic additions in Vic were added in the 18th-century? Anne
Bahde, the Special Collections Librarian at OSU who is tasked with the care of the
Gradual, has suggested that some of the writing in the OSU volume is in a style
consistent with the 18th-century. The particular section that she pointed out was a corner
that had to be repaired with a parchment patch and writing (Figures 5.35 and 5.36). If
we look closely at the two sides of the diagonal corner patch, we can see that the q and
the b are more consistent with the later Humanistic Bookhand style that the original
Gothic Rotunda on the rest of the page. This points to a repair done later in the life of the
book, probably to extend its usable life since care was taken to replicate the written
material lost from the removal of the original damaged section.

103

On folio 16r (Figure 5.37), another style of script that is much less formal and
regular than other styles in the volume is evident. Some of the letters in the line are
slightly tilted off from the up-down axis, giving the appearance of italicized letters.
Perhaps this was a correction done quickly, with not as much care paid to the
regularization of the lettering. If so, this is not the only example of “informal script” in
the volume. There are many instances of additions and changes to the text in the book
that are in a smaller informal script, usually also characterized by the ink being of a
more brownish tint (Figure 5.38).

Figure 5.37. Folio 16r – Example of “italicized” script

104

Figure 5.38. Folio 2v – Example of “informal script”

One last style of writing in the volume is possibly out of the ordinary. The
aforementioned use of stencil is a curious feature of the OSU Gradual, as this was not
practiced in the production of late medieval manuscripts. There are indications that one
of the hands involved in scribing the book made use of stencil (Figure 5.39). If we look
closely at the lettering in certain sections, easily identified by the regular use of the
ampersand (Figure 5.40), the lettering appears too uniform and consistent to have been
done with a free hand. It is also possible to detect gaps in the letter, which is probably
because of the small connecting bridges that hold stencil forms together.

105

Figure 5.39. Folio 10r – Example of a stenciled section

106

Finally, there is evidence in a couple of places in which the historiated initial of
the introit had been cut out and replaced with a patch (Figure 5.41), such as on the Feast
of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. However, the text of the introit has not
been changed, and thus the initial did not need to be altered. The new “E” written in the
patch as a replacement does not appear to have been done by a scribe with any particular
calligraphic skill. Could this have just been a repair patch necessitated by someone
cutting out a historiated initial? As this is a major feast, might this initial have been one
of the nicely historiated examples in the book? It seems that even books as unassuming
as this Gradual can also fall victim to book vandals and art collectors.

Figure 5.41. Folio 9v – Cut out historiated initial
A close examination of the special initials and script styles of this manuscript has
proved to be beneficial. From looking at the historiated initials we can see a lack of
uniformity that points to many hands contributing to the illustrations in the text. Details
such as the occasional appearance of the girdle book suggest that at least some layers
107

were done no later the 16th-century. The appearance of the putto on a dolphin construct
indicates that another layer of sketches was likely added later in the 16th or even in the
17th-century. These two time frames are supported by the concordances in the secondary
initials between the OSU gradual and the dated 16th- and 17th-century graduals that are
in Vic. The appearance of the faces in all three books places them in the same general
area among a group of illustrators exploring similar types of drawing. It is difficult to
say which volumes were illustrated first at this juncture, but a deeper investigation to
compare all the faces in the books could be a future project.
The various script styles that appear in the OSU Gradual also support the theory
that many hands at various times may have scribed text into the manuscript. As with the
illustrations, the text scribal hands exhibit various skill levels, running the gamut from
very precise to barely legible. The variance of styles from Gothic Rotunda to Humanistic
Bookhand (and even possibly Secretary hand) shows the passage of time between layers
of text since each layer addition was likely instituted using the script style prevalent at
the time. The distinct styles point to at least two to three layers of text, if not more. The
“informal” additions are more difficult to date. The possibility of an 18th-century layer
is not impossible, but more investigation has to be done to see if the supporting evidence
is there.

108

CHAPTER VI
CONCLUSION
My goal has been to proceed with this investigation in a systematic manner that
allowed me to build evidence and support a conclusion so that this work can serve as a
guide for those who are interested in pursuing similar types of research. I hope I have
provided enough information for a novice who needs somewhere to start, yet keep the
information relevant for a more experienced reader. Liturgical manuscripts from the late
medieval period and later, such as large-format antiphonals and graduals, often end up in
collections far from their point of origin. Unfortunately we rarely have precise records of
their journey or even of their identity, as in the case of the OSU Gradual. As it is the
case in many college and university libraries, and also in city libraries, the OSU Valley
Library does not have a dedicated position for a Latin paleographer or chant specialist.
The question becomes, when faced with such a book, where a generalist would begin? It
is this need that I aimed to address; I wanted to offer a way for non-specialists to
approach and study musical-liturgical books.
Each step of this journey added a piece to the puzzle of the identity of the book.
The physical examination revealed the purpose of the OSU Gradual, it is a book meant
to be used and it has had a long life in service. That it is a “workhorse” can be discerned
by the solid way it is constructed and by the sturdy materials that it consists of. Although
it has decorations, they are not of the caliber that would make this a display item. The
size of the book is due to the practicality of having one book made to last and that
everyone could share – which was a normal practice of the time – as opposed to needing
to face the expense of providing individual booklets for each member of a choir.
109

In the process of constructing a catalog of contents for the OSU Gradual, it was
possible to determine the specific type of book this manuscript is, namely a Sanctorale,
a liturgical manuscript that contains the chant parts of the mass for saints’ feast days. It
differs from a Temporale, which contains the mass chants for daily masses, and an
Antiphonale, which contains the chants of the Divine offices. The location of
provenance (or place of origin) appeared to be Vic in Catalonia (Spain) as indicated in
the rubrics and supported by other evidence. These issues already cover two of the three
salient points that Hiley states are fundamental in the identification of an unknown
manuscript, namely the type of book and its provenance. One the other hand, the third
piece of the puzzle, the date, is much harder to establish.
Although a definitive dating is not possible for the OSU Gradual at this time, and
may never be, we now have a sufficient number of clues to propose at least an
approximate timeline. I would state that a terminus post quem of c.1500 for the initial
layer of the main text block would be reasonable, based on the accumulated evidence
(e.g. presence of some specific saints; chant text concordance with late 15th-century
sources from Vic; and script styles). The text in the oldest layer is consistent with the
Missale Vicense from 1496, which is well before the Tridentine Reform. If construction
of the OSU Gradual had begun in the post-Tridentine era (after 1564), it is likely that the
original layer would have included the “newer” texts found in the emendations, rather
than the “older” text that matches the Missale Vicense. The saints’ feast days that appear
in the main text block are also consistent with an earlier date.
On the other hand, I am inclined to date the index in the second half of the 16thcentury as a likely post-Tridentine addition, since all the saints included are from the

110

universal Roman martyrology. One of those feasts, that of Our Lady of the Snow, did
not become a universal feast until 1558. However, the index is probably not part of a
later 17th-century addition since – as it is the case for the main text block – it does not
include later saints such as Teresa of Ávila or Francis Xavier, and its script style is still
consistent with the Gothic Rotunda/Textualis rather than with the Humanistic Bookhand
script.
Based on the presence of the girdle book and the putto-dolphin tandem, I would
propose that additions and emendations were continually made to the Gradual
throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The multiple palimpsest – and the fact that the
layers can be dissected to identify likely times of construction based on the chant text,
music and lettering – support that the book has had several layers added at different
points in its existence. Although not definitive, a terminus ante quem in the mid-18thcentury for the last added layer is plausible based on (1) the presence of Humanistic
Bookhand and stenciling, and (2) on the fact that the Vic gradual dated in the 16thcentury presents solid evidence of 18th-century additions, specifically dating from 1761.
There are still many questions that need to be answered about the OSU Gradual,
such as: how it ended up in Oregon; why it has so many alterations and other curiosities,
like the story of the added chant for Santiago de Compostela in the back of the volume
that seems out of place, and many more. However, I hope to have provided a useful start
for the non-specialist. Some possibilities for further study could be:
(1) as I suggested at the end of Chapter V, a closer examination of the faces in
the black initials in comparison with those from the Vic volumes;

111

(2) a thorough cataloging and comparison of all the historiated initials to
determine similarities, differences and possible relationships;
(3) and a comparison of the script styles in the OSU Gradual with additional
books from Vic to help determine a more precise dating.
Given the rising interest in late-medieval sources, including those from the
Iberian Peninsula, I hope that a larger pool of sources for comparison will be readily
available in the near future. In addition, although it has been useful to have access to
images of other graduals from Vic, a comparison with more manuscripts from the area
would provide further exemplars for illustrations and scripts types. Even non-musical
manuscripts would be relevant in this case and may help to piece together the puzzle of
the OSU Gradual chronology.
Using my examination of the OSU Gradual as a sample, an interested researcher
could use the following as tools in his or her investigation to help evaluate the purpose
and provenance of graduals and similar musical manuscripts:
(1) physical attributes, such as size of item and materials of construction,
(2) indicators of provenance, such as colophons, rubrics, saints venerated during
certain periods in specific localities and chant concordances,
(3) musical characteristics, such as note types and melodic construction, and
(4) iconography, symbolism and script type analysis.
It is my hope that through this brief journey with the OSU Gradual, individuals and/or
institutions will take interest in pursuing further research along the points I presented.

APPENDIX A
OSU GRADUAL SANCTORALE INVENTORY
Note:
The titles of chant parts have been rendered for the most part as they are written in the
OSU gradual, as has the format of the folio numbers, although abbreviation have been
expanded as indicated in Cappelli. In cases where variants exist, I have chosen one form
for the sake of consistency, unless the change is specific to layers. All month and day
dates were added based on feast days identified from the Missale Vicense, Butler’s and
other calendric sources. I have also added English translation of the saints’ names.
Although Officium is used in the Gradual for the entrance chant, Introit is used here.
The red folio numbers are from the modern digital images and the black folio numbers
are how the manuscript is originally numbered in Roman numerals.
Key:
Chancery font = added informal script, typically brown
Crossed out = erased or crossed out from page
Grey lighted = palimpsest/newer addition, sometimes stenciled
