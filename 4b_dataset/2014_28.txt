PREFACE

W ith th e in tro d u c tio n of In form ation and C om m unication T echnology (ICT)
lib ra ry services have changed to a g re a t extent. It has reach ed far a h ead from the
tra d itio n al circulation services to p re s e n t info rm atio n services. In form ation services are
s tre n g th e n e d due to a d v a n ce m en t in In te rn et, e-re so u rc e s and c o m p u te r softw are.
A lm ost all lib ra ry functions, i.e., acquisition, processing, m ain te n a n c e and d issem in atio n
have b e e n affected by technological changes. In th is w ay one can say th a t th e
p e n e tra tio n of ICT in th e p ro fessio n of lib ra ry and info rm atio n science is d eep rooting. It
can be easily se en th a t th e ICT b a sed a u to m a te d lib ra ries a re also grow ing w ith
tra d itio n al libraries. But w ith th is stre n g th several com plications and challenges are
also arisin g as th e gap b e tw e e n th e tra d itio n al lib raries and m o d ern ICT b a sed lib raries
is w id en in g giving rise to a n ew concept, nam ely, ‘digital divide’.

This te rm is w idely

u sed in d escrib in g th e difference b e tw e e n lib raries w hich have and w hich do n o t have
access to th e Info-technologies due to technical e x p e rtise o r financial resources.
A lthough th e la tte r is th e m ajo r cause in th e p re s e n t aren a, b u t it is only access to
technology th a t can p rovide a so lution to th is problem .

Thus, th is rese a rc h will stu d y O pen Source Softw are and O pen Access reso u rc es
available on th e W eb. This re se a rc h will be an effort to change th e m ind of th o se w ho
believe th a t In te rn e t b a sed services can be available only to th e affluent libraries. This
p ro p o se d rese a rc h w o rk will be an in te rv e n tio n b e tw e e n th e m o d ern ICT b ased
lib raries and th e tra d itio n a l lib ra ries w hich a re lagging b eh in d due to financial condition

o r due to th e lack of in fo rm atio n a b o u t th e Open Source Softw are and O pen Access
resources.

This rese a rc h w ould help th e lib ra ries w ith no finance o r w ith lim ited finance
w hich are n o t able to buy expensive com m ercial lib ra ry m an a g e m e n t softw are,
digitization so ftw are an d scholarly d atab ases. It will help th em to be a w are a b o u t th e
o p en source so ftw are and o p e n access lite ra tu re th a t can be helpful to get th e ir w o rk
done in place of com m ercial softw are. A dditionally, th is re se a rc h will help th em to com e

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

1.1.

Background

The invention of paper in 105 AD in China by Cai Lun and printing machine in 15th Century
in Europe, were the initial factors that changed the status and fate o f the libraries worldwide.
Since then libraries have seen the technology growth in all their aspects, i.e., collection,
process and services. Collection-wise it has grown over the time from clay tablets, to papyrus
rolls, to paper, and now to electronic documents. Even the process o f preparation o f library
records have changed from hand written records using ink pen, to type writers and now to
computers. Further, services o f a librarian have changed from guardian o f documents, to
circulator of documents, to information provider and now he is regarded as knowledge
manager. The technological changes have been affecting almost every type o f library
including public, academic and special. A computer with the Internet access has become a
very basic necessity of any type o f library.
The m ajor changes for libraries came in 1876 when several developments took place together.
These developments were the publication o f 1st edition of Dewey Decimal Classification,
creation of Cutter’s Rules for Dictionary Catalogue, and formation o f Am erican Library
Association; since then a series o f developments and new innovations were noticed in the
field o f library and information science. W illiams (2002) notices the introduction o f
technology to automate library functions entered in the libraries with the use o f punch cards
for the library circulation and acquisition during 1930s extending to 1960s.

1.2.

Genesis of library automation

It was W orld W ar II that staged the development o f libraries throughout the globe. Libraries
had huge collection gaps created by W orld W ar II (Rayward, 2002). The libraries, after the
W orld W ar II, were under huge pressure o f acquisition and quick technical processing o f it.
The existing library technologies were proving inadequate and incapable to bear this
pressure. During this time library professionals got attracted towards the new emerging
technologies that could boost up the work. But the libraries at that time were not able to
manage immediate transition towards implementation o f new technologies.

Rayward

observes the situation as;

W hen existing library technologies began to break down under economic, social and
bibliographical pressures emerging in the late 1950s and early 1960s and library
began seeking relief in automation, the introduction o f automation involved profound
m isunderstanding between librarians and early systems developers about the nature o f
the professional knowledge and tradition o f librarianship on one hand and o f the
capabilities o f the new technology and what was required for implementation on the
other. (Rayward, 2002, p. 6).

However, various projects on Library automation were initiated around the world. According
to a survey carried out by Library Autom ation Research and Consulting (LARC), there were
about 2,000 library automation projects in all types o f libraries by 1968 and another 20,000
library automation projects were underw ay in the w orld by 1973 (Patrinostro, 1974).

Am erican and British libraries began experiments with computers in 1950s and 1960s that
quickly spread to other countries of Europe. No innovation or development, according to
Rayward (2002), in the field o f library profession, after that, was simple or straight forward.
Every development had gone through extensive literature studies and efforts o f library and
technical professionals.

3

Bush (1945) m ay be the first scientist to thing about an Integrated Library M anagement
Software. In his article “As we m ay think” he talked about a device that can control
circulation, cataloguing and indexing of the books o f a library. He observed:

A library o f a m illion volumes could be compressed into one end o f a desk. If the
hum an race has produced since the invention o f movable type a total record, in the
form o f magazines, newspapers, books, tracts, advertising blurbs, correspondence,
having a volume corresponding to a billion books, the whole affair, assembled and
compressed, could be lugged off in a m oving van. Mere compression, o f course, is not
enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it,
and this aspect o f the m atter comes later. Even the m odem great library is not
generally consulted; it is nibbled at by a few. (Bush, 1945, p. 2).
A nd later in the same he suggests:
Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort o f m echanized private file
and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, "memex" will do. A memex
is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications,
and which is m echanized so that it m ay be consulted with exceeding speed and
flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory. (Bush, 1945, p. 6)
His concept o f ‘m em ex’ had straight away shown a way for ‘hypertext research’ o f Ted
Nelson. Ideas o f Bush realized firstly in M assachusetts Institute o f Technology (MIT) in the
form o f COMIT which was developed by Victor Yngve and others in 1957 (Yngve, 1958).
COMIT was a program ming language to manage linguistic computation that enabled a
program mer to retrieve a particular string o f information. After this, a series o f innovations
for the automation were taken place. The librarians m oved towards new vision and ideas for
the use o f technologies for the advancement o f library systems. This move led to an explosion
of the experiments for computerization o f library functions during 1960s and 70s.
It was the third generation o f computer applications which m arked a significant invention by
Jack Kilby o f Texas Instruments in 1958. The invention was integrated circuit. It replaced
transistors o f second generation and it was able to pack a huge num ber o f transistors into a
single chip o f silicon. By the end o f this generation instead of punched cards, librarians and
other technical professionals interacted with third generation computer, through keyboards

4

and m onitor and interfaced with operating system (ITL Education Solutions Limited, 2006).
The development o f computers during 1958 guided Hans Peter Luhn o f IBM to generate a
computer based keyword index for the articles appearing in Chemical Abstracts. This
keyword index known as Keyword in Context (KW IC) was found very comfortable for the
computers as it was inexpensive and presented several access points (Comog, 1983).

In 1960s another instance o f computer use for cataloguing appeared when Library of
Congress used M achine Readable Catalogue (MARC) for the production o f standard
computerized cataloguing cards. Technologies in this area flourished rapidly to take the
developments from M ARC to MARC II by the end of 1968. The M ARC was designed with
the help o f ‘fields’ and ‘tags’ consisting o f three digit num bers from 001 to 999 for each
bibliographic details o f the document. Allocating bibliographic details to these tags is called
‘tagging’, i.e., Title, Author, Publisher, ISBN No. and so on. MARC II became well known
among libraries in the US resulting in NISO (National Information Standards Organisation)
accepting it as a standard format for bibliographic records in 1973 (Wedgeworth, 1993).
1960s also m arked the establishment o f Ohio College Library Centre1 (OCLC) in 1967. With
the help o f OCLC, University o f Ohio became the first university of the world to do online
cataloguing as early in 1971 (OCLC, 2010; Jorden, 2006). M embership o f OCLC in its initial
years was open for only academic libraries especially college libraries but with an
amendment in OCLC Articles o f Incorporation on M ay 17, 1972 non-academ ic libraries were
also perm itted to join OCLC (Grosch, 1995). This step o f OCLC opened the door to widening
the new -bom OCLC online system towards cooperative agreements w ith m any regional
library networks outside Ohio; by 1975, OCLC had grown up with over 500 participating

xN ow Online C o m p u t e r Library C e n te r

5

libraries. The num ber further extended to above 2000 academic, research, public and special
libraries by the end o f 1970s.
On the other hand MARC Project boom ed up and spread a revolution o f computerized library
cataloguing in the US followed by the development o f national M ARC projects by the
various national agencies in countries worldwide. U K MARC in the U K and similar projects
in several countries m ushroom ed and by 1986, about 19 countries reported existence of
national MARC service and another 25 were in progress (Wedgeworth, 1993). However, it
was still not clear that how exchange of bibliographical data could cross the national
boundaries. Later initiatives from IFLA (International Federation o f Library Associations and
Institutions) to develop UNIM ARC (Universal Machine Readable Catalogue) made it
possible to share standardized bibliographic data globally.

1.3.

ARPANET, Internet and Emergence of Online Databases

In 1959 engineers o f the US Department o f Defence, came together and formed Advanced
Research Project Agency (ARPA). The objective o f this team was to develop a network that
can be used for peer to peer communication in Department o f Defence.

Department o f

Defence did not approve the use of this approach, but this research o f ARPA provided a
strong basis for the Internet. A fter failing to get its project get approved at Department o f
Defence, ARPA Connected computers o f four Universities of the US, i.e., University o f
California at Los Angeles, the University o f California at Santa Barbara, Stanford Research
Institute, and the University o f Utah to form ARPANET in 1969. By 1971 the num ber raised
to 13 Nodes with 30 different university sites funded by the ARPA (Cerf, 1993). W ithin next
two years the Global Networks become a reality when University College of London and
Royal Radar Establishment, N orway connected to ARPANET (Crocke, 2000; Kirstein, 1988;
Zakon, 2010; B aldauf & Stair, 2009). University of California later used this netw ork to

6

develop an Online Public Access Catalogue nam ed M elvyl2. The subsequent development of
a num ber o f protocols, i.e., TCP/IP, FTP, Gopher, Telnet, etc. and m any other networks such
as CSNET3, M ILNET4, BITNET5, and EDUCOM led to the birth o f the Internet.

Development in networks also realized the dream o f M ichael Hart to provide books free of
cost to the public when he started a project in 1971 known as Project Gutenberg. Project
Gutenberg has the credit o f being w orld’s ‘1st virtual library’6 and online full text database of
books. Success o f Project Gutenberg, invention o f microcom puters and storage devices, and
unprecedented growth o f the Internet provided a new way o f information dissemination
through online databases. DIALOG was the m ost popular commercial database to search
reference and bibliographical information for scientific and technical information.

1.4.

Evolution of Digital Divide

Research in automation o f library functions was m arked m ainly in four countries, i.e., United
States o f America, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. A few universities and
institutions played pioneering role in library automation. In the US it was University of

2Melvyl w a s s t a r t e d in University of California as a library a u t o m a t i o n s y s te m for circulation in 1977. It w a s
a vailable online in 1980.

California, Library o f Congress, Ohio State University, and Online Computer Library Centre
(Tedd, 1994; Rayward, 2002), University o f Newcastle and University o f Bath in UK(Line,
2006), University o f Guelph and University o f W aterloo in Canada (Tedd, 1994) and
University o f Adelaide in Australia (Tedd, 1994). Later sim ilar research extended to few
more universities o f these countries. The early automation systems include University of
California’s Melvyl, G eac’s ADVANCE, Dynix and BLCM P’s BLS, IM E’s TfNlib, Ohio
State U niversity’s Library Computer System.

The continuous developments in library computerisation led the libraries o f developed
countries far ahead to that o f libraries in Asia, Africa, Latin Am erica and m any other
developing and under developed countries. The term ‘Digital D ivide’ became prominent in
1990s when the differences between the various fields, i.e., education, commerce and
Industry o f the countries with IT power and without IT power was clearly visible. The
libraries were not exempted from this.

The term digital divide m ay be “perceived to be the gap between those people who have
access to the latest information and communications technologies and those who cannot”
(Murelli, 2002). According to Pippa Norris (2001, p. 2) the digital divide is understood to be
the difference between “Those who do, and those who do not, use the panoply o f digital
resources to engage, mobilize, and participate in public life.”

The digital divide was observed largely in three aspects; first, availability o f technology;
second, availability to finance to acquire the technology and third, availability o f skills to
make use o f the technology. A fter the birth o f the Internet, its growth was lim ited for the first
20 years but as soon as World W ide Web came into existence in 1989 and web browsers were
developed, it became a boom and developed rapidly.

8

On the one side where computerization of libraries was started in developed countries, i.e.,
USA, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, etc. in 1950s and 60s, the other developing
and under developed countries could apply these technologies only after 1980s. India
reported use o f computers in libraries in 1965 in INSDOC, and Bangladesh in 1996. In
Africa, Nigerian special libraries initiated the implementation o f technologies and played the
pioneering role for computerisation o f libraries.

1.5.

Development of Open Source Software and Open Access Resources

In 1985 UNESCO developed a software called CDS/ISIS (Computerized Documentation
System - Integrated Set for Information Systems) to develop in-house databases of local
collection. It was distributed free o f cost to the libraries worldwide. Since then libraries in
developing and under developed countries started their interest in autom ating library
functions. CDS/ISIS was prim arily an information storage and retrieval system used for
storing and retrieving bibliographical details of library resources.

In 1985 Richard Stallman established Free Software Foundation (FSF) with an objective to
promote universal freedom to create, distribute and m odify computer software applications.
Additionally it was established to generate and use funds for GNU project (A project that
m arked the beginning o f free software movement), started by Stallman in 1983. The head
office o f FSF is in M assachusetts, USA.

The philosophy o f GNU project and FSF was not only to provide free access to software but
to provide software in such a m anner in which users can run the software, access the source
code, m odify the source code for its improvement and redistribute it to others. The authors of
the software applied General Public License (GPL) to their software. A m ajor success came
to GNU Project in 1991 when it, w ith the help o f Linus Torvalds, could develop completely

9

free software for operating system known as Linux. Since then a num ber o f initiatives have
been taken towards the development o f free software. Today we can find free software for
any operating system as well as for any purpose. The field of library and information science
is no exception.

In 1998, Eric S. Raym ond and Bruce Perens form ed Open Source Initiative (OS1) with a hope
to remove the ambiguity o f the individuals who perceived “free software” as anti­
commercial. The aim of OS1 was to bring software business into open source in which they
could get remarkable success. The concept o f Open Source Software is explained in details in
Chapter 5.

A trend in Open Source Software in librarianship started with the establishment o f Open
Source Initiative. A series o f open source software applications developed in a row. For
example, Koha integrated library m anagement system in 1999, Greenstone Digital Library
Software and E-prints Digital Library Software in 2000, Dspace Digital Library Software in
2002, Fedora Digital Library Software in 2003, Newgenlib integrated library management
software in 2005, and Evergreen integrated library m anagement software in 2006. These
software helped library professional a lot in bridging digital divide and automating their
libraries in a very cost effective manner. Open Source software empowered library
professionals to compete with the growing technological changes.

As far as open access is concerned, free access to literature was all along there even in
ancient times w hen there were no legal restrictions in having access to literature. But with the
invention in printing technologies, price factor started to be involved in accessing knowledge.
Slowly and gradually, accessibility to available literature, especially research literature,
turned costly to costlier. With the establishment o f Educational Research Information Centre
(ERIC) in 1966 one m ay see the development o f open access movem ent though the

10

footmarks o f open access were felt so early when a num ber o f inventors did not patent their
inventions and kept them under public domain, i.e., open access.

With the growth of the Internet and World Wide Web the distance between the countries
across the w orld became narrower. The concept of resource sharing is realized in true sense.
In last few years m ost o f the countries o f the w orld could afford access to computers and
other information technology. The cost o f the Internet and Computers has reduced to such an
extent that any library can easily adopt it with m inimum finance. Additionally, increase in
ICT education and professional trainings by software vendors have reduced the skills barriers
to operate the m odem software. However, on the other hand these developments also
increased the perception in people that these technologies are going to result in differences in
development opportunities to people, and that a gap will be developed between those who
can access these technologies and those who cannot. This is due to the financial constraints
which is still a concern for libraries to acquire costly software and online databases to provide
high-tech services to their users.

1.6.

Statement of the Problem

A continuous salient role o f ICT in libraries is an indisputable reality. A num ber o f articles
over several decennia have emphasized the technological transform ation in libraries.
Information services are strengthened due to advancement in Internet, e-resources and
computer software. Alm ost all library functions, i.e., acquisition, processing, maintenance
and dissemination have been affected by technological changes. In this way one can say that
the penetration o f ICT in the profession o f library and information science is deep rooting. It
can be easily seen that the ICT based ‘automated libraries’ are also growing with ‘traditional
libraries’. At the same time

several problems are also arising due to the widening gap

between the traditional libraries and m odem ICT based libraries. Once, Florence Nightingale,

11

pioneer o f m odem nursing, said that “The progressive w orld is necessarily divided into two
classes — those who take the best o f what there is and enjoy it — those who wish for
something better and try to create it” (Wikiquote, 2009). In the preview of this quote o f
Nightingale, the whole universe is divided into two divisions. Earth as Land and Water,
hum an beings as m en and women, morals as right and wrong and the society again is divided
into two categories, i.e., Capitalist and Non-Capitalist. In this w ay libraries are also divided
into two divisions, i.e., rich and poor, in other words libraries which can afford new
technologies and libraries which cannot afford such technologies. This division has given
birth to the concepts o f ‘Techno-capitalism’ and ‘Digital divide’ which are getting very
important and assert a debatable place among library professionals. Earlier every library had
been providing almost similar services with the lim ited available resources. The m ajor
difference that could be found between these libraries was regarding their collections only.
But in the technological era this difference is touching quality o f service also. Organisations
with a healthy budget provide attractive services with the help o f new emerging library
management software, digital library software, e-content m anagement software, client server
technologies and online literature/databases to their users in their libraries. All these software
and databases are very costly, so the organisations with poor economic condition cannot
afford it and still carry on with traditional circulation services that lead to a big gap between
these libraries and m odem IT based libraries. Use o f ICT is directly affecting the popularity
o f the libraries especially public and academic libraries in developing countries like India. It
m ay not require a great research to evaluate the differences in quality o f public libraries
between libraries o f developing and that o f developed nations. Lack o f ICT results into
insufficient services to the users, hence the library professionals o f these libraries feel
backward in comparison to the others. This technological difference has given rise to this new
concept o f ‘Digital divide’. This term is widely used in describing the difference between

12

libraries which have and which do not have access to the Info-technologies either due to
technical expertise or financial resources. However the latter is the m ajor cause in the present
arena.

However, it is only present technology that can provide a solution to this problem. In this
world where capitalists are leading, there is a small segment that does not believe in the
capitalistic view and are following M arxist ideology. They believe that an opportunity to
grow should be available to all regardless o f their status, caste, creed, colour etc. These
groups believe in open access and open source and they are awakening the w orld about open
source and open access.

If we refer the research articles published on these topics we find num ber o f such writings.
But m ost o f these deal with one or two software or a few databases which are available in the
public domain. However, there is a lack o f literature discussing in full the open source
m ovement and open access movem ent from a librarian’s point of view. This study attempts to
fill in this information gap.

Thus, this research titled ‘Open source software and open access resources fo r enhancing
library services: An exploratory study’ will study open source software and open access
resources available on the Web. This research is an effort to change the m ind o f those who
believe that Internet based services can be available only to the affluent libraries This
proposed research work will be an intervention between the m odem ICT based libraries, and
the traditional libraries which are lagging behind due to financial condition or due to the lack
of information about the open source software and open access resources.

1.7.

Research questions

The present study would attempt to answer the following questions.

13

•

How open source software m ovement originated, developed and succeeded?

•

How m any important open source software projects are there for libraries?

•

W hich open source software w ould be the best for library automation?

•

W hich open source software w ould be the best for development o f a digital library?

•

How open access m ovement started and developed and has impacted the library and
information services?

•

Are there enough English language open access e-Joum als from various subjects to
enrich a library’s collection?

1.8. Objectives of the study
The objectives o f this study are:
•

To analyse the Open Source Software M ovement from its birth to present status from
a librarian’s point o f view.

•

To analyse the features o f open source software for library automation and
development o f a digital library.

•

To construct a m odel o f optimum open source software for a library

•

To analyse the Open Access Movement, its development and its impact on Library
and Information Services.

•

To identify and collect various English language Open Access e-Joum als from
different subjects.

1.9. Significance of the study
This research w ould help the libraries with no finance or with lim ited financial resources.
Libraries that are not able to buy expensive commercial library m anagement software,
digitization software and scholarly databases, through this study, w ould become aware o f the

14

open source software and open access literature that can be helpful to get their work done
without huge financial resources. Additionally, this research will help them to come out o f the
dilemma o f selection o f a proper Integrated Library M anagem ent Software (ILMS) and other
open source software out o f a num ber o f available open source software. The exemplary
database o f English language scholarly journals, which is provided in Appendix A of this
research report, will strengthen any type o f library in respect o f its digital collection.

M any libraries in developing countries like India do not have sufficient resources to deliver
m odem Information Technology (IT) based services as effectively as delivered by those in
developed countries. This inequality threatens the fundamental laws o f library science. In fact
it is not possible to minimise and remove the inequalities and get m odem sophisticated
technology for all libraries but with the help o f open source software and open access
resources. The present research addresses this issue head-on.

1.10. Scope of the Study
The scope of this study is delimited to open source software and open access resources. This
study is a descriptive study that does not collect the data through any questionnaire or
interview. The study carries out descriptive analysis o f open access m ovem ent and open
source movement. Moreover, the software which are freely available on the Internet but are
not open source do not come under the purview o f this study. In this study, no attempt is
made to evaluate any open source software through prim ary sources o f data collection.
However, secondary sources o f information are used to assess the open source software. The
study also aims to draw an optimum m odel o f open source software for libraries that they can
use successfully and rely on.

15

1.11. Limitation of the Study
In the present study the researcher could not touch Web 2.0 tools that are freely available on
the Internet due to their volatile nature and complexities. In addition to that, in listing open
access journals, researcher has used only English language open access journals, however,
open access journals in a num ber o f languages are available.

1.12. Structure of the research report
The present work is planned under 8 chapters, which are briefly discussed below.
Chapter 1: Introduction

This chapter briefly discusses the introduction o f computer applications in libraries. The
researcher has tried to emboss the level o f struggle in implementing technologies into the
libraries. Additionally this chapter defines the statement of the problem. Objectives o f the
study are also stated in this chapter. The significance, scope and limitations o f the study has
been m entioned and the plan o f study report has been formulated.

Chapter 2: Related Literature: An overview

To understand the problem and critical aspect o f the subject a num ber o f studies and research
literature are needed to be referred.

Hence this chapter on related literature is one o f the very

important chapters o f the study. This chapter includes an overview o f the work done on open
access and open source since the beginning o f the concept.

Chapter 3: Research Design and M ethods Used in the Study

This chapter describes the research design used in the present study. M oreover, the methods
used for the present study has been explained in detail.

Chapter 4: Open Source M ovement: An Analysis

16

This chapter discusses the open source software movement. This m ovement was started as a
general movem ent and entered in the field o f library and information science in late 1990s. It
faced m any dissenting voices and doubts o f its success in library fields as people in library
and information science were not computer experts and m ay not program me the codes for
library software. However, the time proved such doubts as wrong. This chapter discusses this
story that revolutionised the information services in libraries.

Chapter 5: Open Source Software for Libraries

This chapter deals with the technical features of the prominent open source software for
libraries. Researcher has selected software from various categories such as library
management software, digital library software, etc. which are used extensively in libraries.
This chapter also presents evaluation o f software based on the existing studies.

Chapter 6: Optim um Open Source Software for a Library: A M odel

This chapter fulfils the last objective o f the study. The researcher has identified and explained
an optimum open source software m odel for a library. This m odel is suggested keeping in
m ind the libraries o f India that are having inadequate finances and technical expertise. The
researcher has also given the reasons and justifications for suggesting this particular model.

Chapter 7: Open Access M ovement: An Analysis

This chapter deals with the concept of open access in detail from the librarian’s point of view.
This chapter fulfils the first objective o f the study. This chapter enunciates the analytical
chronology o f the open access m ovem ent under various headings. The researcher has found
that the open access m ovement has been put forward as a strong opposition to subscription
based scholarly journals and is very helpful to the libraries to deliver excellent information
services to the users.

17

Chapter 8: Conclusions and Suggestions

This chapter presents and highlights the conclusions emerging from the findings derived from
the analysis in previous chapters. On the basis of derived conclusions researcher has drawn
some suggestions to m ake the open access movem ent and open source m ovem ent more
powerful and effective in the coming years.

CHAPTER II

RELATED LITERATURE: AN OVERVIEW
Review of literature is a process to identify the research problem and research gaps in a field
of study. Overview o f related literature in this chapter is synthesis o f research that supports
open source software and open access literature. This chapter includes an overview o f open
source software and open access literature. The following overview o f related literature is
divided into two sections, i.e., open source software and open access literature.

2.1.

Related literature: Open Source Software

The literature on the open source software is scattered in a num ber o f ways, i.e., open source,
as a movement, open source operating system, open source software in various fields
including library and information science. However, the present study is concerned with open
source m ovem ent and open source software in library and information science. As a general
m ovement a num ber of studies are available to describe the development o f open source
movement. History o f open source m ovement in literature is presented from several points of
views and standards. For example, Raym ond (2001), DiBona, Ockman, & Stone (1999),
Soderberg (2008), and Kelty (2008) deal with ethical, m oral and ideological view;Daffara
and Gongalez-Barahona (2004) study open source m ovem ent as a project; Laurent (2004)
emphasizes on the licensing o f free and open source software and the like. In addition to
these specific writings a num ber o f general writings are available such as,W illiams (2002)
and Evars (2000) who narrate the whole story o f the beginning of open source movement;
Gay (2002) synthesized the articles o f Stallman describing his philosophy towards software
and history o f free software movement; and Koch (2005) reviewed the research done on free
software m ovem ent and open source software m ovem ent and m any more. The open source

20

software m ovem ent initially was part of free software foundation and later on saperated from
it and was term ed as open source movement. By principle both are same but are different in
their values. Raym ond (2001) provides a very important account o f open source software,
reasons behind the starting o f open source software and the philosophical difference between
the two. He also narrates his experience as a m em ber o f free software movem ent (Williams,
2010 ).

People from Free Softare Foundation saperated their ways and divided into two movement
free software m ovem ent and open software movement. However, by and large both are
known as open source movement. The first objective o f Free Software Foundation was to
develop an open source operating system which was achieved with the development of
Linux. W ith success o f Linux, a huge num ber o f people started to support open source
m ovement and looked towards open source software not only in operating systems but also in
other application software. The movem ent m oved from general to specific through the
development o f software related to specific field o f endeavour, in the case o f present study
the focus

is on open source software related to library operations. Attention of library

professionals was drawn with the historical writing o f Daniel Chudnov (1999a; 1999b). After
these studies a num ber o f writing in support or against the idea o f Danier Chunov published
rapidly. Tennant (Tennant, 2000) had not seen any ambitious open source project for libraries
while Digital Library Federation (Digital Library Federation, 2001) believed that OSS could
be economical and potential alternative for libraries.M arshall Breeding (Breeding, 2002),
however had not seen early suceess to open source software in the field o f libraries due to
lack to program ming knowledge in librarians and high cost o f software development.
M uir(Muir, 2005), however tried to analyse open source software in both positive and
negetive p ersp ectiv e.

21

Am ong these dissenting voices open source software for libraries were developing
continuously. However the literature on these was relatively less except the manuals
developed by the developers o f the software. Clark (2000), and M organ (2012) also saw the
possiblilities o f open source software in library and information science. They also listed
some websites notifying open source software for libraries.

The above m entioned studies, except a few later ones, discuss open source software for
libraries, dealing with open source movement, but none o f them

discuss open source

software m ovement from the view point of a library professional. However, some studies
provide good historical details o f library automation, though not with open source software
(Grosch, 1995; Line, 2006; Rayward, 2002). These studies are helpful to get the

gist o f

activities that were going on in the field o f libraies during the development o f open source
movement. The history of computer applications in libraries is so scattered that it is very
difficult to tie them into a single thread.

Koha is claimed as first open source software for library management. Blake and Rachel
(2000) introduced Koha to the w orld after first release. A fter this a num ber of write ups were
published on Koha and other open source software. Anctil & Beheshti (2004) provided a
brief overview of the open source ILS projects in existence in the initial phase o f open source
m ovement in libraries. Engard (2010) listed a num ber o f open source tools for improving
library services. She also provided the experiences o f users using those tools. Ransom,
Cormack, & Black (2009) rem inded whole development process and the difficulties faced in
bringing out Koha ILS. However these writings were lim ited to one or some more software,
and none o f these source could provide full information about open source m ovement in
libraries.

22

W ith the passage o f time when more alternatives for open source software came into
existence several studies evaluating and comparing these software had come into existence.
Giri (2012) and Singh (2013) evaluated NewGenLib and recom mended it as a very powerful
open source ILS. Singh and Sanaman (2012) at the same time compared NGL with Koha and
found N G L very competitive to Koha. Ram say & Chamberlain (2012) and M uller (2011)
suggested a num ber of criteria to evaluate open source ILS. Kokorceny & Bodnarova (2010),
Lai & Prasad (2013), Yinit Kum ar (2009), and Barve (2008) evaluated open source digital
library software following a num ber o f criteria. However these studies were evaluative
studies. They either evaluated a single or m ultiple software. None o f the studies could suggest
a single software that can be used in any type o f library.

The present study is towards filling the gap of these studies. It aims to analyze the open
source m ovement from a librarian’s point o f view and wish to suggest an optimum model
after studying the available open source software for libraries. However, a review o f all these
studies helped the researcher in his research. Some very important studies on open source are
presented below.

DiBona, Ockman, & Stone (Eds). (1999). Open sources: voices fro m the open source
revolution. Sebastopol: O ’Reilly M edia Inc.

This book contains a num ber o f essays from the pioneer o f open source movement. Some
essays o f this book are historical and some are conceptual. The editors o f this book in the
prologue discuss the free software and try to relate it with open source. Eric Raym ond in
his two essays discusses about the people engaged in the software development. Some
essays discuss the concept o f open source software licenses. Richard Stallman in his
essays narrates his days when he started free software development and reasons behind
his bias toward free software. The essays present in this book make it easy to understand

23

the philosophy o f most prominent open source pioneers and the initial open source
movement.

ii.

Raymond Eric S. (2001). The cathedral and the bazaar: musing on Linux and open
source by an accidental revolutionary, (revised ed.). Sebastopol: O ’Reilly M edia Inc.

It is yet another work that m ust be referred by anyone who is interested about open source. In
this book Raymond explains whole open source ideology. He emphasize that open source can
produce more competent and economical products than proprietary software. He categorizes
closed source software as cathedral where final product is reviewed by a team o f small
num ber of members, while bazaar as an open source product which is open socially and can
be reviewed by everyone. He briefly points out his views towards Richard Stallman and his
Free Software Foundation.

W illiams, Sam (2010). Free as in freedom 2.0: Richard Stallman and the fre e
software revolution, 2nd ed. Revised by Richard Stallman. Boston: Free Software
Foundation.

This is another good book based on Richard Stallm an’s struggle for free software. It looks
like a biographical work on Richard Stallman, however, it includes his philosophy on
software. This book is about the youth o f Richard Stallman in 1960s and 1070s and his work
for m aking software free. It also keeps the debate on ‘free software’ and ‘open source’ alive
throughout the book. The revision o f the book is done by Richard Stallman him self that
makes the book more authentic. The earlier version o f the book was carrying the interviews
o f Richard Stallman, however, this edition also carries his explanation of some interview
questions answered by him.

It is a pioneering write-up that introduced open source software to the w orld o f library
professionals. Chudnov, in this article gave all the reasons to adopt an open source software
and he also criticized proprietary open source software as they did not prove themselves
perfect and up to the mark. He justified that the libraries are not for profit organizations and
open source are the best option for them. He also requested the library w orld to get involved
in open source production. This write up by Chudnov helped in raising open source voice
among library professionals.

v.

Engard, Nicole C. (2010). Practical open source software fo r libraries. Oxford:
Chandos Publishing.

Engard listed a num ber of open source software useful for libraries w ith the practical
experience from the organizations which are already using it. She tried to put arguments
against those who say that open source is not good or economical for libraries. It includes
case studies o f open source software of almost all categories o f libraries.

Related literature: Open Access

Open access is an area which is concerned with libraries, scientific publications, and each one
who is involved in the process o f publication and distribution, i.e., the author, the publisher,
the library, and the ultimate user. Open access again is a very new concept bom in the final
years o f the 20th century and initial years o f the 21st century. However as a philosophy, open
access could have been observed since ancient times. Open access, being a new phenomenon
o f scientific publication, attracts very few studies on it. Some of those are from the pioneers
o f open access movement.

25

M aximum literature in the initial phase of open access m ovem ent is found prim arily on the
rising cost of serials and ways to solve this problem. The contemporary situation is described
by Johnson (1990) as “The consequences of the serials crisis are significant. The proportion
o f library budgets devoted to serials expenditures is increasing at a rate that threatens to
consume the entire acquisitions budget”. A num ber o f scholars during this time raised their
concern towards ‘serial crisis’ and requirem ent o f a possible solution o f it. The subversive
proposal by Steven H am ad (1994) is an important writing towards m aking people aware
about open access. W ritings from m any other advocates of open access not only helped in the
growth o f the open access m ovem ent but also they share large portion o f literature written on
open access movement. Peter Suber (2012) is one o f the advocates who is tracking open
access m ovement from the beginning. He has worked on every aspect o f open access such as
copyright, pricing, economy, etc. Some important writing on open access are presented
below.

This work is based on a listserv discussion started by Steven H am ad in 1994 provoking
scientists towards publishing their papers online for m aking it available to other researchers
at very low cost. It covers the whole discussion and its critical analysis. In addition it includes
some essays on the subject. This book is useful to understand initial views o f the researchers
on serial publications and their pricing and their concern over constant rise is serial price.

Suber, Peter (2012). Open access. Washington: MIT Press

By m aking this book open access Peter Suber proved that he is a tm e supporter o f open
access. This book however is a collection o f his num erous articles available freely on the

26

Web. However, this book presents those writings in a very well m anaged form that m akes the
things easy to understand. Through this book he provides clear and concise explanations of
various aspects o f open access publishing.

Scholarship. Cambridge: The M IT Press.

This was the first collective work on open access and scholarly publishing. W illinsky
interprets the rational o f open access publishing in this book. This book however differs to
that of Peter Suber’s who discusses the m echanism o f open access.

iv.

Jacobs, N. (Ed.). (2006). Open access: key strategic technical and economic aspects.
Oxford: Chandos Publishing.

It is a collaborative work of all open access advocates. This book includes open access and
related concepts. Apart from the basic foundation o f open access, it includes relation o f open
access with researchers, publishers, institutions and the contemporary position o f open access
literature around the world. This book is a good read to understand the development o f open
access since its birth to 2005.

No other m ajor work on open access is available. However the writings on open access is
available in scattered form from small articles from the pioneers o f the open access. None o f
them carries high importance individually. The m ajority o f works discuss about the various
ways o f open access publishing propounded by Peter Suber (2008) and Steven Hamad. These
two and other advocates led to the open access movem ent through Budapest Open Access
Initiative (2002), Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing (Suber, Bethesda Statement
on Open Access Publishing, 2003), and Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in
the Sciences and Humanities (Berlin 9, 2007).

27

These studies discuss either the philosophy o f open access or the framework o f open access
publishing. These studies do not cover the open access as a movement. The present study is
an attempt to fill this research gap.

Though these are not the complete sources o f information for this research work, however,
these studies played an important role in formulating the concept, understanding and
appreciation o f open access literature and open source software. This literature was helpful in
confirming the facts and clarifying the concepts during the initial stages o f the present
research work.

CHAPTER III

RESAERCH DESIGN AND METHODS USED
IN THE STUDY

As m entioned in the preceding chapters, ICT plays a m ajor role in the development of
libraries today. M odem libraries are able to provide improved information services due to the
growing Internet, e-resources and computer software. Although the num ber o f automated
libraries is growing every day, yet there are num erous libraries in a developing country such
as India which are still traditional. The gap between the traditional libraries and m odem ICT
based libraries is widening. The preceding chapters have pointed out that the open source
software and open access research is o f high importance for the library communities. Thus,
the present study attempts to address this digital divide by Open Source Software and Open
Access resources available on the Web. The libraries with no or minimal financial resources
can provide better services to their users through Open Source Software and Open Access
resources.

This chapter deals with the design o f the research and m ethodology used in the study. The
universe of the study, the operational definitions, the techniques used for data collection, the
period covered under the study and steps towards data analysis are also discussed in this
chapter.

3.1.

The universe of this study

The universe for the present study is open source software and open access literature. The
open source software which could be beneficial for a library is covered under this study. The
whole sphere of open source m ovement is also the subject o f this study. In addition to open

33

source software, open access movem ent is also under the universe o f this study. However,
free but commercial software and W eb 2.0 tools do not come under the purview o f this study.

3.2.

The Methodology used in the study

This study is an exploratory and descriptive research on open source software and open
access resources that are useful to modernize a library and thus also analyses the open source
m ovement and open access movement. To conduct this study, the researcher did a
comprehensive literature review o f the previous studies in these areas. The present research
design builds on research done on open source software and open access literature from the
purview o f libraries using a descriptive research method.

For this research study a qualitative research design was formed to enrich the understanding
of the open source software m ovement and open access m ovem ent in addition to useful
software available for a library.

3.3.

Sources of Information

Books have been considered great source o f information for any study since a long time and
it is also not an exemption for this study. A num ber o f books written on open access and open
source software were referred by the researcher to get in touch with the subject. However,
with the inception o f information technology, Internet, and W orld W ide Web, we get another
form o f information, i.e., digital or electronic form. This form o f information is not only easy
to disseminate but also to share in real time. Now an author is not required to collect vast
amount of information to publish it. S/he can instantly publish any small piece o f information
through his or her blog/website. This instant publishing has increased the speed o f research

34

by sharing latest research results. Hence the researcher has also used various resources from
the W eb to collect information required by him.

Google Scholar: Google Scholar is a free search engine that indexes full text o f scholarly
literature published by various publishers in different disciplines. It was started in 2004.
Google Scholar indexes peer reviewed and scholarly online literature published through
online journals both open access and commercial, online books and online repositories of
institutions throughout the world. This search engine proved very important due to its nature
o f open access to search the related literature for this study. A gist o f the various online
sources used for this study is as following.

Science Direct: Science Direct is a database o f full text scholarly journals from several fields
including library and information science. This database was useful to understand current
trends in open access and open source software.

IEEEXplore: IEEEXplore is a database o f scholarly journals from the field o f technology and
engineering. It covers several journals dealing with library automation and open source
software. This database was useful to touch the various aspects o f open source software
m ovement and library automation.

Em erald database: Em erald database is a very prominent database o f scholarly journals
especially from the field o f library and information science. The researcher accessed wide
num ber o f articles talking about open source software, open access, library automation, etc.
from various journals covered under this database. Some prominent journals o f this database
are Journal o f Documentation, Library Hi Tech, Library M anagement, Library Review, The

35

Electronic Library, Online Information Review, Program: electronic library and information
systems etc.

Springer Link: Springer link is also a database o f scholarly journals and books. It offers
access to some but important journals in library and information science. The journals proved
important for the purpose o f this study was International Journal on Digital Libraries.

Other Sources: Literature not covered under the above databases was browsed using various
search engines such as Google, Bing, M amma, Yahoo, etc. These search engines helped the
researcher to find information from newspapers and articles and reports not indexed in any of
the above database.

Operational definitions

The term ‘open source software’ in this study refers to the software which are available free
o f cost, available with source code and do not have any license restriction with respect to
their use, m odification and redistribution. The user of open source software can exercise all
rights o f the owner o f the software and actually there is no owner o f the software but the
software is developed by a community o f software experts.

This study has also used the term ‘free software’. In this case free does not m ean free from
price but it is freedom to use, study, and distribute the software. It is freedom to help the
others. Both ‘open source software’ and ‘free softw are’ are not any different in their
principles but they are different ethically.

Similarly the term ‘open access’ in this study refers to the authentic scholarly writings which
are available through Internet to the users without paying any subscription fees and without

36

any copyright restriction with respect to their use, reproduction, and redistribution. However,
the authors o f open access scholarly writings have the right to be cited by the researchers who
use these writings in carrying out their research.

3.5.

Data collection: methods and techniques used

Being a descriptive research, the data for this study w as collected from scholarly literature on
open access and open source software. To proceed with the research, researcher studied the
vast literature related to the subject. Researcher collected data prim arily from books, articles,
etc. written since the inception o f the concepts till present. To collect the data, researcher has
used various sources such as books and journals available in the libraries. Open access
literature available through Internet and various proprietary databases were also extensively
used.

To retrieve the literature available on Internet in the public domain, researcher used various
search engines such as Google Scholar, Google, Bing, M amma, Yahoo, Search.com,
Ask.com, dogpile, etc. In addition to the general Search Engines, the researchers had also
used the specific databases that are known to have scholarly writings on the related field.
Such databases include Science Direct, Springer Link Service, Em erald database, ieeexplorer,
etc. These databases cover m ajor proprietary scholarly journals of library and information
science.

All these resources helped the researcher to access comprehensive literature on the subject
and on the basis o f this literature, the researcher could trace the open source software and
open access movement.

37

3.6.

Period of data collection

The duration of data collection was 3 years, i.e., 2010 to 2013.During this period literature
from related subject was gathered from every source discussed above. No literature after m id
2013 was retrieved. This point is being stressed here as the w orld o f open source software as
well as open access resources keeps growing continuously.

3.7.

The steps towards Data analysis

The first step towards data analysis was to unravel the open source software movem ent and
its penetration into the field o f library and information science in late 1990s. This is achieved
through analysing the previous studies in this area. Chapter IV analyses this story that
revolutionised the information services in libraries.

The next step was to analyse the technical features o f the prominent open source software for
libraries. Researcher has selected software from various categories such as library
management software, digital library software, etc. which are used in high percentage among
automated libraries. Chapter Y reports this analysis and also presents an analysis o f the m ain
features o f software based on the existing studies.

Further, the attempt was to identify and explain an optimum open source software m odel for
a library. This m odel is suggested keeping in m ind the libraries o f India that are having
inadequate finances and technical expertise. The researcher has also given the reasons and
justifications for suggesting this particular model. This fulfils the third objective o f this study.

To fulfil the fourth objective o f the study, Chapter VII deals w ith the concept o f open access
in detail from a librarian’s point of view. It enunciates the analytical chronology o f the open
access m ovem ent under various headings. This is achieved through analysing the previous

38

studies in this area. As open access is very helpful to the libraries to provide excellent
information services to the users the researcher has consulted various open access journals
directories such as DOAJ, and other sources where open access journals are listed and
compiled a list o f more than 5000 open access journals from various fields in English
language. This exploration fulfilled the fifth objective of this study. A list of titles o f these
journals is presented at appendix A.

During the accumulation o f the links o f open access journal researcher found that an open
access journal is available almost for every subject. However, broadly these journals could be
categorised under following subjects:

M edical Science: M edical science is dominating open access w orld by having almost 18%
open access journals in the subject. M edical science is a subject which is directly related to
every single hum an being on the earth. Having m aximum open access journals in medical
science eased the research in medical and health sciences.

Education: Open access journals are also flooded in education. After m edical science,
education has the large num ber o f open access journals published in several languages.

Life Science: life science is another area where a num ber o f open access journals are
available. In life science, user m ay find journals dealing with biology, zoology, biochemistry,
and biotechnology etc.

Chemistry: Chem istry also established as an attractive subject among open access
publishers. More than 100 English language open access journals are available in various
aspect o f chemistry.

39

Literature and Linguistics: One m ay find a wide range o f open access journals in literature
and linguistics. Researchers working in this area m ay not get affected due to unavailability o f
subscription based scholarly journals in their libraries as this area is covered hugely by open
access publishers.

Others: As discussed earlier, open access journals are available on almost every subject.
Subjects not discussed above also have good num ber of open access journals available online.
Computer science, Engineering, Philosophy, History, Economics, M anagement, Generalia,
Agriculture, Library and Information Science are the subjects that have more than 100 open
access journals each in English language. Other subjects o f social sciences, humanities,
science, technology, arts, etc. have 10 to 100 open access journals in English language.
However there is a need o f open access journals in areas o f naval science, nuclear physics,
acoustics, environmental engineering, and hydraulic engineering.

Thus, the above research design and m ethodology helped the researcher to achieve all the
objectives of the present study in an efficient way.

CHAPTER IV
OPEN SOURCE SOFTW ARE M OVEM ENT: AN
ANALYSIS

4.1.

Introduction

T he term ‘so ftw are’ w as coined by Jo h n W . T ukey and h e u sed it for the first tim e in 1958 in his
article published in The A m erica n M a th em a tica l M o n th ly (1958). H ow ever, the idea o f softw are
w as devised b y A la n T uring (1936) during his p resentation on T uring M achine. E arlier, term s
like ‘com puter p ro g ra m ’ and ‘c o d e ’ w ere in use. C erazzi (2003, p. 80)defm es softw are as “a
single entity, separate from the co m p u ter’s hardw are, that w orks w ith the hardw are to solve a
p ro b lem .” T he early softw are, the so called ‘com puter p ro g ra m ’ and ‘c o d e ’, w ere installed or
program m ed in the com puter during th eir configuration and it w as a hercu lean task to change,
delete, uninstall, and reinstall softw are on com puter. In fact, initially softw are w ere p art o f
com puters and w ere not available separately. C om puter m anufacturers used to sell com puter and
softw are as a single entity. B ut in 1968, w ith the intervention o f the U S governm ent, com puter
m anufacturing com panies w ere forced to sell softw are as a separate u n it (C eruzzi, 2003, p. 106;
K elty, 2008, p. 119)and thus, em erged the com puter softw are industry. H ow ever, the real grow th
o f softw are industry w as observed only after the invention o f m icrocom puters in m id 1970s,
w h ich brought the com puter on the desk o f the people. 1990s observed developm ent o f W eb and
W indow s system softw are that trem en d o u sly increased the u se o f application softw are w ith
W indow s. H ow ever, the h isto ry o f softw are is v e ry extensive and com plex, this chapter w ould
concentrate on the developm ent o f open source m ovem ent w ith special reference to the softw are
in use for library and inform ation m anagem ent.

41

4.2.

Genesis of Open Source Movement

In the beginning, there w as no existence o f pro p rietary softw are or sharew are/free softw are.
Softw are w ere n o thing but codes to p erfo rm a particu lar task on the com puter and w ere available
w ith com puters in source code (D affara & G onzalez-B arahona, 2004; C hudnov, 2007). These
codes w ere frequently u sed b y educational institutions to study them . C ustom ers w ere also able
to m odify th em as p er th eir needs as in th e case o f open source softw are, hence, there w as no
difference b etw een the u se r and the program m er. A t the launch o f the 701, the first com m ercial
com puter b y IB M in 1952, there w as no difference b etw een hardw are and softw are, all
com puters had been sold w ith softw are o f one kind or the other. T hese softw are w ere free
softw are w ith the code. R ichard Stallm an (2002)also discussed about a softw are sharing
com m unity w h ich w as in existence in 1970s to share and help the users w ho w ere facing
problem s or bugs in using operating system ITS (Incom patible T im esharing System ) developed
b y M IT.

T he histo ry o f free and open source softw are is tw ofold. O ne is related to the developm ent o f
U N IX operating system and the other related w ith R ichard S tallm an ’s G N U project.

4.2.1.

D evelop m en t o f U N IX

T he idea o f U N IX w as industrialized in 1965 w h en M assachusetts In stitution o f T echnology
(M IT ), G eneral E lectric C om pany (G E), and B ell T elephone Lab (B TL) cam e up w ith a project
M U L T IC S (M ultiplexed Inform ation and C om puting Service) w ith the objective to develop a
m ulti u se r operating system (E vers, 2000, p. 1 l).B u t it did not produce any positive result and in

42

1969, B T L declared to w ithdraw its resources and m anpow er involved in the p roject as the
project w as m oving tow ards failure.

H ow ever, tw o B T L researchers D ennis R itchie and K en T hom pson did n ot lose th eir enthusiasm
and developed som e p rogram and gam es w h ich th ey tried on G E645 and P D P -7 com puters by
altering the codes. T hough such a softw are did not w o rk but th ey got huge experience from this.
T hom pson had already developed a fde system for an operating system .

In 1969 K en T hom pson spent few w eeks on w riting K ern el (core o f any operating system ), sh a ll
(program to read com m ands) and an a ssem bler (to convert codes into softw are). To w o rk on
these, he used D E C ’s P D P -7 com puter and the results w ere great for him . H e n am ed it U N IC S
(U niplexed Inform ation and C om puter Service), later renam ed as U N IX . Initially, he kept this
p rogram v ery sm all due to less capacity o f P D P -7 com puter. It w as a tim e w h en P D P -10 w as in
m arket and T hom pson and R itchie m ade several attem pts to convince B T L to acquire it but th ey
did not succeed.

In 1970s K en developed a program m ing language k n o w n as B w h ich w as later im proved and
com pleted b y D ennis R itchie and nam ed C in 1972. C has proved its e lf v e ry pow erful and in
com m on use, even after four decades o f its developm ent, because o f its portable program m ing
language and flexibility to m ove p rogram from one kind o f com puters to another. In the sam e
y ear B T L acquired the latest P D P -1 1 com puter seeing the success o f T hom pson and R itchie on
U N IX . “W ith several B T L sta ff m em bers from outside the research group using the typesetting
facilities o f th e P D P -1 1, th e need to docum ent the operating system grew . T he result w as th e first
U nix P ro g ram m er’s M anual b y T hom pson and R itchie, w h ich w as dated N o v em b er 3, 1971”
(Salus, 1994).N ow B T L w as using U N IX for th eir com puters instead o f having the operating

43

system com bined w ith the P D P -1 1 (W eber, 2004, p. 26). T he v e ry next year th ey rew rote U N IX
to add m ore functionality and released th e 2nd versio n o f U N IX . W ith this release, n u m b er o f
installations in B T L reached to ten (Salus, 1994). R itchie and T hom son had rew ritten the kernel
o f U N IX in C language instead o f an assem bly language that m ade it hardw are independent. This
th ird edition or versio n o f U N IX w as installed in sixteen sites, in 1973, all w ith in A T & T (Evers,
2000). It w as the fourth year o f developm ent o f U N IX but it w as not m u ch k n o w n elsew here
except A T & T .

A m ajo r landm ark cam e in the developm ent o f U N IX w h en R itchie and T hom pson presented a
pap er on U N IX at the A C M Sym posium on operating system s in O ctober 1973. T his sym posium
proved a big advertisem ent o f U N IX to related audience. A fter that B T L had a n u m b er o f
requests for copies o f U N IX . T he pub licatio n o f th eir p a p e r on U N IX in conference proceeding
in Ju ly 1974 caused an explosion in dem and o f U N IX unanim ously.

A T & T w as able to sell this product at m inim al cost in ‘as it is ’ form w ithout any royalties to
A T & T and w ithout any support and bug fixes (W eber, 2004, p. 28; Salus, 1994). A t this tim e it
w as open in source form and its source code w as being studied in the universities.

W h en there is no system to help one out th en peo p le w ith sim ilar pro b lem get assem bled to help
each other and th e sam e w as in case o f U N IX . U sers o f U N IX cam e to g eth er to share thoughts,
inform ation, codes, bug fixes etc. T he group gained po p u larity b y th eir n am e U senix
A ssociation. U sers around the w orld w ere w orking on U N IX like any true open source softw are
w here program m ers o f various universities and organizations w ere developing U N IX and new
developm ents and im provem ents w ere m erged w ith the n ew release b y A T & T .

44

T he developers o f U N IX w ere n ot able to help or support users due to legal binding but the u ser
groups w ere w orking constantly to solve the U N IX error faced b y the users all around the w orld.

A big change cam e into w orking o f U N IX in its 7th versio n w h ich w as released in 1979. The
m ost influential feature o f this versio n w as its portability. This versio n w as successfully run over
com puters m anufactured by D E C , IB M and Interdata (Evers, 2000, p. 13). The earlier v ersio n o f
U N IX w as able to ru n on different com puters m anufactured b y D E C only. T he continuous
developm ent and po p u larity o f U N IX m ade its m anufacturers serious tow ards U N IX as a
com m ercial p roduct and th ey constrained the distribution o f source code in n ew licence. T he new
licence term s m ad e m an y universities to drop U N IX from th eir course o f study. B ut, u ntil 1982,
A T & T could not com m ercialize U N IX in its full capacity due to the consent decree w hich
restricted A T & T to enter into softw are business. A court decree in 1982 rem oved the restriction
form A T & T to com e into softw are industry. A fter this, the developm ent o f U N IX becam e m ore
aberrant. A n u m b er o f derivatives w ere observed in the m arket w h ich confused the users. The
m ost p rom inent o f those is B SD . O ther derivatives w ere either based on A T & T ’s U N IX or B SD .
H ow ever derivatives from A T & T required licence from A T & T w hereas this w as not the
situation in case o f B SD . T here w ere som e suits fded on B SD too for breaching the licence
restriction o f U N IX but could not succeed as the earlier versions o f U N IX w ere released w ith
free source code.

4.2.2.

B SD (B erk eley S oftw are D istribution ): F irst O pen Source L icense

U N IX cam e into the U n iversity o f C alifornia, B erkeley in 1974 after T h o m p so n ’s and R itch ie ’s
p resentation on the O perating System . A t the sam e tim e, U N IX w as included into the courses o f
study. C om puter researchers, studying and w orking in B erkeley, started to w o rk on the

45

im provem ents o f U N IX b y adding n ew features and kernels to the existing U N IX . W ith this they
had a full derivative o f U N IX w h ich th ey could distribute to the users. In 1977, a softw are
distribution licence w as developed at the U n iv ersity o f C alifornia k n o w n as B erkeley Softw are
D istribution (B SD ). This softw are distribution licence contained alm ost all the features that an
open source licence should have. B SD allow ed the users to use, edit the source or its binary
codes, and redistribution o f the softw are w ith or w ithout perm ission. H ow ever, there w ere som e
restrictions on it. The licence reads that “ [all] advertising m aterials m entioning features or use o f
this softw are m ust display the follow ing acknow ledgem ent: T his p roduct includes softw are
developed b y the <organisation>” (U niversity o f C alifornia, 1999).

T he developm ent o f U N IX and B SD licence w as indicating the future rev o lu tio n tow ards the free
and open source softw are although the term O pen Source w as not in existence at that p oint o f
tim e. B ut people h ad begun to support the concept o f free softw are. A t the sam e tim e, w hen
U N IX and B S D w ere getting m om entum , R ichard Stallm an had started his crusade for free
softw are b y establishm ent o f Free Softw are Foundation.

4.2.3.

G N U and F R E E SO F T W A R E F O U N D A T IO N

R ichard Stallm an, w ho had started w orking w ith M IT A I Lab (M assachusetts Institute o f
T echnology A rtificial Intelligence Lab) in 1971, w as the central character o f G N U (G N U N ot
U nix) and F SF (Free S oftw are Foundation). H is duty w as to im prove and enhance the quality o f
ITS (the Incom patible T im esharing System ), an operating system designed and used b y M IT A I
Lab for its P D P - 10 com puters.

In the initial phase, the softw are w as free and M IT A I Lab used to share it w ith others on
dem and. Stallm an w rites:

46

“W e did not call our softw are "free softw are," because that term did not yet exist, but that
is w hat it w as. W henever people from another u n iv ersity or a com pany w anted to port
and use a program , w e gladly let them . I f you saw som eone u sin g an u n fam iliar and
interesting program , you could alw ays ask to see the source code, so that you could read
it, change it, or cannibalise parts o f it to m ake a n ew p ro g ram ” .(Stallm an, 1999, p. 31)
H ow ever, the situation rad ically changed in 1980s w ith unfortunate discontinuation o f D igital
PD P -10 series com puters. A s the ITS w as created and designed u sin g m achine depended
assem bler language, it resulted in obsolescence o f all p rogram related to ITS.

T he n ew m o d e m com puters o f 1980s had th eir ow n p ro p rietary softw are w here the purchaser o f
the com puters had to sign a non-disclosure agreem ent. W hen M IT A I lab purchased n ew m o d em
com puters, all its scientists required to sign a non-disclosure agreem ent even for getting an
executable copy o f the operating system . B ut R ichard Stallm an w as o f a different ph ilo so p h y and
supporter o f free softw are. In w ords o f R ichard Stallm an (1999)“ [signing this agreem ent m eant
that] i f you share w ith y o u r n eighbour you are a pirate. I f you w ant any changes, beg u s” .
Stallm an w as not rea d y to give up his freedom to help others. A t this stage, he w as left w ith three
options; first, jo in the pro p rietary softw are w orld by signing non-disclosure agreem ent and
p rom ising not to help others. In w ords o f Stallm an (1999)“I could h av e m ade m o n ey this w ay,
and perhaps am used m y se lf w riting code. B ut I k n ew that at the end o f m y career, I w ould look
back on years o f building w alls to divide people, and feel I had spent m y life m aking the w orld a
w orse p lac e .”

T he second option he h ad w as to leave the com puter softw are industries and tu rn his w a y to
som e other business w h ere his softw are developing skills w ould not be m isused. B ut this could
not have been h elpful for the others and w ould have w asted his p rogram m ing skills. T he third
option w h ich Stallm an opted w as to develop softw are that w ould be free for users n ot only to use

47

but also to m o d ify o r redistribute. H is choice w as to develop an operating system as it is v ery
crucial com ponent o f the com puter and w orks like a soul o f it. I f there is an operating system
installed in a com puter, one can do m an y things w ith it. B ut i f there is no operating system , the
com puter w ould be dead.

H e chose to develop an operating system that is com patible w ith U N IX . H ence, he started a
project for the sam e and nam ed it ‘G N U ’ w h ich stands for ‘G N U is N o t U N IX ’. H e tag g ed this
future operating system w ith his pioneering term ‘free so ftw a re ’

H e gave up his engagem ents w ith M IT in 1984 to focus entirely on G N U . T he p rim ary m otto
behind leaving his jo b w as to m ake sure that in future M IT m ay n ot claim G N U as its ow n
p roduct as S tallm an w as its em ployee. In v e ry short tim e he got a p roduct called G N U Em acs.
H e distributed the p ro g ram tape at a cost o f $150 w h ich w as cost o f m ailing and o f the tape. The
softw are w as free. D uring this process Stallm an also felt a need o f copyright licence to m ake
sure that all derivatives o f the softw are also rem ain free and in public dom ain. S tallm an
(1999)cites an exam ple o f the X W indow S ystem w h ich w as developed at M IT , and released as
free softw are w ith a p erm issive license, and w as soon adopted b y a n u m b er o f com puter
com panies. These com panies added X to th eir pro p rietary U N IX system s, and covered th em by
the sam e nondisclosure agreem ent. To avoid this p o ssib le future o f softw are, Stallm an decided to
w rite a softw are distribution licence k n o w n as G PL (G eneral P ublic L icense). This licence
introduced the concept o f ‘c o p y left’. This license is w id ely used, even today, b y open source
softw are to give freedom to users to use, distribute and m o d ify the licence.

T he next step o f R ichard S tallm an ’s m ovem ent w as to bring G N U project u n d er an organisation.
In

1985, he established a tax free charity organisation u n d er th e n am e T r e e Softw are

48

F o u n d a tio n ’ (FSF). W ith this organisation he could handle several activities like accepting
donation, selling copies o f free softw are or p roviding other services. S tallm an has attem pted to
form ally define the term ‘Free S o ftw are’. T his term refers to the follow ing freedom s w h ich are
granted to the u se r o f the softw are (Free S oftw are F oundation, 1985):

>

F reedom to ru n the p rogram in any place, for any p urpose and forever.

>

F reedom to study h o w it w orks and to m odify it as and w h en required. This guarantees
supply o f the Source C ode o f the softw are.

>

F reedom to redistribute copies o f the softw are as it is or in m odified form so w e can help
our friend and neighbour.

>

F reedom to im prove the p rogram and release the im provem ents to the public. This also
requires the source code.

Stallm an m ade use o f the G P L softw are distribution licence for any softw are released b y F SF to
guarantee these freedom s.

T hrough this licence, the author allow s the u se r o f the p ro g ram to

exercise these freedom s. In addition to this, FSF also bestow ed a freedom to the author to apply
any restriction s/he w ishes, i.e., to credit the original author even in its redistrib u tio n in m odified
form . H ow ever, such restrictions m u st not offset w ith the above freedom s.

R ichard S tallm an ’s FSF w as earning p o p u larity v e ry quickly. S tallm an ’s planning w as to w rite a
com plete full operating system but even before th at the com ponents o f the OS w as dem anded by
the com puter users. G N U E m acs w as u sed b y a n u m b er o f com puter u sers w ith U N IX or other
system softw are. It w as supporting S tallm an to im prove G U N E m acs, but on the other hand it

49

w as delaying his w o rk o f w riting the full operating system . F SF w as also getting donation in the
form o f m oney, labour and com puters to support the noble cause o f R ichard Stallm an.

B y 1990’s S tallm an successfully com pleted all com ponents o f G N U except its K ernel. W ithout a
K ernel, w h ich is h eart o f any operating system , it w as difficult to bring out a com plete operating
system . S tallm an w ished to develop its kernel based on M ach. M ach w as an operating system
m icrokernel developed at U niv ersity o f U tah. M ach w as a com m ercial K ernel and to m ake it a
com ponent it w as required to have M ach as a free K ernel. U sing a com m ercial K ernel for free
softw are m ay affect its freedom as M ach w as bound u n d er copyright licence. Stallm an, w ith help
o f his technical supporters, could w rite a K ernel for G N U w h ich w as k n o w n as G N U H U R D .
H ow ever G N U K ernel w as full o f errors and w as incom plete and u nsuitable to be used w ith
G N U . E ven to d ay H U R D is not com pleted. B ut, it w as fortunate that there w as a m an w ho could
do this Job and it w as L inus Torvalds.

4.2.4.

L IN U X

Linus T orvalds, an am bitious but unk n o w n student o f H elsinki U niversity, started to build a
K ernel in 1991. H is aim w as to build a free U N IX kernel for Intel- based com puters. H e initiated
to build this keeping A n d rew T a n e n b au m ’s M im ix system in m ind, w h ich w as based on U N IX
system and p u blished as a book (K avanagh, 2004). It w as also used as a teaching source in
universities. H ow ever L inus w as u n h ap p y w ith this K ernel. L inus h ad created his kernel

O pen Source In itiative

A fter m erging w ith L inux, n u m b er o f supporter o f G N U increased considerably. A fter 1997, a

w ith the p assage o f tim e it cam e out as a n ew term inology, i.e., O pen Source. E ric S. R aym ond,
w rote a pap er 'C athedral and b a z a a r’ and p resented it in G N U /L inux C ongress organized by
P eter Salus, a m em b er o f FSF , u n d er the sponsorship o f FSF in 1997. The m ain concentration o f
the p ap er w as on the tw o w ays o f prod u ctio n o f free softw are. R aym ond in this p ap er supported
the open w a y o f p roducing free softw are. C athedral, in his view , w as the structure o f G N U
E m acs that has the source code w ith it but the access o f it w as restricted to an exclusive group o f
softw are developers w hile B azaar m odel o f free softw are also com prises source codes th at are
available online to every individual to edit and im prove. H e credited L inus T orvalds for this
m odel o f free softw are.

Eric S. R aym ond w as an active m em b er o f G N U E m acs in 1980s but he distanced h im s e lf from
this in 1992 after a dispute w ith R ichard S tallm an for m aking som e unauthorised changes in

51

G N U E m acs. In w ords o f R aym ond “It frustrated m e so m u ch that I decided I d id n ’t w ant to
w o rk w ith [R ichard Stallm an] anym ore” (W illiam s, 20 0 2 ).Thus he w as connected w ith the
ph ilo so p h y o f free softw are but distanced from F SF and R ichard Stallm an, how ever, he
continued to w ork on free softw are com m unity that enabled h im to get invited in G N U /F inux
C ongress and p resent his view s.

A lth o u g h m ost p o rtio n o f his pap er w as sim ilar and in practice as free softw are, but, R aym ond
p rovided a n e w business w a y th ro u g h free softw are. T his pap er left a v e ry huge influence that it
w as going to m ak e its place in history. N etscape C om m unication C orporation, a com m ercial

in a furious struggle, kn o w n as ‘brow ser w a r’1, to m ake its bro w ser dom inant brow ser on the
desktop. W ith the release o f Internet E x p lo rer 4, M icrosoft decided to give aw ay Internet
E xplorer as inbuilt softw are w ith M icrosoft W indow s operating system (W ikipedia, 20 1 1 ).This
step o f M icrosoft brought a h ig h er im pact on m arket o f N etscape, resu ltin g in a rapid loss in the
n u m b er o f users o f N etscap e N avigator. T he m arket condition m ade it easy for N etscape
C om m unication to u n derstand that it is tim e for som e h ard decision b y changing the rules, and a

N etscape decided to release the source code o f N etscap e N av ig ato r to public.

O n January 22, 1998, N etscape announced to give the source code o f N etscap e N av ig ato r free to

for helping us get to this point in the first place. Y o u r thinking and w ritings w ere fundam ental
inspirations to our d e c isio n ” (R aym ond, 2001).

Soon after this declaration, a strategy session, on 3rd F ebruary 1998 at Palo A lto, C alifornia,
U S A , w as held b y E ric R aym ond w ith T odd A nderson, C hris P eterson (Foresight Institute), John
H all and L arry A u g ustin (L inux International), Sam O ckm an ( o f the S ilicon V alley Linux U ser's
G roup). “T he strategy session grew from a realization that the attention around the N etscape
announcem ent h ad created an o p p o rtunity to educate and advocate for the superiority o f an open
developm ent p ro cess” (O pen Source Initiative, 2012). E ric R aym ond w ho w as already in conflict
w ith R ichard Stallm an w anted to pave a n ew w a y to offer the w orld free softw are w ithout any
riv alry w ith com m ercial softw are. C hris P eterson o f F oresight Institute coined and suggested a
term ‘O pen S o u rce’ for it. It is further quoted b y O pen Source Initiative (2012) on its histo ry
page:

T he conferees believed the pragm atic, business-case grounds that h ad m otivated
N etscape to release th eir code illustrated a valuable w a y to engage w ith potential
softw are users and developers, and convince th em to create and im prove source code by
participating in an engaged com m unity. The conferees also believed that it w ould be
useful to have a single label that identified this approach and distinguished it from the
philosophically- and politically-focused label "free softw are." B rainstorm ing for this new
label eventually converged on the term "open source", originally suggested by C hristine
Peterson. (O pen Source Initiative, 2012)
B eing m otivated b y this sm all conference, E ric R aym ond spread the w ord about his p h ilosophy
and tried to gather m ore supporters. H e got an approval from L inus T orvalds w ho w as convinced
b y his philosophy. In addition to that, he got support from m an y other com puter professionals
w orking for Free S oftw are F oundation. E ven R ichard Stallm an seem ed convinced b y R aym ond
initially to adopt the term ‘o pen so u rc e ’ but later on rejected it. (T iem ann, 2006; Stallm an R. ,
2012; W illiam s, 2002).

53

R aym ond and his friends w ere m aking all possible efforts to m arket the term open source and
th ey w ere getting success too. B ut, soon th ey felt that to m arket the term ‘open so u rc e ’ in a better
w ay, th ey b ad ly required a platform . H ence R aym ond decided to form ‘O pen Source In itia tiv e ’
w ith the help o f B ruce Perens, a colleague o f R ichard S tallm an and m em b er o f FSF , and T im
O ’R eilly, another supporter o f FSF. In F eb ru ary 1998, R aym ond form ally declared the launch o f
O pen Source Initiative (O SI) to regulate the term ‘open so u rc e ’ by p roviding a definition o f this
term for th e people interested to m ake th eir pro g ram open for the public. H is call to support the
term ‘open so u rc e ’ w as as follow ing;

“A fter the N etscape announcem ent broke in January I did a lot o f thinking about the next
phase — the serious p u sh to get "free softw are" accepted in the m ain stream corporate
w orld. A n d I realized w e have a serious pro b lem w ith "free softw are" itself.
Specifically, w e have a pro b lem w ith the term "free softw are", itself, not the concept. I've
becom e convinced that the term has to g o .” (R aym ond E. , 1998)
E ric R aym ond w as the first P resident o f O SI and B ruce Perens the first V ice President. O SI, w ith
its initiation, provided its definition o f O pen Source S oftw are (O SS) and criteria to decide the
open source softw are. A ccording to O SI, "O pen source prom otes softw are reliab ility and quality
b y supporting independent p eer rev iew and rapid evolution o f source code. To be certified as
open source, the licence o f a p rogram m ust guarantee the rig h t to read, redistribute, m odify, and
u se it freely" (O pen Source Initiative, 1998).

In addition to open source definition O SI also identified ten criteria to decide open source
softw are. In other w ay, these criteria are broader form o f definition o f open source.

>

F ree R ed istrib u tion : The first criteria to decide open source is free redistribution. The
licence o f softw are shall not restrict anyone from redistributing or selling the softw are as

54

a w hole or a constituent o f aggregate softw are. T he licence shall not com pel to p a y any
ro y alty or fee against the softw are, its red istrib u tio n or sale.
>

Source C ode: Source code is a prerequisite for open source. To be identified as ‘open
so u rc e ’ softw are, a p ro g ram m ust com prise its source and m u st perm it the softw are in
source code as w ell as in executable form . In case the softw are is not distributed w ith
source code the developer m ust have publicized the source code from w here it could be
dow nloaded w ith the help o f Internet, w ithout paying any fees.

>

D erived W orks: O pen source licence m ust p erm it alteration and derived w o rk form s. In
addition, the licence should also perm it the redistribution o f derived w o rk u n d er the sam e
licence o f original softw are.

>

In tegrity o f A u th o r ’s Source C ode: The licence o f open source softw are m ay lim it
source code from being distributed in m odified form if, the licence allow s th e distribution
o f ‘p atch file s’ w ith the source code for the pu rp o se o f m odifying the pro g ram at build
tim e. H ow ever, the licence m ust allow distribution o f softw are built from m odified
source code.

>

N o discrim in ation against person or group: The open source softw are licence m u st not
discrim inate against any p erso n or a group o f persons.

>

N o discrim in ation again st field o f endeavour: N o group should be restricted by licence
to m ake use o f softw are for any specific field o f endeavour. A nyone from any field m ust
be free to use the softw are as p er his/h er requirem ent.

>

D istrib u tion o f licence: T he licence o f the softw are m u st apply to all o f th em to w hom
licence is redistributed w ithout adding any additional licence.

55

>

L icence m ust not be specific to a product: T he softw are licence should not depend or
be restrictive to a specific softw are distribution.

>

T he licen ce m ust not restrict other softw are: T he licence m ust not restrict the softw are
distributed u n d e r other v a rie ty o f licence. F o r exam ple, it should not insist that the other
softw are u sed w ith this softw are should be an open source softw are.

T he licen ce sh ou ld be tech n ology neutral: O pen source softw are licence should not be
restricted to th e use o f a p articular tec h n o lo g y or u ser interface.
(O pen Source Initiative, 1998)

Since this declaration o f O SI, the open source m ovem ent boom ed up and w as heard everyw here.
H ow ever, the internal conflict betw een tw o groups, i.e., Free Softw are F o undation led by
R ichard S tallm an and O SI led by Eric R aym ond, on th eir philosophies continue and is still in
existence2.

Open Source Movement and Libraries
4.3.1.

C om p u ter app lication in lib raries

T he developm ent o f com puter application in libraries has b een experienced since late 1950s and
early 1960s to autom ate adm inistrative, u ser and technical service functions. H ow ever the idea o f
an integrated library system w as generated long back by V en n ever B ush (1945) in his pap er ‘A s

57

y o u m ay th in k ’, w h ich later realized in the form o f C O M IT , a p rogram m ing language to retrieve
a particu lar string o f inform ation, b y Dr. V icto r Y n g v e and others at M IT Lab in 1957 (Y ngve,
1958). A n o th er p resentation b y H erley E. T illitt (1970), entitled “A n experim ent in inform ation
searching w ith the 701 calculator” at an IB M conference at E ndicott, N e w Y ork in 1954, also
evidenced the existence o f inform ation retrieval program . T illitt, a w orking p rofessional at U S
N av al O rdnance T est S tation (N O T S), applied library com puterization that m otivated the w orld
to use com puterization in libraries. A n u m b er o f sim ilar sm aller projects o f com puterisation w ere
running, to give the account o f all o f th em here is v e ry difficult, albeit th e introductory chapter
provides a gist o f historical developm ent in library com puterisation. H ow ever, it is n ot difficult
to understand that lib rary professionals w ere v e ry m u ch aw are and interested in com puterisation
o f library functions since the v ery beginning.

1960s w itnessed the developm ent o f M A R C (M achine R eadable C atalogue) after the several
efforts o f L ibrary o f C ongress. M A R C is still v ery p rom inent cataloguing standard w orldw ide.
A fter these initial successes a w ide n u m b er o f efforts to o k place to create various applications to
autom ate library w ork such as inform ation retrieval, circulation, indexing etc. H ow ever these
developm ents and innovation w ere taking place at institutional levels only. W ell-funded
institutions o f A m erican, A u strian and E uropean continents w ere increasingly getting involved in
autom ation technologies. L ibrary o f C ongress, M IT , O C L C , U n iv ersity o f C alifornia and other
w ere leading organizations in such program m ing inventions. O ne th ing m u st be noted h ere that
all the com puter program m es developed during 1950s, 1960s w ere batch processing, th ey w ere
not as sim ple as to d a y ’s integrated system s and librarians and com puter program m ers o f those
days had to w o rk v e ry h ard to m anage those com puter program s.

58

Increasing interest o f librarians in com puterisation paved the w a y to establishm ent o f several
com panies especially dealing w ith library com puterisation, to nam e a few , G eac, SIR SI, D ata
R esearch A ssociates (D R A ), C A R S, E x- L ibris, PA L S, G aylord, and Innovative Interface, Inc.
L ibraries used to enter into a long tim e contract after buying a library system from these
com panies as sw itching the ven d o r w as like starting from the beginning. The costing o f the
com puter p rogram and th eir m anagem ent w as v ery expensive and out o f reach o f libraries and
institutions w ith scant finance. D evelopm ent o f com puter program s to autom ate the library
functioning, on the one side, eased the w ork o f libraries, but at the sam e tim e a n u m b er o f
libraries o f developing and u n d er developed countries w ere lacking these program s as it w as
unaffordable for th em to acquire costly com puters and library autom ation program s.

W ith the p assage o f tim e, acquisition o f com puters becam e affordable and also indispensable for
any type o f organization or institute and so also for a library. H ow ever, hav in g com puter
applications or library autom ation softw are and m anaging th em w ere still unaffordable. In initial
phase com puter program s for library functions w ere not available as free product; libraries
interested in com puterization needed to h ire the program m ers or enter into an agreem ent w ith
library com puterisation ven d o r to design a p rogram as p er the need o f a library w h ich w as still
v e ry costly.

4.3.2

B egin n in g o f O pen Source lib rary system s

T here w ere som e free tools in existence for libraries. M ost o f th em w ere developed b y O C LC

U N E S C O in 1985 and distributed to libraries w orldw ide for free th ro u g h th eir w ebsite.

T he free softw are m o vem ent or open source m ovem ent w as already in the lim e light in 1980s
nonetheless, libraries w ere still aw ay from the concept o f free softw are. D uring this decade
U N IX w as already installed on com puters w hile L inux w as about to be bom . D uring late 1980s
concept o f free softw are w as taking m o m en tu m and com m ercial vendors w ere looking tow ards
free softw are as an opportunity to accom plish th eir com m ercial goals. T his resulted into
establishm ent o f C ygnus Solutions4, the w o rld ’s first open source softw are com pany b y M ichael
T iem ann w ith the help o f D avid H enkel-W allace and Jo h n G ilm ore. T iem ann found business
opportunities in open source as he states:

“O pen Source w ould u n ify the efforts o f program m ers around the w orld, and com panies
that p rovided com m ercial services (custom izations, enhancem ents, bug fixes, support)
based on that softw are could capitalize on the econom ies o f scale and broad appeal o f this
n ew kind o f softw are.” (T iem ann, 1999)

B y late 1980s and early 1990s the w hole w orld had been looking at FO SS as an approach to save
th eir m o n ey to be invested on com m ercial softw are or FO SS as a business strategy itself.
H ow ever libraries did n o t tu rn tow ards it before late 1990s; instead, there w ere som e p roprietary
softw are w h ich w are u sin g open source softw are as a com ponent o f th eir ILS.

A d vocacy o f D an iel C h u d n ov to open source softw are in lib raries

In m ost o f the possibilities, D aniel C hudnov, the m ost w ell-k n o w n advocate o f the open source

th ro u g h h is historical w riting ‘O pen Source library system : getting sta rte d ’ in F ebruary 1999 on a

60

w ebsite (http://www.oss41ib.org) created b y him to p rovide open source softw are to library
professionals

(M organ, 2012; C larke, 2000). In A ugust, 1999 he republished it in ‘L ib ra ry

J o u r n a l’ w ith m odified title ‘O pen source softw are: the future o f library sy ste m ’, that had done
enough to b ring the term to the attention o f library com m unity (C hudnov, 1999a).

D aniel C hudnov (1999b), in his w riting encouraged the library professionals to draw their
attention tow ards open source softw are b y elaborating the benefits o f open source softw are and
equalizing the p h ilosophy o f librarianship and O SS. H e suggested that using open source
softw are the libraries can cut the costs involved in developm ent and m anagem ent o f p roprietary
softw are in library as w ell as the libraries could m o d ify the codes as p e r the req u irem en t o f the
library. H e says “W e are an educational institution, and w e are here for people to leam about
com puters. That should include learning h o w th e softw are on this com puter w orks.... L ibraries
should actively discourage the concealm ent o f generally u sefu l know ledge, and that includes
pro p rietary softw are." (C hudnov, 1999b). This w riting by C hudnov becam e a m ilestone in the
field o f O SS in libraries. H e w as appreciated b y a n u m b er o f library professionals for his efforts
in this w riting and starting O S S4L ib in early 1999 (C larke, 2000; M organ, 2012). H ow ever,
before C h u d n o v ’s w riting also there w ere a few exam ples o f efforts m ad e tow ards using O SS;
som e o f th em w ere cited b y C hudnov in his w riting. Som e o f them , for exam ple are, use o f
L inux, A pache, M yS Q L and PH P (L A M P) for m anaging inform ation about online resources and
selected subject-based Internet resources at Y ale's C ushing/W hitney M edical L ibrary (C hudnov,
1999b). Further, yet another exam ple is the enunciation o f ‘K eystone P rin c ip le s’ b y A R L
(A ssociation o f R esearch L ibraries) leaders w ho acknow ledged that “libraries w ere responsible
for creating innovative inform ation system s and advocated for the developm ent o f open source

61

solutions” (Jaffe & C areaga, 2007). A ccording to C hudnov (1999b) the follow ing factors and
situations insist libraries to use OSS.

>

O SS perm its libraries to reduce the costing on library softw are that can be utilised in
other developm ental activities in library.

A library w ish in g com m ercial support can also adopt an O SS as there are several
organisations w h ich provide technical support for OSS.

L ibrary professionals could also build th eir O SS project and m ake it open for the library
com m unity to im prove it.

a few

perceived

O SS

as

“still

only

a distant

po ssib ility ”(B reeding, 2002). M arshall B reeding (2002) produced his argum ents w h y O SS in
libraries could not be a rea lity soon:

>

A m ovem ent o f libraries, including L ibrary o f C ongress, from self-developed ILS to
pro p rietary softw are ensured that th ey do not h av e resources to develop and m aintain

62

>

P roprietary ILS developed b y com m ercial ven d o rs are resu lt o f research o f m ore than
five years and th eir softw are are hav in g p rogram codes o f m illions line. T hey have great
team s o f com puter program m ers and developm ent o f an O SS is a m illion dollar project. It
is hard to see that even a large library w ould h av e all these facilities to develop a large
scale ILS.

>

T echnology is developing so fast that even com m ercial ILS developers w ith th eir great
team s find it difficult to cope w ith the dem ands o f libraries. H ence h o w a team o f open

library professionals.

>

A n u m b er o f O SS enthusiasts are present but v ery few library adm inistrators are rea d y to
take risk o f strategic reliance on O SS. L ibraries lack the ability to fund the program m ing
sta ff for th eir com m ercially-supplied system , and m u ch less tow ards the developm ent o f
OSS.

M arshall saw no future o f O SS although K oha w as already b o m b y th e tim e he w as w riting this.
H e did not see any “parad ig m shift approaching w here com m ercial com panies yield to open
source and free softw are.” H e observed further, “ The opportunity for libraries to develop O pen
Source applications in th e digital library arena is n a rro w ” (B reeding, 2002).

4.3.5

O pen source softw are as an essential aspect for the d evelop m en t o f lib rary services

H ow ever, D raft R eport (D igital L ibrary Federation, 2001) o f D igital L ibrary F ederation (U SA )
did observe O SS as an essential aspect for the developm ent o f L ibrary services. The report puts
th eir findings as under:

63

>

O SS is an econom ical alternative to libraries' reliance u p o n com m ercially supplied
softw are.

>

O SS is essential i f libraries are to develop softw are and system s that m eet th eir patrons'
needs.

>

O SS ensures th at library system s and online services w ill be m ore functional for libraries
and th eir patrons and as such be good for library patrons.

R o y T ennant (2000) saw the opportunities in O SS but he felt th at “unless the O SS application is
a w ell-developed and stand-alone application such as the A pache w eb server, use o f O SS w ill
m o stly occur in large libraries ( o f all types) th at are m ore likely to have s ta ff w ho can install and
m ain tain the softw are” . Sim ilarly, M uir (2005) accepted that O SS is beneficial for libraries from
the financial p oint o f v iew and it gives opportunities to the libraries to m o d ify th em according to
the need o f the lib rary but at the sam e tim e he raises doubts as to the availability o f technical
expertise and support in the long run to contain any bug or error. T his turns out to be its single
m ost draw back.

H ow ever, w ith the p assage o f tim e O SS proved the people w ho w ere skeptic regarding the
acceptability o f open source softw are in libraries w rong. In a v e ry short p eriod after C h u d n o v ’s
call to adopt O SS, a n u m b er o f projects for open source library applications found th eir w ay.
A d d itio n ally libraries started to shift from com m ercial to open source softw are. It w as enough to
change the m inds o f people w ho doubted the future o f O SS. R oy T ennant (2003), after 3 years o f
raising doubts about the future o f O SS in his publication, accepted that “open source is [going]
into m ain stream ” . S im ilarly M arshall B reeding (2009) w ho saw open source ILS as a distant
po ssib ility agreed that “T he open source ILS m o vem ent has p rogressed past the point w here its

64

v iab ility can seriously be questioned. T he current m om entum o f open source ILS adoption m akes
it alm ost inevitable that it w ill represent an increasing p o rtion o f the library autom ation
landscape” .

T here are softw are w h ich are developed p u rely on free and open source p latfo rm and the users
need not spend even a single pen n y for these. U sin g free and open source softw are, one can
easily provide h ig h level technical facilities to the users and m ake the library autom ated.
H ow ever, the libraries w ho find it convenient to obtain com m ercial support for th eir ILS m ay
also obtain the sam e for O SS. T oday a n u m b er o f vendors exist w ho p rovide support for O S ILS.
T aking com m ercial support, for those w ho have enough financial resources and w ishing to h ire a
vendor, for open source ILS again w ill save the libraries from being blackm ailed b y the vendors
o f com m ercial ILS as source code o f open source is alw ays open and changing the ven d o r m ay
not h arm the activities and functionalities o f the library in any respect. A vailab ility o f
com m ercial vendors for O SS is an answ er to the skepticism o f M uir as w h en he said “w ho
officially provides support: after all, there is no ven d o r to com plain to, and this could m ake it
h ard er to ensure im provem ents and fixes are m ad e ” (M uir, 2005).

Open Source Software Projects for Libraries

A fter the above discussion on the expansion o f concept on O SS in libraries, it is n ecessary to
have an in-depth look at p rom inent open source projects in libraries. T he upcom ing discussion

for th eir developm ent. H ow ever, it w ill not cover the technical analysis o f the softw are itse lf as it

O pen Source L ib rary M an agem en t System s
K oh a (O pen Source IL S )

K o h a 5, claim ed to be the first open source library m anagem ent system , traces its origin to the
1999 in N e w Zealand. K oha is a result o f the frustration o f the library professional w ith the
com m ercial library m anagem ent system . A group o f public libraries o f H orow henua L ibrary
T rust (H LT) in N e w Z ealand felt the need to change th eir com m ercial ILS, C atalist, as it w as not
com plem ent w ith Y 2 K 6 issues. T he lib rary w as not able to do anything w ith the softw are as it
w as a closed source softw are and th ey w ere forced to rep lace th eir ILS w ith a n e w ILS. The
other pro b lem w ith C atalist w as that it depended on m odem s to m ain tain th eir n etw ork w hich
w as increasing th eir telephone line cost (A nctil & B eheshti, 20 0 4 ).Instead o f going for another
com m ercial ILS, H L T decided to develop th eir ow n ILS suitable to th eir needs. H L T L ibrarian
R osalie B lake did all that w as required to convince the council to get exceptional circum stances
grant for replacing the current ILS and she succeed in it. H ow ever, the approved fund w as 50%
o f the actual cost and rest had to be m anaged b y the library its e lf from th eir annual budget
(R ansom , C orm ack, & B lake, 2009).

B eing m u ch cost conscious, th ey sent R F P (R equest F o r P roposal) to several vendors but the
proposals w ere either costly or could not com ply to the library needs. T hey h ad v e ry

options l e f t , first, increase the budget w h ich w as n e a r to im possible, second, to com prom ise w ith
th eir needs w h ich th ey did not w ant to do, and th ird that th ey w rite an ILS o f th eir ow n. H aving
K atipo com m unication, an IT firm , in th eir partn er list, increased th eir m o tiv atio n to choose the
last option. T hey gave th is resp o n sib ility to K atipo C om m unication to p rogram an ILS for H LT.
W ork o f ILS started in Septem ber 1999 and w as com pleted b y Jan u ary 2000, how ever, it w as
available to the w orld for dow nload only in Ju ly 2000 as th e first release (K oha C om m unity,
n.d.). K atipo C om m unication has suggested that the softw are w ill release u n d er G N U G eneral
Public L icence (G PL ) as an open source softw are so that the project w ould have longevity. H L T
accepted this suggestion and its release w as free for all.
Initially, it w as nam ed C4 (C heap and C heerful C opy o f C) but then, after a lot o f discussion,
th ey adopted a M aori language term ‘K o h a ’ w h ich m eant ‘g ift’ o r ‘donation.

(Engard, 2010).

“W e chose K oha as the nam e, because it’s free and because it’s our gift to the w o rld ” (R ansom ,
C orm ack, & B lake, 2009). T he reaction o f developers w as that K oha w ould have a long and
b right future as the w o rld ’s first open source integrated softw are. T hough, the earlier started
project on open source ILS w as reported as A vanti ILS project begun in 1998 b y P eter Schlum pf,
it could not be as com plete and successful as K oha.

Initial release o f K oha w as enough for H L T libraries th o u g h it did not have several features such
as Z 39.50 and M A R C . A fter p u b lishing its release on K o h a ’s m ailing list, people around the
w orld started show ing th eir interest in it. Som e school libraries in C oast M ountains School
D istrict o f B ritish C olum bia in C anada started u sin g K oha w ith the help o f Steve T onneson, the
netw o rk engineer o f the district. T he w orldw ide interest in K oha rose only after its adoption by
N elsonville P ublic L ibrary (N PL ) in O hio, U SA . N P L also funded to develop Z 39.50 and M A R C
feature in K oha to m ake it m ore advanced and viable. S low ly and gradually a n u m b er o f libraries

m oved to K oha from closed source softw are. T he constant m ove o f libraries tow ards K oha also
generated the opportunities for com m ercial ven d o rs to establish th em selves as K oha technical
supporter. Som e o f the com m ercial vendors are K oha W ater S olutions7, L ib lim e8, and E quinox9.
P resen tly K oha is ru nning in its 3.10.6 version.

A v an ti (O pen Source IL S)

A v a n ti 10 is the earliest started project on an open source ILS b y P eter S c h lu m p f in 1998.
N onetheless the project had v ery sm all success u ntil the end o f 2004. This is w hat gave chance to
K oha to be acclaim ed the w o rld ’s first open source ILS. A vanti is dependent on a single m a n ’s
effort as it does n ot have any supporting com m unity o f developers. B y the end o f 2008 it could
have only a cataloguing and p atro n accessible catalogue m odule. Its capacity is lim ited and it is
configured to catalogue and search up to 16,000 titles and 32,000 item s (Schlum pf, 20 0 8 ).The
program m ing language o f the softw are is ja v a and it is com patible to run on Linux and
W indow s. H ow ever it failed to fascinate library com m unity and no library has reported using
A vanti M icroL C S (A nctil & B eheshti, 2004).

4.5.2.

Interp retation s

O pen source softw are has becom e an inevitable reality not ju st in library but any type o f
organisation and even in daily lives o f people. The w id ely used open source softw are is
G N U /L inux operating system w h ich is u sed by alm ost every individual w ho uses In ternet
because all m ajo r applications u sed b y people to d ay u se L inux as operating system o f their
servers such as L acebook, G oogle, A m azon, etc. A pache W eb Server has been u sed by
m ax im u m n u m b er o f w ebsites in the w orld and has beaten all com m ercial w eb servers. Its
nearest com petitor is M icrosoft W eb Server. A m o n g W eb B row sers also, open source softw are is
leading w ith L irefox and C hrom e. Y et another fam ous open source softw are is A p a c h e ’s O pen
O ffice that claim s to be v ery successful and p rom inent am ong the com puter users throughout the
w orld. These softw are are being utilised by com puter professionals o f alm ost every industry
including library and inform ation science.

H ow ever, open source softw are used specifically for libraries and inform ation centres are K oha,
N ew genlib, E vergreen, D space, G reenstone, E prints etc. A d d itio n ally there are m an y other types
o f softw are th at are used in the libraries. The open source softw are m ovem ent and libraries are
closely related as ph ilo so p h y o f open source softw are to distribute free softw are reflects in the
ph ilo so p h y o f libraries to dissem inate inform ation freely. T hat is w h y once A m arel (2008)
rig h tly asserted that “libraries and the open m ovem ent m esh to g eth er lo g ically.” Free Softw are
F oundation follow s the open m ovem ent as a ph ilo so p h y and does not support p roprietary
softw are in any w a y w hile the O pen Source advocates do not loath pro p rietary softw are i f th ey

80

do n ot have a better open source softw are to replace the closed one. E ven the m o st prom inent
open source advocates use p roprietary softw are. H ow ard C ounty Library, k n o w n for m ost
optim um use o f open source softw are, provides access to th eir O P A C th ro u g h the com puters
using M icrosoft and A p p le ’s operating system (D eG roff, 2008). B ut, open source softw are have
secured th eir place in all types o f libraries.

T he estim ation o f usage o f open source softw are and its im pact on libraries is difficult. H ow ever,
there are several literature available about success o f open source installation in libraries from
every co m er o f the w orld. In fact som e studies show that open source ILS form a significant
p o rtio n o f autom ation industry (B reedings, 2013).

O pen source softw are h av e proved efficient in every aspect such as price and support. E very
open source softw are is supported th rough m ore th an one com m unity and th rough their
developers as w ell. M ost o f the tim e the participants o f the com m unity are users o f the softw are
w ho are experiencing the softw are, hence, the bug finding and offering solutions are quicker than
a com m ercial vendor. T he n ew users get support from the com m unity and soon get rea d y to
support other n ew users. H ow ever, w ithout good supporting com m unities it is difficult for open
source softw are to develop. A few exam ples o f such softw are are A vanti, PhpM yL ibrary,
O penbiblio, E m ilda, etc.

A n o th er benefit o f open source softw are is th at it is co n tinuously u n d er developm ent; thus users
can avail the latest features. Y et another v e ry im portant benefit o f u sin g open source softw are is
that it does not bind anyone to continuously use it. It gives freedom to m igrate to any other
softw are any tim e w h ich is not an easy task in case o f com m ercial softw are.

81

C ontinuous involvem ent o f library professionals in open source softw are installation and its use
helps th em

in becom ing aw are o f the com plexities o f inform ation technology and in

com prehending the intricacies o f softw are u sed in library autom ation. Som e inform ation
professionals gain considerable expertise o f softw are b y u sin g open source softw are th at th ey
them selves could develop or support the developm ent o f an open source softw are b y w a y o f
p roviding program m ing help, bug finder or th ro u g h helping other installations. O pen source
softw are is a p h ilo so p h y and it jo in s the people around the w orld in a chain w here each one is
connected and supported by others. L astly, it could be said th at in open source w orld each one is
a user, developer and program m er w ho supports this m ovem ent to the best o f his/h er capabilities.

O SS in association w ith open access25, W eb 2.0 and upcom ing W eb 3.0 shall be beneficial not
only to d ay but also in com ing future. T he m ost com m on form s o f open access are open access
jo u rn a ls and open access repositories that enable the society to access research results w ithout
paying any fees. W eb tools, on the other hand, are online free tools th at can be used to im prove
the q uality o f lib rary services and to m ak e the optim um u se o f Inform ation T echnology. W eb 2.0
tools are available in various form s such as R SS (R eally Sim ple Syndication), W iki, B logs,
Social N etw ork, Podcast, etc. A n y library w ith all these tools w ith open access literature and
open source softw are m ay p rovide h ig h q uality services to its patrons.

CHAPTER V

OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE FOR LIBRARIES

As discussed in the preceding chapter, there are m any open source software available for
libraries.

A wide variety o f open source library m anagement software, digital library

software and other software are available for the libraries to choose from. This chapter
attempts to fulfil the second objective o f the present study; thus covers the analysis of open
source library m anagement software and digital library software. However, as stated earlier in
Chapter III, the researcher has not carried out any prim ary data collection technique through
questionnaire or interview to analyse the various software, but has depended on his personal
experience o f having w orked with some of these software, the m anuals and websites o f these
software and the existing studies on them.

In libraries m ainly two software are used, first a library m anagement software known by the
generic term as Integrated Library System (ILS) and a software used to create a digital library
or an institutional repository. The present chapter w ould first discuss the open source library
management software then move to digital library software. Additionally, this chapter would
also discuss some other open source software that can be useful to libraries.

5.1.

Open Source Library Management Software

There are m any open source library m anagement software in existence, i.e., Avanti,
Evergreen1, PhpM yBibli2, PhpM yLibrary3, Koha4, New G enLib ,5 etc. The researcher has

89

discussed them briefly in the earlier chapter. However, out o f all these only three software are
used by a m ajority of libraries. These software are Koha, Evergreen and Newgenlib. This
current section will discuss only these three software as other software have not made a mark
because m any o f them have either stagnated w ith a particular version or their development
process is very slow or they have unimpressive features.

However Koha, Newgenlib and

Evergreen could successfully attract the libraries and find enough num ber o f users. A wide
num ber o f libraries are using these open source software. Koha and Evergreen are holding
about 14 percent m arket o f commercial support ILS services in the w orld (Breeding, 2013).In
addition to this, the num ber is huge for those who are running open source software on their
own without a commercial support. Newgenlib, on the other hand is a developing open
source software which originated in India. It is gaining momentum with its excellent features
and m agnificent support service. Hence it is justifiable to have an analytical and evaluative
view on only these three open source ILS which is presented in this section by discussing
their technical features and modules.

5.1.1. Koha
Koha, synonymous for the term gift in M aori language, was developed in 1999 to get rid o f
Y2K problem and on dissatisfactory services from commercial ILS. In Chapter four the
investigator has already discussed the historical background o f Koha. Koha is written with
Perl language and is created on LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP) platform. However, a
few versions of Koha were also developed for W indows. However, the last version for
windows was released in 2009, i.e., 2.2.9 and no further version o f Koha was developed for
Windows. Koha has won several awards such as 3M A w ard for Innovation in Libraries in
2000, Interactive NZ A w ard (The best example o f interactive m edia specifically made for
community and not for profit organisations) in 2000, Trophee Du Libre A w ard in 2003,

90

Com puterworld excellence in IT for non-profit Aw ard in 2004 etc. (Koha, 2013). The current
version of Koha is 3.12.4 released on 24th August 2013. The technical specifications and
various modules o f Koha are discussed below.

5.1.1.1.

Technical Features

Besides developed on LAMP platform Koha has several technical features which are as
m entioned below in this Section.

Complete open source: Koha is a full-fledged open source software. From basic application
of Koha to database application, W eb server and installation platform all are open source.
Koha does not use any commercial software that m ay levy any indirect costs to a library that
adopts Koha. It is distributed under G N U ’s General Public Licence while other applications
are also distributed under this or other open source licence.

Library Standard compliant: Koha is built using m aximum library standards and protocols
to ensure interoperability between Koha and other software using these standards. Library
standards make it easy to m igrate to and from K oha easily. Koha Uses M ARC tags, ISBD for
cataloguing, Z 39.50 for information exchange and several other similar library standards.

W eb based interface: Koha is not only a W eb based application but its interfaces such as
administrative interface, OPAC, and self-checkout interfaces are completely web based and
opens with the help of a browser. Hence it does not require having a separate client
application for running the software. K oha’s web interface is based on XHTM L, CSS and
JavaScript W eb technologies that make Koha platform independent.

Freedom to use comm ercial database: Though Koha is basically tested on M ySQL to store
data, one m ay also use commercial database software such as Oracle, or Informix.

91

No

vendor lock in: Koha does not impose any restriction in any form for its use. A library

can freely use Koha by itself, with in-house expertise or can outsource external technical
support. .

Dual database design: Koha uses dual database, i.e., text based and RDBMS to ensure
scalable database enough to meet the transaction load o f any library, no m atter what is the
size.

No huge structure required: To have Koha in a library, it does not require to have a huge
technical structure. A simple computer is enough to install Koha on it. Koha can work on a
standalone computer as well as on a huge intranet and W eb structure.

5.1.1.2.

Koha M odules

Koha has all essential modules that a complete ILS should have. K oha has acquisition,
circulation, cataloguing, OPAC, and serials module. The brief details o f the same are as
m entioned below in this Section.

Acquisition: Acquisition module o f Koha works in two modes. Simple mode and advanced
mode. The simple m ode provides an interface for adding new holdings to the catalogue.
Advanced mode provides options and interface for tracking o f acquisition process such as
requests, orders, claiming, invoicing, budget control and other processing o f the library.

Cataloguing:

The

cataloguing

m odule

of

Koha

follows

worldwide

recognized

M A R C/M A RC 21 format for creating bibliographic records. Additionally, it can also convert
these records to ISBD format. Z39.50 protocol is implem ented to retrieve the cataloguing
records o f other libraries. Cataloguing m odule o f Koha is also compatible with AACR2.
Users can create bibliographic record o f a document without following acquisition module or

92

by following acquisition module. Cataloguing module also enables the user to create
cataloguing framework for different kinds o f material such as monograph, serial, web
resources, digital resources etc.

Circulation: Circulation module o f Koha provides an easy interface for issuing or returning
of books. M oreover patron m anagement is also available in this module. This module
calculates fine on overdue m aterials automatically. There is provision to operate with the
institutional email server to provide email notifications to the user regarding checking out and
in.

Serials: Serial module o f K oha provides interface for registering periodical subscription, to
renew them and to track the arrival of them. It also takes care o f late received issues, skipped
issues and forwards automatic claims to the supplier. Serials module, in short, is a great hand
for the library professionals to manage periodicals with more than ten diverse frequencies. It
also forwards the information of library holdings to the OPAC and keeps the patrons abreast
about the serial issues available in the library.

OPAC: Online Public Access Catalogue o f Koha is very interesting. It provides simple
Google type search option with an advanced Boolean logic based search. Simple search is for
users who are not very familiar w ith Boolean logic and like to carry a Google like search. It
also has ‘did you m ean’ feature that lets the user informed about their spelling mistakes or the
books available in the database with slight different spellings. Advanced search on the other
hand uses Boolean logic to reduce the recall and increase precision. OPAC module also keeps
the users informed about the new arrivals in the library. It also enables users to create public
and private list o f favourite titles. Koha OPAC enables the user to search in various
languages. Recently OPAC has integrated with various W eb 2.0 features.

93

Others: In addition to above basic modules, Koha also provides comprehensive report
generation facility. Koha can generate a wide range o f reports depending upon the
requirement o f the library. M oreover Koha also helps the library to create barcode labels for
books and patrons. It also takes care o f Inventory through its inventory m anagement system
that helps in stock taking.

Koha, thus, is a complete library m anagement system with all required modules and features.
A library can adopt Koha with its own technical hum an resource or can outsource the
maintenance o f it with a num ber of support agencies. The best feature is that the library can
change the support agency at any time and it cannot be compelled to take service o f a
particular agency. Additionally, the libraries that do not wish to take commercial support for
Koha m ay refer a num ber o f m anuals available at Koha website, can become a m em ber of
the various forums on Koha that extends support to all new Koha users. M oreover, in case o f
a bug, Koha has created a bug directory that helps to debug any particular problem. Using
Koha, a library m ay get rid o f the commercial ILS which often comes loaded with a num ber
of terms and conditions.

5.1.2. Evergreen
Evergreen is yet another prominent open source software which was first released in 2006
and is now adopted by more than 1000 libraries including public libraries, academic libraries,
and special libraries all over the w orld (Evergreen, 2013).It was initiated as a project at
Georgia Public Library to take care of more than 200 public libraries of Georgia State.
Chapter four o f this report has already discussed developmental history o f Evergreen in more
detail. Evergreen is designed and developed to install at Linux operating system like Koha,
however, it is based on client server technology and its client application can be installed on

94

W indows platform. The current version o f Evergreen is 2.4.1 released in July 2013. The
technical specification and modules o f Evergreen are as below.

5.I.2.I.

Technical features

Similar to Koha, Evergreen is also designed using Perl language and uses Apache Web
server. However it uses PostgreSQL to store database. The technical features o f Evergreen
are discussed in this Section.
True open source: Evergreen is a true open source software. It is not only designed to install
on open source operating platform but all supporting software that it uses are open source
only. Evergreen uses open source W eb Server Apache, database PostgreSQL, Perl etc. It is
licensed under G N U ’s GPL licence that offers freedom to users to use, m odify and distribute
to others.

Client Server Technology: Evergreen is built on Client server technology. The server is
Linux while the Client application is platform independent and can be installed even on
W indows or Mac.

Library Standards com pliant: Evergreen follows m ost o f the library standards such as
MARC, Dublin Core, Z39.50 etc. to facilitate easy interoperability between other library
tools.
OpenSRF: Evergreen also features the Open Scalable Request Framework (OpenSRF) that
allows the developers to create applications for evergreen with a m inimum knowledge o f its
structure.

Applicable in any organisational structure: Evergreen is compatible to work in any type o f
organisational structure such as a single library, multiple libraries in the same campus,
multiple libraries in various parts o f the city or town, or multiple libraries at various cities,
states or countries. Evergreen provides complete structure to work in any o f these conditions.

95

Sufficient for multiple branches: Evergreen can work for a standalone library or a num ber
o f libraries o f an organisation. Evergreen under this feature allows each library to set up their
own rules and policies within their system. Such as circulation period, num ber o f items issued
to the patron etc. This functionality allows each m em ber library to m aintain their rules,
regulations and individual preferences that m akes the workflow o f each library very simple
and smooth.

5.I.2.2.

Evergreen M odules

Acquisition: Acquisition module in Evergreen has all features and options required for a
library. Evergreen provides platform to users to file their request for an item as the library
admin can approve or reject a request, create orders for requested book, allot budget for a
financial year, receive invoices from vendors and forward it to the technical section for
further processing. M oreover, in acquisition module admin can send rem inders for items not
received from the vendors and can print any document related to acquisition process.

Cataloguing: Cataloguing in Evergreen supports M ARC format for entering bibliographic
details of an item. Admin can m odify or create templates using MARC tags. In order to
import the cataloguing records from other libraries Z39.50 features is available in this
module.

Circulation: Through circulation interface admin can issue books to users and can get them
checked in back to the library. To specify the period o f circulation, admin has to specify the
circulation period for various category o f users. M oreover, admin can specify the amount of
fine for overdue items. Nevertheless, through pre-specified rules admin can select a specific
date for any item to any user at the time o f checking out o f a book. In addition to check in and
out, the circulation m odule provides option to renew the status o f an item which is already a

96

checked out item; option to m ark the item as lost or set their status in maintenance in case the
book is not available in stacks due to binding or other technical reasons.

OPAC: Evergreen OPAC provides a state-of-the-art web interface (Yang & Hofmann, 2010).
It provides a simple and Boolean logic based search option to the users. Evergreen provides
an excellent navigation from one search result to another with a specific subject or author.
M oreover, evergreen provides an optimum ‘did you m ean’ feature. W hen a user’s search hits
no result, then Evergreen provides a list of suggestive alternative spelling. It also has the
ability to fetch the book cover from Internet on the basis o f its ISBN number. If the book is
present in Google Books project, then it also hyperlinks to the web page o f that particular
item so that the users can read the summary o f the item.

Serials: Serial module is one which was added m uch later than the other modules in
Evergreen. It first appeared in Evergreen in 2009 while full-fledged serial module was added
in 2011. Hence, serial module o f Evergreen is not as m atured as the other open source library
management software, however, it has all the basic features such as processing request for a
new journal, adding a new journal and a journal issue, registering the claim for a not received
issue etc.

Others: In addition to the above prim ary modules, Evergreen has ‘Report B uilder’ feature
that allows the admin to create various statistical reports using a num ber o f database tables of
Evergreen. M oreover like all ILS, Evergreen also has a common administration module to
configure the various param eter of the software. To support the users o f Evergreen there are a
num ber of online forums run by the community. In addition to that, some commercial
vendors are also available for those who wish to adopt a third party commercial support for
Evergreen. Some o f these vendors are Equinox, ByW ater and Lyrasis.

97

5.1.3. NewGenLib
NewGenLib is another prominent open source software for libraries. It is bom and developed
in India by Verus Solution w ith the help o f Kesavan Institute of Information and Knowledge
M anagement, Hyderabad. The developmental history o f NewGenLib has already been
discussed in Chapter IV.

NewGenLib is an ILS which is turned open source from a

commercial ILS. It received huge publicity in a very short span o f time and is being used in a
num ber o f libraries not only in India but also overseas. NewGenLib can be installed on Linux
as well as on Windows. It is a web based application and based on Client Server structure,
however, it does not require any specific client application to be installed specifically. It
installs client application autom atically from the server. The current version o f NewGenLib is
3.0.4 Release 2 released on 25th June 2013.

5.I.3.I.

Technical Features

Unlike Koha and Evergreen, NewGenLib has the ability to work on W indows platform in
addition to Linux. It uses Java Tomcat as web server, PostgreSQL database to store data and
is program med with the help o f Java. NewGenLib has a num ber o f advanced technical
features which are rare in any ILS, open source or proprietary. Some o f them are discussed
here in this Section.

Complete open source:

Similar to Koha and Evergreen, NewGenLib (NGL) is also a

complete open source software as it uses all open source software to support the functionality
o f this software. Besides the m ain application, NGL uses Apache Tomcat as web server,
PostgreSQL database and is program med in Java. It uses Java W eb Start to install client
application on other computer.

98

Platform independent: This feature m akes the NGL unique in comparison to Koha and
Evergreen. NGL is platform independent and can be installed on W indows too. It does not
compel the users to have a Linux platform to install NGL.

Library standard compliant: NG L is complying with international library standards such as
MARC, Z39.50, MARC21, and OAI-PMH, Dublin Core. These standards enable
interoperability in NG L with other library software or tools.

RFID integration: NGL is compatible to RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) integration.
If a library wishes to have RFID then they need not change their ILS. NGL is fully
compatible to configure RFID based product with it.

Autom ated mailing and SMS: NGL has integrated automated m ailing and SMS technology
through which a user receives an SMS when s/he borrows or returns the book to the library.
In addition to circulation, email and SMS can be sent through various modules such as
serials, acquisition etc.

M ulti lingual: NGL has made it possible to enter data in catalogue in several scripts. Besides
English one can enter data in m any other languages such as Hindi, Gujarati, Arabic, Urdu,
etc.

Android application: NGL has developed a mobile application for android so that the users
m ay access NGL through their android mobile (Verus Solutions, n.d.).All basic features o f an
OPAC are available through this application such as browsing the collection, checking the
availability o f the item, checking checkout history, list of new arrival books etc.
5.1.3.2.

NewGenLib M odules

NGL has all m odules which are generally found in all ILS and there are some modules which
are peculiar to it. The details o f the modules o f N G L are as follows:

99

Acquisition:

acquisition module

in NGL provides

comprehensive

functionality for

acquisition. Request made through OPAC are shown here. Additionally the librarian can also
add or remove items through this module. The user can create firm order, receive invoices,
and assign accession num bers from this module. In addition to the general features o f a
typical acquisition module this m odule also m anages items received in gift, books bought by
the library on approval basis, quotation received by the suppliers etc.

Cataloguing: NGL like Koha and Evergreen follows MARC format for bibliographic entry.
However, it has eased the work o f library professionals by creating a num ber o f MARC based
templates for various category o f items such as single volume book, m ulti volume book, book
chapter, non-print material, serials, journal article etc. These tem plates reduce the users'
confusion about num erous tags o f MARC records. In addition to the ready templates NGL
has created several m asters which are preconfigured, i.e., type o f material, nature of
documents etc. M oreover, NGL has provided the functionality to attach a digital file with a
MARC record, hence, a library which is not in a huge requirement o f a digital library
software can do their work with NGL. For a digital document it also follows international
standard D ublin Core. Through this module subject and author authority files are stored in the
database that increases the vocabulary control in indexing the items.

Circulation: circulation o f NGL is very simple and communicative. The circulation module
works on the basis o f the parameters set by the admin such as user privileges and overdue
charges etc. Issue and return, and renewal function are very rapid in NGL and it also accepts
the barcode standards and RFID integration. M oreover, this module also deals with the items
lost or damaged, items sent out for binding, inter library loan, Book Bank, and weeding out o f
the books.

100

OPAC: Online Public Access Catalogue o f NGL is developed with several features o f W eb
2.0. NG L OPAC provides several search options besides simple and Boolean logic based
search. Patron m ay select the category o f items, such from books, serials, book chapters and
serial articles etc. Patron by logging onto the OPAC m ay check books borrowed by them,
their privileges and can also request the books for acquisition to the library. In the recently
released version a patron m ay also search the experts in the organisation.

Serials: Like other m odules, serial module o f NGL is also integrated w ith all basic functions.
All functions o f Serial desk such as collecting request, creating orders, receipt o f invoices and
issues, claims for not received issues and binding o f serials can be m anaged w ith this module.

NGL W orkbench: NewGenLib work bench provides option to the admin to create and print
library card and barcode labels. The library card is fully customizable on the requirem ent of
the library. NGL uses another open source application - iReport for creating library cards
using the library admin that can m odify the format of library card. M oreover this m odule also
helps the library to import the book record and patron record from an xls or csv file. Book
records can also be imported from a M ARC file.

End of the Day Process (EOD): NewGenLib end of the day process is an application which
is bundled in NG L application. The purpose o f this application is to relegate the production o f
time taking outputs, i.e., creating claim letters, emails to users, etc. to a time when the server
is comparatively free than the other busier periods of the day.

Others: In addition to all modules elaborated above, NGL has an administration module
where all basic configurations are done. Through this module various parameters such as
holidays, category o f patron, list o f vendors, budget head, financial year, user privileges, etc.
can be fixed. M oreover, NGL has started using a new application that helps to index full text

101

o f digital attachments so that a user can retrieve any documents from any key w ord o f the
document. In addition to the m ain application, NG L has developed some other applications
which can be integrated with the NG L prim ary application. These are NGL UC and NGL
Touch. NGL UC (NewGenLib Union Catalogue) helps to integrate the OPAC o f several
libraries into one, while N G L Touch is an application that enables the self-check in, check­
out and self-renewal o f a library material. NGL also supports VuFind that enables the patron
o f a library to search and browse the library resources by replacing the traditional OPAC to
an online OPAC o f next generation.

However, presently the users o f N ewGenLib are lim ited to m any Indian libraries and very
few libraries outside India in comparison o f Koha and Evergreen. However, the future of
NGL is very bright looking at its technical support and development process. NGL has
several layers o f support to the users o f NGL. Firstly, they help the users in real time when
they face a problem or get into a trouble. Using remote desktop access tools, an NGL
program mer m ay fix any issue in no time. This layer o f their support looks more promising
than even technical support o f a commercial software. Secondly, like m any other software,
they also have a forum where any query m ay be answered by NG L program mers and the
other users o f NGL. In the third option they have created free lancers who m ay help the
libraries in their area. In addition to all these free support, they m ay also provide a
commercial support if the library wishes to have it. However, till now, no other commercial
vendor has been observed providing any commercial support for NGL.

Open Source Digital Library Software

W ith the explosion in the num ber o f electronic or digital documents, libraries started to store
the electronic copies o f theses, dissertations, articles and chapters written by faculty mem bers
and m any other forms o f scholarly content online for instant and easy access by the users of
the library. A digital library software played an important role in managing, retrieving and

102

browsing o f the electronic documents kept in the server o f the library. M any open source
software are available for m anaging a digital library or institutional repository o f an
institution. However, out of many, three are used by large num ber of libraries

and these are

Dspace6, Greenstone7 and Eprints8. This section w ould cover only these three m ost prominent
open source digital library software. However, there are a num ber of scholarly writings,
evaluating the other open source digital library software.

For instance, Sunita S. Barve

(2008) has done a comprehensive evaluation of open source digital library software in her
thesis.

5.2.1. Dspace:
Dspace was developed at MIT, as discussed in the preceding chapter, with the objective to
facilitate organisations in m anaging their digital content. It is a simple and platform
independent open source software licensed under BSD Licence (DSpace, n.d.). It is specially
designed to support digital preservation for the electronic/digital documents added to the
repository in an easy m anner (Barve, 2008).The central idea behind the structural m odel of
Dspace is ‘com m unities’ that is unit and subunit in an organisation. In case o f university,
‘com m unities’ can be schools, departments, laboratories, research centres, etc. of the
university (Smith, 2003). Communities contain collections by clustering related content.
System architecture o f DSpace is as shown in Figure 1.0.

5.2.I.I.

Technical Features

In addition to being an open source software, DSpace uses advanced techniques to make
DSpace more advanced in its usability. The technical features of DSpace are as follows:

Complete open source: DSpace is a complete open source software. Besides prim ary
application, it uses all other supporting software such as Java, Apache Ant, Apache Maven,
PostgreSQL database and Apache Tomcat; the web server is also an open source. Hence it
does not cause any direct or indirect cost on software.

User Interface: DSpace is a complete web based solution. Both interfaces, i.e., user interface
and administrative interface, are accessible from any web browser. This helps the

104

administrator to m anage the digital library more effectively. It does not require to access
server to m anage the collection and changing the preferences and configurations.

Platform independent: DSpace is platform independent. It can be installed on Linux as well
as any version o f W indows. A user need not leam Linux operating system to get DSpace
installed, but, it is easily installable on any version o f W indows such as W indows XP,
W indows Vista, W indows 7, W indows 8, etc.

Com patible with International Standards: Dspace is compatible with International
standards such as OAI-PM H, Dublin Core, OAICat, etc. Open Archive Initiative- Protocol
for M etadata Harvesting (OAI-PM H) is an internationally recognized protocol for metadata
harvesting. Dublin core is a set o f 15 m etadata elements to describe the digital resource
(Wikipedia, 2013) and OAICat is O CLC’s open source framework to conform OAI-PMH
(OCLC, 2011). M oreover, Dspace is also compatible and configured to use any crosswalk
plug-in to offer additional m etadata formats such as METS.

CNRI H andling system: In order to create a tenacious identifier for items uploaded to
DSpace, it has used CNRI handling technology. A Handle system is a technological
specification for assigning, m anaging and resolving a persistent identifier for digital objects
over the internet (Wikipedia, 2013). Under this specification Handle server runs under a
separate process and receives TCP requests from other servers and issues resolution requests
to a global server or servers if a Handle entered locally does not correspond to some local
content (Handle System, 2012).

Open URL Support: Dspace uses Open URL from SFX. Dspace with the help o f SFX
server m ay display an Open U R F link on every item page using Dublin Core metadata.
M oreover, Dspace can respond to the incoming Open URFs.

105

5.2.I.2.

Functional features

W here use o f open source technology m akes DSpace a complete open source solution for
creating digital library; the use o f distinctive specification, protocols, standards and
program ming m akes the workflow and function o f DSpace very user friendly and attractive.
The functional features provided by DSpace are analysed below in this Section.

Authentication and authorisation: A uthentication m eans verification o f users to identify
their rights in the repository. Users need to log in to use the repository and their rights over
the digital library. Adm inistrator can set the limits to various contributors in respect to access
o f communities and collections. A user who is not authorised or not logged in can access the
documents and serve the rights allotted to an anonymous user. M oreover an anonymous user
can register him to the repository and can access the rights allotted to an anonymous user;
however, the administrator can upgrade the rights o f him.

Similarly, the registered contributors (e-people) are m anaged through authorisation. The
admin can control the registered contributors in regards lim iting their rights to access the
features, collections and communities in the repositories. The administrator can also limit the
num ber o f items received from registered contributors and limit the size o f items to be
deposited into the repository.

Collection and communities: As discussed earlier, the central idea o f development o f
working module o f DSpace is ‘com m unities’, hence at the configuration point the
administration has to create the ‘com m unities’. ‘Com m unities’ is referred to the collections
and people. Adm inistrator creates communities and under communities several collections
are created. Similarly e-groups and e-people m ay also be created. The items submitted by the

106

contributors are submitted to the related collection o f the community. It helps to provide an
efficient browse feature at user’s end.

Flawless workflow: The workflow o f DSpace is based on the need o f the institution;
however, typically it is a combination of three flawless steps. Each collection in Dspace may
be assigned to e-groups or e-persons. If the collection is not assigned to any e-group or eperson then step 1 is skipped and step 2 and 3 are overruled in the absence o f step 1. W hen a
depositor submits a document to the repository, it goes to the e-group o f the collection where
it has been submitted. The group is notified and the group at step one m ay accept or reject the
submitted document. At step 2, the document is informed to another assigned e-group where
it can edit m etadata provided by the submitter with the item; however the content o f the
document cannot be edited. Here also e-group m ay reject the submission o f the item. At step
three again item is informed to assigned e-group for verification of m etadata and submission
to the repository. Submission cannot be rejected at this step; however the m etadata can be
edited. Figure 2.0 shows the workflow o f DSpace (2010).

A submitter can submit his document following seven simple steps in submission module.
The first three steps are related to the description and m etadata o f the document. At fourth

107

step contributor has to upload the document to the repository. Fifth step is verification of
submitted information and o f document while sixth step deals w ith the license information.
The submission completes at seventh step, from where it is forwarded to the e-group, to
which document is related for further process.

Optimized retrieval: the system in DSpace provides two ways retrieval, i.e., search and
browse o f items available in the repository. In search, it facilitates simple and Boolean logic
search. DSpace search retrieves items by searching keywords provided by searcher in the
Dublin Core or any other set o f m etadata used by the repository. On the other hand, through
browse, a user can browse the communities created under the repositories and subsequently
collection under any comm unity and an item in the collection.

Supports wide variety of documents: DSpace supports a huge range of formats in the
repository that helps in creating various types o f repositories such as Video, Audio, Picture,
M ultimedia, Text etc. M oreover, DSpace also allows the customisation to accommodate the
formats required as per the need o f an organisation.

Import and Export: DSpace includes the batch tools to import and export the whole data or
a collection o f a community. The data is exported in directory form where the m etadata is
stored in an XM L fde.

Statistics: Use and user statistics is an attractive feature of DSpace. Through this feature
various reports about the content and user o f the system can be generated by the system. The
reports include num ber o f items archived, num ber o f bit streams viewed, num ber o f item
pages viewed, num ber o f collection pages viewed, num ber o f user logins, num ber o f searches
made, most popular search, m ostly downloaded item, top country/city views, etc. (DSpace,
2010 ).

108

Others: In addition to the above features, DSpace has several other small features that are
very helpful for users and make the software very valuable. DSpace supports submission of
HTML documents to the repository. DSpace also provides support to the Creative Commons
licence to be attached to the repository. A submitter m ay use this license for the item
uploaded by him. W hen a user uses this option, a text document o f the creative commons
licence is attached w ith the document submitted by the submitter. DSpace has the RSS feeds
for the communities and the collections. W hen a user subscribes the RSS feed for a particular
community or collection, the user gets information through email on submission o f a new
document to that comm unity o f collection. M oreover, DSpace has inbuilt checksum checker
to verify if any document in the repository has not become corrupted or has been tampered
with.

DSpace is supported by various online forums. These forums have huge num ber of members
from every com er o f the w orld who are using DSpace. A ny new user who wishes to adopt
DSpace m ay get help o f these forums. In addition to DSpace software, its website also
provides complete m anual o f the DSpace that covers information from installation to
configuration and management. However, if an organisation wishes to have commercial
support for DSpace, there are wide num ber o f agencies that provide commercial support for
DSpace. A list o f registered technical support providers is available on DSpace website
(Dspace, n.d.).

DSpace is used by num erous libraries and organisations worldwide. It is upgraded at regular
intervals. The current version o f DSpace is 3.2 that was released on 24th July 2013.

109

5.2.2. Greenstone
Greenstone is w orld’s first open source and prominent digital library software. It was
developed in N ew Zeeland at University o f W aikato with the funding support o f UNESCO
and Hum an Info NGO, Belgium (Greenstone, 2012). The historical details o f Greenstone are
already discussed in Chapter IV. Greenstone is a suite o f software that provides a new way to
organize information and publish it on the Internet or on CD ROM (Greenstone, n.d.).The
aim of Greenstone is to enable users in libraries and other organisations to build their own
digital library. Figure 3.0 explains its data model (Trambu, 2012).

110

5.2.2.I.

Technical features

Am ong all open source digital library software, Greenstone m akes itself distinguished due to
the technology used by it and a host o f features it provides. The technical features of
Greenstone are discussed in this Section.

Truly open source software: Like m any other open source software, Greenstone also
follows a complete open source model. It is program med using Perl program ming language.
For web server it uses Apache open source server configured on JRE environment. To store
data it uses GDBM (GNU Database M anager) database. All these software are open source
software, hence do not attract any hidden or indirect costs.

Supports W indows: W hile m any open source software can be installed only on Linux,
Greenstone can be installed not only on Linux, but also on W indows platform. One can
install it on 32bit W indows system. It supports W indows XP, Vista and W indows 7.

User Interface: Greenstone works on Client Server technology. Clients can be installed on
Linux, Mac or W indows. Installation o f Client enables to submit the document from a remote
computer. It requires Java to install a client. However the public interface is web based and
does not require any specific application. Public interface can be accessed via any web
browser.

Single click installation: One o f its best technical features is its installation. The new version
o f Greenstone is bundled in a single software and it does not require long manuals for
installation o f Greenstone. Additionally, downloading various m atching version supporting
software is also not required as all supporting software are bundled in one. It is a single click
software. Greenstone is just a single exe file, one has to click it once and wait to complete its
installation.

I ll

M ultilingual: Greenstone is a m ultilingual software. It supports Arabic, Chinese, Czech,
Dutch, French, Galician, German, Hebrew, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Maori, English,
Russian, etc. languages. To add any o f these languages, one needs to provide a set of
language specific text fragments which does not require huge knowledge of Greenstone
(Witten, 2003).

Support to International standards: Greenstone is compatible with international standards
such as OAI-PMH, Z39.50, Dublin Core and other m etadata standards. Z39.50 helps to
import the m etadata o f digital documents from the other digital library.

Large scale database. Greenstone is designed in such a w ay that it can contain millions of
documents o f hundreds o f gigabyte size. Even if it is having a huge data uploaded in the
server the searching of the server does not get affected.

Supports plugins: Greenstone is developed presum ing that a num ber o f new formats m ay be
developed in the future and a document m ay be developed in a format which is not identified
by Greenstone. Hence, in Greenstone, plugins can be written to accommodate new types of
data.

5.2.2.2.

Functional Features

Using above m entioned technologies and supporting facilities, Greenstone provides
functional facilities that distinguish it from other digital library software. The functional
features o f Greenstone are analysed here.

M ultimedia: Greenstone supports a wide variety o f documents. The Greenstone collection
can contain textual documents, pictures, audio files, video files and a combination o f all of
these. Hence Greenstone can be very useful software to a variety o f institutions, for example,

112

video library, m ultim edia library, academic library, m edia library, etc. Greenstone also
enables to write plugin to identify other types o f documents which are not facilitated by
default.

Generates CD-ROM databases: This feature and function of Greenstone separates it from
other digital library software. This feature m akes it a complete digital library software as one
can also create CD-ROM based database. If a library wishes to create subject based collection
on CD-ROM, Greenstone provides this facility. The databases created by Greenstone can be
installed on any local computer and documents on it could be retrieved from here.

Flexible searching and browsing: Greenstone provides search as well as browse option. In
search it provides simple and advanced search. It also provides option to search a field or full
text o f document. In Browsing one can browse the collection through author, subject, title,
uploaded dates, etc. Browsing options can be selected at the time o f building collection.

Real time operation: N ew collection in Greenstone can be installed without bringing the
system down. Users who are online m ay also notice new ly installed collection instantly.

Supports various metadata formats: Greenstone supports a num ber o f m etadata formats
such as Dublin Core, RFC 1807, NZLS (New Zealand Govt. Location Service), AGLS
(Australian Government Locator Service) and m any more. These m etadata formats can be
used by the organisations as per their needs. M oreover, an organisation also can create their
own m etadata format by choosing and creating m etadata elements.

It facilitates the

organisation to manage various online databases such as video, audio, patent, newspaper
clippings and m ultim edia effectively.

W hat you see-what you get (W YSW YG): Greenstone is an open source digital library
software, available from the New Zealand Digital Library (ngdl.org) under the terms and

113

condition o f GNU General Public Licence. It includes everything discussed in this section
such as web access, capacity to generate CD-ROM based databases, etc. (W itten, Bainbridge,
& Boddie, 2001). It also provides an auto install feature for easy installation on W indows and
Linux.

Others: In addition to the above m entioned functional features, Greenstone provides various
small features such as it can be installed offline also. Being m ultilingual it is supported by
International communities in more than one language. It organises the document in
hierarchical form that one m ay browse the collection in hierarchical way. Greenstone also
facilitates distributed collections. Distributed collection means various collections installed
on various computers, which m ay be presented to the users in the same w ay and through a
single web page as a part of a single digital library.

Greenstone is supported by large community to provide technical assistance to its users
worldwide. It has forums, Wikis, m ailing lists, FAQs, user manuals, to support the users.
Additionally, there are also a num ber of online training program mes organised by its
developers and the comm unity to inform users the features o f Greenstone. M oreover, a
num ber o f conferences are also held to discuss Greenstone and workshops are conducted to
provide practical hands on training to it. In addition to all, commercial support for Greenstone
is also provided by a num ber o f vendors worldwide. Greenstone is used by a huge num ber of
organisations worldwide. The current version o f Greenstone is 2.86.

5.2.3. EPrints
EPrints is another digital library software on the lines of DSpace and Greenstone. It is yet
another highly used open source software for creating digital library after the above two.
Eprints took its way at Southampton University in 2000. The historical background o f EPrints

114

is discussed in Chapter IV.

Originally the development o f EPrints was supported by

Cogprints, and presently it is supported by Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) as a
part o f Open Citation Project. The technical features o f EPrints are as below:

5.2.3.I.

Technical features

Like m any other open source software, EPrints is also an open source application and is
distributed through the web without any cost and with liberty to modify, redistribute and
adapt as per the need. However there are several features that differentiate EPrints from other
open source digital library software. The technical features o f EPrints are as follows.

True Open source based on LAM P technology: EPrints is developed on the LAMP
architecture, how ever it is written on Perl instead o f PHP (EPrints, 2013). All software used
for EPrints are fully open source software and thus they do not attract any hidden or indirect
costs to adopt it. It is licensed under G N U ’s General Public Licence which is a prominent
licence for open source software.

Platform Independent: W ith a release in 2010 for W indows, EPrints has become a platform
independent software. N ow it can be installed on Linux, Mac or W indows. Linux is not a
must operating system for using EPrints. A user o f W indows operating system can also adopt
EPrints.

User Interface: Unlike Greenstone, EPrints provides web based interface not only for user
but also for the administrator that m akes it easy for the administrator to m anage the software
from any computer on LAN or on WAN.

Supports Plugins: Being written in Perl, it is very easy to write Plug-ins for EPrints. It also
supports third party plug-ins to get compatible with unknown formats.

115

Complies with International Standards: EPrints complies with international standards such
as OAI-PM H and various M etadata standards. Use o f these International standards makes
EPrints compatible with other software and increase the interoperability o f the software.

M ultilingual: EPrints has used Unicode thoroughly; hence it m ay allow use o f any language
consistently.

Export and import: EPrints facilitates bulk import and export of record in several formats
such as ASCII, BibTex, XM L, etc. that helps to create large collection easily.

5.2.3.2.

Functional Features

EPrints has a different working structure than that o f DSpace and Greenstone. The functional
overview o f EPrints is as follows:

Three user role: EPrints has its work flow around three m ajor roles, i.e., author, editor and
administrator (Beazley, 2010). A uthor has to submit his/her documents or papers, editor’s
role is to review the submission before publication through the repository and administrator
controls all back-end functions of the software that includes technical and functional
structure.

Supports wide variety of media: EPrints supports a variety o f formats such as PDF, JPEG,
TIFF, HTML, etc. Those formats which are not supported by default can be recognized by
using plug-ins.

Extended search option: EPrints provides extended search option that includes simple
search, field search, and full text search. A search in EPrints scans through each m etadata
type entered in the database. In addition to the search option, EPrints also provides browsing

116

facility through which one can browse the collection on the basis o f author, title, subject or
date o f submission.

Custom isable metadata: EPrints supports a num ber o f m etadata schemas such as Dublin
Core, METS, etc. In addition to this it also supports the customisation o f the m etadata that
facilitates the creation o f a m etadata by defining the elements as per the requirem ent o f the
organisation.

SHEPRA/RoM EO Integration: EPrints provides integration with SHEPRA/RoM EO for
quickly checking the publisher’s policies and author’s rights over the content submitted by
them (Beazley, 2010).

Others: In addition to the above functional features, EPrints has m any small features that
attracted the large comm unity to use it. EPrints provides RSS feeds for entire collection based
on the specific criteria decided by the administrator such as author, subject, etc. Having a web
interface has eased the end user submission to the repository. It supports Library o f Congress
Subject Heading for indexing and browsing of the collection.

At present EPrints has been reported in more than 270 organisations including British
Library, Harvard College, Australia National University, etc. Like other open source software
discussed above, EPrints also has a similar support. One m ay use the ready documents on
EPrints web site, EPrints forums available on the web or can use the option of commercial
support. A very active comm unity is working behind the EPrints for its consistent
development. The current version of EPrints is version 3.3.12 released on 24th July 2013
(EPrints, 2013a).

117

5.3.

Other open source software for libraries

In addition to open source library m anagement software and open source digital library
software, there are a num ber o f software available that can be used by a library. These
software include Content m anagement software, Journal m anagement software, etc. Engard
(2010) has listed a wide range of open source software in her book on practical open source
software. She has also listed the experience o f some libraries using those open source
software. Some categories o f open source software not discussed in the earlier sections that
m ay be very useful in libraries are discussed in this Section.

5.3.1. Open Source W eb OPAC (Online Public Access Catalogue)
W hen we say W eb OPAC, an OPAC bundled in library m anagement software reflects in our
mind. However, here the concern is not about the default W eb OPACs o f library management
software; open source web OPAC are the applications, integrated with W eb 2.0 features,
designed especially for converting the OPAC into a next generation W eb OPAC without
modifying the existing or default W eb OPAC application o f the library management
software. These applications provide an additional interface for the users to retrieve the
library resources with the help o f a third party application known as catalogue overlay system
or Catalogue 2.0. Some o f the very prominent such OPACs are Acquabrowser, Scriblio,
Yufind, SOP AC, Backlight, LibraryFind, Extensible catalogue, ObiblioOPAC for Joomla,
OPACIAL, Drupac etc. An extensive comparison o f m any o f these is done by Yangand
W agner (2010).These applications, however, are designed by using diverse structure and
means, but the objective is to provide a next generation catalogue. Few o f these are solely
cataloguing applications while others provides catalogue integration as a feature o f their m ain
application, how ever the m ain application is not a library integrated system. Some o f these
applications are used frequently by the libraries such as VuFind, LibraryFind, and Scriblio.

118

VuFind is a solely web catalogue application integrated w ith a num ber o f W eb 2.0 features
and was developed in V illanova University Library in 2007; however, it could detect only
four users by July 2009. Using VuFind with any ILS needs bit of program m ing if it is not
already supported by the ILS. The information on technical requirem ent for implementing
VuFind and information about the various features is available on project website o f V uFind9.

VuFind, like other open source software, is released under GNU General Public Licence and
available for download from its website. NewGenLib is program med to adopt V uFind that
makes integration o f VuFind w ith NewGenLib very simple. Koha can also be integrated with
it with little modification (Adara, 2011). Using VuFind will make the catalogue o f library
more advanced and dynamic.

LibraryFind10 is another open source application to make the library catalogue more technical
and attractive. It was developed by Oregon State University Library, U nited States in 2007.
LibrayFind also provides various W eb 2.0 features for information retrieval. Project site of
LibraryFind provides all required information for the installation o f this application on any
computer. However, there is lack o f documents providing information on integration of
LibraryFind with Koha, NewGenLib or any other library ILS.

Scriblio11, earlier known as W Popac, is the oldest open source OPAC with W eb 2.0
application developed in 2006 by Host Plymouth State University, United States. Scriblio is
fully based on W ordpress, the online content m anagement application. Scriblio not only
provides the library an opportunity to create a free website but also to integrate its OPAC
with this website. The detailed technical notes on installation and working of Sriblio are
available on its project Website.

11 h t tp : / /s c r i b l io . n e t

119

ObiblioOPAC for Joomla and Drupac are OPAC modules that can be integrated with Joomla
or Drupal to configure a web OPAC on a website designed on Joomla or Drupal. These
applications are rather simple than other applications as they are created in the form o f a
module. However, precondition for these applications is having Joomla or Drupal based
website.

Although above applications are just an add-in for the ILS, they require tedious procedures to
install and configure them with the ILS. This tedious procedures is one of the reasons for not
attracting a huge num ber o f users worldwide.

5.3.2. Open Source Content M anagem ent System
A content m anagement system (CMS) is a software providing ability to create a website with
dynamic features o f W eb 2.0 such as blog, RSS feed, discussion forum, surveys, wikies,
podcasts, etc. Content m anagement system is o f two types: web based and an offline
application. The W eb based content m anagement system lets the users not only to create
website but also hosts them at the real time while an offline application enables users to
create a website offline which the user can upload online by choosing host and registering
domain name o f his/her choice. Both types o f options are available through proprietary and
open source. However, free web hosting and domain name is not guaranteed in online content
management system. Hence, it is always favourable to create a website using offline
applications where users have the freedom to select the web hosting and domain name
vendors. In offline CMS, a huge num ber o f open source applications are available, however,

m aximum market than Joomla and Drupal due to its simplicity and ease. Joomla is on second
place while Drupal is on third as it is difficult than other two, although it is very high-tech
than others.

Joomla, Drupal and W ordpress, all three being open source, are developed on PHP and
MySQL. However, they dynamically differ in terms o f their capabilities and features.

W ordpress is the simplest CMS o f the three listed above. It was released in 2003 under
G N U ’s GPL license m aking it complete open source software. One can design a blog or a
website using W ordpress easily. However, those who wish to create more dynamic website
m ay prefer Joom la or Drupal. The project page o f W ordpress has enough num ber of
document to assist in its installation and using its modules. W ordpress enables users to handle
it from multiple points hence it is a m ulti-author CMS tool. It is a user friendly tool having a
plugin library to add various features in the website. A beginner m ay easily opt for it for
creation o f a library blog or a simple library website. There is also a service, i.e.,
W ordpress.com, where users not only can create websites but also host it free and get a free
domain name. The drawback o f W ordpress is its limitations. It has lim ited designs, limited
plug-ins and limited content m anagement capabilities that make W ordpress a good blog
creation tool but very basic CMS for the newbies. However, in terms o f use, W ordpress is at
the top of all three CMS. Some featured websites created w ith W ordpress are metro.co.uk
(Metro, Newspaper, UK), tv.msnbc.com, blogs.loc.gov/loc/ (Library o f Congress, blog),
library.plymouth.edu (Playmouth University, Library, lis.uncg.edu (University o f N orth
Caroline, Library), etc. A comprehensive list of m any other sites using W ordpress is given on
the project page o f W ordpress.

Joomla is another open source CMS and winner o f several awards for its wonderful features.
It was released in 2005 and is licensed under G N U ’s GPL, the open source license. The great

121

advantage o f using Joomla is its strong developer com m unity15 that is always ready to
support the users o f Joomla. Like W ordpress it is a user-friendly CMS tool that requires no
technical or program ing knowledge to handle it. However, having a technical knowledge is
always a benefit in creation o f any website or blog. Joomla is a more powerful tool than
W ordpress, having m any extension tools that include plug-ins, components, templates,
modules and languages. Joomla is also supported with a large num ber o f manuals for its
installation and m odular handling. The weakness o f the CMS is that one cannot start working
straight forward with Joomla, one needs to learn crunch o f it before working on it. However,
it helps one to develop a site which has more structural stability and content than Wordpress.
Some featured websites created with Joomla aregsas.harvard.edu (Harvard University),
statelibrary.sc.gov (South Carolina State Library), www.librarynext.com (LibraryNext,
India), etc.osu.okstate.edu (Oklahom a State University) and m any more can be explored on
Joomla project website.

Drupal is another prominent open source CMS that came into existence in 2001 with its
distribution under G N U ’s GPL license. Drupal is exceptionally powerful and developer
friendly CMS. It is very flexible to develop powerful blogs or a dominant website. It has
more features and possibilities than Joomla or W ordpress. Project page o f Drupal provides a
num ber of manuals to help in installation and working on Drupal. However, it requires more
expertise in using a CMS than Joom la and W ordpress. Drupal with a large num ber of
modules and themes m akes itself very useful for m aking websites with great features. The
current version o f Drupal is 7.23 released on 7th August 2013. Some featured websites that
developed using Drupal are thewhitehouse.gov (W hite House, USA), data.gov.uk (Govt, of
UK), science.mit.edu (MIT School of Science), library.unt.edu (University o f N orth Texas
Libraries), and college.du.ac.in (Acharya NarendraDev College, India), etc.

Although there are a num ber o f open source CMS available, but the three discussed above are
the m ost important and prominent o f all. Using any one o f these three m ay be useful in all
respects, i.e., security, documentation and support.

5.3.3. Open Source Journal M anagem ent and Conference M anagem ent Software
Public Knowledge Project16 is the developer of Open Journal System (OJS), Open
Conference System (OCS) and few other software. OJS is an open source software developed
with the objective to provide a solution to host and m anage all aspects o f publishing a
journals online such as call for paper, receiving manuscripts, forward them to editors,
resending to author for correction, peer review, publication o f an issue, and retrieving the
current or older issues and journals. OJS made each o f these works very easy and convenient.
Any organisation publishing a periodical can easily m anage all operation related to Journal
with OJS. It is an open source software released under G N U ’s SGPL license.

Open Conference System on the other hand, is another important software that is used
widely. A conference, symposium, workshop, etc. can be m anaged and handled w ith the help
o f OCS. OCS is compatible to handle every operation of a conference m anagement including
publication of conference paper. Like OJS, OCS is also released under G N U ’s GPL licence
that makes OCS an open source software. In addition to these two software, Public
Knowledge Project has developed Open M onograph Press (OMP) and Open Harvester
Software (OHS) designed on the basis o f OJS and OCS.

All these software are user friendly and can be installed on any platform. Installation o f these
software is easy. The manuals o f working on software are available on its project website.

5.4.

In Summation

The open source software has given the libraries a chance to provide the users the services
comparable to the libraries w ith huge economic and technological resources. Open source
software could be adopted at a very low cost without any vendor lock in and with the source
code. Then one can increase the innovation and adaptation o f the software by modifying the
source code o f the software. Open source software are imperative for any type o f library, i.e.,
academic, public or research. The philosophy o f open source software revolves around two
principles, viz., sharing and collaboration. These principles are very m uch acceptable and
adaptable in libraries too. Hence, the open source software and libraries are natural fit, as
both promote learning and understanding by dissemination o f information (Poynder, 2001).
Open source software come to libraries as exciting opportunities to fulfil the expectations,
roles and process which are critical to the library’s community o f patrons. These open source
software are available in m any categories as discussed in this chapter and hundreds o f other
categories which are important to an individual or organisation at any level. OSS in libraries
are available for every function that can embrace the quality of service provided by the
libraries. A library having a single computer with internet connection can easily adopt and
implement these open source software. Open source software does not require high license
fee or high configuration fee for the software implementation in the library. M oreover, open
source software also has the possibility to get the commercial services o f the vendors, if the
library is w illing to have it.

Open source software w ith these opportunities also pose some challenges forward. If an
organisation is not having techno savvy staff to implement these software then it m ay attract
a cost by hiring a vendor to implement it. Another challenge is that generally open source
does not offer the same kind of support as a proprietary software does. At the time o f any
error or bug libraries with proprietary software m ay easily call the vendor and get the

124

problem solved, but the case is not the same in case o f open source software. Here the person
dealing with the software has to solve the problem him self or herself. S/he has to rely fully on
the community forum o f the particular open source software which m ay take time to solve the
bug or error. Open source software can be a daunting game for those who are not having
program ming knowledge and confidence or are not techno savvy.

However, these challenges are no reason to not choose open source software, but just are the
challenges that need to be taken care of. These challenges can be faced even when a library
has commercial software. A library must select the software keeping these challenges in
mind. There are a num ber o f excellent open source software as discussed in this chapter
which are available and are endowed with tremendous features but a library need to keep in
m ind the resources available with it while choosing the software. If one chooses an open
source software keeping in m ind these challenges and the available resources (technical
expertise) then there can be no better alternative than open source software. The next chapter
deals with the optimum software m odel that a library can adopt.

CHAPTER VI

OPTIMUM OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE FOR A
LIBRARY: A MODEL

6.1.

Background

Preceding chapters o f this work dealt with the concept o f open source software and available
open source software in general and with reference to libraries in particular. The analysis
revealed

the availability o f a num ber o f open source software for libraries. However, a

library cannot not use all the software together; it has to select an appropriate and optimum
product suitable to the needs of that particular library. Selection o f the software for a library
has always been seen as a challenge. There are several research publications available that
deal with the criteria to keep in m ind while selecting an open source ILS or digital library
software for library.

Ram say and Chamberlain (2012) have developed a comprehensive

guide that focuses on the decision process in selecting an ILS for a library. They listed a huge
list o f features that should be taken into consideration while choosing an ILS for a library.
N abi Hasan (2009) discussed several challenges

in choosing an optimum ILS or digital

library software such as, operating system used in the organisation, capability o f software to
run over LAN or WAN, total cost o f implementation (direct or indirect), etc. Tristan M uller
(2011) did analysis o f 20 free and open source ILS for the library and came up with two
software as his recommendations. However, this analysis is based on standard ILS features
only and did not consider the technical skills and resources available with the library.

None o f the studies, discussed above or available in literature, proposes an appropriate model
o f open source software or any single software that could be accepted by any type o f library.
Actually, choosing and implementing an open source software is a very crucial step in library
automation. A n organisation invests a lot of time, if not money, in m aking it live, and if it is

128

done without a proper hom ework it m ay prove very expensive. The available studies just
explain a num ber o f criteria to be considered while going for an open source software or
evaluate the available open source software by one w ay or other, but none o f them suggests
any particular software out o f a num ber o f software available on the Web. M oreover these
studies completely miss out one most important criterion, i.e., resources available with the
library adopting any open source software. This chapter puts forward open source software
model for a new library that wishes to have its system automated. This model is created
considering the criteria of open source software selection and the presum ing minimum
financial and technical resources are available w ith the library. This m odel w ould be very
helpful for the libraries o f Indian and other countries that are willing to move to open source
software but do not have the financial resources and technical resources for evaluating and
selecting an optimum software. Additionally those libraries which have enough financial
resources w ould also be able to adopt this m odel to make the library services more dynamic.

6.2.

Basic Criteria

The financial and hum an resource situation o f the library should be the single m ost criterion
while selecting any open source software. Generally any study for selection o f open source
software misses out this criterion and concentrates on the features provided by the software.
But the m odel given here gives prim ary consideration to this criterion before considering the
features o f the software because the features of software are useless if the library adopting the
software is not able to use these feature for one or the other reason. The following conditions
are considered as the basic criteria for adopting the model suggested.

•

The m inim um requirem ent for this m odel to become operative is m erely a computer
with a decent internet connection. It is understandable that a library will think for
automation only if it is having these two things. The present m odel is suggested with

129

the presum ption that the library that wishes to move for an open source software is
having only the m inimum hardware package and does not have anything else.
•

The second consideration is the operating system used on the computer available in
the library. Although Linux is an open source software and available without any
charge; but W indows is used by m ore num ber o f users in home and office computers
including libraries. Hence, it is presum ed that the library that wishes to adopt an open
source software is having a W indows operating system on its computer.

•

The third consideration is availability o f technical expertise w ith the library. Here it is
presum ed that the library does not have expert personnel in computer software and the
library staff is just computer literate to use the computer to get their work done on
computer without having m uch o f technical expertise. It is further presum ed that even
the parent organisation o f the library does not have IT experts in the organisation.

•

The forth consideration is regarding the availability o f financial resources. It is
presum ed that the organisation is not in a condition to spend huge funds on library to
purchase an expensive software or to pay annual maintenance cost (AMC) to m aintain
an open source software.

After considering the above conditions, which actually are the ground realities in our country
for most o f the libraries, the features of suggested open source software are considered. The
library open source software m odel presented here m ainly consists o f two software one o f
which is ILS and another is institutional repository software/digital library software. However
this m odel also suggests other open source software for m anaging online journals and other
electronic content but such

software are useful for the libraries having more than the

m inimum conditions discussed above as these software definitely require more funds and
expertise to make optimum use o f them.

130

6.3.

Open Source Software for Libraries: an Optimum Model

This m odel as discussed above includes the basic software for a library, i.e., an ILS and a
digital library/institutional repository software. However the basic need for a library is an ILS
but a digital library software is also important to host the scholarly articles by the staff o f the
institution and dissertations and theses by the students. In addition to these two software
presented, this model also includes some other additional software that m ay be helpful for the
library such as a content m anagement software and a software to host a journal or a
conference.
6.3.1. M ost Suitable Optimum Open Source ILS: NewGenLib (NGL)
Under the category o f open source integrated library systems, NGL is m ost optimum and
adoptable in every type o f library. There are a num ber o f reasons to justify N G L as the most
optimum software for any type o f library. Firstly if we consider the evaluation criteria most
o f the studies prefer Koha and Evergreen while the studies done in the last two years have
increased the option by including NGL. The reason behind this is that in the last two years
NGL has emerged as a strong competitor o f Koha and Evergreen. A num ber o f studies from
India has recom m ended NGL (Giri, 2012; Singh K. , 2013; Singh & Sanaman, 2012).NGL
more or less has all features and modules provided by Koha and Evergreen. The details o f the
modules o f these software are already given in Chapter Y,

hence that will not be repeated

here. A perusal o f these features reveal that its features are no less than K oha’s although
Koha is recom mended by more studies than NGL. The reason o f it is that Koha was released
long before NGL. However, the present m odel recom mends adoption of NGL.

The m ajor reason to give weightage to NGL over Koha is the first basic criteria m entioned
above, i.e., it is fully applicable in any type o f library with or without finance, with one or

131

more computers and with m inim um technical expertise. The details o f the reason to
recom m end N G L are as following.

Platform independent: N G L is a platform independent software, i.e., it can be installed not
only on Linux but also on W indows or any other platform. Koha, which is recom mended by
m ajority o f studies, is based on Linux only and cannot be installed on W indows. However, a
version o f Koha was developed for W indows but it could not grow well and stagnated with
its last version 2.2.9 released in 2009. In fast growing technological era it is not
recom mended to go w ith a product which is not developing in real sense o f the term. Also
version 2.2.9 is good for circulation and cataloguing only. Other version which is still
developing is Linux based and is difficult for those who are not familiar w ith Linux operating
system. It is a well-known fact that m ost o f the computer users prefer and are comfortable
only with W indows platform. Although installation o f Koha is eased w ith the help for live
CD but still it needs enough knowledge o f Linux to work on it. NG L is preferable due to its
compatibility with W indows platform too.

Free live support from developers: NG L is the only software that provides free live support
to the libraries opting for NGL or who wish to adopt it. The NGL team has started a NGL
adaptation program under which they help the libraries to install the software. M oreover, they
provide an online training through which users can get informed about the practical use of
NGL. As a general practice NGL provides live support to the libraries using NGL, in case
they face any problem or bug. Any issue of the library can be resolved by NGL team using
desktop sharing tools such as Team Viewer and/or Ami Admin. Thus, NGL is recom mended
to the libraries looking for a suitable software or want to move from their present software.
Although like NGL, Koha also has several sources to provide the help to install and learn the
software,

but there are no live help available from the developer or any agency free o f cost.

132

Users o f Koha need to depend on available forums and documentations or they have to opt
for commercial option for live support. Hence NGL is more effective and reliable for this
reason also.

Free Data Conversion: Another m ajor reason to recom m end NGL is its free data conversion
service. It not only helps the libraries that want to adopt NGL as their first library automation
software, but it also helps the libraries to migrate from on library autom ation software to
another library autom ation software. If a library is already running on a library m anagement
software and wants to migrate to NGL, the NGL team will help the library to m igrate their
existing data in NGL. There are no charges for it. If a library has m aintained their catalogue
in M icrosoft Access or Excel, then also NGL team will convert the data into needed format to
make NGL running in the library. Such support will save huge time to enter data in software
and in no time whole catalogue can be automated. In case o f Koha there is no such free
service. The library has only one way, i.e., to hire a commercial vendor to convert the data
into Koha format; as this w ould incur additional cost there is a possibility that the parent
organization m ay not allow this.

User Friendly: A nother reason to recom m end N G L is its simple user interface. Using NGL
is very user-friendly and does not require very special skills. Even MARC format of
cataloguing is sim plified in such a m anner that it does not pose any confusion in the m ind of
a cataloguer. A num ber o f templates are preconfigured to save time and efforts o f the
cataloguer. If it is compared with Koha, NG L cataloguing module is m uch more simplified
than Koha where a cataloguer needs to have full knowledge o f MARC tags for cataloguing of
books. M oreover, in Koha, a wide num ber o f configurations are required while NGL is fully
preconfigured and just requires filling basic configurations which varies from library to
library.

133

Continuous development: Yet another essential reason to recom m end NGL is its continuous
development. NGL Team is continuously working on the features o f the software. They come
with a new version in every 45 days. The continuous development is recom m ended for any
Software. This consistent advancement m akes the debugging o f errors o f last version faster
and easier.

Features: Koha is very well known open source software and has very advanced features in
comparison to Evergreen. However, NG L has grown over the time with continuous
development and competes well with Koha. . Features in both Koha and NGL are advanced.
The users of NGL m ay not find any deficiency when it is compared with Koha. It has
m aximum features o f Koha and m any other advanced features which are not available even in
Koha. Some o f these are, W eb 2.0 enabled catalogue, SMS service to users on book issue and
return and digital library capacity. In addition to these, there are a num ber of functionality
which m akes NGL more powerful software in comparison to

Koha. Hence features o f NGL

compete well with K oha and also have an edge over it owing to the reasons m entioned above
and can be accepted in any library.

W hen we consider the above criteria, it becomes very easy to understand that NGL is more
compatible for an average library functioning under the presum ptions made above. Not only
those libraries which are technologically or financial weak but the libraries with strong
financial and technical support can also adopt NGL as their library m anagement system.
Thus, in library m anagement system NGL is recom m ended over Koha. NGL can be adopted
by the libraries without any fear and trouble.

134

6.3.2. M ost Suitable Open Source Digital Library Software: DSpace
Under the category o f open source digital library software three software are prominent they
are DSpace, Greenstone and EPrints. If we consider the features as discussed in the preceding
chapter, none of these is complete or can satisfy every need of every user. All these software
have their own specifications and features that cannot be substituted by other digital library
software. However, according to Registry o f Open Access Registries (n.d.), DSpace is
dominating all other digital library software with 1383 registered repositories out o f 2893
total registered repositories. M ajority o f the experts also suggests DSpace as their first
preference (Kumar, 2009; Trambu, 2012; Lai & Prasad, 2013; Kokorceny & Bodnarova,
2010). For the purpose o f this m odel also DSpace is suggested as the m ost suitable software
over greenstone and EPrints. Greenstone, on the other hand provides a single click
installation and has the ability to enable users to create CD ROM based database for their
libraries. However, in overall evaluation o f digital library software DSpace is found more
suitable.

The m ajor reason to consider DSpace is its simple workflow and platform independency.
DSpace can be installed on any platform whether W indows or Linux, 32bit or 64bit. It also
provides a very simple workflow that does not take m uch time to understand. It provides step
by step workflow which a user can follow easily. The details of the features dominating
Greenstone and Eprints are discussed below.

User Interface: DSpace provides a very simple single web interface for admin and user.
Admin, after login to the account, can access all o f his rights while other user m ay enjoy the
rights o f a user. From this interface user can search and browse the collection while admin
can add communities and collections.

Platform Independent: DSpace is platform independent and can be installed on any
platform while Greenstone cannot be installed on 64 bit W indows system and EPrints is
prim arily m ade for Linux though it has started development on W indows too.

Simple workflow: The workflow of DSpace is one which is most competitive among all
digital library software. It provides very simple workflow w hich does not require very rigours
training to understand. The functionalities o f DSpace is very simple to work on and
applicable in any library.

Simple object management: DSpace provides an easy and simple object management
system. The object display is decided during the workflow only. Greenstone on the other
hand requires program ming to manage the object information display. To display information
in a proper way administrator requires creating a tag using program ming skills.

Access Control: Access control feature o f DSpace is unique in all digital library software.
DSpace has a concept of people and group which are created by administrator and assigned
powers to upload the documents into the collection. The access is provided through password
X509 certificates and LDAP. Greenstone is lim ited to two predefined groups, i.e.,
administrator and collection builder. In EPrints registered users can create and edit objects.

DSpace is a suitable digital library m anagement software that m ay fulfil all general needs o f
an institution such as collecting and preserving the articles o f the staff, dissertations o f the
students and other documents. However, there are also some challenges. Lirst the installation
o f DSpace is not as simple as Greenstone. Greenstone provides a single click installation
whereas DSpace requires installation o f a series o f programs to make DSpace operable on the
computer. Secondly, to install DSpace an internet connection is required. During installation
o f DSpace some components are required to be downloaded from the Internet as installation

136

process. Third, DSpace cannot create offline CD ROM based databases that Greenstone can
do. And lastly if an organisation needs to deal with various kind o f documents such as patent,
newspaper cuttings, diverse category o f videos where different m etadata format is required
one m any choose Greenstone. However, overall DSpace is the best option for those libraries
which do not have specific objectives.

6.3.3. Other Optional Open Source Software
However a library having m inimum resources requires only an ILS to run in the library. Only
when the librarian is m ore active the library m ay go for a digital library software. The
combination o f these two software, i.e., NGL and DSpace m ay be called a complete model
for a library. However, in this digital age libraries have to go beyond the traditional concepts
o f library and have to get involved in a num ber o f activities which demands additional tools
rather than just ILS and DLS. The libraries today are hosting and m anaging online journals
and run their own CMS to provide information to users. M any librarians, to have a proper
management and updating, wish to make a website themselves and m any others who are
hosting online journals wish to do the same. Those who wish to do this m ay opt for the
following software for satisfying their needs.

6.3.3.I.

Open Source Publishing and Review M anagem ent Software: Open Journal
System

Open Journal System (OJS) is the best open source journal m anagement software.

It

provides a complete solution for publishing an electronic journals as well as carrying peer
review process. The installation o f OJS is very simple and does not pose any difficulties to
the users of the software. The software and relevant documents on working o f OJS are
available on its project site, i.e.,www.pkp.sfii.ca.

137

6.3.3.2.

Open Source Content M anagement System (CMS)

In this category, it is difficult to suggest and single CMS that m ay fulfil all requirem ent o f the
user. CMS m ay be used as a process o f learning. Those who are at initial stage m ay use
W ordpress which is most simple and able to do all to make a website w ith blog. But as the
need raises one can move from W ordpress to Joomla and from Joom la to Drupal. Drupal is
most sophisticated CMS software having a num ber o f modules. If a librarian has some
technical expertise and courage to handle some levels of difficulties m ay opt for Joom la or
Drupal directly. One who opts for Drupal will be able to do all the jobs with Drupal and a
num ber o f free modules are available for it. Installation o f all three is simple. Installation and
other m anuals are available on their respective project sites. More details o f these can be
found in Chapter Y o f this research report.

6.4.

In Summation

Open source software are o f great benefit to the libraries and the individuals. The need is of
just identifying and selecting the correct one out o f a num ber of OSS available. At the time of
selection o f software, besides considering its features, one must take care o f the available
resources to adopt the OSS. This model, i.e., NGL for ILS and DSpace for DLS is presented
keeping in m ind the m inimum requirements, m inim um availability o f resources and use of
Operating Systems. However, it does not m ean that those who have enough finance m ay not
go for this model or the m odel is having less features. The OSS model suggested here carries
almost all features which are generally found in a commercial software. For example, DSpace
which is a suggestion o f this model is used widely by the libraries to build their digital
libraries. In ILS, Koha is used by wide num ber o f organisation worldwide while the
suggestion o f this m odel is NewGenLib. Such a suggestion is being made because although
Koha is the oldest library m anagement software and popular worldwide, but its W indows

138

version has stagnated w ith its last version 2.2.9 released in 2009.

W hereas, NGL is new

software developed in India itself. NewGenLib is now attracting the libraries worldwide and
feature wise it is very competitive to Koha, with the additional benefit o f its platform
independency.

These two software have the ability to manage a library as well as to create a digital library.
However, those who w ish to go beyond this by creating a website and launching an online
journal m ay opt for OJS and W ordpress to fulfil their objectives.

This chapter on optimum m odel o f open source software fulfils the third objective of the
present study. It is hoped that this m odel will help the libraries not only in selecting open
source Integrated Library Software and Digital Library Software but also in going m uch
beyond.

CHAPTER VII

OPEN ACCESS MOVEMENT: AN ANALYSIS OF ITS
DEVELOPMENT AND IMPACT ON LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES

7.1.

Background

Invention o f printing press in 1440 by Johannes Gutenberg m ust have given relief to billions
o f people who have been aware of the destruction o f knowledge in the form o f handwritten
manuscripts in various conflicts. Some o f these unforgettable events are Burning o f Nalanda
University library and burning handwritten manuscripts during Hussite crisis. “Dharm
Ganga” in 1193 by M uslim invaders. This library was very huge and contained thousands o f
volumes o f precious handwritten manuscripts in three buildings. The Persian historian,
M inhaj-i-Sirajin, in his chronicle the Tabaquat-I-Nasiri reported that “the burning o f the
library continued for several m onths and smoke from the burning manuscripts hung for days
like a dark pall over the low hills” (Nair, 1987). Similarly, in early 1400s during Hussite
crisis, about 200 manuscripts were burned with the order o f authorities o f the kingdom
(Butler, 1997). It is definitely impossible to bring those manuscripts back which were
destroyed in such events, but invention o f printing press gave hum anity a chance to create
multiple copies of a single work and so that the work m ay be available for hum anity forever.
However, invention of printing press proved a m ajor relief as it made it possible to create
multiple copy o f a single work and to keep it long lasting. The most immediate effect o f this
invention was the production o f greater num ber o f books at a more reasonable price to the
common man.

141

However, this free flow o f book production could not go for long as a series o f Copyright
Acts started throughout the world. By 1886 these laws were implem ented at international
level through Bem e Convention. TRIPS (Trade Related aspects o f Intellectual Property
Rights) o f 1995 and W CT (WIPO Copyright Treaties) o f 1996 were extended forms of
copyright laws providing more protection to the creator of intellectual property. Though,
there are some relaxations in these laws for academic purposes, but no provision for free or
open access. A very important notice in the development o f copyright is that before India
singed the W TO treaty, we had a patent law which did not permit application of a patent for
medicine and food, but, after signing these treaties, India was compelled to change its Patent
Act and made m edicine and food patentable just to comply with the provisions o f the W TO
treaty.

Science and technology also developed after renaissance and the inventions were protected
by Patent laws; at the same time the writings on such research were also protected by
copyright laws. The research results were published in the form o f scholarly journals since
1665 with Journal de Scavans (5 January, 1665) and Philosophical Transactions of Royal
Society (6 March, 1665). Since then four things have kept increasing day by day, first
research results, second publication o f scientific journals containing research papers, third
copyright protection to these journals, fourth and m ost importantly cost o f journals.
Increasing cost not only compelled the institutions to reduce the num ber o f subscribed
journals to cope with the available budget, but also narrowed down the circulation of results
o f research done in various fields. This, in addition to the invention o f Internet and W W W,
made people to think about open access.

142

7.2.

Scholarly Publishing

Scholarly publications in the form of periodicals started with the initiation o f scientific
journals, ‘Journal de Scavans’ and ‘Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society’ in the
17thcentury. Since then, these have become the first choice of researchers and scientists for
publishing their research results. In next 340 years, a num ber o f organizations throughout the
globe were prom pted to run thousands o f quality scholarly journals. But an explosion of
scholarly publication was seen only by 19th century prom pted by increasing specialisation
and diversification o f scientific and academic research and also low-cost publication using
cheap wood pulp based paper

(Yalauskas, 1997). Some o f the publishers emerged as

typhoons o f the scholarly publication industry that covered a big part o f global scholarly
publications. Today, around 2000 periodical publishers are a part o f journal publishing
industry, but the top three journal publishers, viz. Elsevier, Springer-Kluwer and W illyBlackwell, account for approxim ately 42% of all published journal articles and no other
publisher accounts for more than 3% share o f journal publication market (M cGuigan &
Russell, 2008).

The concern here is not the holding of journal publishing market by few journal publishers,
but the consistently increasing cost o f journal subscription resulting into serial crisis. This
serial crisis has compelled almost every organization o f the w orld either to cut in the num ber
o f journal subscription or to increase the budget involved in the journal subscription.

7.3.

Serial Crisis and Journal Pricing

143

The unfailing increase in journal subscription cost led to the coining o f a new term, ‘Serial
crises’. The journal subscription cost has constantly escalated during last 30-40 years.
Statistics from some of the reputed organizations in the w orld are very shocking and
surprising. The statistics from ARL (Association of Research Libraries) show that during
i986-2006 the ARL mem bers m anaged to increase their budget by 321 % while increase in
serial num ber subscribed during this period was slightly ahead than what they had in 1986,
i.e., 51%, whereas the growth in the unit cost o f a periodical was observed 180% (Kyrillidou
& Young, 2008, p. 13).

Not only this, but in 2003, well reached universities such as Harvard, Cornell, California,
Duke, MIT, and several others cancelled their Elsevier subscriptions or dropped their
subscriptions to hundreds o f journals (Willinsky, 2006). Elsevier is considered as the costliest
journal publisher in the publishing industry. In 2002, it accounted for 50% o f the University
o f California’s online serial budget, although its titles accounted for only 25% o f total
subscription (Willinsky, 2006). W illinsky has given detailed account o f journal subscription
in his book The Access principle. In a recent newspaper article by fan Sample, published in
the Guardian, he reported that the Harvard University also cracked to sustain the
subscriptions o f paid journals (Sample, 2012). The article reported;

A m emo from Harvard Library to the university's 2 ,i0 0 teaching and research staff
called for action after warning it could no longer afford the price hikes imposed by
m any large journal publishers, which bill the library around $3.5m a year.
The extraordinary move thrusts one o f the world's wealthiest and m ost prestigious
institutions into the centre o f an increasingly fraught debate over access to the results
o f academic research, m uch o f which is funded by the taxpayer.
The outcome o f Harvard's decision to take on the publishers will be watched closely
by m ajor universities around the w orld and is likely to prompt others to follow suit.
The m emo from Harvard's faculty advisory council said m ajor publishers had created
an "untenable situation" at the university by m aking scholarly interaction "fiscally

144

unsustainable" and "academically restrictive", while drawing profits of 35% or more.
Prices for online access to articles from two m ajor publishers have increased 145%
over the past six years, with some journals costing as m uch as $40,000, the memo
said.
M ore than 10,000 academics have already joined a boycott of Elsevier, the huge
Dutch publisher, in protest at its journal pricing and access policies. M any university
libraries pay m ore than h alf o f their journal budgets to the publishers Elsevier,
Springer and Wiley.
Robert Dam ton, director o f Harvard Library told the Guardian: "I hope that other
universities will take similar action. We all face the same paradox. W e faculty do the
research, write the papers, referee papers by other researchers, serve on editorial
boards, all o f it for free ... and then we buy back the results o f our labour at
outrageous prices.
"The system is absurd, and it is inflicting terrible damage on libraries. One year's
subscription to The Journal o f Comparative Neurology costs the same as 300
monographs. We simply cannot go on paying the increase in subscription prices. In
the long run, the answer will be open-access journal publishing, but we need
concerted effort to reach that goal."
In traditional journal publishing, researchers submit articles to editors who send them
out for peer review, a task that is usually unpaid. The final versions of the articles are
then formatted and sold back to university libraries. Open access comes in various
guises, but one model requires authors to pay to have their articles published and
made freely available to anyone.
According to the Harvard memo, journal subscriptions are now so high that to
continue them "would seriously erode collection efforts in m any other areas, already
compromised". The m em o asks faculty m em bers to encourage their professional
organisations to take control o f scholarly publishing, and to consider submitting their
work to open access journals and resigning from editorial boards o f journals that are
not open access.
It adds that the library must insist on transparent contracts that prevent universities
from discussing in public the fees they pay certain publishers.” (Sample, 2012)
“The answer will be open access publishing” the hope o f the Harvard University researcher is
the hope o f the whole world. The libraries throughout the w orld face a similar situation.
Smaller libraries somehow manage to subscribe m inim um journals. However the amount
invested by them m ay be very useful for providing other facilities to their users. Commercial
journals must be substituted with open access journals but this requires unity o f research
scholars worldwide.

145

So such voices from affluent libraries like Harvard Library do make an impact on the
thinking o f other libraries and information professionals. Further, it was hoped that the
transform ation from print to online will reduce the subscription cost to a considerable level.
M oreover, Steven H am ad after launching his free online journal ‘Psychoquy’ with the
sponsorship of Am erican Psychological Association in 1989, observed the difference of
costing in print publication and online publication (Okerson & O'Donnell, 1995):

“If we charged PSYCOLOQUY's readership (now estimated at 40,000) their share of
the true costs, they w ould have to pay 25 cents per year (down from 50 cents a couple
o f years ago, as the readership grew and costs actually shrank; and thanks in part also
to centralized subscriber-list handling at EARN, m uch o f it automatized, as well as to
developments such as gopher and world-wide web, which are rapidly replacing the
subscriber m odel by the browser m odel altogether in electronic publication).”
(Okerson & O'Donnell, 1995)
A nd he claimed

“M y claim that the true per-page cost o f electronic publication will be 25% o f current
per-page paper costs rather than the 75% that has been quoted over and over, has been
challenged and I have attempted to support m y estimate above.”
(Okerson & O'Donnell, 1995)

But online publishing did not make real differences even in online m odels, rather it put
forward other purchase m odels also, such as pay per view and bundled subscription licensing.
Pay per view is generally m eant for the researchers who wish to purchase or download a
particular journal article. The costing of this option is too high for an individual purchaser. A
newspaper article by George M onbiot (2011) published in The Guardian, stated the following
in this concern:

Reading a single article published by one of Elsevier's journals will cost you $31.50.
Springer charges €34.95, W iley-Blackwell, $42. Read 10 and you pay 10 times. And
the journals retain perpetual copyright. You want to read a letter printed in 1981?
That'll be $31.50.

146

O f course, you could go into the library (if it still exists). But they too have been hit
by cosmic fees. The average cost o f an annual subscription to a chemistry journal is
$3,792. Some journals cost $10,000 a year or m ore to stock. The m ost expensive I've
seen, Elsevier's Biochimicaet Biophysica Acta, is $20,930. Though academic libraries
have been frantically cutting subscriptions to make ends meet, journals now consume
65% o f their budgets, which m eans they have had to reduce the num ber o f books they
buy. Journal fees account for a significant component of universities' costs, which are
being passed to their students. (Monbiot, 2011)

Hence, it is very difficult for an individual to pay such a huge amount for reading a single
journal article. At the same time, libraries also find it challenging to subscribe scholarly
journals especially in the field of Science, Technology and M edical Sciences, when the costs
are rising steadily. Increasing cost o f journal is resulting in constant decrease in the num ber
o f journal titles subscribed by the libraries. This situation is mounting the problem o f serial
crisis all over the world. Some o f the Journal publishers quote the increase in peer review
process o f the articles as a reason for this rise. But the article reports the profit of journal
publishers and publishing norms:

The returns are astronomical: in the past financial year, for example, Elsevier's
operating profit m argin was 36% (£724m on revenues o f £2bn). They result from a
stranglehold on the market. Elsevier, Springer and Wiley, who have bought up m any
o f their competitors, now publish 42% o f journal articles.

M ore importantly, universities are locked into buying their products. Academic papers
are published in only one place, and they have to be read by researchers trying to keep
up with their subject. Dem and is inelastic and competition non-existent, because
different journals can't publish the same material. In m any cases the publishers oblige
the libraries to buy a large package o f journals, whether or not they want them all.
Perhaps it's not surprising that one o f the biggest crooks ever to have preyed upon the
people of this country - Robert M axwell - made m uch o f his m oney through
academic publishing. (Monbiot, 2011)
M oreover, in most of the cases peer review is a process where authors submit their article to
the editors, who review the article, it is a job which is m ostly unpaid. But m any a time,
authors are required to pay a publishing fee to get their article published in the journals.

147

Subscribing scholarly journals is an unavoidable requirem ent for academic and research
institutions to disseminate the result of research done throughout the world. The profit of the
publishing industries seems very high in an environment where the whole w orld is passing
through inflation crisis. Sonya W hite and Claire Creaser (2007) in their report, regarding
increasing price o f journals, put forward some eye opening facts through their research which
are as follows:

>

A m edian price of Elsevier biomedical journals was £859 in 2006 while the same of
Oxford University Press was £198.

>

In this period a price rise for biomedical journal was observed to the extent o f 104%.
Per page price rise increase was £1.06 which is about 75%.

>

A m edian price rise in social science journal was observed to 120% for the period of
six years, i.e., 2000-2006. A nd the price rise for per page was 91%.

This report was supported by Oxford University Press and included the period o f only six
years. Being supported by a journal publisher, the research m ay have carried out from the
publisher’s perspective but still the statistics o f price rise are unbearable for an academic
library which has a very lim ited budget.

This price rise during the last four decades drew the attention of a num ber o f scholars which
resulted in production o f several articles related to price hike in scholarly publishing. Lloyd
Davidson (1989), Life Science librarian o f N orth W estern University, finds that “the cost of
journals these days has risen m uch faster than the cost-of-living index. This has forced m any
institutions, including mine, to begin cancelling all those journals which are at all peripheral
to the m ajor research areas we serve.”

The crisis in scholarly publication not only has devastating effects on academic and other
libraries, but also has m ade it more difficult for researchers to carry out their research. Open

148

access is now the only way to fight the monopolies o f scholarly publishing industries and to
provide bondless access to research result, which is m ostly carried out using public funds.

7.4.

Journey towards Open Access: A Historical Analysis

A movem ent does not start at a jerk but takes ages and ages to be formed. A m ovem ent is the
result of an idea that comes into the m ind o f a person. The idea spreads and collects
supporters and oppositions. If the idea is based on ‘Public good’ then it m ay get huge
popularity. If this popularity o f idea inspires the w orld to form organisations to carry on this
idea, then it m ay be term ed as a movement. The history is full o f such m ovements like the
Independence m ovem ent o f India, Dalit M ovement, Feminist M ovement and m any more.
Open access m ovem ent is one o f such m ovem ents which is based on ‘public good’ and is in
its initial phase.

Though open access m ovem ent traces its formal history to Budapest Declaration in 2002, it
has a long informal base, which took open access to a worldwide movement. Some o f the
reasons have been discussed above, i.e., exorbitant increase in journal price and monopolies
o f journal publishers. Other includes the aspiration o f people to make the knowledge o f the
world within the reach o f every individual o f the globe. A nd these wishes could come true
when Internet and W orld W ide W eb have come into existence.

The pioneering effort to make full text in open access was made by M ichael Hart, the founder
o f Project Gutenberg. He was credited to create the first e-book in 1971 through his ‘Project
Gutenberg’. Its m ission was “to break down the bars o f ignorance and illiteracy” (Hart &

149

Newby, 2004). M ichael Hart invested his life time earnings, i.e., around $100 m illion in
making e-books available on Internet through Project Gutenberg, which now has a collection
o f more than 30,000 e-books in 60 languages available for people without any restrictions.
Although the collection was of copyright free books, but it was an effort to make books
within the access o f people without charging any download or reading fee which is the m ain
objective o f open access movement.

During late 80s, researchers and library professionals had already started to talk alternative
ways o f scholarly journals. They were worried about the constantly increasing price of
scholarly journals. Peggy Johnson (1990) discussed about price rise o f serials and some
solutions to avoid it. The suggestions include self-publication or journal by institutions and to
avoid submitting articles to high cost journals (Johnson, 1990). During these days, in 1979,
George Soros founded Open Society Foundation to pursue his ambitions of establishing open
societies in place o f authoritarian forms of government (Open Society Foundation, 2010).

In 1987, first free peer reviewed journal was observed when research students of N ova South­
eastern University, Florida, launched 'N ew Horizons in A dult E ducation’ through their
network Adult Education Network (ADENET) (Nova Southeastern University, 1987).
Presently this journal is m anaged by Florida International University. The journal is renam ed
'New Horizons in Adult Education and Human Resource D evelopm ent’ (Florida International
University, 2006). Psycologuy was another free journal published in 1989 and started peer
review process in 1990. Psycoloquy as m entioned earlier was sponsored by Am erican
Psychological Society and launched by Steven H am ad (Okerson & O'Donnell, 1995). In the
same Year, University o f Houston launched another free journal nam ed The Public-Access
Computer Systems Review under the editorship of Charles W. Bailey (W ikipedia, 2012). The
year 1989 also observed the launch o f New sletter o f Serial Pricing Issues which fire the talk

150

on serial crisis and issues o f price increase in scholarly journals. A fter 1989, every year
observed inauguration o f at-least one free electronic journal.

A big milestone in Open Access came in 1991, when Paul Ginsparg started an online archive
for Physicist, i.e., XXX.lanl.gov. It was an institutional repository o f Los Alamos National
Laboratory developed with an objective to save the articles submitted by the scientists o f the
organisation to a common place instead o f m ailing to individuals. In 1998, it was renam ed to
arXiv.org. The access to the archive is totally free and is accessible to

every individual, who

wishes to access it. The arXiv.org received a huge success and appreciation from scientists in
every com er o f the world. This success caused the expansion o f arXiv to m any other
scientific subjects such as mathematics, astronomy, computer science, statistics and m any
more. Presently it has a huge collection o f approxim ately 100000 articles. In 1993, George
Soros, Founder o f Open Society Foundation, established Open Society Institute under his
foundation Open Society Foundation.

The year 1997 made the concept o f free distribution o f information more strong w ith the
establishment o f CogPrint by Stevan H am ad and Research Papers in Economics (RePEc).
This year also m arks the establishment o f PubM ed, which made M edline free w ith its
amalgamation with PubMed.

Around the same time Scientific Electronic Library Online

(Silo) was launched by Sao Paulo Science Foundation to strengthen free distribution o f health
information and research.

The next was the launch o f Scholarly Publishing and Academ ic R esearch Coalition (SPARC)
program m e by A m erican Research Libraries (ARL) in 1998. SPARC claims itself to be “correcting
the im balance in the scholarly publishing system ” (SPARC, 2007). It is an alliance o f 222 academic
and research libraries to set the im balance correct w hich has resulted in escalating the prices o f

151

scholarly journals and making it difficult to the scholarly community to access and use it. According
to this program “At the core o f SPARC's m ission is the belief that these imbalances inhibit the
advancement o f scholarship and are at odds with fundamental needs o f scholars and the
academic enterprise” (SPARC, 2007). Presently SPARC is running several blogs, newsletter
and organising other programmes such as access conferences, international meets, etc. on
open access.

By 1999, a num ber o f Institutional and subject repositories had emerged. At the same time a
project to develop open source digital repository software was being carried out at
M assachusetts Institute o f Technology (MIT) with the help o f Hewlett-Packard (HP). The
existed repositories were facing a num ber of problem s with e-print servers, diversity in
formats of archives and requirem ent o f cross platform searching for articles in various
repositories. M ost prominent repositories at this time were, arXiv.org providing access to
physics, mathematics, computer science, etc.; cogPrints for psychology, linguistics and
neuroscience; RePEc providing access to literature in the field o f economics and N etworked
Digital Library o f Thesis and Dissertation (NDLTD) a repository o f electronic thesis and
dissertations authored by the students o f m em ber institutions. The problems faced by the
archives turned them up for a m eeting in M exico’s Santa Fe, where they discussed all
difficulties faced by them and end users. Here, Ginsperg o f arXiv and Van de Sompel of
Ghant University proposed creation o f a universal service for author’s self-archived scholarly
literature nam ed Universal Preprint Service later renam ed as Open Archive Initiative (OAI).
OAI provided a universal format for data harvesting known as Open Access InitiativeProtocol for M etadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). OAI was a big achievement in the area o f
open access. It was used in digital library software such as Dspace and Greenstone.
M oreover, it has given a momentum to open access institutional repositories.

It is very difficult and will make things very complex to put the details o f every new launch
relating to free and open access. However, a timeline o f events supporting open access is
given by Peter Suber (2009) and the same of open access declaration (2012) are given on
Open Access Directory. The following figure shows development o f open access m ovement
on the basis o f data provided at open access timeline (Suber, 2013) and open access
declaration timeline.

Figure 2: Development o f Open access movem ent

7.4.1. Public Library o f Science
By this time the cost o f journals was rising invariably and the increased cost was restricting
access to research articles to thousands o f the researchers. Sometimes, the authors, who
submitted their articles to the commercial publishers were not able to access their own article
as their organisation could not subscribe to those journals. This condition invoked not only
the consumers, but also the producers o f such articles, to do something to bring those articles
to free access. Hence, an initiative took place through an open letter to the journal publisher
stating that “we pledge that, beginning in September 2001, we will publish in, edit or review
for, and personally subscribe to only those scholarly and scientific journals that have agreed
to grant unrestricted free distribution rights to any and all original research reports that they

153

have published, through PubM ed Central and similar online public resources, within 6
m onths o f their initial publication date” (Public Library o f Science, 2001).

This letter was initiated by

“Harold Varmus, Director, National Cancer Institute; Patrick

Brown, Professor, Department o f Biochemistry, Stanford University School o f Medicine, and
Howard Hughes M edical Institute in California, Investigator; and M ichael Eisen, Associate
Professor o f Genetics, Genomics, and Development in the Department o f M olecular and Cell
Biology at the University o f California, Berkeley” (Public Library of Science, 2001) in later
2000 and soon was popular among the scientists and researchers globally. This letter also
attracted the m edia and m edia played a great role in popularising the letter and its content
over the world. The open letter w as loved by the scientists worldwide and got signed by more
than 37000 scientists from 180 countries.

This was an attempt to change the publishing m odule within the commercial m odule itself.
But it was not successful as the policies o f journal publishers were intact even after the
enormous support received by open letter. By the end o f 2002, Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation offered PLoS a huge grant o f $9 M illion to launch free biomedical journals.
Finally, PLoS, with this grant, made it possible to start two open access journals namely
‘PLoS Biology’ and ‘PLoS M edicine’.

Today, PLoS has grown to the biggest open access publisher publishing for science and
medicine. Open access was getting boost with launch o f such journals and Budapest Open
Access Initiative converted this journey towards free access into an ‘open access m ovem ent’

7.4.2. Budapest Open Access Initiative

154

Open Society Institute organised a small m eeting in Budapest on 1-2 December, 2001 with
the objective to accelerate process in International effort to make research article in all the
academic disciplines freely available on Internet or the W eb (Open Society Institute, 2002a).
This meet received a num ber o f views from the participants from various disciplines and
different nations to make up the Open A ccess Movement. This m eeting ended with a decision
to start an initiative known as Open Access Initiative for the same. In less than 2 months after
its formation, OAI released its initiative called Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI).

It was a historical day of 14th February, 2002 w hen Open Society Institute released Budapest
Open Access Initiative at Budapest, Hungary and for the first time the term ‘open access’ was
assigned to free and unrestricted access to research articles online. OSI on this occasion
prom ised funding o f 1 m illion US dollars per year for three years to support open access
projects (Open Society Institute, 2002b). The initiative reads as below:

A n old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an
unprecedented public good. The old tradition is the willingness of scientists and
scholars to publish the fruits o f their research in scholarly journals without payment,
for the sake o f inquiry and knowledge. The new technology is the internet. The public
good they make possible is the world-wide electronic distribution of the peerreviewed journal literature and completely free and unrestricted access to it by all
scientists, scholars, teachers, students, and other curious minds. Rem oving access
barriers to this literature will accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning
o f the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it
can be, and lay the foundation for uniting hum anity in a common intellectual
conversation and quest for knowledge.(Open Society Institute, 2002a)
The introduction o f the initiative shows its concerns towards free literature. It talks about
traditional way to publish research journal in periodicals which are paid and does not reach to
every individual due to pricing issue. But advent o f Internet and development o f W orld W ide
W eb provides a w ay and an opportunity to the scientists and researchers to spread their
research result to more people without any restriction. This will help the education system to
grow and will create a global collaborative comm unity sharing their knowledge. It was BOAI

155

which had coined the term ‘Open A ccess’ as a m eaning o f unrestricted online availability of
research articles. Further this initiative calls the institutions and individuals worldwide
involved in the process o f knowledge generation to come together to share their research and
work without any price and other barriers. The call was to make efforts to bring all scholarly
literature in public domain. It was a formal beginning o f Open Access M ovement. The
initiative explained the benefits o f open access which m ay also result in m aking the peer
reviewed literature barrier free.

M oreover, this initiative very importantly talks about the category o f literature which should
be available freely or in the open access; the literature which are developed by the researchers
and distributed ‘without expectation of paym ent’ should be in the open access. Hence it is not
the call to the people who generate their livelihood by their writings. Such category m ay
include novelists, dramatists, generators o f music, etc. as they generate their livelihood by
their work. They write w ith expectation of selling their work to have m eal on their table. But
this is not the case with a professor of a university or a researcher in a research institute. They
get their food by teaching and by doing other activities for their organisation. So it is a very
important feature of this initiative. The initiative provides an elaborated definition o f open
access as follows:

By "open access" to this literature, we m ean its free availability on the public internet,
perm itting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the
full texts o f these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or
use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers
other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only
constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this
domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right
to be properly acknowledged and cited. (Budapest Open Access Initiative, 2002)
The definition o f open access provides full freedom to the readers to access the article
without any barrier.

It just expects from the readers or the researchers to cite and

156

acknowledge the source properly in their writings. It does not lay down any other condition
for the distribution o f such work. This definition gives opportunity to the w orld to use,
distribute, download, print or to include in any database without any financial, legal or
technical barrier.

The BOAI does not avoid the financial needs to develop or produce a journal. Hence it
discusses the requirem ents o f funds to support the open access to research article online. This
statement shows concern about financial aspects to achieve open access, however, it costs
very low to provide open access to peer reviewed journals through web in comparison to
print publication which is a traditional m odel for the same. Steven H am ad also states that
distributing literature online reduces costs to 25% o f what it costs in print distribution
(Okerson & O'Donnell, 1995). M oreover, other m odels for financial support to open access
journal have also been developed, such as publication fees, dual mode o f distribution where
print version is paid and electronic version is open access, open access journals sponsored by
various organisations, funds from the government, support from the promoters o f open
access, etc.

To start open access, BOAI suggested two ways, i.e., self-archiving and open access journals.
Self-archiving was already in existence for 10 years when this declaration was made.
However BOAI supported the archives created following the protocols created by Open
Archives Initiative for easy searching and browsing of articles submitted in the archives.

Open Access Journals was the second suggestion by BOAI to boost open access. The
declaration appeals individuals and organisations to move towards publishing open access
journals to publish research results o f their scholars and scientists. The open access journals,
by nature, w ould not be following any copyright laws to restrict the reader in any way and

157

will be dissem inated widely. The open access journals w ould not imply any subscription
charges to the readers but m ay find out other ways, as discussed earlier, to meet their cost.
The initiatives clearly state their objective and future expectations from the world o f research
and scholarly writings.

Open access to peer-reviewed journal literature is the goal. Self-archiving (I.)and a
new generation o f open-access journals (II.) are the ways to attain this goal. They
are not only direct and effective m eans to this end, they are within the reach of
scholars themselves, immediately, and need not wait on changes brought about by
markets or legislation. W hile we endorse the two strategies just outlined, we also
encourage experimentation with further ways to make the transition from the present
methods o f dissemination to open access. Flexibility, experimentation, and adaptation
to local circumstances are the best ways to assure that progress in diverse settings will
be rapid, secure, and long-lived. (Budapest Open Access Initiative, 2002)
Budapest Open Access Initiative suggested above two ways to enhance open access to peer
reviewed articles and journals and expected more to explore. It also talked about the idea of
copy left instead of copyright. BOAI not just released their initiative but made it a concrete
effort towards open access by providing all types o f help, i.e., financial, technical, etc. to the
efforts towards open access. The Open Society Institute uses its resources and influence in
encouraging and developing institutional self-archiving. It also extends support to launch new
open-access journals. It also guides such initiatives to become economically self-sustaining.
Although Open Society Institute has substantial resources and enormous commitment
towards open access initiative, at the same time it feels that other organisations should also
extend their resources to accelerate this m ovem ent forward. Thus this Institute invites all the
stake

holders

like

“governments,

universities,

libraries, journal

editors,

publishers,

foundations, learned societies, professional associations, and individual scholars” (Open
Society Institute, 2002a) to join this m ovement so that research and education can flourish in
this world.

158

Initially this initiative was adopted by 13 signatories including Bioline International, Open
Society Institute, Public Library of Science (PLoS), Scholarly Publishing and Academic
Research Coalition (SPARC), Peter Suber, Biom ed Central, etc. As on 12th September 2012,
it has 5673 individual and 637 organisations who have signed BOAI declaration.

This num ber o f signatories seems very little if we compare it with the num ber o f Internet
users worldwide. As per the latest statistics o f ‘Internet W orld Stats’ more than 2260 m illion
people worldwide are users o f Internet. Surely, m ost of the users come from the community
o f consumers o f information, but if we presume that, one per cent o f the Internet users belong
to the category o f the researchers, scientists and university teachers, then the num ber o f such
users w ould be more than 226 lakh. M oreover, if we look at the num ber o f blogs of
individual authors we find this num ber very high. So, if BOAI is getting only 5673
individuals in the last ten year, then a num ber of doubts m ay arise. W hether, the scholars who
were expressing concern for price hike of journals published by commercial publishers really
want open access to grow? However, this study has yet to explore m any things which m ay
give answer to this question.

After this declaration, a num ber o f open access archives and journals were started. In addition
to that, various efforts to boost the open access m ovement were observed. In less than one
year o f BOAI declaration, Creative Commons, a non-profit organisation established by
Lawrence Lessig and his friends in 2001, released their first set o f copyright licence for free
to the public (Creative Commons, 2002). The objective was to make the information within
access to all with m inimum restrictions.

Lunds University o f Sweden launched a m ajor project called ‘Directory o f Open Access
Resources (D O A J)’ in 2003 with financial help from Open Society Institute and SPARC

159

listing around 300 initial open access journals (Bjomshauge, 2011). DOAJ is basically a list
o f open access journals to provide easy access to the researchers, students, teachers, etc.
around the world.

7.4.3. Bethesda Statem ent on Open Access Publishing
W ithin a few months another statement on open access was released that is known as
‘Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing’ with the objective to come up with some
concrete

steps to foster open access publishing and rapid and efficient dissemination o f

scholarly peer reviewed articles among all the related parties. The aim was to make epublishers, scientists, organisations, libraries, etc. related to or dependent on scientific
publication to agree to a common solution, i.e., open access (Suber, 2003).

This statement also came up with their definition o f open access publication stating “Open
access is one that meets following two conditions:

>

The author(s) and copyright holder(s) grant(s) to all users a free, irrevocable,
worldwide, perpetual right o f access to, and a license to copy, use, distribute, transmit
and display the work publicly and to make and distribute derivative works, in any
digital m edium for any responsible purpose, subject to proper attribution of
authorship, as well as the right to make small numbers o f printed copies for their
personal use.

>

A complete version o f the work and all supplemental materials, including a copy of
the perm ission as stated above, in a suitable standard electronic format is deposited
immediately upon initial publication in at least one online repository that is supported
by an academic institution, scholarly society, government agency, or other wellestablished organization that seeks to enable open access, unrestricted distribution,
interoperability, and long-term archiving (for the biomedical sciences, PubM ed
Central is such a repository) (Suber, 2003).

This definition m ainly exhibits two points. First, that an open access publication is the
property o f the author and it grants public the rights to access, copy, distribute transmit,
display and to make use o f it in any derivative work. The only expectation o f these
publications is to be cited and properly acknowledged. Second, the article with the above

160

rights m ust be submitted in electronic format and in full to any open access repository
immediately after its publication. Hence, it refuses to grant open access label to any article
accessible after three, six or twelve months of its publication so called delayed open access.

Bethesda statement is released in three parts or can say three separate statements from
funding agencies and Institutions, libraries and publishers and scientists and scientific
societies proposing duties on their ends.

Institutions, including academic and research institutes and funding agencies, propose and
agree to encourage their researchers and staff to publish their research results in open access
journal; to offer financial help to publish their research results in peer reviewed open access
journals; to consider the merit o f work instead o f title o f journal at the time o f appointment,
promotion, grant or award and to consider the open access publications as service to the
community and will give merits o f the same at the time o f appointment, promotion, etc. This
statement is an effort to bring the institutions, which insist the scientists and researchers to
have great publications, in favour o f open access. Out o f their proposals, their agreement to
consider the merit o f work and not the title o f journal is more interesting. The intention
behind this statement is to bring the open access publication in equality o f commercially
published journals and to encourage scientists and researchers to publish their articles in open
access journals.

In statement o f libraries and publishers, libraries propose to give priority to open access
journals and make users o f the library aware about these journals. Additionally, they will list
the open access journals in their catalogue to be retrieved by the users. At the same time,
publishers propose to provide an open access option for any research article published by
them, work with publishers providing open access to develop tools for authors and publishers

161

for m anuscript transition and publication and to develop open access module with low
barriers.

The statements seem quite prom ising to promote open access. The Bethesda statement
included all the factors included in a scholarly publication. On one side, where it includes a
promise on the part o f libraries to encourage the literature published in open access to be used
by the users, it is also trying to bring commercial publishers under the um brella of open
access w ith the proposal from publishers to provide open access option to every article they
publish and to help the publisher providing open access to develop tools for easy publication.

The statement on the part o f scientists says that they w ould take the rights to publish their
article in an open access too through their own website or through an institutional repository.
M oreover, they also propose to publishing, reviewing and editing for open access journals.

This statement was m ade in the presence o f 24 participants. The participants were the
advocates o f open access and publishers providing open access journals. After this
declaration no information is available on the official page o f the declaration about whether
any other participants signed the statement or not. M oreover, there is no information o f the
development on the basis of this statement. However, it is difficult to say that the statement
has no impact on communities involved in the scholarly publication w ithout analysing further
development in the field.

7.4.4. Berlin Declaration on Open Access to K nowledge in the Sciences and Humanities
In next few m onths o f Bethesda statement, an international conference on open access was
organised at Berlin by M ax Plank Society. This conference and m eeting o f various
international open access advocates resulted in Berlin Declaration on Open Access to
Knowledge in Sciences and Humanities (Berlin 9, 2007).This declaration accepted m ost of

162

the principles o f Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) and included them in the
declaration. Berlin Declaration accepted the conditions o f open access publication proposed
by Bethesda Statement o f Open Access Publishing and defined that “W e define open access
as a comprehensive source o f hum an knowledge and cultural heritage that has been approved
by the scientific com m unity” (Gruss, 2003).

The Berlin declaration has been signed by 394 signatories as on September 2012 that covers a
num ber o f universities and research centres. The declaration was very m uch similar to that of
Budapest Declaration and had similar objectives.

These three declarations BBB (Budapest, Bethesda and Berlin) are the m ajor declarations
towards open access m ovem ent and the whole m ovement is spread on the basis o f these
declarations. Signatories o f Budapest and Berlin declaration are increasing constantly and
these declarations, being done with the support of Open Society Institute and M ax Plank
Society, are still very m uch active.

Now, almost 10 years have passed since these declarations. During these years, a num ber of
initiatives towards open access have taken place. It is very m uch required to analyse the
development of such initiatives to m ark the success o f open access movem ent in the last
decade.

7 .5.

Prominent Open Access Publishers

7.5.1. Biomed Central
BioM ed Central is a commercial publisher, but focused in publishing open access journals in
the field of Science, Technology and M edicine (STM). It was developed in 1998 and
launched in 2000 by VitekTracz. He was a person involved in commercial publication who

163

developed m edicine and science journals and once they became popular, he sold them to big
commercial publishers like Elsevier. But during

1990s situation around the w orld

experienced a drastic change with a huge opposition o f commercial publishers by open access
advocates due to unaffordable price rise. M oreover, emergence of Internet and W eb also
paved a w ay to remove the costs of publishing. Vitek Tracz was also convinced that such an
emergence o f Internet and W eb will make it difficult for the commercial publisher to charge
high price for their journals.

Evaluating the situation, Vitek Tracz started a commercial but open access publication
BioM ed Central (BMC). In 2001 BMC announced launch o f initial list o f journals. BMC did
not charge readers to read an article o f any o f its journal but it charged the author to publish
their articles as publication fees or article processing fees that was $500. The BioM ed Central
experienced m any ups and downs due to changes in its publication fees and some times
editors o f BioM ed Journals rebelled against its price increase (Poynder, 2005). In 2008
BioM ed Central with approximately 180 journals was acquired by Springer, one o f the m ajor
commercial publishers. It posed a threat to millions o f scholars to lose the open access to
BioM ed Central, but, Springer prom ised to provide open access to its journals. Since then the
num ber o f open access journals published by Biom ed Central has constantly increased. As on
September 2012, it was providing 220 open access journals that included journal published
by Springer Open and Chemistry Central.

7.5.2

Public Library o f Science (PLOS)

Public Library o f Science (PLoS) was established as a result o f the open letter to the
publisher, as discussed earlier, in 2000. The goal o f PLoS is to “provide ways to overcome
unnecessary barriers to immediate availability, access, and use o f research, pursue a

164

publishing strategy that optimizes the openness, quality, and integrity o f the publication
process, and develop innovative approaches to the assessment, organization, and reuse of
ideas and data” (Public Library of Science, 2004). W ith the help of a Grant o f $9 m illion it
could start two initial online journals, i.e., PLoS Biology and PLoS M edicine in 2003 and
2004 respectively. PLoS is a non-profit organisation unlike BioM ed Central, though it also
charges publication fees from the authors to recover editing and publication cost o f the
journals. Though PLoS was receiving grants from several foundations spread globally but in
2011 for first time it declared that it does not bank on any foundation and is producing its cost
itself (Jerram, 2011). It follows the copyright m odel of Creative Commons where any article
published on PLoS expects only proper citation and acknowledgment in the later research
that come out referring it. As o f September 2012, they are running seven peer reviewed
journals in m edical and biomedical fields. These journals are m ost important open access
journals in m edicine and m ay equalize to commercial journals o f Elsevier.

7.5.3

Hindawi Publishing Corporation

Hindawi Publishing Corporation is the brain child o f Ahm ed Hindawi and Nagw a Abdel
M ottalab and Egypt based commercial publisher o f scientific, technical and m edical (STM)
journals. It was established in 1997 and launched its first commercial and subscription based
journal in 1999. It was quite successful in its initial 5 years but ‘serial crisis’ and price
negotiation made it difficult for smaller publishers to launch new journals and get the
subscriptions. W ith the view that “Subscription publishing does not encourage innovation and
will not rew ard the smaller players” (Harris, 2007) they tried a new m odel o f publishing, i.e.,
Hybrid mode, where they launched a journal in 2003 with subscription based print and open
access electronic mode and converted two subscription based journals to open access. By
2005 they experienced remarkable success in open access and started some more totally open

165

access journals and also converted their early subscription based journals to open access
(Peters, 2007). As o f September 2012, Hindawi Publishing Corporation had been publishing
438 fully open access journals. Out o f these, around 75% journals are carrying impact factor
(Harris, 2007). To fund the open access publication they charge per page publication fees
from the authors and are running several dual mode publication where print mode is
subscription based while electronic mode is open access.

7.5.4

Scientific Electronic Library Online (SCIELO)

SciELO is a m ulti-country project initiated in Brazil by FAPESP (Fundacao de Am paro a
Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo), in partnership with BIREM E (the Latin Am erican and
Caribbean Centre on Health Sciences Information) in 1997 (Scientific Electronic Library
Online, 2009). Once it began in Brazil, a num ber o f countries have kept joining this project to
provide open access “free to access and free to publish” (Scientific Electronic Library Online,
2009). The countries joining

this project includes Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile,

Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, M exico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela and South Africa.
South Africa is recent joiner to this project and was working with SciELO in 2009. SciELO
project is a very strong project o f 977 peer reviewed journals (as on September 2012) spread
over 15 nations and various languages o f the world. Besides this, it has a solid database of
Bibliometric and Scientometric indicators that are compatible to Thomson ISI too. Since
2002 it has been getting financial help from CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Cientifico e Tecnologico). This huge netw ork o f open access journals is rapidly proceeding
towards its

goal to “envisage the development o f a common m ethodology for the

preparation, storage, dissemination and evaluation o f scientific literature in electronic form at”
(Scientific Electronic Library Online Chile, 2009) using a special software that establishes an

166

electronic library accessible through a num ber of route, e.g., titles in alphabetic and subject
list, subject and author indexes and an integrated search engine.

7.5.5

Highwire Press

HighW ire Press, established in 1995, is a division o f Stanford University Libraries producing
more than 2500 online peer reviewed journals including subscription based, open access and
delayed open access journals. Out o f these journals, 61 journals are fully open access while
279 are providing delayed open access.

7.5.6

M DPI.COM

M DPI (M olecular Diversity Preservation International) established in 1996 is a Switzerland
based organization aiming to deposit and exchange m olecular and Biom olecular samples. In
2008, another institute was established with same abbreviation M DPI (M ultidisciplinary
Diversity Publishing Institute) with the objective to publish open access journals in various
scientific and m edical fields. The articles published by M DPI are fully open access. They
cover the publication cost through article processing fees collected from the authors. MDPI
was established in 1996 and as on September 2012, it has been running 89 open access
journals. It is observed that num ber o f M DPI publication increased only after the launch of
M DPI.com in 2008 as before 2008 they were running only 8 journals (MDPI, 2012). Various
journals published by M DPI.com have good impact factor.

7.5.7

Others

There are a num ber o f small organisations, institutes and publishers who publish and provide
open access to their publication which w ould be too long to m ention here. However, these
m ainly include various research organisations and institutions, i.e., Am erican Association o f

167

Pharmaceutics, A m erican Clinical and Climatological Association, Am erican Institute of
Physics, Am erican M edical Informatics Association, and m any more, and commercial
publishers like W olters Kluwer Health/M edknow Publication (223 journals), Bentham
Science Publishers(237 journals), W iley-Blackwell Publishing(l 1 journals), Co-Action
Publishing(27 journals), Dove press(126 Journals), German M edical Science(16 journals),
Frontier M edia SA(14 journals), Karger Publishers(5 journals), Nature Publishing Group(16
journals), Oxford University P re ss(ll journals), Sage Publication (4 joum als)Copem icus
Publication (30 journals), and others. They provide a num ber o f open access journals and are
strengthening open access movement. In addition to fully open access, these publishers also
give option to authors to keep their article in open access by paying a publication fees.

Directory o f Open Access Journals (DOAJ) listed 9709 open access journal as of April 2014
in various languages and field o f knowledge. DOAJ was established in 2003 with listing of
less than 500 open access journals. If we look at the statistics, it is easy to analyse that since
then DOAJ has added approxim ately 3 journals per day to the golden road to open access.

Directory of Open Access Repository (DOAR) on the other hand, lists over 2000 open access
repositories including institutional repositories and subject repositories providing access to
their contents. Open access through institutional repositories, or subject repositories is known
as green road to open access.

7.6 Open Access and Copyright
Discussion on open access will always be incomplete without a discussion on copyright issue.
W henever there is a debate on copyright, people presume that copyright is something which
prevents the open access and levies a price restriction over the access of scholarly content

168

(Jeffery, 2006). But, if we analyse or study copyright carefully, we m ay easily understand
that copyright is not a barrier but a set o f rules that preserves the right o f an author of an
intellectual property towards its ownership and distribution. It is the intention o f copyright
holder which prohibits the open access o f scholarly content and m akes them available on a
price. Copyright law just fixes the duration, in which the holder o f the copyright clutches the
rights and ownership o f scholarly contents. The basic aim of copyright is to preserve the
interest o f those who earn their living and bread and butter through their creative works. It
includes musicians, artists, writers o f fictions, painters, industrial trademarks, etc. At the
same time it is also being used for the scholarly articles where the authors have no financial
interest in writing an article; they write only to gain greater visibility and they publish it with
commercial publisher and transfer copyrights o f the article for nothing. The publisher makes
use o f those articles to earn huge profits.

N o copyright Act in the w orld fixes a price on which scholarly content can be distributed or
made available. The holders o f the copyright solely carry all right over the content and can
distribute without any cost by their choice without violating Copyright Act. However, these
laws do not explicitly offer open access o f the intellectual property to the public.

Authors o f scholarly articles during submission o f their write-ups to the journal publishers
hand over all the copyrights through a copyright transfer agreement. One hardly cares or
considers keeping copyrights o f the articles with them or not transferring the copyrights to the
publishers. However, some institutions have their own copyright policies when they fund the
publisher for publishing articles of their scientists. Peter Suber (2012, p. 80) discusses about
such right retention policies o f N IH (National Institutes o f Health) and Harvard University.
They made it compulsory for their scientists and faculty mem bers to deposit their articles to
institutional repositories as soon as they are accepted for the publication, thus, a pre-print o f

169

the article is available through open access institutional repositories without any barrier. In
addition to this, m any publishers now permit authors to submit pre-print o f articles to
institutional repositories or upload at author’s website for free accessibility. Hence, it is not
copyright that prohibits the access o f scholarly content but the intention o f publishers and
authors or the lack o f commitment towards open access from the authors who do not try to
get perm ission of uploading a pre-print to institutional repositories or their own websites.

However, these Copyright Acts certainly strengthen the hands o f those who, definitely are not
the authors, desires to make m oney by selling such scholarly content at high price. Lawrence
Lessig and James Boyle tried to create a new copyright that expressly m akes the literature
within public domain, through ‘creative com m ons’ in 2005, a copyright that does not levy
any restriction in anyways to use the literature and make it in open access. Creative commons
appeared as a copyright licence for open access journals. Both commercial publisher and
open access publisher ask the author for transferring copyrights to the publisher but their aims
are different. A commercial publisher, when receives the copyright o f an article from an
author, becomes the sole authority o f the article and even the author needs perm ission of the
publisher to upload the same article into an archive. Open access journals also ask for
copyright from the authors but their aim is not to sell those articles or to earn from them.
They just distribute it freely and at the same time, the author also retains the rights to upload
the article in a repository or on their own website without any infringement of copyrights.
However, the entire discussion lastly depends upon the hum an intention. If there is no
intention to support open access, then even creative commons cannot do anything as it cannot
be forced. Interest o f publishers and m any research institutes strongly supports Copyright
Acts. Not only this, they want the governments throughout the world to make such Acts more
strong to satisfy their financial greed. The recent global copyright treaties and copyright

170

amendments affected the individual Copyright Acts, Patent Acts, etc. Patent Act is very m uch
related with the public good and copyright. Right to open access silently offers the users to
use the literature and convert the knowledge into a product which m any a time is protected
with a patent law. The most elegant example o f these developments is Patent Am endment
2005 o f the Indian Patent Act 1970. This Act introduced food, pharm aceutical and chemical
invention that were not patentable in India before 2005. This amendment was not done with
earning intention by Indian government but was a step to just comply with TRIPS agreement.
This amendment not only made m edicines costly in India and m any other developing
countries but also threatened the right to life o f a num ber o f patients in these countries who
could not afford the lifesaving drugs and died without medicine. Our late Prime M inister of
India Smt. Indira Gandhi had stated at the W orld Health Assem bly in 1982: "The idea o f a
better ordered world is one in which m edical discoveries will be free o f patents and there will
be no profiteering from life and death." (Lanjouw, 1998). But today it seems we are m oving
towards the business o f ‘profiteering from life and death’ just to fulfil obligations of a treaty.
All these are directly indicating to knowledge capitalism where one section of society wishes
to keep the other section deprived o f knowledge. The entire deal just shows profit m aking
intention o f the people. Research work in India, whether in a government granted institution
or a fully private institution, is fully bome by the government, i.e., public funds, but the
results o f these researches are not available to the people themselves. People associated with
this so called business o f knowledge generation do not want to share it for free. Not only this,
but they also want to generate very high profit from this business. However, there are plenty
o f examples where the inventors had left their invention unpatented for the welfare of public
and people throughout the globe are using those products. Some o f these products are Polio
Vaccine, Internet, W orld W ide Web, ATM M achine, Stove’s Burner and m any more. These
inventions carry the potential to earn billions of dollars for their inventors but they just left it

171

for the community throughout the world. And we know that, these inventions have changed
the world. Thus, the use o f copyright solely depends upon the hum an intention. It is almost a
decade to the open access movem ent but still this m ovem ent is struggling to gain ascendance
over commercial publishing industry.

7.7 Impact of Open Access on Library and Information Services
The development o f open access has made a wide impact on various aspects o f libraries such
as economic, technological, collection development, reference services, information literacy,
etc. However the m ajor impacts are on economic aspects, technological aspects and
collection development policy o f the libraries.

Open access has made a wide impact on economic aspects of the libraries. The libraries,
acquiring the scholarly literature from the sources which provide under the open access
philosophy, are not required to pay for accessing the literature. They are free to access and
distribute the literature; can print num ber o f copies as per their wish and are not bound by any
copyright law.

Open access has also been encouraging the libraries to set up an institutional repository or
start open access journals. Initiating an open access journal or institutional repository poses a
num ber of technological challenges, software issues and requires expertise to overcome
those. The gaining o f technological expertise slowly reflects in the services o f the library. The
libraries try to provide access to their open access literature following various ways such as
Google search engine, perm anent URL such as DOAJ, etc. Use o f technology benefits the
libraries not only to disseminate open access literature but also helps in sharpening the skills
o f library professionals.

172

Open access has also a wide impact on collection development policy. As soon as they start
looking to open access journals, libraries realize that open access literature has everything
they require. They can create their own databases of U R L ’s o f the open access journals and
open access institutional repositories available on the W orld W ide W eb dealing with the
subject o f their concern. M any of the journal articles published in subscription based journals
are available free through the institutional repository o f their institutions. This availability not
only eases the financial pressure from their shoulders but also m akes them more conscience
while subscribing to a journal. They m ay also use the budget for something else than just on
journal subscription.

7.8 English language Open Access e-Journals from different subjects
The fifth objective o f this study is to identify and collect various English language Open
Access e-Joum als from different subjects. Instead of subscribing to a num ber o f journals, the
library m ay provide access to open access journals available on the Web. So, the researcher
has collected more than five thousand open access journals in English language from various
subject fields. To gather these journals the researcher has referred a num ber o f directories of
open access journals such as DOAJ, Open-J-Gate, and Public Library o f Science etc. The
researcher has found that at-least a few open access journals are available in almost all
subjects. To be precise, the researcher identified 103 subjects for this list. The subjects
identified are shown in the table below.

7.9 Findings and Interpretations
7.9.1 M ajor Findings
From the detailed discussion about the open access movem ent in the earlier sections, the
m ajor findings are summ arised below.

•

Free flow o f print publication was facilitated with the invention o f printing machine;
it could survive due to enactment o f a series o f copyright laws and by 1886, these
laws were implem ented globally.

•

The research results had begun to be published in the form o f scholarly journals since
1665 with Journal de Sc a vans (5 January, 1665) and Philosophical Transactions o f
Royal Society (6 March, 1665). Since then, the prices of scholarly journals have been
escalating.

•

Increasing cost is not only compelling the institutions to reduce the num ber of
subscribed journals to cope with available budget, but also narrowing the circulation
o f the result of research done in various fields.

•

Today, around 2000 periodical publishers are associated with journal publishing
industry, but, top three journal publishers, viz., Elsevier, Springer-Kluwer and W illyBlackwell, account for approxim ately 42% o f all published journal articles and no
other publisher accounts for more than 3% share o f journal publication market.

175

•

The unfailing increase in journal subscription cost led to the coining o f a new term,
i.e., ‘serial crises.

•

The statistics from ARL (Association o f Research Libraries) shows that during 19862006 the ARL m em bers m anaged to increase their budget by 321% while increase in
serial num ber subscribed during this period was not remarkable.

•

M ichael Hart invested his life time earnings, i.e., around $100 m illion in m aking e-books
available on Internet through Project Gutenberg, w hich is now has a collection o f m ore than
30,000 e-books in 60 languages available for the people w ithout any restrictions.

•

D uring these days, in 1979, George Soros founded Open Society Foundation to pursue his
ambitions o f establishing open societies in place o f authoritarian forms o f government.

•

In 1987, the first free peer review ed journal w as observed w hen Research students o f Nova
South-eastern University, Florida launched ‘N ew Horizons in Adult E ducation’ through their
netw ork A dult Education Network.

•

A big m ilestone in Open A ccess came in 1991, w hen Paul Ginsparg started an online archive
for Physicist, i.e., XXX.lanl.gov.

•

OAI provided a universal format for data harvesting known as Open Access InitiativeProtocol for M etadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH).

•

In 2001 an initiative took place through an open letter to the journal publisher
showing their decision to write, review and edit for those journals which m akes the
access free instantly or within 6 m onths o f initial publication. This letter got
sanctioned by 37000 scientists from 180 countries.

•

By the end o f 2002, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation offered PLoS a huge grant
o f $9 M illion to launch free biomedical journals.

176

•

On 14th February, 2002, Open Society Institute released Budapest Open Access
Initiative at Budapest o f Hungary and for the first time the term ‘open access’ was
assigned to free and unrestricted access to research articles online.

•

In 2003 another statement on open access known as ‘Bethesda Statement on Open
Access Publishing’ was released w ith the objective to boost open access publishing.

•

Year 2007 m arked for one more declaration known as ‘Berlin Declaration on Open
Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Hum anities’.

•

Lawrence Lessig and James Boyle tried to create a new copyright that expressly
makes the literature within public domain, through ‘creative com m ons’ in 2005, a
copyright that does not levy any restriction in anyways to use the literature and make
it in open access.

•

Today more than 10,000 open access journals o f various subjects in a num ber of
languages are available. In addition to this there are various encyclopaedias and books
available without any restriction.

7.9.2 Interpretations
Open access came into existence because o f three m ajor factors. Firstly, the constant rise in
the price o f scholarly journals in the field o f science, technology and medicine. As noted
earlier, the first scholarly journal began only in the third quarter o f the 17th century, grew in
20th century and captured the whole market by the end o f the 20th century. In the last two
quarters o f the 20th century, a huge price hike was observed that w orried not only the
institutions subscribing these journals, but also the authors of the articles publishing in these
journals. It brought the scholars around the w orld together against serial pricing or serial
crisis. This anger and worry among scholars and scientists m arked the launch o f ‘newsletter
on serial pricing issues’ in 1989 to discuss the issue and raise their voice against price rise.

177

Several editors o f commercial journals left the editorship o f their journals; they also wrote an
open letter to the publisher to make their articles freely available but nothing could change
the m ind and policies o f commercial publishers.

This phase also m arked m ajor technological changes around the w orld with the advent of
computers, Internet and W orld W ide Web. These inventions gave an opportunity to launch
online journals to cut print and paper cost to a considerable level. But, it has made no changes
in commercial publishing industry and price rising rem ained intact. However, some open
access pioneers such as Steven H am ad and Charles W. Bailey launched their own open
access journals and observed that online publishing cuts publishing costs to 25% o f the print
publication. Steven H am ad posed these debates forward to the public by his ‘subversive
proposal’ (Okerson & O'Donnell, 1995) on a list serve in 1994 which was later published as
an online book. His arguments in this m ailing list, “the scientific journal and the scholarly
monograph are threatened by rising costs, rising output, and constrained academic budgets.
The m ost painful paradox is that in the interests o f science, the law o f the market cannot be
allowed to function. An item with a very small m arket m ay yet be the indispensable link in a
chain o f research that leads to a result o f high social value” and suggestion to create self­
repositories became guiding principles o f open access movement.

Secondly, double pay debate was also a leading factor towards open access movement. The
debate was raised on use o f public funds to carry out the researches by the research
institutions over the w orld and to subscribe the journals publishing those research results.
This gave birth to double pay debate for doing the research and again for accessing the
research results. The commercial publishers get the benefit o f the entire cycle. Additionally,
there are cases where journal also levy publication fees which is paid again by those
institutions where researchers work. This multiple pay paradox, has spread disappointment

178

and anger among scholars and institutions. Open access publishing was seen as a solution to
this unfair, immoral and uncourageous double paym ent irony.

Thirdly and last, as researchers noted earlier no movem ent starts at a single point. It is
something which converts from the thinking o f people that gets support from more peers and
lead to a movement. Pioneering efforts from open access advocates, such as Peter Suber,
Steven Hamad, Charles W. Bailey, Harold Varmus, A lm a Swan, Lawrence Lessig and m any
more have resulted in consciousness towards open access and opposition towards commercial
publication.

Started with golden road to open access, now a num ber o f ways are discovered to provide
open access to scholarly articles. As o f today, open access is possible through gold open
access, green open access, gratis open access, libre open access, delayed open access, etc.

In terms o f impact, open access has been coming as a strong competitor o f commercial
publication that has compelled m any o f them to offer open access in one way or the other.
But still there is a lot to improve. As a recent study in 2010 showed that around 20% of total
published peer reviewed article in 2009 could be found in open access (Bjork et al, 2010).
Now question arises whether to take it in a positive or negative sense. W hatever, one thing is
clear that open access is yet to undergo a lot to find its way. Still libraries are finding it
difficult to subscribe journals due to high price and low budget. M any a times it seems that
we are standing at the same turn where we were a decade back. Subscription o f paid journals
and databases is made compulsory for educational institutions by the accrediting authorities.
Use and distribution o f open access journals in libraries is still not flourishing. Though for
individuals it has become easier to find information available in public domain.

179

It is true that open access has significantly changed the scholarly publishing but it's the turn
o f the universities, research institutions, and funding agencies to push open access by
encouraging publication in open access journals. Additionally, Scientists also should go for
publication in open access journals instead o f commercial journals. One must leave this
m isconception that publication in a commercial journal will only be able to assign them good
impact factor and reputation. At last it can be said that it is not the journals which provide a
reputation to an author but it is an author who gives reputation by submitting their high
quality articles to journals.

CHAPTER VIII

CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

In the course o f the present research study and the interpretations made in the preceding
chapters, m any interesting facts and features about open source software m ovem ent and open
access m ovement have come to the fore. These facts and features not only reveal the
development of open source software m ovem ent and open access m ovement as a whole, but
also lay down the foundation for further research in these areas in future.

8.1.

Conclusions: open source software movement

1. Open Source like open access is distribution o f software with the source code and
with the liberty to m odify or redistribute the same to anyone.
2. Libraries are in high need o f computer software to meet the expectations o f the users.
Open source provide them a variety o f software developed by a num ber of
organisations and individuals worldwide.
3. The philosophy o f library and open source software is the same, i.e., to serve the
community. Use of open source in libraries supports this philosophy largely.
4. Open source does not m ean that it should be free o f cost, one m ay charge for an open
source software, however, he cannot restrict the purchase to distribute it freely to
others or to m odify it.
5. Open source operating systems and web servers have already captured the most o f the
servers in the world.
6. From the perspective o f a library professional, open source software is playing the
role o f life saving medicine especially in developing countries.

7. Open source software is a successful alternative for any type o f library and available
for a wide range o f operations applicable for a library from general, operating system
(Linux), data processing software (Open Office) to specifics, i.e., library management
system, digital library creation, web designing, e-leaming, content management
system, m anaging online serial or conference, etc.
8. Even when a library adopts open source software it m ay need Annual M aintenance
Contract to m aintain the system. Unlike proprietary software where only the
developer m anages it, here the advantage is that, the library has the option to choose
from a num ber o f vendors who offer to m anagement various open source software.
Some prominent vendors are Liblime,Equinox, ByW ater, Lyrasis, etc.
9.

In open source software user libraries have a num ber o f choices to adopt or migrate to
at any point o f time. Good choices for library management software are Koha and
Newgenlib; for Digital library software, DSpace, Greenstone and Eprints; for content
m anagement software Joomla, Drupal and W ordpress. These alternatives provide a
huge range o f choice from which libraries can select most prominent and promising
software as per their needs. These alternatives also give them choice to migrate from
one to another at a later point o f time.

10. Open source software release their new upgraded version more frequently than
proprietary software; also these upgraded versions o f open source software are freely
available to the users while in case o f proprietary software users are required to pay
even for the new versions o f the software.
11. Open source operating systems have been proving themselves very safe in
comparison to proprietary operating systems. We all know that the Linux versions o f
operating systems are more secure than W indows in terms o f virus and malware
attack.

12. Open source m akes source code available to the world; the people around the w orld
not only can use it, but m odify it and improve the software to m ake it more
competitive. It has already been accepted that all types o f open source software are
presenting very strong competition to commercial software.
13. Am ong available open source software, NewGenLib is found more suitable for library
automation; while DSpace is good for creating digital libraries. These software are
easy helpful and available with enough technical support to library professionals.
14. The open source software have very bright future as the market base o f open source
software is increasing very fast. Open source operating system and web servers are
already in high use in comparison to proprietary systems. Open source SQL database
is posing tough competition to proprietary software. Libraries are increasingly using
one or the other open source software.

.

Conclusions: Open access movement

1. Information Technology has become an unavoidable element o f today’s libraries and
information centres. Open source software and open access resources are the tools and
resources that provide a helping hand to the libraries having lim ited or no financial
resources to use m odem information technology.
2. The open access is associated with the scholarly publishing in the form o f journal
articles. The advocates o f open access expect the free distribution of digital copies o f
these scholarly publications.
3. Since the publication of first scholarly journal, the prices o f scholarly publications
continue to increase sharply. M any o f the publications become unaffordable even for
big libraries.

186

4. Open access m ovem ent offered three fold solutions in the form o f open access
journals, self-archiving and institutional repositories. Researchers can opt for any o f
these ways to publish their scholarly writings.
5. The Open access m ovement was supported by a num ber o f individuals, institutions
and associations which reflected in the beginning o f a num ber o f open access journals.
6. Open access in not just a movem ent to encourage the barrier free access to scholarly
publishing, but also to accelerate the research with easy access to research results.
Such an effort thus avoids duplication of research that leads to saving and conserving
the collective resources o f humanity.
7. Open access provides nationally and globally a way to generate and encourage further
research, education and training prospects.
8. If we see this m ovem ent from a different perspective, we can easily understand that
open access m ovement has expanded the definition o f ‘right to life’. The m aximum
journals available in open access are o f health science. Hence, now people associated
with health sciences can easily access research results in their subject area without
any economic liability; something that was possible earlier only when their
institutions subscribed to the same. They, now, not only can access that research result
but also apply it to enhance their profession and render service to society.
9. The open access m ovem ent has given birth to the concept o f cyber democracy where
scholarly publishing is available for all and anyone can use it without prior perm ission
o f the author o f the same just by fulfilling moral duty o f acknowledging the author.
10. Open access m ovement has also been very supportive in the growth o f knowledge
economy by m aking knowledge and information available to wide num ber of people.

11. Open access does not violate the right o f the author to be acknowledged. The
researcher using earlier work has m oral obligation to acknowledge the author whose
research has been used in the study.
12. One o f the m ajor impacts o f open access is that it omits or rem oves the barriers
between university and society or research organisations and societies. Research work
which earlier was accessible only to universities and research institutions that
subscribed to it is now accessible through open access to anyone even outside these
institutions.
13. Open access has made the scholarly writings available to a wide range of people such
as entrepreneurs, consultants, social workers, journalists, policy makers, teachers in
schools, people in business & industry and the public as a whole. Earlier m aximum
scholarly writings were available to only academicians and researcher who were able
to access it through the subscription by their parent organisation. Use of scholarly
writing by general public will surely enhance their understanding and social learning.
14. For the government funded research, open access is a w ay to get m aximum utilisation
and m aximum return on the government funds by way o f making it widely available,
easily discoverable, accessible, retrievable and m uch m ore useful.
15. At this juncture, the notion o f developed nation has changed. Now the country having
m aximum financial resources is not called developed nation but a country having
m aximum information is considered a developed nation. Open access is a wonderful
way to increase the ‘knowledge capital’ o f any country.
16. The open access advocates do not expect the authors who write for a living to allow
open access to their work.

However it expects a university researcher to allow to

access his/her work through open access.

188

17. Open access and open source movem ent have been proving very successful in
bridging the digital divide and the gap between the haves & the have nots, the
developed & the developing and the rich & the poor; be it individuals or libraries.
18. Open access m ovem ent has forced the commercial publishers to respond positively to
it by either turning few o f their journals to open access instantly or after few months.
M any publishers are running a num ber o f open access journals along with their
commercial journals. M oreover, m any o f them allow authors to submit the pre-print
or post-print o f their articles to the institutional repositories of their institutions.
19. The open access m ovem ent is showing its wide impact over scholarly publishing. A
num ber o f open access repositories and more than 10,000 journals in various
languages are available to the world. A library is in a very good position to help in the
growth o f open access m ovem ent via open source software.

8.3.

Suggestions

In the light of the findings, interpretations and conclusions o f the present study, the researcher
w ould like to present the following suggestions.

1.

Libraries with no library management software in their libraries should automate
their libraries using open source software. Open source software is not a
challenge, it is a help that we can use, improve and forward to someone else. It
has num erous benefits; it offers a very smooth library system without having to
pay for the software. This w ould help not only in modernising the library and the
information professional’s skills but w ould also help in the development o f the
software that is being used. NewGenLib is a very suitable open source library
m anagement software while D Space is a considerably good open source digital

189

library software. However, if one does not wish to use these for any reason, they
m ay opt for other open source software. The open source world has good
alternatives to choose from.
2. Libraries that are already using library m anagement software but due to some
functional difficulties w ish to m igrate to something better, m ay also consider
m igrating to NewGenLib for library m anagement and DSpace for m anaging their
digital library. They can even m odify and customize these to suit their needs.
3. More than 10,000 open access journals in various languages (about 5000 o f them
in English) are available covering all fields o f hum an endeavour. Such open
access scholarly publishing is a very good source for libraries to provide their
users right information at the right time. A list of 5000 English journals
categorised according to different subjects is presented in Appendix A of this
report. All libraries must provide access to these journals to their users through
library’s OPAC or website. More use o f open access literature will lead to more
research results being put up on open access and that will boost open access
movement.
4. The libraries should encourage and start institutional repositories to make the
research work of their institution available to the world. It w ould not only boost
the open access m ovement but w ould also make the access to their research
output easy to the world.
5. The funding organisations including government should make it compulsory for
researchers to publish their research in open access journals only. It will not only
make their research widely available, but will also save the funds which is used
in subscribing to the journals again to access the research w ork o f their
researchers.

6. Authors of research papers should also understand that the research done by them
is funded by public and they should have access to it easily without again paying
for it.
7. If the institution is having enough research to publish a journal of any periodicity
they m ust start an open access journal. There are a num ber o f open source
software to m aintain such a journal online.
8. Today’s library services are influenced very m uch by information technology and
a library professional m ust have sufficient knowledge o f it. Use o f open source
software needs fairly good IT skills and it m ay prove very good for working
closely with information technology. M any a time librarian needs to debug the
problem him self that needs good understanding o f technology.
9. Growth of open source software for libraries depends upon the response of
library professionals. W hen libraries use open source software it helps in the
growth o f the open source movem ent in the library field. It requires collaborative
efforts from all those who have the abilities to make this m ovem ent more
effective.
10. M oreover library professionals should also help in the development o f new open
source software and improvement o f the existing open source software. Although
it is the software professionals who develop the codes, the library professionals
by constantly using it can identify the bugs found in the software and find the
ways to smoothen the workflow of the software and inform the same to the
developers. This w ould help and guide the software professionals to come out
w ith new and improved versions o f the software.

191

11. The library professionals should follow and encourage the use o f open source and
open access licensing by providing their research in open access and submitting
their software to the open source community, if they succeed in creating one.
12. In summation, open source and open access are two separate m ovem ents but for
the libraries the combination o f two can do a magic that perhaps even proprietary
software cannot do for them. A library professional m ust make the optimum use
o f the both.

8.4.

Future avenues for research

Although library professionals are slowly becoming aware o f open source software but still
there is a lot o f scope for research in open source software and open access literature.
Research in open access needs more efforts to make is practically applicable in small
libraries; presently open access literature is understood only in big libraries.

The possible

research areas related to open access and open source software in the field of library and
information science is enumerated below.

•

Comparative study o f open source and commercial software to make Open Source
Software more effective.

•

Practical implementation o f open source software in libraries and laying out the
resources required, problem s faces both technical and human, expected m inimum
budget for automating a library, etc.

•

Use of open source software to make the use o f open access literature m ore effective
in libraries.

•

Best practices with open source software and open access literature.
